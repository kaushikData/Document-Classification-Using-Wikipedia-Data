'''''ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd''''' is a 2010 decision of the [[Federal Court of Australia]] brought by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) against [[Cabcharge Australia Ltd]].&lt;ref name=FCA1261&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|1261|2010|litigants=ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd |courtname=auto}}; {{cite AustLII|FCA|837|2010|litigants=ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd (No 2) |courtname=auto}}. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the ACCC began proceedings in the Federal Court against Cabcharge alleging that Cabcharge had breached section 46 of the Commonwealth [[Trade Practices Act]] (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action alleged [[predatory pricing]] by Cabcharge and centred on Cabcharge's conduct in [[refusal to deal|refusing to deal]] with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through [[EFTPOS]] terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taxi meters and fare updates at below actual cost or at no cost.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

In September 2010, to settle the action, Cabcharge admitted a number of contraventions of TPA and the Federal Court imposed a fine of $15 million ($14 million in civil penalties and $1 million in costs), the highest ever penalty imposed for misuse of market power. The judgement was delivered by Justice [[Raymond Finkelstein]] on 17 November 2010.

==Background==
Cabcharge provides various products and services in Australia and overseas, predominantly to taxi drivers, owners and networks (the firms that provide booking and dispatch services to drivers and owners). The services that Cabcharge provide include non-cash payment processing systems for taxi fares, payment processing systems for taxis and provision of taxi meters. The company holds a dominant market position in these services across Australia as it supplies almost 97% of Australian taxis with its electronic payment system.

The ACCC began proceedings in June 2009 in the Federal Court against Cabcharge Australia Ltd. The ACCC action alleged that Cabcharge had breached section 46 of the Trade Practices Act (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action alleged [[predatory pricing]] by Cabcharge and centred on Cabcharge's conduct in refusing to deal with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through EFTPOS terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taximeters and meter updates at below actual cost or at no cost.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;
 
At the relevant date, to breach Section 46 of the TPA, a corporation must have misused its substantial market power to:
 
* eliminate or substantially damage a competitor 
* prevent the entry of a person into that market or any other market; or	
* deter or prevent a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that market or any other market.
 
Section 46 of the TPA was amended numerous times since September 2007 to strengthen the ACCC's ability to successfully bring proceedings for alleged contraventions. For example, in September 2007, a sub-section 46(1AA) was introduced into the TPA to prohibit corporations with substantial market share from engaging in [[predatory pricing]]. Predatory pricing occurs when a company sets its prices below cost for a sustained period for one of the [[anti-competitive]] purposes referred to above. In November 2008, the TPA was amended again to make clear the circumstances when corporations had 'taken advantage' of their market power. This change sought to deal with the evidentiary difficulties the regulator encountered in establishing this element in earlier cases. Since January 2007, the courts have also been given power to impose a [[civil penalty]] for each act or omission contravening the TPA. Civil penalties can now be imposed up to the greater of $10 million, three times the value of the benefit obtained from the misconduct, or 10% of the annual Australian turnover of the company involved.

==Resolution==
===Cabcharge admissions===
To settle the proceedings, Cabcharge admitted to three contraventions of the TPA. The company agreed to the issue by the court of declarations, compliance orders, civil penalties of $14 million and costs of $1 million.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

=== Cabcharge settlement ===
On 24 September 2010, Justice Finkelstein approved the settlement of the action and declared that Cabcharge had breached the TPA by taking advantage of its substantial degree of power in the Australian markets for the supply of services to enable non-cash payments for taxi fares and charges by taxi passengers and non-cash instruments that could be used only for the payment of taxi fares and charges.

==Judgement==

===Refusal to deal===
It was found that since 2005 Cabcharge had unreasonably refused to deal with a potential competitor (namely Travel Tab which had changed its name to Mpos in January 2007) in the payments and instruments markets by refusing to allow Travel Tab/MPos to process Cabcharge instruments (e.g., Cabcharge cards) on Mpos EFTPOS equipment. It was found that: "With respect to both refusals, Cabcharge acknowledges that although there would have been time and costs involved in developing appropriate interfaces, there was no technical reason that would prevent any electronic taxi-specific payment product from being processed by any EFTPOS terminal as long as that taxi-specific instrument and the relevant EFTPOS terminals complied with all relevant banking/financial industry protocols, including security protocols."

It was found that: "Cabcharge’s refusals were for the purpose of preventing Travel Tab/MPos from processing Cabcharge instruments electronically and resulted in Cabcharge’s payment processing system remaining the only system that processed Cabcharge’s instruments electronically."&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

===Predatory pricing===
Between September 2004 and October 2007 Cabcharge acquired taximeters at a cost of $250 per meter. Of these, Cabcharge supplied approximately 727 units free of charge and approximately 5613 units at an invoiced price of $100 (of which it did not obtain any payment for approximately 758 units). At the time its competitors sold meters for between $430–550 plus GST. Cabcharge installed 197 meters free of charge at an estimated cost of $120 to $160 per installation. From 9 November 2007, it sold meters at a retail price of $250.

In addition, Cabcharge supplied meter updates free to networks and operators, notwithstanding that it incurred costs of around $75,000 to supply these updates. At the time its competitors charged $70 to $110 plus GST per update. Cabcharge funded its losses from profits it made from its payment processing systems.

It was found that Cabcharge took advantage of the substantial degree of power it had in the payment processing market for the purposes of: (1) affecting the profitability of other suppliers of meters and updates; (2) ensuring that other suppliers of meters and updates could not match or be price competitive with Cabcharge; and (3) ensuring that alternative suppliers did not commence supplying electronic processing services.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

The '''African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights''' (also known as the '''Banjul Charter''') is an [[international human rights instrument]]  that is intended to promote and protect [[human rights]] and basic freedoms in the [[Africa|African continent]].  

It emerged under the aegis of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (since replaced by the  [[African Union]]) which, at its 1979 Assembly of Heads of State and Government, adopted a resolution calling for the creation of a committee of experts to draft a continent-wide human rights instrument, similar to those that already existed in [[Europe]] ([[European Convention on Human Rights]]) and the [[Americas]] ([[American Convention on Human Rights]]). This committee was duly set up, and it produced a draft that was unanimously approved at the OAU's 18th Assembly held in June 1981, in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/7770-treaty-0011_-_african_charter_on_human_and_peoples_rights_e.pdf|title=African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to its Article 63 (whereby it was to "come into force three months after the reception by the Secretary General of the instruments of ratification or adherence of a simple majority" of the OAU's member states&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/7770-treaty-0011_-_african_charter_on_human_and_peoples_rights_e.pdf|title=African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights came into effect on 21 October 1986– in honour of which 21 October was declared "African Human Rights Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/sessions/5th/resolutions/1/|title=1: Resolution on the Celebration of an African Day of Human Rights / Resolutions / 5th Ordinary Session / ACHPR|website=www.achpr.org|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oversight and interpretation of the Charter is the task of the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]], which was set up in November 2, 1987 in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]] and is now headquartered in [[Banjul]], [[Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/about/|title=About ACHPR / ACHPR|website=www.achpr.org|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protocol to the Charter was subsequently adopted in 1998 whereby an [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was to be created. The protocol came into effect on 25 January 2004. 

In July 2004, the AU Assembly decided that the ACHP would be incorporated into the [[African Court of Justice]].  In July 2005, the AU Assembly then decided that the ACHP should be operationalised despite the fact that the protocol establishing the African Court of Justice had not yet come into effect.  Accordingly, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060211014920/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Decisions/com/AU6th_ord_Council_Decisions_Jan2006_Khartoum.pdf Eighth Ordinary Session] of the Executive Council of the [[African Union]] meeting in Khartoum, Sudan, on 22 January 2006, elected the first judges of the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]].  The relationship between the newly created Court and the Commission is yet to be determined.

As of 2016, 54 states have ratified the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/ratification/]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been ratified by every AU member state.

== Content ==
The African Charter on Human and People's Rights includes preamble, 3 parts, 4 chapters, and 63 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/7770-treaty-0011_-_african_charter_on_human_and_peoples_rights_e.pdf|title=African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter followed the footsteps of the European and Inter-American systems by creating a regional human rights system for Africa. The Charter shares many features with other regional instruments, but also has notable unique characteristics concerning the norms it recognizes and also its supervisory mechanism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Christof Heyns, the essentials of...Human Rights, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The preamble commits to the [[anti-Zionism|elimination of Zionism]], which it compares with [[colonialism]] and [[apartheid]],&lt;ref&gt;African Charter on Human and Peoples's Rights, Preamble [http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/charter_en.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524075958/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/charter_en.html |date=May 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; caused [[South Africa]] to qualify its 1996 accession with the reservation that the Charter fall in line with the UN's resolutions "regarding the characterization of Zionism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/ |title=African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights |publisher=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights |accessdate=9 December 2012 |archivedate=10 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CnQA8Qrg?url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/ |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Norms contained in the Charter ==

===Civil and Political Rights===
The Charter recognizes most of what are regarded universally accepted civil and political rights. The civil and political rights recognised in the Charter include the right to [[freedom from discrimination]] (Article 2 and 18(3)), equality (Article 3), life and personal integrity (Article 4), dignity (Article 5), freedom from slavery (Article 5), freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 5), rights to due process concerning arrest and detention (Article 6), the [[right to a fair trial]] (Article 7 and 25), [[freedom of religion]] (Article 8), [[freedom of speech|freedom of information and expression]] (Article 9), [[freedom of association]] (Article 10), freedom to assembly (Article 11), [[freedom of movement]] (Article 12), freedom to [[political participation]] (Article 13), and the [[right to property]] (Article 14).

Some human rights scholars however consider the Charter's coverage of other civil and political rights to be inadequate. For example, the right to privacy or a right against forced or compulsory labour are not explicitly recognised. The provisions concerning fair trial and political participation are considered incomplete by international standards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, this is subject to argument as for example Article 5 of the Charter states "Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of this legal status. All forms of exploitation and degradation of man particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment shall be prohibited" also, Article 15 states "Every individual shall have the right to work under equitable and satisfactory conditions, and shall receive [[equal pay for equal work]]" - which may be understood to prohibit [[unfree labour|forced or compulsory labour]], although this is not explicitly mentioned. Similarly, the Charter does not explicitly recognise the right to vote as a means of political participation, but Article 13 states "(1) Every citizen shall have the right to participate freely in the government of his country, either directly or through freely chosen representatives in accordance with the provisions of the law. (2) Every citizen shall have the right to equal access to the [[public service]] of his country. (3) Every individual shall have the right of access to public property and services in strict [[equality before the law|equality of all persons before the law]]."

===Economic, Social and Cultural Rights===
The Charter also recognises certain [[economic, social and cultural rights]], and overall the Charter is considered to place considerable emphasis on these rights. The Charter recognises [[right to work]] (Article 15), the [[right to health]] (Article 16), and the [[right to education]] (Article 17). Through a decision by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, SERAC v Nigeria (2001), the Charter is also understood to include a [[right to housing]] and a [[right to food]] as “implicit” in the Charter, particularly in light of its provisions on the [[right to life]] (Art. 4), [[right to health]] (Art. 16) and to development (Art. 22).&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2008) [http://www.fao.org/righttofood/publi09/natural_resources_en.pdf "The Right to Food and Access to Natural Resources"]. Rome.   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514203528/http://www.fao.org/righttofood/publi09/natural_resources_en.pdf |date=May 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peoples' Rights and Group Rights===
In addition to recognising the individual rights mentioned above the Charter also recognises collective or [[group rights]], or [[peoples' rights]] and [[three generations of human rights#Third-generation human rights|third-generation human rights]]. As such the Charter recognises group rights to a degree not matched by the European or Inter-American regional human rights instruments. The Charter awards the family protection by the state (Article 18), while "peoples" have the right to equality (Article 19), the [[right to self-determination]] (Article 20), to freely dispose of their wealth and [[natural resource]]s (Article 21), the [[right to development]] (Article 22), the right to peace and security (Article 23) and "a generally satisfactory [[environmentalism|environment]]" (Article 24).

===Duties===
The Charter not only awards rights to individuals and peoples, but also includes [[duties]] incumbent upon them. These duties are contained in Article 29 and are as follows:
* The duty to preserve the harmonious development of the family.
* To serve the national community by placing both physical and intellectual abilities at its service.
* Not to compromise the security of the State.
* To preserve and strengthen social and national solidarity.
* To preserve and strengthen national independence and the territorial integrity of one's country and to contribute to its defence.
* To work to the best of one's abilities and competence and to pay taxes in the interest of society.
* To preserve and strengthen positive African cultural values and in general to contribute to the promotion of the moral [[well-being]] of society.
* To contribute to the best of one's abilities to the promotion and achievement of African unity.

The '''African Governance Architecture (AGA)''' is a mechanism for dialogue between stakeholders that are mandated to promote [[good governance]] and bolster democracy in Africa. In the book entitled ''The African Union Law'' (Ed. Berger Levrault, 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;29) Blaise Tchikaya established the link between conceptual platform called ''AGA'' and the modernisation of International Law applicable to African states. The AGA is fundamentally one aspect – probably the most significant – of recent international law of governance.&lt;ref name="EuropaAfrica"&gt;{{cite news|last1=EuropaAfrica|title=The African Governance Architecture|url=https://europafrica.net/2011/03/10/the-african-governance-architecture/|accessdate=31 May 2016|work=europafrica|agency=EuropaAfrica|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is a key actor in promoting the domestication and implementation of the objectives outlined in the legal and policy pronouncements in the [[African Union]] (AU) Shared Values.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Africa's International Relations" /&gt; Established in 2011 AGA is based in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia in the AU Headquarters with the AGA Platform Members based Africa wide.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Africa's International Relations" /&gt; In February 2016 the rules of Procedure on how the AGA legally functions were adopted by Member States during the African Union Summit.&lt;ref name="Decisions of the Twenty-Sixth Ordinary Session"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AUC|title=Decisions of the Twenty-Sixth Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Unions|url=http://au.int/en/sites/default/files/decisions/29514-assembly_au_dec_588_-_604_xxvi_e.pdf|website=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The discussion of a “[[Pan-Africanism|Pan-african]] Architecture on Governance” began with the 16th Ordinary Session of the African Assembly which focused on the theme of the Shared Values of the AU.&lt;ref name="EuropaAfrica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transparency International" /&gt; This Session was held in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], in 2011 and adopted a mandate that would establish a "Pan-African Architecture on Governance".&lt;ref name="The African Union: Addressing the Challenges of Peace, Security, and Governance"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makinda|first1=Samuel M.|last2=Okumu|first2=F. Wafula|last3=Mickler|first3=David|title=The African Union: Addressing the Challenges of Peace, Security, and Governance|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317420293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to give effect to the Assembly decision on the Establishment of the Pan-African Governance Architecture, the [[African Union Commission]] (AUC) established the African Governance Architecture (AGA) as a platform that promotes interactions between stakeholders who work on promoting good governance and strengthening [[democracy]] in Africa, in addition to translating the objectives of the legal and policy pronouncements in the AU Shared Values&lt;ref name="AU Shared Values"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AGA|title=AU Shared Values|url=http://www.aga-platform.org/index.php/aga-platform/2015-10-20-06-26-7/norms-standards|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see below for more information).&lt;ref name="The African Union: Addressing the Challenges of Peace, Security, and Governance" /&gt;

With 2012 being the year of AU Shared Values the diverse charters of the AU were pushed to becoming an integral guide to the activities to both the Organs and Member States of the African Union.&lt;ref name="Transparency International" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polity Shared Values"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polity|title=AU: Statement by the African Union, on the recently concluded Year of Shared Values|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/au-statement-by-the-african-union-on-the-recently-concluded-year-of-shared-values-24012013-2013-01-24|accessdate=31 May 2016|work=Polity.org.za|agency=Polity|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the African Charter for Democracy, Elections and Governance&lt;ref name="ACDEG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ACHPR|title=African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance / Legal Instruments / ACHPR|url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/charter-democracy/|website=achpr}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ACDEG), an integral document stipulating the functions of the AGA, was put into force after being adopted in 2007.&lt;ref name="ACDEG Legislation allafrica"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karmo|first1=Henry|title=Liberia: Regional Peace - AU Wants Liberia Ratify ACDEG Legislation|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201406060597.html|accessdate=31 May 2016|work=allAfrica.com|date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 14 of June the AGA Platform was established in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]] in order to create a space within the AGA structure where the diverse stakeholders and organs of the AU working in the field of [[Democracy]], [[Election]]s and [[Governance]] work together to implement and domesticate the AU Shared Values.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Africa's International Relations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meeting to Launch the African Governance platform"&gt;{{cite news|last1=EuropaAfrica|title=Meeting to Launch the African Governance platform|url=https://europafrica.net/2010/08/06/launch-of-the-african-governance-platform/|accessdate=31 May 2016|work=europafrica|agency=EuropaAfrica|date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 both the Platform and Secretariat became operational and finally for the 26th ordinary Session of the AU assembly (Jan 2016) the Rules of Procedure were legally adopted giving the AGA a legal guide on its activities.&lt;ref name="EuropaAfrica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Decisions of the Twenty-Sixth Ordinary Session"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AUC|title=Decisions of the Twenty-Sixth Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Unions|url=http://au.int/en/sites/default/files/decisions/29514-assembly_au_dec_588_-_604_xxvi_e.pdf|website=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Clusters and Secretariat ===
The AGA Platform is technically assisted by the AGA Secretariat and the Clusters within AGA.&lt;ref name="ECDPM IGAD AGA" /&gt; They are both the mechanisms for interaction and foster the engagement of the AGA Platform Members.&lt;ref name="ECDPM IGAD AGA" /&gt;

==== Clusters ====
Source:&lt;ref name="ECDPM IGAD AGA" /&gt;

The Clusters were established as coordinating arms to support and achieve the goals of AGA.&lt;ref name="Consolidating the African Governance Architecture" /&gt; There are five clusters focusing on the different fields that AGA is involved in. These are:

{| class="wikitable"

==== Secretariat ====
Source:&lt;ref name="Consolidating the African Governance Architecture" /&gt;
The AGA Secretariat as mentioned is the coordinating hub of the AGA Platform. It is housed in the Department of Political Affairs of the African Union Commission (AUC) and is responsible for collating and processing the Platform outcomes for presentation to, and consideration by AU Policy Organs.

=== African Governance Facility===
Source:&lt;ref name="African Governance Facility"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AGA|title=African Governance Facility|url=http://www.aga-platform.org/index.php/aga-platform/2015-10-20-06-26-7/2015-10-12-11-41-45|website=www.aga-platform.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Governance Facility (APF) is the resource mobilization framework of AGA designed to support Platform Members’ initiatives and programs which promote good governance and democracy on the continent. The facility aims to especially promote:
"institutional capacity strengthening and building; dialogues to facilitate citizen engagement in democratic governance processes; technical support to Member States towards the ratification, domestication, implementation and reporting on AU Shared Values instruments; and preventive diplomacy, post conflict reconstruction and [[peacebuilding]] initiatives".&lt;ref name="African Governance Facility" /&gt;

== Activities ==

The activities are divided between the activities of the AGA secretariat that are meant to coordinate the implementation and activities of the AGA platform members and secondly the activities of the AGA platform members.

The AGA Secretariat activities are as follows:

=== Youth Engagement Strategy ===
The AGA Youth Engagement Strategy was set up to promote the effective participation of Africa’s youths in democratic governance initiatives of the AGA platform especially with a focus on democracy, elections, human rights and governance in Africa.&lt;ref name="NDI Partners with African Union"&gt;{{cite news|last1=NDI|title=NDI Partners with African Union to Increase Youth Political Involvement {{!}} NDI|url=https://www.ndi.org/mou-auc-2015-story|accessdate=3 June 2016|work=www.ndi.org|agency=NDI|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Africa having the youngest population on earth&lt;ref name="Africa Youth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kingsley|first1=Ighobor|title=Africa’s youth: a "ticking time bomb" or an opportunity?|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/may-2013/africa%E2%80%99s-youth-%E2%80%9Cticking-time-bomb%E2%80%9D-or-opportunity|website=www.un.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Youth Strategy thus sees this as an area of focus for increasing the engagement with civil society.&lt;ref name="Youth Consultations 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DG Trends|title=Youth Consultations 2014|url=http://dgtrends.org/youth-consultations-2014/|website=DG Trends|accessdate=3 June 2016|date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGA-YES"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AGA|title=AGA Youth Engagement Strategy (AGA-YES)|url=http://www.aga-platform.org/index.php/2015-10-20-06-26-8|website=www.aga-platform.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Strategy especially suggests to develop a continental youth mentorship program, setup Model AUs working closely with higher learning institutions in Africa and making space for AU "Youth Ambassador" positions.&lt;ref name="NDI Partners with African Union" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Youth Should Focus on Building Democratic Institutions Says African Union Leader"&gt;{{cite news|last1=NDI|title=Youth Should Focus on Building Democratic Institutions Says African Union Leader|url=https://www.ndi.org/ibraheem-sanusi-NDI-visit-story|accessdate=3 June 2016|work=www.ndi.org|agency=NDI|date=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regional Consultations"&gt;{{cite news|last1=NDI|title=Regional Consultations Focus on Youth Building a Culture of Democracy and Peace in Africa|url=https://www.ndi.org/node/21854|accessdate=3 June 2016|work=www.ndi.org|agency=NDI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Dialogue occurred for the fourth time in December 2015.&lt;ref name="Annual High Level Dialogue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual High Level Dialogue |url=http://www.aga-platform.org/index.php/2015-09-26-20-44-22/2015-11-06-11-40-08 |website=www.aga-platform.org |accessdate=27 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420061902/http://aga-platform.org/index.php/2015-09-26-20-44-22/2015-11-06-11-40-08 |archivedate=20 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DG Trends" /&gt; It was set up to create an annual event where AGA Platform members, member states and non-state actors frankly account and analyze the impact of their work towards consolidating democracy and bolstering good governance in Africa.&lt;ref name="DG Trends"&gt;{{cite web|title=DG Trends|url=http://dgtrends.org/|website=DG Trends|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further align with the previously mentioned Youth Engagement Strategy, AGA has also introduced a youth pre-forum that aims to bolster the involvement of youths in High Level meetings.&lt;ref name="African Youth Steer AU Agenda"&gt;{{cite web|last1=NDI|title=African Youth Steer AU Agenda for "Silencing the Guns" {{!}} NDI|url=https://www.ndi.org/AU-Youth-Consultation-Nairobi|website=www.ndi.org|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topics of the last four High Level Dialogues were:

# November 2012 in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], on the state of democratic governance in Africa
# November, 2013 in Dakar, Senegal, and focused on enhancing constitutionalism and rule of law in Africa&lt;ref name="Overview, recommendations and conclusions of High Level Dialogue - DGTrends 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DG Trends|title=Overview, recommendations and conclusions of High Level Dialogue - DGTrends 2013|url=http://dgtrends.org/overview-recommendations-and-conclusions-of-high-level-dialogue-dgtrends-2013/|website=DG Trends|accessdate=3 June 2016|date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge Management Strategy===
Source:&lt;ref name="Knowledge Management Strategy" /&gt;

Currently the AGA is working on a unified Knowledge Management Strategy that envisions to create a unified strategy to compile, produce and dessiminate knowledge products on the Platform members. The exact content of the strategy is yet to be announced and verified by external sources.&lt;ref name="Knowledge Management Strategy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AGA|title=Knowledge Management Strategy|url=http://www.aga-platform.org/index.php/aga-knowledge-management-strategy|website=www.aga-platform.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Platform Members work actively in ensuring joint programming a few examples are:

The African Commission working together with the African Court and the [[African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child]] on a joint inquiry mission in [[South Sudan]] resulting in a 315-page document highlighting the Human Rights violations on the basis on which extensive recommendations were set forward.&lt;ref name="Final Report of the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=PSC|title=Final Report of the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan|url=http://www.peaceau.org/uploads/auciss.final.report.pdf|website=PEACEAU|publisher=AUCISS|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State Reporting guidelines as legislated in the ACDEG and finalized with the adoption of the rules of procedure obligate countries to submit a State Report every 2 years.&lt;ref name="African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AU|title=African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance|url=http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/treaties/7790-file-african_charter_on_democracy_elections_and_governance.pdf|website=AU|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date none have been submitted. The State Reporting Process and Mechanism gives rise to large scale interaction between all AGA Platform Members especially as members such as the Commission or APRM have existing State reporting mechanisms that can be utilized and thus create synergies within the mandate of AGA.

== AGA Synergies ==
Source:&lt;ref name="Silencing the Guns"&gt;{{cite web|last1=KHADIAGALA|first1=GILBERT M.|title=Silencing the Guns: Strengthening Governance to Prevent, Manage, and Resolve Conflicts in Africa|url=https://www.ipinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IPI_Rpt-Silencing_the_Guns-Strengthening_Governance_Africa.pdf|website=IPIinst|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the nature of the AGA there are many overlapping areas with other organs and structures within the African Union. As it is a coordinating body much like the [[African Peace and Security Architecture]] (APSA) they complement each other in that they both acknowledge that democratic governance and Peace and Security are interrelated and are reinforcing factors required to achieve both.&lt;ref name="AU APSA Linkage"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matlosa|first1=Khabele|title=The AU’s African Governance Architecture Linkages with the APSA - ECDPM|url=http://ecdpm.org/great-insights/peacebuilding-statebuilding/african-unions-african-governance-architecture-linkages-african-peace-security-architecture/|website=ECDPM|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus AGA and APSA are working on mutually reinforcing projects through structure such as the Inter- Departmental Task Force on Conflict Prevention (IDTFCP)&lt;ref name="Silencing the Guns"&gt;{{cite web|last1=KHADIAGALA|first1=GILBERT M.|title=Silencing the Guns: Strengthening Governance to Prevent, Manage, and Resolve Conflicts in Africa|url=https://www.ipinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IPI_Rpt-Silencing_the_Guns-Strengthening_Governance_Africa.pdf|website=IPIinst|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges and criticism ==
The main challenges that have been identified by various think tanks and external Evaluations are:

# "The AGA and [[African Peace and Security Architecture|APSA]] do not yet have strong institutional connections" &lt;ref name="AU APSA Linkage" /&gt;
# "The Constitutive Act of the AU only makes reference to ‘[[good governance]]’ and not ‘[[governance]]’. The conspicuous absence of the fundamental concept of good governance, which is entrenched in the Constitutive Act, will render the AGA ineffective since ‘governance’ as a concept does not necessarily advance the objective of the AU of promoting good governance."&lt;ref name="The Challenges Facing Africa's Emerging Governance Architecture"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gumedze|first1=Sabelo|title=The Challenges Facing Africa's Emerging Governance Architecture|url=https://www.issafrica.org/iss-today/the-challenges-facing-africas-emerging-governance-architecture|website=ISS Africa|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The AU Commission, which is the heart of AGA lacks clear organizational structures and thus is not ideal to spearhead the initiative.&lt;ref name="The Challenges Facing Africa's Emerging Governance Architecture" /&gt;
# AGA needs to establish a sustainable funding scheme that will ensure independent and well functioning structures.&lt;ref name="The Challenges Facing Africa's Emerging Governance Architecture" /&gt;

Originating in the [[legal profession]], '''argument in the alternative''' is a strategy in which a lawyer advances several competing (and possibly [[mutually exclusive]]) arguments in order to pre-empt objections by his adversary, with the goal of showing that regardless of interpretation there is no reasonable conclusion other than the advocate's.

[[Bart Simpson|Bart Simpson's]] classic "I didn't do it, no one saw me do it, you can't prove anything!" could be considered a somewhat humorous example. In a more serious example, a lawyer might argue, not only that his client was elsewhere when a murder or other crime took place, but also that ''even if he had been on the scene'', he would have had no way of accessing the alleged murder weapon.  In this way, the lawyer attacks several premises of the prosecution's argument at once. The secondary line of reasoning might be presented to persuade a sub-audience who would not otherwise agree with the primary [[argument]].

In regards to [[contract law]], arguing in the alternative is done where a dispute arises over the terms of a contract. In a particular case it may be best for the [[plaintiff]] to allege that a statement made was to become a term of the contract. However the circumstances of the case may be such that the plaintiff cannot be certain that the court will accept this argument. To allow for this possibility, all the plaintiff need do is to argue in the alternative that the statement was in fact a representation (which allows for remedies based on misrepresentation) or again in the alternative that the statement became a part of a collateral contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khoury, Yamouni|first=D, Y S|title=Understanding Contract Law|year=2007|publisher=LexisNexis Butterworths|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Occasionally, such arguments can be confusing to some people, who perceive a self-contradiction. Generally speaking, this is a case of mistakenly thinking the argument claims ''both'' alternatives are true, when in reality it is claiming only that one or the other of them must be.

{{Tort law}}
In [[common law]], '''assault''' is the [[tort]] of acting intentionally, that is with either general or specific intent, causing the reasonable apprehension of an immediate harmful or offensive contact. Because assault requires intent, it is considered an [[intentional tort]], as opposed to a tort of [[negligence]]. Actual ability to carry out the apprehended contact is not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=George Luther|title=American Law &amp; Procedure, Vol II, Torts|date=1910|publisher=La Salle Extension University|isbn=9781166483043|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Criminal Law]] an assault is defined as an attempt to commit battery, requiring the specific intent to cause physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=Black's Law Dictionary|year=2011|publisher=West Group (Law)|isbn=0314275444|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to battery==
As distinguished from [[battery (tort)|battery]], assault does not need to involve actual contact; it only needs intent to make or threaten contact and the resulting apprehension. However, assault requires more than words alone.  For example, wielding a knife while shouting threats could be construed as assault if an apprehension was created. Fear is not required for an assault to occur, only anticipation of subsequent battery. 

A battery can occur without a preceding assault, such as if a person is struck in the back of the head. An assault can be an attempted battery.

==Elements==
Three elements must be established in order to establish tortious assault:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Julia|title=Connecting with Tort Law|publisher=Oxford|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; first, there must be a positive act by the defendant;&lt;ref name="Barton v Armstrong"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Barton v Armstrong |year=1973 |court=UKPC |num=27 |format=1 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |parallelcite=[1976] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; second, the plaintiff had reasonable apprehension (the requisite state of mind) of immediate physical contact,&lt;ref name="Barton v Armstrong"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|24|2014|litigants=Dunwoodie v Teachers Mutual Bank Ltd |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and third, the [[defendant]]'s act of interference was intentional (the defendant intended the resulting apprehension).&lt;ref name="Rixon v Star City"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|265|2001|litigants=Rixon v Star City Pty Ltd |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But intent for purposes of civil assault can be either general or specific.  Specific intent means that when the defendant acted, he or she intended to cause apprehension of a harmful or unwanted contact.  General intent means that the defendant knew with substantial certainty that the action would put someone in apprehension of a harmful or unwanted contact.

While the law varies by jurisdiction, contact is often defined as ''harmful'' if it objectively intends to injure, disfigure, impair, or cause pain.

The act is deemed ''offensive'' if it would offend a reasonable person’s sense of personal dignity.

While ''imminence'' is judged objectively and varies widely on the facts,  it generally suggests there is little to no opportunity for intervening acts.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Knight'' (1988) 35 [[Australian Criminal Reports|A Crim R]] 314, ''Zanker v Vartzokas'' (1988) 34 [[Australian Criminal Reports|A Crim R]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the state of ''apprehension'' should be differentiated from the general state of [[fear]], as apprehension requires only that the person be aware of the imminence of the harmful or offensive act.

In Australia, the test for proving tortious assault is formulated as requiring '' 'proof of an intention to create in another person an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact' ''.&lt;ref name="Rixon v Star City"/&gt;{{rp|paras 56-8}}

==Defenses==
Assault can be justified in situations of [[Right of self-defense |self-defense]] or [[Right of self-defense |defense of a third party]] where the act was deemed reasonable. It can also be justified in the context of a sport where [[Consent |consent]] may be given or implied. An act of assault may also be privileged, meaning that the person who commits the assault had the legal right to do so and cannot be sued, as might occur if a police officer draws a firearm on a criminal suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Personal Injury Claims for Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/assault_battery.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, [[Automatism (law)|automatism]] (e.g., sleep walking) acts to negate the intent element as someone acting while asleep is not acting voluntarily.

{{USBankruptcy}}
{{Insolvency}}
In the [[United States]], [[bankruptcy]] is governed by federal law, commonly referred to as the "Bankruptcy Code" ("Code"). The [[United States Constitution]] (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4) authorizes Congress to enact "uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States." Congress has exercised this authority several times since 1801, including through adoption of the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]], as amended, codified in [[Title 11 of the United States Code]] and the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005]] (BAPCPA).

Some laws relevant to [[bankruptcy]] are found in other parts of the United States Code. For example, bankruptcy crimes are found in [[Title 18 of the United States Code]] (Crimes). Tax implications of bankruptcy are found in [[Title 26 of the United States Code]] ([[Internal Revenue Code]]), and the creation and jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts are found in [[Title 28 of the United States Code]] (Judiciary and Judicial procedure).

Bankruptcy cases are filed in [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] (units&lt;ref&gt;See 28 U.S.C. sec. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States District Court]]s), and federal law governs procedure in bankruptcy cases. However, state laws are often applied to determine how bankruptcy affects the property rights of debtors. For example, law governing the validity of liens or rules protecting certain property from creditors (known as exemptions), may derive from state law or federal law. Because state law plays a major role in many bankruptcy cases, it is often unwise to generalize some bankruptcy issues across [[U.S. state|state]] lines.

==History==
{{main|History of bankruptcy law in the United States}}
Before 1898, there were several short-lived federal bankruptcy laws in the U.S. The first was the [[Bankruptcy Act of 1800]]&lt;ref&gt;{{usstat|2|19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was repealed in 1803 and followed by the act of 1841,&lt;ref&gt;{{usstat|5|440}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was repealed in 1843, and then the act of 1867,&lt;ref&gt;{{usstat|14|517}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was amended in 1874&lt;ref&gt;{{usstat|18|182}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repealed in 1878.

The first modern Bankruptcy Act in America, sometimes called the "[[Nelson Act]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{usstat|30|544}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initially entered into force in 1898.  The current Bankruptcy Code was enacted in 1978 by § 101 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549 (November 6, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; and generally became effective on October 1, 1979.  The current Code completely replaced the former Bankruptcy Act, the "Chandler Act" of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1938: Securities And Exchange Commission |work=MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461500773/1938_securities_and_exchange_commission.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwPrnHU8?url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461500773/1938_securities_and_exchange_commission.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chandler Act gave unprecedented authority to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in the administration of bankruptcy filings.  The current Code has been amended numerous times since 1978. See also the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2005.

==Chapters of the Bankruptcy Code==
Entities seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code may file a petition for relief under a number of different chapters of the Code, depending on circumstances. Title 11 contains nine chapters, six of which provide for the filing of a petition. The other three chapters provide rules governing bankruptcy cases in general. A case is typically referred to by the chapter under which the petition is filed. These chapters are described below.

===Chapter 7: Liquidation===
{{Main|Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code}}
Liquidation under a [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] filing is the most common form of bankruptcy. Liquidation involves the appointment of a trustee who collects the non-exempt property of the debtor, sells it and distributes the proceeds to the creditors. Because each state allows for debtors to keep essential property, Chapter 7 cases are often "no asset" cases, meaning that the bankrupt estate has no non-exempt assets to fund a distribution to creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Judith A. Fitzgerald, Arthur J. Gonzalez &amp; Mary F. Walrath, ''Rutter Group Practice Guide: Bankruptcy'', paragr. 10:40, at p. 10-5, The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 7 bankruptcy remains on a bankruptcy filer's credit report as part of credit history for 10 years.

United States bankruptcy law significantly changed in 2005 with the passage of [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (US)|BAPCPA]], which made it more difficult for consumer debtors to file bankruptcy in general and Chapter 7 in particular.

Advocates of BAPCPA claimed that its passage would reduce losses to creditors such as credit card companies, and that those creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers in the form of lower interest rates. Critics assert that these claims turned out to be false, observing that although credit card company losses decreased after passage of the Act, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits increased.&lt;ref name = "Credit Card"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1157158 "The Effect of BAPCPA on Credit Card Industry Profits and Prices"] Berkeley Business Law Journal, Vol. 6, No. 1, Spring 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 9: Reorganization for municipalities===
{{Main|Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code}}
A [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9]] bankruptcy is available only to [[municipality|municipalities]]. Chapter 9 is a form of reorganization, not liquidation. Notable examples of municipal bankruptcies include that of [[Orange County, California]] (1994 to 1996) and the [[Detroit bankruptcy|bankruptcy of the city of Detroit, Michigan]] in 2013.

===Chapters 11, 12, and 13: Reorganization===
[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|right|A few volumes of [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Title 11 (Bankruptcy)]] of the United States Code Annotated (U.S.C.A.) at a [[law library]].]]
{{Main|Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code}}
Bankruptcy under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]], [[Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 12]], or [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] is more complex reorganization and involves allowing the debtor to keep some or all of his or her property and to use future earnings to pay off creditors. Consumers usually file chapter 7 or chapter 13. Chapter 11 filings by individuals are allowed, but are rare. Chapter 12 is similar to Chapter 13 but is available only to "family farmers" and "family fisherman" in certain situations. Chapter 12 generally has more generous terms for debtors than a comparable Chapter 13 case would have available. As recently as mid-2004 Chapter 12 was scheduled to expire, but in late 2004 it was renewed and made permanent.

===Chapter 15: Cross-border insolvency===
{{Main|Chapter 15, Title 11, United States Code}}
The [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005]] added [[Chapter 15, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 15]] (as a replacement for section 304) and deals with [[cross-border insolvency]]: foreign companies with U.S. debts.

==Features of U.S. bankruptcy law==

===Voluntary versus involuntary bankruptcy===
As a threshold matter, bankruptcy cases are either voluntary or involuntary. In voluntary bankruptcy cases, which account for the overwhelming majority of cases, debtors petition the bankruptcy court. With [[involuntary bankruptcy]], creditors, rather than the debtor, file the petition in bankruptcy. Involuntary petitions are rare, however, and are occasionally used in business settings to force a company into bankruptcy so that creditors can enforce their rights.

===The estate===
Except in Chapter 9 cases, commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an "[[Estate (law)|estate]]."  Generally, the debtor's creditors must look to the assets of the estate for satisfaction of their claims. The estate consists of all property interests of the debtor at the time of case commencement, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|11|541}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a married person in a [[community property]] state, the estate may include certain community property interests of the debtor's spouse even if the spouse has not filed bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|11|541(a)(2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The estate may also include other items, including but not limited to property acquired by will or inheritance within 180 days after case commencement.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|11|541(a)(5)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]] purposes, the bankruptcy estate of an individual in a Chapter 7 or 11 case is a separate taxable entity from the debtor.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|26|1398}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bankruptcy estate of a corporation, partnership, or other collective entity, or the estate of an individual in Chapters 12 or 13, is not a separate taxable entity from the debtor.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|26|1399}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy court===
{{Main|United States bankruptcy court}}
In ''[[Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;458 U.S. 50 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that certain provisions of the law relating to Article I bankruptcy judges (who are not life-tenured [[Article III judge|"Article III" judges]]) are unconstitutional. Congress responded in 1984 with changes to remedy constitutional defects. Under the revised law, bankruptcy judges in each judicial district constitute a "unit" of the applicable [[United States District Court]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{USC|28|151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge is appointed for a term of 14 years by the [[United States Court of Appeals]] for the circuit in which the applicable district is located.&lt;ref&gt;See {{USC|28|152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States District Courts have [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over bankruptcy matters.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|28|1334(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, each such district court may, by order, "refer" bankruptcy matters to the Bankruptcy Court,&lt;ref&gt;See {{USC|28|157(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most district courts have a standing "reference" order to that effect, so that all bankruptcy cases are handled by the Bankruptcy Court. In unusual circumstances, a district court may "withdraw the reference" (''[[i.e.]]'', taking a particular case or proceeding within the case away from the bankruptcy court) and decide the matter itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|28|157(d)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisions of the bankruptcy court are generally appealable to the district court,&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|28|158(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and then to the Court of Appeals. However, in a few jurisdictions a separate court called a [[Bankruptcy Appellate Panel]] (composed of bankruptcy judges) hears certain appeals from bankruptcy courts.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|28|158(b)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Trustee===
{{Main|United States Trustee}}
The [[United States Attorney General]] appoints a separate [[United States Trustee Program|United States Trustee]] for each of twenty-one geographical regions for a five-year term. Each Trustee is removable from office by and works under the general supervision of the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|28|581}} and {{usc|28|586(c)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Trustees maintain regional offices that correspond with federal judicial districts and are administratively overseen by the Executive Office for United States Trustees in Washington, D.C. Each United States Trustee, an officer of the U.S. Department of Justice, is responsible for maintaining and supervising a panel of private trustees for chapter 7 bankruptcy cases.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|28|586(a)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Trustee has other duties including the administration of most bankruptcy cases and trustees.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|28|586(a)(3)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Section 307 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code, a U.S. Trustee "may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in any case or proceeding" in bankruptcy except for filing a plan of reorganization in a chapter 11 case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S.C. Sec. 307. United States trustee|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title11/html/USCODE-2011-title11-chap3-subchapI-sec307.htm|website=GPO|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Automatic stay===
{{Main|Automatic stay}}
Bankruptcy Code § 362&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|11|362}}.&lt;/ref&gt; imposes the [[automatic stay]] at the moment a bankruptcy petition is filed. The automatic stay generally prohibits the commencement, enforcement or appeal of actions and judgments, judicial or administrative, against a debtor for the collection of a claim that arose prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. The automatic stay also prohibits collection actions and proceedings directed toward property of the bankruptcy estate itself.

In some courts, violations of the stay are treated as void ''ab initio'' as a matter of law, although the court may annul the stay to give effect to otherwise void acts. Other courts treat violations as voidable (not necessarily void ''ab initio'').&lt;ref&gt;''Sikes v. Global Marine, Inc.'', 881 F.2d 176 (5th Cir. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Any violation of the stay may give rise to damages being assessed against the violating party.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|11|362(k)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-willful violations of the stay are often excused without penalty, but willful violators are liable for punitive damages and may also be found to be in contempt of court.

A secured creditor may be allowed to take the applicable collateral if the creditor first obtains permission from the court. Permission is requested by a creditor by filing a motion for relief from the automatic stay. The court must either grant the motion or provide adequate protection to the secured creditor that the value of their collateral will not decrease during the stay.

Without the bankruptcy protection of the automatic stay, creditors might race to the courthouse to improve their positions against a debtor. If the debtor's business were facing a temporary crunch, but were nevertheless viable in the long term, it might not survive a "run" by creditors. A run could also result in waste and unfairness among similarly situated creditors.

Bankruptcy Code 362(d) gives 4 ways that a creditor can get the automatic stay removed.

===Avoidance actions===
Debtors, or the trustees that represent them, gain the ability to reject, or '''avoid''' actions taken with respect to the debtor's property for a specified time prior to the filing of the bankruptcy. While the details of avoidance actions are nuanced, there are three general categories of avoidance actions:
* Preferences: {{UnitedStatesCode|11|547}}
* Federal fraudulent transfer: {{UnitedStatesCode|11|548}}
* Non-bankruptcy law creditor: {{UnitedStatesCode|11|544}}

All avoidance actions attempt to limit the risk of the legal system accelerating the financial demise of a financially unstable debtor who has not yet declared bankruptcy. The bankruptcy system generally endeavors to reward creditors who continue to extend financing to debtors and discourage creditors from accelerating their debt collection efforts. Avoidance actions are some of the most obvious of the mechanisms to encourage this goal.

Despite the apparent simplicity of these rules, a number of exceptions exist in the context of each category of avoidance action.

====Preferences====
Preference actions generally permit the trustee to avoid (that is, to void an otherwise legally binding transaction) certain transfers of the debtor's property that benefit creditors where the transfers occur on or within 90 days of the date of filing of the bankruptcy petition. For example, if a debtor has a debt to a friendly creditor and a debt to an unfriendly creditor, and pays the friendly creditor, and then declares bankruptcy one week later, the trustee may be able to recover the money paid to the friendly creditor under 11 U.S.C. § 547. While this "reach back" period typically extends 90 days backwards from the date of the bankruptcy, the amount of time is longer in the case of "insiders"—typically one year. Insiders include family and close business contacts of the debtor.

====Fraudulent transfer====
Bankruptcy fraudulent transfer law is similar in practice to non-bankruptcy [[fraudulent transfer]] law. Some terms, however, are more generous in bankruptcy than they are otherwise. For instance, the statute of limitations within bankruptcy is two years as opposed to a shorter time frame in some non-bankruptcy contexts. Generally a fraudulent transfer action operates in much the same way as a preference avoidance. Fraudulent transfer actions, however, sometimes require a showing of intent to shelter the property from a creditor.

Generally, conversion of nonexempt assets into exempt assets on the eve of bankruptcy would not be indicia of fraud per se. However, depending on the amount of the exemption and the circumstances surrounding the conversion, a court may find the conversion to be a fraudulent transfer. This is especially true when the conversion amounts to nothing more than a temporary arrangement. The cases that held a conversion of nonexempt into exempt assets to be a fraudulent transfer tend to focus on the existence of an independent reason for the conversion. For example, if a debtor purchased a residence protected by a [[homestead exemption]] with the intent to reside in such residence that would be an allowable conversion into nonexempt property. But where the debtor purchased the residence with all of their available funds, leaving no money to live off, that presumed that the conversion was temporary, indicating a fraudulent transfer. The courts look at the timing of the transfer as the most important factor.

====Non-bankruptcy law creditor - "Strong Arm"====
The ''strong arm'' avoidance power stems from 11 U.S.C. § 544 and permits the trustee to exercise the rights that a debtor in the same situation would have under the relevant state law. Specifically, § 544(a) grants the trustee the rights of avoidance of (1) a judicial lien creditor, (2) an unsatisfied lien creditor, and (3) a bona fide purchaser of real property. In practice these avoidance powers often overlap with preference and fraudulent transfer avoidance powers.

===The creditors===
Secured creditors whose security interests survive the commencement of the case may look to the property that is the subject of their security interests, after obtaining permission from the court (in the form of relief from the automatic stay). [[Security interest]]s, created by what are called [[secured transactions in the United States|secured transactions]], are [[lien]]s on the property of a debtor.

Unsecured creditors are generally divided into two classes: unsecured priority creditors and general unsecured creditors. Unsecured priority creditors are further subdivided into classes as described in the law. In some cases the assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all priority unsecured creditors in full; in such cases the general unsecured creditors receive nothing.

Because of the priority and rank ordering feature of bankruptcy law, debtors sometimes improperly collude with others (who may be related to the debtor) to prefer them, by for example granting them a [[security interest]] in otherwised unpledged assets. For this reason, the [[bankruptcy trustee]] is permitted to reverse certain transactions of the debtor within period of time prior to the date of bankruptcy filing. The time period varies depending on the relationship of the parties to the debtor and the nature of the transaction.

In Chapters 7, 12, and 13, creditors must file a "proof of claim" to get paid. In a Chapter 11 case, a creditor is not required to file a proof of claim (that is, a proof of claim is "deemed filed") if the creditor's claim is listed on the debtor's bankruptcy schedules, unless the claim is scheduled as "disputed, contingent, or unliquidated."&lt;ref&gt;See generally subsection (a) of {{usc|11|1111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the creditor's claim is not listed on the schedules in a Chapter 11 case, the creditor must file a proof of claim.

===Executory contracts===
The bankruptcy trustee may reject certain [[executory contracts]] and unexpired leases.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|11|365}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For bankruptcy purposes, a contract is generally considered executory when both parties to the contract have not yet fully performed a material obligation of the contract.

If the Trustee (or debtor in possession, in many chapter 11 cases) rejects a contract, the debtor's bankruptcy estate is subject to ordinary breach of contract damages, but the [[damages]] amount is an obligation and is generally treated as an unsecured claim.

===Committees===
Under some chapters, notably chapters 7, 9 and 11, committees of various stakeholders are appointed by the bankruptcy court. In Chapter 11 and 9, these committees consist of entities that hold the seven largest claims of the kinds represented by the committee. Other committees may also be appointed by the court.

Committees have daily communications with the debtor and the debtor's advisers and have access to a wide variety of documents as part of their functions and responsibilities.

===Exempt property===
Although in theory all property of the debtor that is not excluded from the estate under the Bankruptcy Code becomes property of the estate (''i.e.'', is automatically transferred from the debtor to the estate) at the time of commencement of a case, an individual debtor (not a partnership, corporation, etc.) may claim certain items of property as "exempt" and thereby keep those items (subject, however, to any valid liens or other encumbrances). An individual debtor may choose between a "federal" list of exemptions and the list of exemptions provided by the law of the state in which the debtor files the bankruptcy case unless the state in which the debtor files the bankruptcy case has enacted legislation prohibiting the debtor from choosing the exemptions on the federal list. Almost 40 states have done so. In states where the debtor is allowed to choose between the federal and state exemptions, the debtor has the opportunity to choose the exemptions that most fully benefit him or her and, in many cases, may convert at least some of his or her property from non-exempt form (e.g., cash) to exempt form (e.g., increased equity in a home created by using the cash to pay down a mortgage) prior to filing the bankruptcy case.

The exemption laws vary greatly from state to state. In some states, exempt property includes equity in a home or car, tools of the trade, and some personal effects. In other states an asset class such as tools of trade will not be exempt by virtue of its class except to the extent it is claimed under a more general exemption for personal property.

One major purpose of bankruptcy is to ensure orderly and reasonable management of debt. Thus, exemptions for personal effects are thought to prevent punitive seizures of items of little or no economic value (personal effects, [[hygiene|personal care]] items, ordinary clothing), since this does not promote any desirable economic result. Similarly, tools of the trade may, depending on the available exemptions, be a permitted exemption as their continued possession allows the insolvent debtor to move forward into productive work as soon as possible.

The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 placed pension plans not subject to the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA), like 457 and 403(b) plans, in the same status as ERISA qualified plans with respect to having exemption status akin to spendthrift trusts. SEP-IRAs and SIMPLEs still are outside federal protection and must rely on state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/9th/0215618p.pdf|title=UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE v. SNYDER|work=Findlaw|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spendthrift trusts===
Most states have property laws that allow a trust agreement to contain a legally enforceable restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest in the trust (sometimes known as an "anti-alienation provision"). The anti-alienation provision generally prevents creditors of a beneficiary from acquiring the beneficiary's share of the trust. Such a trust is sometimes called a [[spendthrift trust]]. To prevent fraud, most states allow this protection only to the extent that the beneficiary did not transfer property to the trust. Also, such provisions do not protect cash or other property once it has been transferred from the trust to the beneficiary. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, an anti-alienation provision in a spendthrift trust is recognized. This means that the beneficiary's share of the trust generally does not become property of the bankruptcy estate.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Texas Property Code section 112.035 and {{usc|11|541(c)(2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redemption===
In a Chapter 7 liquidation case, an individual debtor may redeem certain "tangible personal property intended primarily for personal, family, or household use" that is encumbered by a lien. To qualify, the property generally either (A) must be exempt under section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (B) must have been abandoned by the trustee under section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code. To redeem the property, the debtor must pay the lienholder the full amount of the applicable allowed secured claim against the property.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|11|722}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debtor's discharge===
{{Main|Bankruptcy discharge}}
Key concepts in bankruptcy include the debtor's [[Bankruptcy discharge|discharge]] and the related "fresh start." Discharge is available in some but not all cases. For example, in a Chapter 7 case only an individual debtor (not a corporation, partnership, etc.) can receive a discharge.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|11|727(a)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Discharge is also believed to play an important role in credit markets by encouraging lenders, who may be more sophisticated and have better information than debtors, to monitor debtors and limit risk-taking.&lt;ref name = Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of a bankruptcy discharge is to eliminate ''only'' the debtor's ''personal'' liability,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|11|524}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''not'' the ''in rem'' liability for a secured debt to the extent of the value of collateral. The term "''in rem''" essentially means "with respect to the thing itself" (i.e., the collateral). For example, if a debt in the amount of $100,000 is secured by property having a value of only $80,000, the $20,000 deficiency is treated, in bankruptcy, as an unsecured claim (even though it's part of a "secured" debt). The $80,000 portion of the debt is treated as a secured claim. Assuming a discharge is granted and none of the $20,000 deficiency is paid (e.g., due to insufficiency of funds), the $20,000 deficiency—the debtor's ''personal liability''—is discharged (assuming the debt is not non-dischargeable under another Bankruptcy Code provision). The $80,000 portion of the debt is the ''in rem'' liability, and it is not discharged by the court's discharge order. This liability can presumably be satisfied by the creditor taking the asset itself. An essential concept is that when commentators say that a debt is "dischargeable," they are referring only to the debtor's personal liability on the debt. To the extent that a liability is covered by the value of collateral, the debt is not discharged.

This analysis assumes, however, that the collateral does not increase in value after commencement of the case. If the collateral increases in value and the debtor (rather than the estate) keeps the collateral (e.g., where the asset is exempt or is abandoned by the trustee back to the debtor), the amount of the creditor's security interest may or may not increase. In situations where the debtor (rather than the creditor) is allowed to benefit from the increase in collateral value, the effect is called "lien stripping" or "paring down." Lien stripping is allowed only in certain cases depending on the kind of collateral and the particular chapter of the Code under which the discharge is granted.

The discharge also does not eliminate certain rights of a creditor to setoff (or "offset") certain mutual debts owed by the creditor to the debtor against certain claims of that creditor against the debtor, where both the debt owed by the creditor and the claim against the debtor arose prior to the commencement of the case.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|11|553}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every debt may be discharged under every chapter of the Code. Certain [[Taxation in the United States|taxes]] owed to Federal, state or local government, [[student loans]],&lt;ref name = Simkovic/&gt; and [[child support]] obligations are not dischargeable. (Guaranteed student loans are potentially dischargeable, however, if debtor prevails in a difficult-to-win [[adversary proceeding]] against the lender commenced by a complaint to determine dischargeability. Also, the debtor can petition the court for a "financial hardship" discharge, but the grant of such discharges is rare.)

The debtor's liability on a [[secured debt]], such as a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] or [[mechanic's lien]] on a home, may be discharged. The effects of the mortgage or mechanic's lien, however, cannot be discharged in most cases if the lien affixed prior to filing. Therefore, if the debtor wishes to retain the property, the debt must usually be paid for as agreed. (See also [[lien avoidance]], [[reaffirmation agreement]]) (Note: there may be additional flexibility available in [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] for debtors dealing with oversecured collateral such as a financed auto, so long as the oversecured property is not the debtor's [[primary residence]].)

Any debt tainted by one of a variety of wrongful acts recognized by the Bankruptcy Code, including [[defalcation]], or consumer purchases or cash advances above a certain amount incurred a short time before filing, cannot be discharged. However, certain kinds of debt, such as debts incurred by way of fraud, may be dischargeable through the Chapter 13 ''super discharge.'' All in all, as of 2005, there are 19 general categories of debt that cannot be discharged in a [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy, and fewer debts that cannot be discharged under Chapter 13.

===Entities that cannot be debtors===
The section of the Bankruptcy code that governs which entities are permitted to file a bankruptcy petition is {{UnitedStatesCode|11|109}}. [[Bank]]s and other deposit institutions, [[insurance]] companies, [[railroad]]s, and certain other financial institutions and entities regulated by the federal and state governments, and Private and Personal Trusts, except Statutory Business Trusts, as permitted by some States, cannot be a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code. Instead, special state and federal laws govern the liquidation or reorganization of these companies. In the U.S. context at least, it is incorrect to refer to a bank or insurer as being "bankrupt". The terms "insolvent", "in liquidation", or "in receivership" would be appropriate under some circumstances.

===Status of certain defined benefit pension plan liabilities in bankruptcy===
The [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]] (PBGC), a U.S. government corporation that insures certain defined benefit pension plan obligations, may assert liens in bankruptcy under either of two separate statutory provisions. The first is found in the Internal Revenue Code, at {{usc|26|412(n)}}, which provides that liens held by the PBGC have the status of a tax lien. Under this provision, the unpaid mandatory pension contributions must exceed one million dollars for the lien to arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swett|first1=Brian I.|last2=Terrien|first2=Michael S.|title=Pension Protection Act New FASB Rule May Put Secured Lenders at Greater Risk of PBGC Liens|journal=ABI Journal|date=December 2006|url=http://www.abi.org/abi-journal/pension-protection-act-new-fasb-rule-may-put-secured-lenders-at-greater-risk-of-pbgc|accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=American Bankruptcy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second statute is {{usc|29|1368}}, under which a PBGC lien has the status of a tax lien in bankruptcy. Under this provision, the lien may not exceed 30% of the net worth of all persons liable under a separate provision, {{usc|29|1362(a)}}.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

In bankruptcy, PBGC liens (like Federal tax liens) generally are not valid against certain competing liens that were perfected before a notice of the PBGC lien was filed.&lt;ref&gt;Id. See {{usc|26|6323(a)}} and {{usc|26|6323(f)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bankruptcy costs==

Ninety-one percent of U.S. individuals filing bankruptcy hire an attorney to file their Chapter 7 petition.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215234421/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |archivedate=December 15, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical cost of an attorney is $1,170.00.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"/&gt; Alternatives to filing with an attorney are: filing pro se, meaning without an attorney, which requires an individual to fill out least sixteen separate forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|title=Bankruptcy Forms|work=United States Courts|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; hiring a [[Bankruptcy petition preparer|petition preparer]] (which have a track record of shoddy work and unsuccessful cases),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Preparing Petitions: It Irks the Lawyers, But Is It Lawyering?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|agency=New York Times|date=13 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; or using online software to generate the petition.

The U.S. Bankruptcy Court also charges fees. The amounts of these fees vary depending on the Chapter of bankruptcy being filed. As of 2016, the filing fee for Chapter 7 was $335 and $310 for Chapter 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Fees|url=http://www.pawb.uscourts.gov/court-fees|website=United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to apply for an installment payment plan in cases of financial hardship. Additional fees are charged for adding creditors after filing ($31), converting the case from one chapter to another ($10-$45), and reopening the case ($245 for Chapter 7 and $235 in Chapter 13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/fees/bankruptcy-court-miscellaneous-fee-schedule|website=Bankruptcy Courts|publisher=United States Courts|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bankruptcy crimes==
In the United States, criminal provisions relating to bankruptcy fraud and other bankruptcy crimes are found in sections 151 through 158 of Title 18 of the [[United States Code]].

Bankruptcy fraud includes filing a bankruptcy petition or any other document in a bankruptcy case for the purpose of attempting to execute or conceal a scheme or artifice to defraud. Bankruptcy fraud also includes making a false or fraudulent representation, claim or promise in connection with a bankruptcy case, either before or after the commencement of the case, for the purpose of attempting to execute or conceal a scheme or artifice to defraud. Bankruptcy fraud is punishable by a fine, or by up to five years in prison, or both.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|18|157}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowingly and fraudulently concealing property of the estate from a custodian, trustee, marshal, or other court officer is a separate offense, and may also be punishable by a fine, or by up to five years in prison, or both. The same penalty may be imposed for knowingly and fraudulently concealing, destroying, mutilating, falsifying, or making a false entry in any books, documents, records, papers, or other recorded information relating to the property or financial affairs of the debtor after a case has been filed.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|18|152}}; see also {{usc|18|1519}}, which provides for a 20 year prison sentence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain offenses regarding fraud in connection with a bankruptcy case may also be classified as "racketeering activity" for purposes of the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO).&lt;ref&gt;Codified at {{usc|18|1961}} through {{usc|18|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any person who receives income directly or indirectly derived from a "pattern" of such racketeering activity (generally, two or more offensive acts within a ten-year period) and who uses or invests any part of that income in the acquisition, establishment, or operation of any enterprise engaged in (or affecting) interstate or foreign commerce may be punished by up to twenty years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|18|1962}} and {{usc|18|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bankruptcy crimes are prosecuted by the [[United States Attorney]], typically after a reference from the [[United States Trustee]], the case trustee, or a bankruptcy judge.

Bankruptcy fraud can also sometimes lead to criminal prosecution in state courts, under the charge of [[theft]] of the [[good (accounting)|goods]] or [[theft of services|services]] obtained by the debtor for which payment, in whole or in part, was evaded by the fraudulent bankruptcy filing.

==Bankruptcy and federalism==
On January 23, 2006, the Supreme Court, in ''[[Central Virginia Community College v. Katz]]'', declined to apply state [[sovereign immunity]] from ''[[Seminole Tribe v. Florida]]'',&lt;ref&gt;517 U.S. 44 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; to defeat a trustee's action under {{usc|11|547}} to recover preferential transfers made by a debtor to a state agency. The Court ruled that Article I, section 8, clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution (empowering Congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy) abrogates the state's sovereign immunity in suits to recover preferential payments.

==Social and economic factors==
In 2008, there were 1,117,771 bankruptcy filings in the United States courts. Of those, 744,424 were chapter 7 bankruptcies, while 362,762 were chapter 13.&lt;ref name=courts08s&gt;[http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/2009/bankrupt_f2table_dec2008.xls US Courts 2008 Bankruptcy Statistics (Excel)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816072439/http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/2009/bankrupt_f2table_dec2008.xls |date=August 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal bankruptcy===
{{see also|Personal bankruptcy#United States}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
Personal bankruptcies may be caused by a number of factors. In 2008, over 96% of all bankruptcy filings were non-business filings, and of those, approximately two-thirds were chapter 7 cases.&lt;ref name=courts08s /&gt;

Although the individual causes of bankruptcy are complex and multifaceted, the majority of personal bankruptcies involve substantial medical bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Personal bankruptcies are typically filed under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.  Personal Chapter 11 bankruptcies are relatively rare.
The American Journal of Medicine says over 3 out of 5 personal bankruptcies are due to [[medical debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Himmelstein | first1 = D.

===Corporate bankruptcy===
Corporate bankruptcy can arise as a result of two broad categories failure—business failure or financial distress. Business failure stems from a critical flaw in the company's business model that prohibits it from producing the necessary level of profit to justify its capital investment. Conversely, financial distress stems from a critical flaw in the way the company is financed, or its capital structure. Continued financial distress leads to either technical insolvency (assets outweigh liabilities, but the firm is unable to meet current obligations) or “bankruptcy” (liabilities outweigh assets, and the firm has a negative net worth). A company experiencing business failure can stay off bankruptcy as long as it has access to funding; conversely, a company that is experiencing financial failure will be pushed into bankruptcy regardless of the soundness of its business model. The actual causes of corporate bankruptcies are difficult to establish, due to the compounding effects of external (macroeconomic, industry) and internal (business or financial) factors. However, some studies have indicated that financial leverage and working capital mismanagement are likely two of the major causes of corporate failure and bankruptcy in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;''Corporate Bankruptcy: Assessment, Analysis and Prediction of Financial Distress, Insolvency, and Failure," by Konstantin A. Danilov, available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2467580&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest bankruptcies==
The largest bankruptcy in U.S. history occurred on September 15, 2008, when [[Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.]] filed for [[Chapter 11]] protection with more than $639 billion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSLF13895120080915|title=CDS dealers honour trades to cut Lehman risk|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1279">{{Politics of Benin}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Benin]] on 2 December 1990. The main issues were changing the political system to a [[multi-party system]], with a secondary issue as to whether there should be age limits for the [[List of heads of state of Benin|President]]. The referendum passed with 93.2% of voters approving the change to a multi-party system and 73.3% in favour of age limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bj.html Elections in Benin] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life timeline}}
'''Biotic material''' or '''biological derived material''' is any material that originates from [[living organisms]]. Most such materials contain [[carbon]] and are capable of [[Decomposition|decay]].

The earliest [[origin of life|life on Earth arose]] at least 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Origin1"&gt;Schopf, JW, Kudryavtsev, AB, Czaja, AD, and Tripathi, AB. (2007).

Examples of biotic materials are [[wood]], [[straw]], [[humus]], [[manure]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[crude oil]], [[cotton]], [[spider silk]], [[chitin]], [[fibrin]], and [[bone]].

The use of biotic materials, and processed biotic materials ([[bio-based material]]) as [[alternative natural materials]], over synthetics is popular with those who are environmentally conscious because such materials are usually biodegradable, renewable, and the processing is commonly understood and has minimal environmental impact. However, not all biotic materials are used in an environmentally friendly way, such as those that require high levels of processing, are harvested unsustainably, or are used to produce [[greenhouse gasses|carbon emission]]s.

When the source of the recently living material has little importance to the product produced, such as in the production of [[biofuel]]s, biotic material is simply called [[biomass]]. Many fuel sources may have biological sources, and may be divided roughly into [[fossil fuels]], and [[biofuel]].

In [[soil science]], biotic material is often referred to as ''[[organic matter]]''. Biotic materials in [[soil]] include [[glomalin]], [[Dopplerite]] and [[humic acid]].  Some biotic material may not be considered to be organic matter if it is low in [[organic compounds]], such as a clam's shell, which is an essential component of the living organism, but contains little organic carbon.

Examples of the use of biotic materials include:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}

*[[Alternative natural materials]]
*[[Building material]], for a stylistic reasons, or to reduce allergic reactions
*[[Clothing]]
*[[Energy industry|energy production]]
*[[Food]]
*[[Drugs|medicine]]
*[[Ink]]
*[[Composting]] and [[mulch]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10845">In the 20th century, the [[United States]] began to invalidate laws against [[blasphemy]] which had been on the books since before the founding of the nation, or prosecutions on that ground, as it was decided it violated the [[Constitution of the United States|American Constitution]]. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] provides "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press..." While there are no federal laws which forbid "religious vilification" or "religious insult" or "[[hate speech]]", some states have blasphemy statutes.

== Blasphemy laws ==

[[File:An Act against Atheism and Blasphemy - Mass Bay Colony 1697.jpg|thumb|right|"An Act against Atheism and Blasphemy" as enacted in 1697 in "His Majesty's Province of the Massachusetts-Bay in New-England" (1759 printing)]]
Massachusetts, Michigan, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania have laws that make reference to blasphemy.&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some US states still have blasphemy laws on the books from the founding days. For example, Chapter 272 of the [[Massachusetts General Laws]] –  a provision based on a similar colonial-era [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]] statute enacted in 1697 – states:
{{quote|[http://mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/272-36.htm Section 36]. Whoever willfully blasphemes the holy name of God by denying, cursing or contumeliously reproaching God, His creation, government or final judging of the world, or by cursing or contumeliously reproaching Jesus Christ or the Holy Ghost, or by cursing or contumeliously reproaching or exposing to contempt and ridicule, the holy word of God contained in the holy scriptures shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for not more than one year or by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars, and may also be bound to good behavior.}}

The history of Maryland's blasphemy statutes suggests that even into the 1930s, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was not recognized as preventing states from passing such laws. An 1879 codification of Maryland statutes prohibited blasphemy: 

{{quote|[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000388/html/am388--824.html Art. 72, sec. 189]. If any person, by writing or speaking, shall blaspheme or curse God, or shall write or utter any profane words of and concerning our Saviour, Jesus Christ, or of and concerning the Trinity, or any of the persons thereof, he shall, on conviction, be fined not more than one hundred dollars, or imprisoned not more than six months, or both fined and imprisoned as aforesaid, at the discretion of the court.}}

According to the marginalia, this statute was adopted in 1819, and a similar law dates back to 1723. In 1904, the statute was still on the books at 
[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000393/html/am393--782.html Art. 27, sec. 20], unaltered in text. As late as 1939, this statute was still [http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000379/html/am379--1100.html the law of Maryland]. But in 1972, in ''Maryland v. Irving K. West'', the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] (the state's highest court) declared the blasphemy law unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt; "Blasphemy Laws" in Gordon Stein, editor, ''The Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', page 61. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985. &lt;/ref&gt; This law was still on the books however at least as late as 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Criminal Law and Motor Vehicle Handbook (Longwood: Gould Publications, 2002), Art. 27, section 20. Blasphemy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania enacted a law against blasphemy in 1977. In the fall of 2007, George Kalman sent the completed forms for incorporating a company to the Pennsylvania Department of State. Kalman wanted to incorporate a movie-production company which he called ''I Choose Hell Productions, LLC''. A week later, Kalman received a notice from the Pennsylvania Department of State which informed him that his forms could not be accepted because a business name "may not contain words that constitute blasphemy, profane cursing or swearing or that profane the Lord's name". In February 2009, Kalman filed suit to have the provision against blasphemy struck down as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt; On June 30, 2010, U.S. District Judge Michael M. Bayslon of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in a 68-page Opinion, ruled in favor of Kalman, finding that Pennsylvania's blasphemy statute violated both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/10D0634P.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Maine's law reads as follows: 
{{quote|Blasphemy may be committed either by using profanely insolent and reproachful language against God, or by contumeliously reproaching Him, His creation, government, final judgment of the world, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, or the Holy Scriptures as contained in the canonical books of the Old and New Testament, or by exposing any of these enumerated Beings or Scriptures to contempt and ridicule, and it is not necessary for the state to prove the doing of all of them.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |coauthors= |title=State v.

==Prosecutions for blasphemy==
The last person to be jailed in the United States for blasphemy was [[Abner Kneeland]] in 1838 (a Massachusetts case: ''[[Commonwealth v. Kneeland]]'').{{Contradict-inline|date=December 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;"Kneeland, Abner" in Gordon Stein, editor, ''The Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', pp. 379–380. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kneeland case preceded the ratification (1868) of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], which [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] the Bill of Rights and made it apply to the states and not just to the federal government. From 1925, the Supreme Court applied the Bill of Rights to all states.&lt;ref&gt;"Blasphemy" in Tom Flynn, editor, ''The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', p. 147. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 Lithuanian-American [[Michael X. Mockus]] was convicted in Maine. He appealed to the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Maine]] on March 25, 1921 in [[State v. Mockus]] and lost the appeal.&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Theodore Schroeder]] |coauthors= |title=Constitutional Free Speech Defined and Defended in an Unfinished Argument in a Case of Blasphemy  |year=1919 |publisher=[[Free Speech League]] |page= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHVDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA454&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=Mockus+blasphemy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NKu5wXK5FR&amp;sig=5TfsRjZogxw2zlpKzzo16mx5Ul0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IEmuVMCfEsbIeNXfgbAE&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Mockus%20blasphemy&amp;f=false |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1926 Lithuanian-American Communist [[Anthony Bimba]] was charged in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]] with blasphemy under a law passed during the time of the [[Salem Witch Trials]] more than two centuries earlier, as well as [[sedition]].&lt;ref name=Uhl110&gt;Jennifer Ruthanne Uhlmann, ''The Communist Civil Rights Movement: Legal Activism in the United States, 1919–1946.'' PhD dissertation. University of California, Los Angeles, 2007; pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; A widely publicized week-long trial followed, during which Bimba's attorney likened atheism to religious belief and maintained that individuals had a right under the United States constitution to believe or disbelieve in the existence of a God.&lt;ref&gt;William Wolkovich, ''Bay State "Blue" Laws and Bimba: A Documentary Study of the Anthony Bimba Trial for Blasphemy and Sedition in Brockton, Massachusetts, 1926.'' Brockton, MA: Forum Press, n.d. [1973]; pg. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Bimba was ultimately found not guilty of blasphemy but convicted of sedition, for which he was fined $100.&lt;ref&gt;Wolkovich, ''Bay State "Blue" Laws and Bimba,'' pg. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last U.S. ''conviction'' for blasphemy was of atheist activist [[Charles Lee Smith]]. In 1928 he rented a storefront in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], and gave out free atheist literature there. The sign in the window read: "Evolution Is True. The Bible's a Lie. God's a Ghost." For this he was charged with violating the city ordinance against blasphemy. Because he was an atheist and therefore could not swear the court's religious oath to tell the truth, he was not permitted to testify in his own defense. The judge then dismissed the original charge, replacing it with one of distributing obscene, slanderous, or scurrilous literature. Smith was convicted, fined $25, and served most of a twenty-six-day jail sentence. His high-profile [[fasting|fast]] while behind bars drew national media attention. Upon his release, he immediately resumed his atheist activities, was again charged with blasphemy, and this time the charge held. In his trial he was again denied the right to testify and was sentenced to ninety days in jail and a fine of $100. Released on $1,000 bail, Smith appealed the verdict. The case then dragged on for several years until it was finally dismissed.&lt;ref&gt; "Smith, Charles Lee" in Gordon Stein, editor, ''The Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', pp. 633–634. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985. &lt;/ref&gt;

==''Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson''==
The U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson]]'', 343 U.S. 495 (1952) held that the New York State blasphemy law was an unconstitutional prior restraint on freedom of speech. The court stated that "It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine, whether they appear in publications, speeches or motion pictures."

'''''Brandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission''''' (HREOC) was a case before the [[High Court of Australia]] determining that the HREOC could not validly exercise [[judicial power]].&lt;ref name="Brandy HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1995|litigants=Brandy v Human Rights &amp; Equal Opportunity Commission |parallelcite=(1995) 183 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court maintained a firm position against attempts to confer judicial powers upon non-judicial bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/FedJSchol/2008/8.html |author=French, Justice Robert |author-link1=Robert French |title=Executive toys judges and non-judicial functions}} [2008] Federal Judicial Scholarship 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Up until 1992, Australia's [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]], in response to complaints of [[Racism|racial discrimination]] lodged in accordance with the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]] (Cth) (the RDA), was able to make determinations. These were voluntary, and in the event [[complainant]]s chose not to comply with them, there was no mechanism for enforcement. The only option available to complainants was to make an application to the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] to have the matter re-heard.

In 1988 [[Murray Wilcox|Wilcox J]] criticised this process, in his judgment in ''Maynard v Neilson'', as being costly and unnecessarily repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|168|1988|litigants=Maynard v Neilson |date=27 May 1988|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the [[Government of Australia|federal government]] to amend the RDA to rectify the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AIAdminLawF/1997/11.pdf |author=Nand, J |title=Judicial Power and Administrative Tribunals: The Decision in Brandy v HREOC}} [1997] Australian Institute of Administrative Law Forum 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|sdaolaa1992478|Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Act 1992}} and the {{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|lajlaa1993342|Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sections which these amendments introduced into Part III of the RDA allowed for determinations made by the HREOC to be registered with the Federal Court. These determinations, upon registration, would have the effect of being an order made by the Federal Court, unless a respondent applied for a review.

===Facts===

In the ''Brandy'' case, Harry Brandy and John Bell were both officers of the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC). Bell lodged a complaint against Brandy and ATSIC with the HREOC alleging contraventions to the RDA. The HREOC conducted an inquiry and handed down a determination that both Brandy and ATSIC were to pay compensation to Bell and to apologise to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HREOCA|25|1993|litigants=Bell v ATSIC, Gray &amp; Brandy |date=22 December 1993|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This determination was registered with the Federal Court, prompting Brandy to firstly seek a review and secondly to make an application to the High Court for the present case.

== Legal issue ==
The question came before the Full Court as a result of a case stated by [[Mary Gaudron|Gaudron J]], whether "In consequence of the amendments embodied in the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 and/or the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1993 as they affect the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 are any, and if so which, of the provisions of Part III of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 invalid?"&lt;ref name="Brandy HCA"/&gt;{{rp|p 248}}

== Judgment and outcome of the case ==
A unanimous decision was returned by the High Court through two judgments, one by [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Mason]] [[Chief Justice of Australia|CJ]], [[Gerard Brennan|Brennan]] and [[John Toohey (judge)|Toohey]] [[Justices|JJ]], the other by [[William Deane|Deane]], [[Daryl Dawson|Dawson]], Gaudron and [[Michael McHugh (judge)|McHugh]] JJ. The court found that sections 25ZAB, 25ZAC and 25ZAC of the RDA which had been implemented by the two prior mentioned amendments were invalid. Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ also declared section 25ZAA to be invalid. The other judges did not consider this issue.

This decision was formulated from the consideration of the definition of judicial power, the starting point of which was noted to be the judgment of [[Samuel Griffith|Griffith]] CJ in the case of ''[[Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead]]''.&lt;ref name="Huddart"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1909|litigants=[[Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.auau/cases/cth/HCA/1909/36.pdf (1909) 8 CLR 330]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This case encapsulated a definition of judicial power which included binding and authoritative decisions of controversies between subjects by Chapter III courts of the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Twomey 1995"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2FCJ820%22 |title=Trimming the tribunals: Brandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission |author=Twomey, A |work=Current Issues Brief No 40 1994/95 |publisher=Parliamentary Research Service |date=30 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key factor in the decision of the sections being deemed invalid was the enforceability of the determinations. Mason CJ, Brennan and Toohey JJ stated that "if it were not for the provisions providing the registration and enforcement of the Commission's determinations, it would be plain that the Commission does not exercise judicial power".&lt;ref name="Brandy HCA"/&gt;{{rp|p 269}} Thus, prior to the inclusion of the amendments, the HREOC was not exercising judicial power upon making determinations with regards to complaints of discrimination. By allowing determinations to be registered with the Federal Court to effectively become as an order from that court was to make the determinations enforceable. This was thought by the court to be an exercise of judicial power by a body which could not be vested with such power. This is because the HREOC was not a court in accordance with sections 71 and 72 of the Constitution and thus not a Chapter III court able of exercising judicial power.&lt;ref name="Twomey 1995"/&gt;

The case of Brandy is constitutionally significant firstly because its decision re-emphasises the limited number of bodies which are permitted to exercise judicial power. The decision of Brandy emphasised the fact that non-judicial tribunals and other administrative bodies which did not constitute a Chapter III court of the constitution could not exercise judicial power. This had a twofold effect in that it halted the creation of a number of non-judicial bodies which were to be empowered with such responsibilities, as well as pre-empting the creation of another Chapter III court to manage claims of this nature, which is today known as the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia]]. The decision did have drawbacks, as the problem of inefficiency and high costs, which prompted the creation of the amendment legislation for the RDA in the first place, is still apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UQLawJl/2012/13.html |author=Appleby, G |title=Imperfection and Inconvenience: Boilermakers' and the Separation of Judicial Power in Australia}} [2012] [[University of Queensland Law Journal]] 13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems justified as reallocating the courts power to determine such disputes and vesting it in a tribunal raises questions of fairness.

The final point of constitutional significance arising from the case of ''Brandy'' is the formulation of four guidelines in the Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ judgment which allow a court to determine whether or not judicial power is being exercised. The four points are:
#The determination of a controversy between parties
#Which is based upon existing facts and the application of law
#Resulting in the awarding of remedies
#Which constitute a binding and enforceable decision

These reiterate what are considered to be key characteristics (or ''indicia'') of judicial power. However, these are no necessarily exhaustive, but are definitely a good indicator of judicial power being exercised.

'''''Brown v. United States''''', 256 U.S. 335 (1921), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that if a person is attacked, and that person reasonably believes that he is in immediate danger of death or grievous bodily injury, he has no duty to retreat and may stand his ground and, if he kills his attacker, he has not exceeded the bounds of lawful self-defense.

== Background ==
Brown, the petitioner, and Hermes, the individual killed, had a previous history. Evidence indicated that Hermes assaulted Brown with a knife on two prior occasions and that Hermes threatened that the next time one of them would be taken away in a black box. Given this history, Brown took a handgun with him while supervising excavation work for a post office and put it nearby. Hermes arrived and, according to Brown, came at him with a knife. Brown retreated approximately twenty to twenty-five feet to where he left the pistol and, with Hermes striking at Brown, fired four shots, killing Hermes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUQd5rfm9SEC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=hermes+brown+supreme+court&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=thBSVxQMth&amp;sig=eQIYFskXtp8La5gcwscr8njKw04&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DLnnUf7aEIfI9QSEwoDYCw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hermes%20brown%20supreme%20court&amp;f=false |title=No Duty to Retreat : Violence and Values in American History and Society ... - Richard Maxwell Brown Beekman Professor of Northwest and Pacific History University of Oregon - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="justia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/256/335/case.html |title=Brown v.

A jury convicted Brown of second degree murder after being instructed by the court that, when considering self-defense, the individual assaulted has a duty to retreat as long as retreat is open to him and would not be dangerous to his person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qx8SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=brown+v+united+states+duty+to+retreat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nuvnUZSRA4TU8wTupIDADg&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=brown%20v%20united%20states%20duty%20to%20retreat&amp;f=false |title=United States Circuit Courts of Appeals Reports: With Key-number Annotations ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decision ==
On appeal, the Supreme Court disagreed and reversed the lower court’s conviction holding “that if a man reasonably believes that he is in immediate danger of death or grievous bodily harm from his assailant he may stand his ground and that if he kills him he has not exceed the bounds of lawful self-defense.” In writing the opinion, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes]] stated that “Detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife. Therefore, in this Court, at least, it is not a condition of immunity that one in that situation should pause to consider whether a reasonable man might not think it possible to fly with safety or to disable his assailant rather than to kill him.” &lt;ref name="justia1"/&gt;

In reviewing the lower court’s decision, Justice Holmes noted that there was evidence that Brown fired his last shot after Hermes went down. Brown testified in the lower court that this was an accidental discharge. The Court determined that a person need not lose a self-defense claim if a last shot followed closely to the others during the heat of conflict and if a person believed that he was fighting for his life.&lt;ref name="justia1"/&gt;

'''Cambia''' is an [[Australia]]n-based global [[non-profit]]  [[social enterprise]] focusing on [[open science]], [[biology]], innovation system reform and [[intellectual property]]. Its projects include the [[Patent Lens]], its successor [http://www.lens.org The Lens],  and the [[Biological Innovation for Open Society]] Initiative.

Cambia derives its name from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[verb]] ''cambiar'', to change.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cambiar&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cambia was established in 1992 by [[Richard Anthony Jefferson]], a leading molecular biologist responsible for the invention of the [[GUS reporter system]], with substantial early participation by Steven G Hughes, [https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kate-wilson/27/41a/275 Kate J. Wilson], Andrzej Kilian, Chris A. Fields and Sujata Lakhani.  Jefferson describes his vision to found a non-profit organisation in ''Innovations'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/itgg.2006.1.4.13|title=Science as Social Enterprise: The CAMBIA BiOS Initiative|journal=Innovations|date=Fall 2006|first=Richard|last=Jefferson|volume=1|issue=4|pages=13–44|id= |url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/bios/3067/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/INNOV0104_pp13-44_innovations-in-practice_jefferson.pdf|format=|accessdate=2010-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide more efficient and effective tools to solve the problems of agriculture and society.

In 1992, Cambia relocated to [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] from The Netherlands, to oversee and troubleshoot the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s [[rice]] biotechnology network in Asia. During this time, Jefferson, Wilson and the growing Cambia team visited hundreds of laboratories to help develop, improve, and apply biotechnology capabilities, particularly pertaining to rice. Cambia offered scientific courses and workshops, and increasing assistance in [[Intellectual Property]] management.   Cambia's ethic was influenced by Jefferson's early years in enabling technology invention and distribution, but greatly refined through increasing awareness of socially and scientifically complex systems and using new thinking about biological evolution (including the [[Hologenome theory of evolution|Hologenome Theory of Evolution]]) as models for institution building and collaboration.

Cambia became one of the first social enterprises to use a hybrid licensing model to fund its public good activities.  By selectively patenting important technologies, then creating tiered licensing models for their use, Cambia was able to ensure all parties fair access, but larger licensees would be required to pay more for their non-exclusive use, thus subsidising new developments and distribution and support to less wealthy users, including small enterprises and the public sector in the developing world.  This model - developed also by the social entrepreneur [[David Green (social entrepreneur)|David Green]] for universal access to eye care - is now becoming a pillar of social enterprise function.

Over time Cambia's focus moved away from biotechnology and towards innovation systems and Intellectual Property.   The Patent Lens and its successor The Lens are now the primary focus of Cambia. Cambia's goal has always been to enable and democratise innovation and their move towards free and open tools that help people understand intellectual property landscapes is a continuation of those values. In this way they have changed from a wet-science research institute into a strategic system-changing social enterprise.

==Projects==
Cambia's work to freely distribute scientific tools and techniques gave rise to the [[Biological Innovation for Open Society|Biological Open Source (BiOS)]] Initiative in 2005. Through an open-source biotechnology license and [[Material Transfer Agreement]] (MTA) developed in 2005-2007, BiOS sought to establish [[freedom to operate]] for innovators by providing and exemplifying legal instruments by which innovators could collaboratively use intellectual property protection as a means to share and jointly improve technology for wider utility. BiOS was built on the back of Jefferson's invention of the GUS-based reporter system and the creation of TransBacter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentlens.net/daisy/bioforge_transbacter/3187.html |title=TransBacter Project |accessdate=2010-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a work-around for the creation of transgenic plants bypassing the highly patented [[Agrobacterium]] genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gene transfer to plants by diverse species of bacteria|journal=Nature|date=2005-02-10|first=Wim|last=Broothaerts|author2=Heidi J. Mitchell |author3=Brian Weir |author4=Sarah Kaines |author5=Leon M.A. Smith |author6=Wei Jang |author7=Jorge E. Mayer |author8=Carolina Roa-Rodriguez |author9=Richard A. Jefferson  |pmid=15703747|volume=433|issue=7026|pages=629–633|doi= 10.1038/nature03309|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7026/full/nature03309.html|accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Cambia's projects was the development in 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Jaccoud D, Peng K, Feinstein D, Kilian A (February 2001). "Diversity arrays: a solid state technology for sequence information independent genotyping". Nucleic Acids Res. 29 (4): E25. {{doi|10.1093/nar/29.4.e25}}. {{PMC|29632}}. {{PMID|11160945}}&lt;/ref&gt; by then Chief Scientist Andrzej Kilian of [[Diversity Arrays Technology]], a solid state sequence agnostic genotyping technology that was spun off into a company, DArT, Pty Ltd to perform agricultural genotyping services to the plant breeding community.

A principal current project of Cambia is the free full-text online patent search and exploration facility and knowledge resource, The Lens (previously the Patent Lens). Launched in 2000 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation as a US agricultural patent search facility, and substantially expanded in 2005-2007 to encompass patent documents from multiple jurisdictions and all domains, and information on the linkages between patent applications and the status of granted patents, the Patent Lens allowed free searching of almost 10 million full-text patent documents.  It was distinguished as being the only not-for-profit facility of its kind, with international coverage and integrated links to non-patent literature. The Lens was launched in 2013 as the successor to the [[Patent Lens]], making strides in the visual presentation of patent analysis and workspace management; it is the only global patent site with fully open, shareable, annotatable and re-usable data collections.

It also features an open [[biological patent]] facility, PatSeq, led by Professor [[Osmat Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;Osmat A Jefferson, Deniz Köllhofer, Thomas H Ehrich &amp; Richard A Jefferson, Transparency tools in gene patenting for informing policy and practice.  Nature Biotechnology 31, 1086–1093 (2013) {{doi|10.1038/nbt.2755}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with many advanced tools for searching and analysing biological sequences found in patents, to render gene patenting more transparent.  The facility has mapped sequences disclosed in gene patents onto the genomes of humans, mice, maize, rice, soybean and others.

==Governance==
Cambia is [[social enterprise]], and is a registered [[NGO|Non-Governmental Organisation]] with the [[Food and Agriculture Organization| Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] and a registered observer with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]. Within Australia, Cambia is registered with the [[Australian Securities and Investment Commission]] (ASIC) as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee.

Cambia’s governance is overseen by a Board of Directors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/4759.html |title=Cambia Board of Directors |accessdate=2010-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to its constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/about/592/1809.html |title=Constitution of Cambia - A Company Limited by Guarantee |accessdate=2010-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
As of July 2012, Cambia now operates principally from headquarters in Canberra, ACT at the [[NICTA]] (National ICT Australia) facility, with some staff based in [[Brisbane]], Australia, at the [[Queensland University of Technology]]. Before its move to Brisbane in 2008, where it operated for four years, Cambia was located on the [[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]] research campus of the [[CSIRO]]. Its glasshouse facilities were housed at the [[Australian National University]] campus.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Chad]] on 10 December 1989. The new constitution made the country a [[one-party state]] with the [[National Union for Independence and Revolution]] as the sole legal party, as well as confirming [[Hissène Habré]], who had come to power in a 1982 coup, as president. It also provided for a presidential republic with a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Chad|National Assembly]]. It was passed by 99.9% of voters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/td.html Elections in Chad] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; with a turnout of 93%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eisa.org.za/wep/chaoneparty.htm Chad: Authoritarian regimes, elections and coups (1962-1996)] EISA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M &amp; Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p231 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9360">A '''child access prevention law''' (often abbreviated '''CAP law'''; also sometimes called a '''safe storage law''') makes it illegal for an adult to keep a [[gun]] in a place and manner so that a child can easily access and fire it. Proponents of these laws, such as the [[Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence]], argue that they are effective at reducing accidental gun deaths among children. The [[National Rifle Association]] has lobbied against such laws, arguing that they are ineffective and infringe on the rights of gun owners to protect their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-weisser/child-access-prevention-laws_b_6546772.html | title=Want to Learn About Gun Safety?

==State laws==
As of 2013, 27 states in the United States, as well as the [[District of Columbia]], had enacted a CAP law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://smartgunlaws.org/child-access-prevention-policy-summary/ | title=Child Access Prevention Policy Summary | work=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence | accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[California]] governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed the Firearm Safe and Responsible Access Act, one of the strictest CAP laws in the United States, into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/10/15/firearm_safe_and_responsible_access_act_california_s_strict_new_access_prevention.html | title=California’s Strict New Access Prevention Law Won’t Do Much to Stop Child Shooting Deaths | work=Slate | date=15 October 2013 | accessdate=20 March 2016 | author=Peters, Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
A 1997 study found that CAP laws were associated with a 23% decrease in accidental shooting deaths among children younger than 15 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cummings|first1=P|last2=Grossman|first2=DC|last3=Rivara|first3=FP|last4=Koepsell|first4=TD|title=State gun safe storage laws and child mortality due to firearms.|journal=JAMA|date=1 October 1997|volume=278|issue=13|pages=1084–6|pmid=9315767|doi=10.1001/jama.1997.03550130058037}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 study found that [[Florida]]'s CAP law appeared to have "significantly reduced unintentional firearm deaths to children," but that the similar laws that existed in 14 other states did not seem to have such an effect. At the time, only three states in the U.S., including Florida, allowed those who violated their state's CAP law to be prosecuted on felony charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=DW|last2=Starnes|first2=M|title=Reexamining the association between child access prevention gun laws and unintentional shooting deaths of children.|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 2000|volume=106|issue=6|pages=1466–9|pmid=11099605|doi=10.1542/peds.106.6.1466}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study found that CAP laws were associated with a "modest reduction in suicide rates among youth aged 14 to 17 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Daniel W.|title=Association Between Youth-Focused Firearm Laws and Youth Suicides|journal=JAMA|date=4 August 2004|volume=292|issue=5|pages=594–601|doi=10.1001/jama.292.5.594|pmid=15292085}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study found that states with CAP laws experienced faster declines in accidental child firearm deaths than states without such laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hepburn|first1=Lisa|last2=Azrael|first2=Deborah|last3=Miller|first3=Matthew|last4=Hemenway|first4=David|title=The Effect of Child Access Prevention Laws on Unintentional Child Firearm Fatalities, 1979-2000|journal=The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and Critical Care|date=August 2006|volume=61|issue=2|pages=423–428|doi=10.1097/01.ta.0000226396.51850.fc}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study found that these laws have no significant impact on unintentional gun deaths, but that states with such laws had lower rates of youth suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gius|first1=Mark|title=The impact of minimum age and child access prevention laws on firearm-related youth suicides and unintentional deaths|journal=The Social Science Journal|date=June 2015|volume=52|issue=2|pages=168–175|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2015.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have also found that CAP laws are associated with lower rates of nonfatal gun injuries among children under the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeSimone|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Markowitz|first2=Sara|last3=Xu|first3=Jing|title=Child Access Prevention Laws and Nonfatal Gun Injuries|journal=Southern Economic Journal|date=July 2013|volume=80|issue=1|pages=5–25|doi=10.4284/0038-4038-2011.333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonetti|first1=Joseph A.|last2=Rowhani-Rahbar|first2=Ali|last3=Mills|first3=Brianna|last4=Young|first4=Bessie|last5=Rivara|first5=Frederick P.|title=State Firearm Legislation and Nonfatal Firearm Injuries|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2015|volume=105|issue=8|pages=1703–1709|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302617|pmid=26066935|pmc=4504301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey published by [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] estimated that 54% of gun owners in the United States had unsafe storage of guns. Additionally, [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] has estimated that some 380,000 guns are stolen annually from gun owners in the United States. In a separate study, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] estimated that 18,394 guns were lost of stolen by licensed gun retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21739193-washington-dithers-and-argues-some-states-show-way-what-works-reduce-gun-deaths|title=What works to reduce gun deaths|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAP laws, along with other strict firearm laws, are also associated with lower rates of unsafe gun storage among parents of preschool-age children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prickett|first1=KC|last2=Martin-Storey|first2=A|last3=Crosnoe|first3=R|title=State firearm laws, firearm ownership, and safety practices among families of preschool-aged children.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=June 2014|volume=104|issue=6|pages=1080–6|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2014.301928|pmid=24825210|pmc=4061995}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are not always applied whenever they could be, and sometimes minors are charged instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faulkenberry|first1=JG|last2=Schaechter|first2=J|title=Reporting on pediatric unintentional firearm injury--who's responsible.|journal=The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery|date=September 2015|volume=79|issue=3 Suppl 1|pages=S2-8|pmid=26308117|doi=10.1097/ta.0000000000000676}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that CAP laws were associated with a 19 percent reduction in juvenile firearm-related homicides (while having no association with firearm-related homicides committed by adults or with non-firearm-related homicides committed by juveniles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Anderson, D.|last2=J|first2=Sabia, Joseph|last3=Erdal|first3=Tekin,|date=2018-11-01|title=Child Access Prevention Laws and Juvenile Firearm-Related Homicides|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w25209|journal=NBER|volume=|pages=|doi=10.3386/w25209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a 2016 study found that these CAP laws were ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalesan|first1=Bindu|last2=Mobily|first2=Matthew E|last3=Keiser|first3=Olivia|last4=Fagan|first4=Jeffrey A|last5=Galea|first5=Sandro|title=Firearm legislation and firearm mortality in the USA: a cross-sectional, state-level study|journal=The Lancet|date=March 2016|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01026-0|volume=387|pages=1847–1855|pmid=26972843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marion Hammer]], the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) lobbyist who promoted the [[stand-your-ground]] law, created the [[Eddie Eagle|Eddie Eagle GunSafe]] program in the late 1980s as a "superior alternative to negligent storage legislation, or laws meant to punish adults when children shoot themselves or someone else with an unsecured gun."&lt;ref name="Trace_nra_safe_storage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thetrace.org/2016/10/eddie-eagle-nra-safe-storage/ |title=Academic Who Helped Design the NRA’s Child Gun Safety Program Says the Group Is Misusing It |quote="Lisa Monroe says Eddie Eagle was never intended to be a substitute for safe storage laws."|first=Mike |last=Spies |date=13 October 2016 |access-date=20 February 2018 |publisher=[[The Trace (website)|The Trace]]|series=The Gunfighters}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, according to the NRA, who "promotes the program to elementary schools around the country, and pushes state legislatures to pass laws that require schools to adopt the lesson", 28 million children had been gone through the Eddie Eagle program. In 2016, a NRA lobbyist testified against a safe storage bill in Tennessee, saying that the Eddie Eagle program was the best way "to reduce firearm-related accidents" regarding children.&lt;ref name="Trace_nra_safe_storage"/&gt;

[[Image:Lonja de Valencia1.jpg|right|thumb|The Llotja de la Seda, seat of the Consulate of the Sea in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] since 1498.]]
The '''Consulate of the Sea''' ({{lang-ca|Consolat de mar}}; {{IPA-ca|kunsuˈlad də ˈmaɾ|pron}}) was a quasi-judicial body set up in the [[Crown of Aragon]], later to spread throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean basin]], to administer [[Admiralty law|maritime]] and [[commercial law]]. The term may also refer to a celebrated collection of maritime customs and ordinances in [[Catalan language]], also known in English as ''The Customs of the Sea'', compiled over the 14th and 15th centuries and published at [[Valencia]] in or before 1494.

In the 21st century, the Catalan term ''Consolat de mar'' is today used for a commercial [[arbitration]] service operated by the Barcelona [[Chamber of Commerce]], and also for a series of trade-promotion offices operated by the city of Barcelona.

==Medieval institution==
[[Image:Imperio de Aragón.png|right|thumb|193px|The greatest extent of the territories controlled by the [[Crown of Aragon]], c. 1350]]
The Catalan institution can be traced to the grant of the ''Carta Consular'' to the city of Barcelona by [[James I of Aragon]] in 1258.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 21, [http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/documents/barcelona1258.html Barcelona Maritime Code of 1258].&lt;/ref&gt; This gave Barcelona merchants the right to settle their commercial disputes without interference from the royal courts: in return, the king received much needed financial support for his wars of expansion. [[Mercantile Law]] (''ius mercadorium'') was becoming established at the same time through much of Europe, and similar bodies had already been established in [[Messina]] (first third of the 13th century) and [[Genoa]] (1250).&lt;ref name="Moliné"&gt;Moliné y Brasés (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the territories of the [[Crown of Aragon]] expanded, it was customary to establish new Consulates of the Sea in the major ports. One of the earliest was in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] (1283), where the charter of [[Peter III of Aragon]] makes it clear that disputes are to be settled "according to maritime customs, as these are accepted in Barcelona."

==''Book of the Consulate of the Sea''==
[[Image:Llibre del Consolat de Mar 1814.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The title page of the 1914 edition of the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'', edited by Ernest Moliné y Brasés.]]
{{Main|Book of the Consulate of the Sea}}
The full title in Catalan is ''Les costums marítimes de Barcelona universalment conegudes per Llibre del Consolat de mar'', or "''The maritime customs of Barcelona universally known as the Book of the Consulate of the Sea''". The earliest extant printed edition of the work (Barcelona, 1494) is without a title-page or frontispiece, but it is described by the above-mentioned title in the epistle dedicatory prefixed to the table of contents. The only known copy of this edition (as of 1911) is preserved in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name ="EB11"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jados"&gt;Jados (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; The epistle dedicatory states that the work is an amended version of the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'', compiled by [[Francis Celelles]] with the assistance of numerous [[shipmaster]]s and [[merchant]]s well versed in maritime affairs.

According to a statement made by [[Antonio de Capmany y Montpalau|Capmany]] in his ''Codigo de los costumbras maritimas de Barcelona'', published at [[Madrid]] in 1791, there was extant to his knowledge an older edition, printed in semi-Gothic characters, which he believed to be of a date prior to 1484.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;

There are, however, two Catalan manuscripts preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the earliest of which, being ''MS. Espagnol 124'', contains the two first treatises which are printed in the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' of 1494, and which are the most ancient portion of its contents, written in a hand of the 14th century, on paper of that century. The subsequent parts of this manuscript are on paper of the 15th century, but there is no document of a date more recent than 1436. The later of the two manuscripts, being ''MS. Espagnol 56'', is written throughout on paper of the 15th century, and in a hand of that century, and it purports, from a certificate on the face of the last leaf, to have been executed under the superintendence of [[Peter Thomas (notary)|Peter Thomas]], a [[notary public]], and the scribe of the Consulate of the Sea at Barcelona.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;

The edition of 1494 contains, in the first place, a code of procedure issued by the kings of [[Aragon]] for the guidance of the courts of the consuls of the sea, in the second place, a collection of ancient customs of the sea, and thirdly, a body of rules for the government of cruisers of war. A [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] at the end of these ordinances informs the reader that the book commonly called the ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'' ends here; after which there follows a document known by the title of ''The Acceptations'', which purports to record that the previous chapters and ordinances had been approved by the "Roman" people in 1075, and by various princes and peoples in the 12th and 13th centuries: this is generally regarded as of no historical value.&lt;ref name="Moliné" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt; The paging of the edition of 1494 ceases with this document, at the end of which is the printer's colophon, reciting that the work was completed on 14 July 1494, at Barcelona, by Pere Posa, priest and printer.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;

The remainder of the volume consists of what may be regarded as an appendix to the original ''Book of the Consulate''. This appendix contains various maritime ordinances of the kings of Aragon and of the councillors of the city of Barcelona, ranging over a period from 1271 to 1493. It is printed apparently in the same type with the preceding part of the volume. The original ''Book of the Consulate of the Sea'', coupled with this appendix, circulated in Europe under the title, ''The Consulate of the Sea'', and in the 16th century was translated into the Castilian, the Italian, and the French languages. The Italian translation, printed at Venice c.&amp;nbsp;1549 by [[Jean Baptista Pedrezano]], was the version that obtained the largest circulation in the north of Europe, and led many jurists to suppose the work to have been of Italian origin. In the next century, the work was translated into Dutch by Westerven, and into German by Engelbrecht, and it is also said to have been translated into [[Latin language|Latin]]. An excellent translation into French of ''The Customs of the Sea'', which are the most valuable portion of the ''Book of the Consulate'', was published by [[Jean Marie Pardessus|Pardessus]] in the second volume of his ''Collection des lois maritimes'' (Paris, 1834), under the title of ''La Compilation connue sous le nom do consulat de la mer''. See introduction, by [[Travers Twiss|Sir Travers Twiss]], to the ''[[Black Book of the Admiralty]]'' (London, 1874), which in the appendix to vol.&amp;nbsp;iii, contains his translation of ''The Customs of the Sea'', with the Catalan text.&lt;ref name="EB11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3284">'''Contempt towards officials''' is addressed in the Punitive articles, specifically Article 88 of the U.S. [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] in the [[Manual for Courts-Martial]] (MCM), United States (2008 Edition) as follows:

{{cquote|Any commissioned officer who uses [[contempt]]uous words against the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the Secretary of a military department, the [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]], or the [[Governor (United States)|Governor]] or legislature of any [[U.S. state|State]], [[Territories of the United States|Territory]], [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]], or possession in which he is on duty or present shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.|cquote}}

==Elements==
#That the accused was a [[commissioned officer]] of the [[United States armed forces]]; 
#That the accused used certain words against an official or legislature named in the article; 
#That by an act of the accused these words came to the knowledge of a person other than the accused; and 
#That the words used were contemptuous, either in themselves or by virtue of the circumstances under which they were used.&lt;br&gt; (Note: If the words were against a Governor or legislature, add the following element:)
#That the accused was then present in the State, Territory, Commonwealth, or possession of the Governor or legislature concerned.

==Explanation==
The official or legislature against whom the words are used must be occupying one of the offices or be one of the legislatures named in Article 88 at the time of the offense. Neither "Congress" nor "legislature" includes its members individually. "Governor" does not include "lieutenant governor." It is immaterial whether the words are used against the official in an official or private capacity. If not personally contemptuous, adverse [[criticism]] of one of the officials or legislatures named in the article in the course of a political discussion, even though emphatically expressed, may not be charged as a violation of the article.

Similarly, expressions of opinion made in a purely private conversation should not ordinarily be charged. Giving broad circulation to a written publication containing contemptuous words of the kind made punishable by this article, or the utterance of contemptuous words of this kind in the presence of military subordinates, aggravates the offense. Unlike civilian legislation covering [[United States defamation law|defamation]], the truth or falsity of the statements is immaterial.

==Lesser included offense==
Article 80—attempts

==Maximum punishment==
Dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and [[Military prison#Military jail|confinement]] for 1 year.

A '''Decree of the President of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-ru|Указ Президента Российской Федерации}}; ''Ukaz Prezidenta Rossiyskoy Federatsii'') or '''Executive Order (Decree) of the President of Russia'''&lt;ref&gt;The English term "Executive Order" is also used by official website as equivalent of Russian ''ukaz''. See [http://kremlin.ru/acts/17275 in Russian] or [http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/4833 in English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example: http://eng.kremlin.ru/acts/5331&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal act (''[[ukase]]'') with the status of a by-law made by the [[Russian president]].

As normative legal acts, such ''ukazes'' have the status of [[by-law]]s in the hierarchy of legal acts (along with [[Order of the Government of Russia|Decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation]] and instructions and directions of other officials). Presidential decrees may not alter existing laws of higher precedence  - [[:Category:Treaties of Russia|Russia's international agreements]], the [[Constitution of Russia]], [[Federal Constitutional Law (Russia)|Federal Constitutional Law]]s, [[Federal Law]]s and [[laws of Russian regions]] - and may be superseded by any of these laws. For example, because of Article 15 of the Constitution of Russia, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], as an international document, has higher status than any Russian law or presidential executive order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.constitution.kremlin.ru/#article-15-4 "Universally recognized principles and norms of international law as well as international agreements of the Russian Federation should be an integral part of its legal system. If an international agreement of the Russian Federation establishes rules, which differ from those stipulated by law, ''then the rules of the international agreement shall be applied''."]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digitale Gesellschaft''' (literally, ''Digital Society'') is a German [[Eingetragener Verein|registered association]] founded in 2010, that is committed to civil rights and consumer protection in terms of internet policy.

==History==
The founding members of the association are {{Interlanguage link multi|Markus Beckedahl|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Andreas Gebhard|de}}, [[Falk Steiner]], [[Matthias Mehldau]], [[Andre Meister]], [[Markus Reuter]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Benjamin von der Ahe|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Rüdiger Weis|de}}, and [[John Weitzmann]].

[[Benjamin Bergemann]] is a spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU failed to protect citizens from NSA|url=http://www.dw.de/eu-failed-to-protect-citizens-from-nsa/a-16872631|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the aims of the interest group is to build a campaign infrastructure, and also to reach people who are not internet-savvy. Their founder, Beckedahl stated that "more effective advocacy toward politics and economy" is also a part of their mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/interviewdigitalegesellschaft100.html|title=Neue Internet-Interessensvertretung gegründet|date=15 April 2011|work=tagesschau.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2012, the group has approximately thirty members. According to Beckedahl, the small number of full members is necessary to build an infrastructure before opening up to more people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rhein-zeitung.de/nachrichten/computer/computernews_artikel,-Netzpolitik-Lobby-Beckedahl-will-etwas-Greenpeace-und-keinen-Internet-ADAC-_arid,234073_arpage,3.html#articletop&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
[[File:DigiGes PRISM02.jpg|thumb|Digitale Gesellschaft protesting against [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]]]

The group has worked on topics such as [[ACTA]], [[Open government]], [[open data]], [[information privacy]], [[telecommunications data retention]], [[copyright]], and [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/digitale-gesellschaft-beckedahl-plant-organisation-fuer-buergerrechte-im-web-a-756092.html|title="Digitale Gesellschaft": Beckedahl plant Organisation für Bürgerrechte im Web|author=Von Hilmar Schmundt|work=Der Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, they led [[PRISM (surveillance program)#Europe|a demonstration]] at [[Checkpoint Charlie]], during [[Barack Obama]]'s visit, against the NSA surveillance program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/yes-we-scan-germans-protest-at-checkpoint-charlie-as-obama-arrives-in-berlin/277008/|title='Yes We Scan': Germans Protest at Checkpoint Charlie as Obama Arrives in Berlin|work=The Atlantic|author=Olga Khazan|date=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
In the law of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], an '''implied assertion''' is a statement or conduct that implies a side issue surrounding certain admissible facts which have not necessarily been complied with the rules of relevance. There is varying opinion of whether [[hearsay evidence]] of implied assertions should be admissible in court to prove the issue within contents. While they are considered hearsay, they are generally considered to some extent unreliable than regular statements which are less easy to be fabricated.

In &lt;u&gt;R v Sukadeve Singh [2006] EWCA Crim. 660, [2006] 2 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr.App.R]] 12&lt;/u&gt;, Rose LJ giving the judgment of the court said this at paragraph 14: 
:"When [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Criminal+Justice+Act+2003&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=902928&amp;ActiveTextDocId=903072&amp;filesize=3676  section 114] and  [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Criminal+Justice+Act+2003&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=902928&amp;ActiveTextDocId=903077&amp;filesize=6948 section 118] of the Criminal Justice Act 2003  are read together they, in our judgment, abolish the common law hearsay rules (save those which are expressly preserved) and create instead a new rule against hearsay which does not extend to implied assertions. What was said by the callers in &lt;u&gt;Kearley&lt;/u&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;R v Kearley (1992) 2 AC 228]&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;   would now be admissible as direct evidence of the fact that there was a ready market for the supply of drugs from the premises, from which could be inferred an intention by an occupier to supply drugs. The view of the majority in &lt;u&gt;Kearley&lt;/u&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;R v Kearley (1992) 2 AC 228]&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to hearsay, has been set aside by the Act."

In &lt;u&gt;Sukadeve  Singh&lt;/u&gt; various telephone entries were held not to be a matter stated within [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Criminal+Justice+Act+2003&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=902928&amp;ActiveTextDocId=903073&amp;filesize=1402 section 115] but to be implied assertions which were admissible because they were no longer hearsay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Definition_of_hearsay_evidence  WikiCrimeLine: Definition of hearsay evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Opium Commission''' was a meeting convened in 1909 in [[Shanghai]] that represented one of the first steps toward international [[prohibition (drugs)|drug prohibition]]. Dr. [[Hamilton Wright]] and Episcopal Bishop [[Charles Henry Brent]] headed the U.S. delegation. According to Release, "The formal designation of the meeting as 'commission' reflects the fact that the United States had been unsuccessful in its attempts to convene a 'conference': this latter status would have conferred upon the meeting the power to draft regulations to which signatory states would be bound by international law"[http://www.release.org.uk/html/~The_Law/~Legal_History/1900_to_1939.php]. The Commission was only authorized to make recommendations.

The meeting united the attending nations behind the cause of [[opium]] prohibition, leading to the 1912 [[International Opium Convention]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2100">The '''Jade Treaty''' ({{lang-de|Jade-Vertrag}}) of 20 July 1853 between [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg]] provided for the handover of 340 hectares of Oldenburg territory at what is now [[Wilhelmshaven]], [[Germany]], on the western shore of the [[Jade Bight]], a bay of the [[North Sea]] west of [[Bremerhaven]].  It was considered the best natural deep-water port in the German North Sea coast, and a good place for the naval base Prussia wished to build. The navy base built there became the nucleus of today's Wilhelmshaven.&lt;ref name="Jade"&gt;[[Die Welt]]: [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article247453/Preussens_Geheimnis.html „Preußens Geheimnis“], 19 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Wilhelmshaven Wattgebiet bei Mariensiel.JPG|thumb|The Jade Bight held the potential of a fine deep water port.]] 

Since before 1848 Prince [[Adalbert of Prussia]] had worked to build a Prussian navy.  During the [[First Schleswig War]] of 1848-51, Prussia had virtually no navy. Within a few days the [[Danish navy]] had destroyed German maritime commerce in the North Sea and the [[Baltic Sea]]. By 1852 Prussia had started to expand its fleet and needed a good port on the North Sea, something they had not had since the [[Congress of Vienna]].[[Image:Jade-weser-muendung map de.png|thumb|left|The Wilhelmshaven and Jade Bight area as developed today.]] The Jade Bight area offered deep water, a good anchorage and no ice in winter.&lt;ref name="Jade" /&gt; Oldenburg welcomed the idea of  Prussia as a powerful ally. Also, they needed money to end the Bentinck succession dispute. From 1854 onward Prussia established the fortress, naval base and city of Wilhelmshaven, which would be useful in the [[Second Schleswig War]] of 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Taddey (ed.): ''Lexikon der deutschen Geschichte'', {{ISBN|3-520-81303-3}}, S. 596&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Money laundering''' is the act of concealing the transformation of profits from illegal activities and [[corruption]] into ostensibly "legitimate" assets.&lt;ref name="Duhaimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime|first= Christine |title=What is Laundering? Duhaime's Financial Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Law |url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/what-is-money-laundering |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies. Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion. Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering. After money has been suitably laundered or "cleaned", it can be used in the mainstream economy for accumulation of wealth, such as by acquisitions of properties or legitimate businesses, or simply spent. Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities, and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors.
In a number of legal and regulatory systems, the term "money laundering" has become [[Conflation|conflated]] with other forms of [[financial crime|financial]] and [[White-collar crime|business crime]], and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, [[digital currency|digital currencies]], credit cards, and traditional currency), including [[terrorism financing]] and evasion of [[international sanctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2765010|title=Financial Weapons of War, ''Minnesota Law Review'' (2016)|website=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with ''source'' of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with ''destination'' of funds) when regulating the financial system.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the Anti-Money Laundering &amp; Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Australia), the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (New Zealand), and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance (Cap 615) (Hong Kong. See also (for example) guidance on [http://www.imf.org/external/np/leg/amlcft/eng/ IMF] and [http://www.fatf-gafi.org/topics/financialinclusion/documents/fatfguidanceonanti-moneylaunderingandterroristfinancingmeasuresandfinancialinclusion.html FATF] websites similarly conflating the concepts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering, whether it is  intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations. Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that ''would have been'' a crime in that country, even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gettingthedealthrough.com/area/50/anti-money-laundering/|title=Anti-Money Laundering – Getting The Deal Through – GTDT|website=Getting The Deal Through|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Laws against money laundering were created to use against organized crime during the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]] during the 1930s. [[Organized crime]] received a major boost from Prohibition and a large source of new funds that were obtained from illegal sales of alcohol. The successful prosecution of [[Al Capone]] on [[tax evasion]] brought in a new emphasis by the state and law enforcement agencies to track and confiscate money, but existing laws against tax evasion could not be used once gangsters started paying their taxes.

In the 1980s, the [[war on drugs]] led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize proceeds of [[Drug-related crime|drug crimes]] in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, money can be confiscated and it is up to the individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate if they want the funds back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower [[burden of proof (law)|burdens of proof]].

The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, which led to the [[Patriot Act]] in the U.S. and similar legislation worldwide, led to a new emphasis on money laundering laws to combat [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countermoneylaundering.com/public/content/brief-history-money-laundering |title=A brief history of money laundering |author=Nigel Morris-Cotterill |date=1999 |access-date=17 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224181114/http://www.countermoneylaundering.com/public/content/brief-history-money-laundering |archive-date=24 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Group of Seven (G7)]] nations used the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] to put pressure on governments around the world to increase surveillance and monitoring of financial transactions and share this information between countries. Starting in 2002, governments around the world upgraded money laundering laws and surveillance and monitoring systems of financial transactions. Anti money laundering regulations have become a much larger burden for [[financial institution]]s and enforcement has stepped up significantly. During 2011–2015 a number of major banks faced ever-increasing fines for breaches of money laundering regulations. This included [[HSBC]], which was fined $1.9 billion in December 2012, and [[BNP Paribas]], which was fined $8.9 billion in July 2014 by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="nytimes bnp admits guilt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/bnp-paribas-pleads-guilty-in-sanctions-case/ | title=BNP Paribas Admits Guilt and Agrees to Pay $8.9 Billion Fine to U.S. | work=The New York Times | date=30 June 2014 | accessdate=1 July 2014 |author1=Protess, Ben  |author2=Jessica Silver-Greenberg |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries introduced or strengthened border controls on the amount of cash that can be carried and introduced central transaction reporting systems where all financial institutions have to report all financial transactions electronically. For example, in 2006, Australia set up the [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|AUSTRAC]] system and required the reporting of all financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/ar-14-15-austrac-at-a-glance|title=AUSTRAC at a glance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=AUSTRAC|accessdate=18 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828034700/http://austrac.gov.au/ar-14-15-austrac-at-a-glance|archive-date=28 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:Money-laundering.svg|thumb|Placing "dirty" money in a service company, where it is layered with legitimate income and then integrated into the flow of money, is a common form of money laundering.]] The conversion or transfer of property, the concealment or disguising of the nature of the proceeds, the acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing that these are derived from criminal activity and participate or assist the movement of funds to make the proceeds appear legitimate is money laundering.

Money obtained from certain crimes, such as [[extortion]], [[insider trading]], [[drug trafficking]], and [[illegal gambling]] is "dirty" and needs to be "cleaned" to appear to have been derived from legal activities, so that banks and other financial institutions will deal with it without suspicion. Money can be laundered by many methods which vary in complexity and sophistication.

Money laundering involves three steps: The first involves introducing cash into the financial system by some means ("placement"); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source of the cash ("layering"); and finally, acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds ("integration"). Some of these steps may be omitted, depending upon the circumstances. For example, non-cash proceeds that are already in the financial system would not need to be placed.&lt;ref name="chasing dirty money"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reuter |first=Peter |title=Chasing Dirty Money |year=2004 |publisher=Peterson |isbn=978-0-88132-370-2 |url=http://bookstore.piie.com/book-store//381.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Treasury Department]]:
{{quote|sign=|source=|Money laundering is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds (i.e., "dirty money") appear legal (i.e., "clean"). Typically, it involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration. First, the illegitimate funds are furtively introduced into the legitimate financial system. Then, the money is moved around to create confusion, sometimes by wiring or transferring through numerous accounts. Finally, it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions until the "dirty money" appears "clean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fincen.gov/history-anti-money-laundering-laws|title= History of Anti-Money Laundering Laws|date=30 June 2015|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Methods==
Money laundering can take several forms, although most methods can be categorized into one of a few types. These include "bank methods, smurfing [also known as structuring], currency exchanges, and double-invoicing".&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Lawrence M. Salinger, ''Encyclopedia of white-collar &amp; corporate crime: A – I, Volume 1'', page 78, {{ISBN|0-7619-3004-3}}, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Structuring]]: Often known as ''[[Smurfing (financial crime)|smurfing]]'', this is a method of placement whereby cash is broken into smaller deposits of money, used to defeat suspicion of money laundering and to avoid anti-money laundering reporting requirements. A sub-component of this is to use smaller amounts of cash to purchase bearer instruments, such as money orders, and then ultimately deposit those, again in small amounts.&lt;ref name=NDIC&gt;{{cite web |last=National Drug Intelligence Center |title=National Drug Threat Assessment |url=http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs44/44849/44849p.pdf |accessdate=20 September 2011 |page=40 |date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bulk cash smuggling: This involves physically smuggling cash to another jurisdiction and depositing it in a financial institution, such as an [[offshore bank]], with greater [[bank secrecy]] or less rigorous money laundering enforcement.&lt;ref name="National Money Laundering Threat Assessment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/pressrel/011106.pdf |title=National Money Laundering Threat Assessment |accessdate=3 March 2011 |date=December 2005 |page=33 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017094839/http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/pressrel/011106.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cash-intensive businesses: In this method, a business typically expected to receive a large proportion of its revenue as cash uses its accounts to deposit criminally derived cash. Such enterprises often operate openly and in doing so generate cash revenue from incidental legitimate business in addition to the illicit cash – in such cases the business will usually claim all cash received as legitimate earnings. Service businesses are best suited to this method, as such enterprises have little or no  [[variable cost]]s and/or a large ratio between revenue and variable costs, which makes it difficult to detect discrepancies between revenues and costs. Examples are parking structures,  [[strip club]]s, [[tanning salon]]s,  [[car wash]]es, [[amusement arcade|arcade]]s, [[bar]]s, restaurants, and casinos.
* Trade-based laundering: This involves under- or over-valuing [[invoice]]s to disguise the movement of money.&lt;ref name="Achilles Heel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Capitalism's Achilles Heel |author=Baker, Raymond |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the art market has been accused of being an ideal vehicle for money laundering due to several unique aspects of art such as the subjective value of artworks as well as the secrecy of auction houses about the identity of the buyer and seller.&lt;ref name="Has the Art Market Become an Unwitting Partner in Crime?"&gt;{{cite web |last=Has the Art Market Become an Unwitting Partner in Crime? |title=Has the Art Market Become an Unwitting Partner in Crime? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/arts/design/has-the-art-market-become-an-unwitting-partner-in-crime.html |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shell companies and trusts: Trusts and shell companies disguise the true owners of money. Trusts and corporate vehicles, depending on the jurisdiction, need not disclose their true owner.  Sometimes referred to by the slang term ''rathole'', though that term usually refers to a person acting as the fictitious owner rather than the business entity.&lt;ref name="FATF threat assessment"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=Global Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Threat Assessment |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/48/10/45724350.pdf |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="private-eye.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/registry|title=Private Eye - Official Site - the UK's number one best-selling news and current affairs magazine, edited by Ian Hislop|website=www.private-eye.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Round-tripping (finance)|Round-tripping]]: Here, money is deposited in a [[controlled foreign corporation]] offshore, preferably in a [[tax haven]] where minimal records are kept, and then shipped back as a [[foreign direct investment]], exempt from taxation. A variant on this is to transfer money to a law firm or similar organization as funds on account of fees, then to cancel the retainer and, when the money is remitted, represent the sums received from the lawyers as a legacy under a will or proceeds of litigation.&lt;ref name="private-eye.co.uk"/&gt;
* Bank capture: In this case, money launderers or criminals buy a controlling interest in a bank, preferably in a jurisdiction with weak money laundering controls, and then move money through the bank without scrutiny.
* Casinos: In this method, an individual walks into a casino and buys chips with illicit cash. The individual will then play for a relatively short time. When the person cashes in the chips, they will expect to take payment in a check, or at least get a receipt so they can claim the proceeds as gambling winnings.&lt;ref name="National Money Laundering Threat Assessment" /&gt;
* Other gambling: Money is spent on gambling, preferably on high odds games. One way to minimize risk with this method is to bet on every possible outcome of some event that has many possible outcomes, so no outcome(s) have short odds, and the bettor will lose only the [[vigorish]] and will have one or more winning bets that can be shown as the source of money. The losing bets will remain hidden.
* Black salaries: A company may have unregistered employees without written contracts and pay them cash salaries. Dirty money might be used to pay them.&lt;ref name="Underground Economy Issues. Ontario Construction Secretariat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iciconstruction.com/resources/industry_publications/underground_economy_issues.cfm |title=Underground Economy Issues.

* [[Tax amnesty|Tax amnesties]]: For example, those that legalize unreported assets and cash in tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tax amnesties turn HMRC into 'biggest money-laundering operation in history' |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100011790/tax-amnesties-turn-hmrc-into-biggest-money-laundering-operation-in-history |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By region ==

=== Latin America ===
In Latin America, money laundering is mainly linked to drug trafficking activities and to having connections with criminal activity, such as crimes that have to do with arms trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, blackmail, smuggling, and acts of corruption of people linked to governments, such as bribery, which are more common in Latin American countries. There is a relationship between corruption and money laundering in developing countries. The economic power of Latin America increases rapidly and without support, these fortunes being of illicit origin have the appearance of legally acquired profits. With regard to money laundering, the ultimate goal of the process is to integrate illicit capital into the general economy and transform it into licit goods and services. 

The money laundering practice uses various channels to legalize everything achieved through illegal practices. As such, it has different techniques depending on the country where this illegal operation is going to be carried out:

* In Colombia, the laundering of billions of dollars, which come from drug trafficking, is carried out through imports of contraband from the parallel exchange market.
* In Central America in countries such as Guatemala and Honduras, money laundering continues to increase in the absence of adequate legislation and regulations in these countries. Money laundering activities in Costa Rica have experienced substantial growth, especially using large-scale currency smuggling and investments of drug cartels in real estate, within the tourism sector. Furthermore, the Colon Free Zone, in Panama, continues to be the area of operations for money laundering where cash is exchanged for products of different nature that are then put up for sale at prices below those of production for a return fast of the capital.
* In Mexico, the preferred techniques continue to be the smuggling of currency abroad, in addition to electronic transfers, bank drafts with Mexican banks and operations in the parallel exchange market.
* Money Laundering in the Caribbean countries continues to be a serious problem that seems to be very dangerous. Specifically, in Antigua, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Citizens of the Dominican Republic who have been involved in money laundering in the United States, use companies that are dedicated to transferring funds sent to the Dominican Republic in amounts of less than $ 10,000 under the use of false names. Moreover, in Jamaica, multi-million dollar asset laundering cases were discovered through telephone betting operations abroad. Thousands of suspicious transactions have been detected in French overseas territories. Free trade zones such as Aruba, meanwhile, remain the preferred areas for money laundering. The offshore banking centers, the secret bank accounts and the tourist complexes are the channels through which the launderers whiten the proceeds of the illicit money.

Casinos continue to attract organizations that deal with money laundering. Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela are considered high priority countries in the region, due to the strategies used by the washers.

==== Economic impact in the region ====
The practice of money laundering, among other economic and financial crimes have been better in infiltrating into the economic and political structures of most developing countries therefore resulting to political instability and economic digression.

Money laundering is still a great concern for the financial services industry.  About 50% of the money laundering incidents in Latin America were reported by organizations in the financial sector. According to PwC’s 2014 global economic crime survey in Latin America only 2.8% of respondents in Latin America claimed suffering Anti-Trust/Competition Law incidents, compared to 5.2% of respondents globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/economic-crime-survey/pdf/pwc-latin-america-economic-crime-survey.pdf|title=Economic Crime: A Threat to Business Globally|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612144150/https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/economic-crime-survey/pdf/pwc-latin-america-economic-crime-survey.pdf|archive-date=2018-06-12|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been shown that money laundering has an impact on the financial behavior and macroeconomic performance of the industrialized countries. In these countries the macroeconomic consequences of money laundering are transmitted through several channels. Thus, money laundering complicates the formulation of economic policies. It is assumed that the proceeds of criminal activities are laundered by means of the notes and coins in circulation of the monetary substitutes.

The laundering causes disproportionate changes in the relative prices of assets which implies that resources are allocated inefficiently; and, therefore may have negative implications for economic growth, apparently money laundering is associated with a lower economic growth.

The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] of the United States estimates that only in that country, sales of narcotic drugs represent about 57,000 millions of dollars annually and most of these transactions are made in cash&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/ondcp|title=Office of National Drug Control Policy|website=The White House|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Jurisprudence ====
Money laundering has been increasing. A key factor behind the growing money laundering is ineffective enforcement of money laundering laws locally. Perhaps because of the lack of importance that has been given to the subject, since the 21st century started, there was not jurisprudence regarding the laundering of money or assets, or the conversion or transfer of goods. Which is even worse, the laws of the Latin American countries have really not dealt with their study in a profound way, as it is an issue that concerns the whole world and is the subject of seminars, conferences and academic analysis in different regions of the planet. Now a new figure that is being called the Economic Criminal Law is being implemented, which should be implemented in modern societies, which has been inflicted enormous damage to the point of affecting the general economy of the states. Even though, developing countries have responded and continue to respond, through legislative measures, to the problem of money laundering, at national level, however, money launderers, have taken advantage of the lax regulatory environment, vulnerable financial systems along with the continued  civil and political unrest of most the developing countries.

==Magnitude==
Many regulatory and governmental authorities issue estimates each year for the amount of money laundered, either worldwide or within their national economy. In 1996, a spokesperson for the IMF estimated that 2–5% of the worldwide global economy involved laundered money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp021098|title=Money Laundering: the Importance of International Countermeasures--Address by Michel Camdessus|work=IMF|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF), an intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering, stated, "Due to the illegal nature of the transactions, precise statistics are not available and it is therefore impossible to produce a definitive estimate of the amount of money that is globally laundered every year. The FATF therefore does not publish any figures in this regard."&lt;ref name="FATF FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=Money Laundering - Financial Action Task Force |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/faq/moneylaundering/ |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic commentators have likewise been unable to estimate the volume of money with any degree of assurance.&lt;ref name="chasing dirty money" /&gt; Various estimates of the scale of global money laundering are sometimes repeated often enough to make some people regard them as factual—but no researcher has overcome the inherent difficulty of measuring an actively concealed practice.

Regardless of the difficulty in measurement, the amount of money laundered each year is in the [[1000000000 (number)|billions]] of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments.&lt;ref name="chasing dirty money" /&gt; As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been [[Organized crime|large scale criminal enterprises]]. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, under UK law the first offences created for money laundering both related to the proceeds from the sale of illegal narcotics under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and then later under the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of [[terrorist financing]] in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come ''from'', and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going ''to'').

==Electronic money==
In theory, [[electronic money]] should provide as easy a method of transferring value without revealing identity as untracked banknotes, especially wire transfers involving anonymity-protecting numbered bank accounts.  In practice, however, the record-keeping capabilities of Internet service providers and other network resource maintainers tend to frustrate that intention.  While some [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] under recent development have aimed to provide for more possibilities of transaction anonymity for various reasons, the degree to which they succeed—and, in consequence, the degree to which they offer benefits for money laundering efforts—is controversial. Solutions such as [[Zcash|ZCash]] and Monero are examples of cryptocurrencies that provide unlinkable anonymity via proofs and/or obfuscation of information ([[Ring signature|ring signatures]]). Such currencies could find use in online illicit services.

In 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at [[ESSEC]] ISIS, surveyed new techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]].&lt;ref name="Jean-Loup Richet"&gt;{{cite arXiv |arxiv=1310.2368|title=Laundering Money Online: a review of cybercriminals methods |date=June 2013 |author=Richet, Jean-Loup}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common approach was to use a [[digital currency exchanger]] service which converted dollars into a digital currency called [[Liberty Reserve]], and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013, the US authorities shut down Liberty Reserve charging its founder and various others with money laundering.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/05/liberty-reserve-indicted/ |title=Liberty Reserve founder indicted on $6 billion money-laundering charges |publisher=Wired |date=May 2013 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |author=Zetter, Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another increasingly common way of laundering money is to use online gaming. In a growing number of online games, such as ''[[Second Life]]'' and ''[[World of Warcraft]],'' it is possible to [[gold farming|convert money into virtual goods, services, or virtual cash]] that can later be converted back into money.&lt;ref name="Wired.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/21/money-laundering-online |title=Cybercriminals launder money using in-game currencies |publisher=Wired|date=October 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013 |author=Solon, Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse money laundering==
Reverse money laundering is a process that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes.&lt;ref name="REVERSE LAUNDERING"&gt;{{cite web |last=International Federation of Accountants |title=Anti-Money Laundering |url=http://www.ifac.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/anti-money-laundering-2n.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually perpetrated for the purpose of financing terrorism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cassella | first1 = S.D. | year = 2003 | title = Reverse money laundering | url = | journal = Journal of Money Laundering Control | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 92–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be also used by criminal organizations that have invested in legal businesses and would like to withdraw legitimate funds from official circulation. Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay "under-the-table" salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zabyelina | first1 = Yuliya | year = 2015 | title = Reverse money laundering in Russia: Clean cash for dirty ends | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JMLC-10-2014-0039 | journal = Journal of Money Laundering Control | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 202–221 | doi=10.1108/JMLC-10-2014-0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in an affidavit filed on 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascau alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator [[Leland Yee]], engaged in reverse money laundering activities.

The problem of such fraudulent encashment practices  (''obnalichka'' in Russian) has become acute in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) reported that the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, Serbia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Kazakhstan have encountered a substantial shrinkage of tax base and shifting money supply balance in favor of cash. These processes have complicated planning and management of the economy and contributed to the growth of the [[shadow economy]].&lt;ref&gt;EAG. "[http://eurasiangroup.org/WGTYP_2012_10_eng.pdf Money laundering and terrorist financing with use of physical cash and bearer instruments]", 17th Plenary Meeting of the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, 28 December 2012, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Anti-money laundering}} Combating==
Anti-money laundering (AML) is a term mainly used in the financial and legal industries to describe the legal controls that require [[financial institution]]s and other regulated entities to prevent, detect, and report money laundering activities. Anti-money laundering guidelines came into prominence globally as a result of the formation of the [[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF) and the promulgation of an international framework of anti-money laundering standards.&lt;ref name="about the FATF"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=About the FATF |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/0,3417,en_32250379_32236836_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards began to have more relevance in 2000 and 2001, after FATF began a process to publicly identify countries that were deficient in their anti-money laundering laws and international cooperation, a process colloquially known as "[[name and shame]]".&lt;ref name="FATF NCCT initiative"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=About the Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCT) Initiative |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/document/51/0,3746,en_32250379_32236992_33916403_1_1_1_1,00.html |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compasscayman.com/journal/2010/01/06/The-global-anti-money-laundering-regime--a-short-overview |title=The Global Anti-Money Laundering Regime: A Short Overview, by Richard Horowitz, Cayman Islands Journal, 6 January 2010 |publisher=Compasscayman.com |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effective AML program requires a jurisdiction to criminalise money laundering, giving the relevant regulators and police the powers and tools to investigate; be able to share information with other countries as appropriate; and require financial institutions to identify their customers, establish risk-based controls, keep records, and report suspicious activities.&lt;ref name="Money Laundering FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=Money Laundering FAQ |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/document/29/0,3746,en_32250379_32235720_33659613_1_1_1_1,00.html |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict background checks are necessary to combat as many money launderers escape by investing through complex ownership and company structures. Banks can do that but a proper surveillance is required but on the Government side to reduce this. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/deutsche-bank-anti-money-laundering-report-2018-8|title=Deutsche Bank report reveals shortcomings in its screening process, raises anti-money laundering concerns|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminalization===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The elements of the crime of money laundering are set forth in the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] and [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]]. It is defined as knowingly engaging in a financial transaction with the proceeds of a crime for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property from governments.

===The role of financial institutions===
While banks operating in the same country generally have to follow the same anti-money laundering laws and regulations, financial institutions all structure their anti-money laundering efforts slightly differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amlsource.com/aml-job-descriptions.php|title=Financial Crime Job Descriptions - FinCrimeJobs.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most financial institutions globally, and many non-financial institutions, are required to identify and [[Suspicious activity report|report transactions of a suspicious nature]] to the financial intelligence unit in the respective country. For example, a bank must verify a customer's identity and, if necessary, monitor transactions for suspicious activity. This is often termed as "[[know your customer]]". This means knowing the identity of the customer and understanding the kinds of transactions in which the customer is likely to engage. By knowing one's customers, financial institutions can often identify unusual or suspicious behaviour, termed anomalies, which may be an indication of money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Roth |first=John|title=Monograph on Terrorist Financing |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Ch4.pdf |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=20 September 2011 |pages=54–56 |date=20 August 2004|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank employees, such as tellers and customer account representatives, are trained in anti-money laundering and are instructed to report activities that they deem suspicious. Additionally, [[anti-money laundering software]] filters customer data, classifies it according to level of suspicion, and inspects it for anomalies. Such anomalies include any sudden and substantial increase in funds, a large withdrawal, or moving money to a bank secrecy jurisdiction. Smaller transactions that meet certain criteria may also be flagged as suspicious. For example, structuring can lead to flagged transactions. The software also flags names on government "blacklists" and transactions that involve countries hostile to the host nation. Once the software has mined data and flagged suspect transactions, it alerts bank management, who must then determine whether to file a report with the government.

===Value of enforcement costs and associated privacy concerns===
The financial services industry has become more vocal about the rising costs of anti-money laundering regulation and the limited benefits that they claim it brings.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704355304576214852895407540 |title=U.S. Banks Oppose Tighter Money Rules |work=Wall Street Journal |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2011 |author=Ball, Deborah, et al.,}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator wrote that "[w]ithout facts, [anti-money laundering] legislation has been driven on rhetoric, driving by ill-guided activism responding to the need to be "seen to be doing something" rather than by an objective understanding of its effects on predicate crime. The social panic approach is justified by the language used—we talk of the battle against terrorism or the war on drugs".&lt;ref&gt;''Money Laundering Bulletin'', Issue 154, June 2008, Dr Jackie Harvey (Newcastle Business School&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine has become increasingly vocal in its criticism of such regulation, particularly with reference to countering terrorist financing, referring to it as a "costly failure", although it concedes that other efforts (like reducing identity and credit card fraud) may still be effective at combating money laundering.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/5056338?story_id=E1_VDVGPPR |title=The Lost Trail |work=The Economist |date=20 October 2005 |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides economic costs to implement anti-money-laundering laws, improper attention to [[Information privacy|data protection]] practices may entail disproportionate costs to individual privacy rights. In June 2011, the data-protection advisory committee to the European Union issued a report on data protection issues related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, which identified numerous transgressions against the established legal framework on privacy and data protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion 14/2011 on data protection issues related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2011/wp186_en.pdf|publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=18 February 2014|author=Article 29 Data Protection Working Party|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report made recommendations on how to address money laundering and terrorist financing in ways that safeguard personal privacy rights and data protection laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion 14/2011 Annex: Recommendations|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2011/wp186_en_annex.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=18 February 2014|author=Article 29 Data Protection Working Group|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, groups such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] have expressed concern that money laundering rules require banks to report on their own customers, essentially conscripting private businesses "into agents of the surveillance state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=American Civil Liberties Union |title=The Surveillance Industrial Complex |url=https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/surveillance_report.pdf |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries are obligated by various international instruments and standards, such as the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], the 2000 [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]], the 2003 [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], and the recommendations of the 1989 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) to enact and enforce money laundering laws in an effort to stop narcotics trafficking, international organised crime, and corruption. Mexico, which has faced a significant increase in violent crime, established anti-money laundering controls in 2013 to curb the underlying crime issue.&lt;ref name="Mallen"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/mexico-around-10b-every-year-come-money-laundering-which-was-not-illegal-16-out-31-states-1555099 |title=In Mexico, Around $10B Every Year Come From Money Laundering, Which Was Not Illegal in 16 Out of 31 States |work=International Business Times |date=13 February 2013 |accessdate=12 March 2014 |author=Mallen, Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global organizations===
Formed in 1989 by the [[G7]] countries, the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote an international response to combat money laundering. The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the [[OECD]] in Paris. In October 2001, FATF expanded its mission to include combating the financing of terrorism. FATF is a policy-making body that brings together legal, financial, and law enforcement experts to achieve national legislation and regulatory AML and CFT reforms. {{As of|2014}} its membership consists of 36 countries and territories and two regional organizations.  FATF works in collaboration with a number of international bodies and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/membersandobservers/|title=FATF Members and Observers|last=GAFI|first=FATF|date=21 July 2017|website=www.fatf-gafi.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These entities have observer status with FATF, which does not entitle them to vote, but permits them full participation in plenary sessions and working groups.&lt;ref name="FATF member FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=Member Country and Observers FAQ |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/document/5/0,3746,en_32250379_32236869_34310917_1_1_1_1,00.html |website=www.fatf-gafi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FATF has developed 40 recommendations on money laundering and 9 special recommendations regarding terrorist financing. FATF assesses each member country against these recommendations in published reports. Countries seen as not being sufficiently compliant with such recommendations are subjected to financial sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.bitcoinfaststart.com/bitcoin-money-laundering/|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-riskandnon-cooperativejurisdictions/?hf=10&amp;b=0&amp;s=desc(fatf_releasedate) |title=High-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions |last=Financial Action Task Force |date=23 June 2017 |website=www.fatf-gafi.org |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FATF's three primary functions with regard to money laundering are:
# Monitoring members’ progress in implementing anti-money laundering measures,
# Reviewing and reporting on laundering trends, techniques, and countermeasures, and
# Promoting the adoption and implementation of FATF anti-money laundering standards globally.

The FATF currently comprises 34 member jurisdictions and 2 regional organisations, representing most major financial centres in all parts of the globe.

The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] maintains the ''International Money Laundering Information Network'', a website that provides information and software for anti-money laundering data collection and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imolin.org/imolin/index.html International Money Laundering Information Network].

==Anti-money-laundering measures by region==
Many jurisdictions adopt a list of specific predicate crimes for money laundering prosecutions, while others criminalize the proceeds of any serious crimes.

===Afghanistan===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Afghanistan (FinTRACA) was established as a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the Anti Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Law passed by decree late in 2004. The main purpose of this law is to protect the integrity of the Afghan financial system and to gain compliance with international treaties and conventions. The Financial Intelligence Unit is a semi-independent body that is administratively housed within the Central Bank of Afghanistan (Da Afghanistan Bank). The main objective of FinTRACA is to deny the use of the Afghan financial system to those who obtained funds as the result of illegal activity, and to those who would use it to support terrorist activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fintraca.gov.af |title=fintraca.gov.af |publisher=fintraca.gov.af |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet its objectives, the FinTRACA collects and analyzes information from a variety of sources. These sources include entities with legal obligations to submit reports to the FinTRACA when a suspicious activity is detected, as well as reports of cash transactions above a threshold amount specified by regulation. Also, FinTRACA has access to all related Afghan government information and databases. When the analysis of this information supports the supposition of illegal use of the financial system, the FinTRACA works closely with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the illegal activity. FinTRACA also cooperates internationally in support of its own analyses and investigations and to support the analyses and investigations of foreign counterparts, to the extent allowed by law. Other functions include training of those entities with legal obligations to report information, development of laws and regulations to support national-level AML objectives, and international and regional cooperation in the development of AML typologies and countermeasures.

===Australia===
Australia has adopted a number of strategies to combat money laundering, which mirror those of a majority of western countries. The [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] ([[AUSTRAC]]) is Australia's financial intelligence unit to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, which requires financial institutions and other 'cash dealers' in Australia to report to it suspicious cash or other transactions and other specific information. The [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] maintains a list of [[Outlawed terror organisations in Australia|outlawed terror organisations]]. It is an offense to materially support or be supported by such organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Security: [http://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/WhatAustraliaisdoing/Pages/default.aspx What Australia is doing]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an offence to open a bank account in Australia in a false name,&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988'' (Cth), s 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and rigorous procedures must be followed when new bank accounts are opened. 

The ''Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006'' (Cth) (AML/CTF Act) is the principal legislative instrument, although there are also offence provisions contained in Division 400 of the ''Criminal Code Act 1995'' (Cth). Upon its introduction, it was intended that the AML/CTF Act would be further amended by a second tranche of reforms extending to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) including, inter alia, lawyers, accountants, jewellers and real estate agents; however, those further reforms have yet to be progressed.

The ''[[Proceeds of Crime Act 1987]]'' (Cth) imposes criminal penalties on a person who engages in money laundering, and allows for confiscation of property. The principal objects of the Act are set out in s.3(1):

* to deprive persons of the proceeds of, and benefits derived from the commission of offences,
* to provide for the forfeiture of property used in or in connection with the commission of such offences, and
* to enable [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission|law enforcement authorities]] to effectively trace such proceeds, benefits and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Cash|last=Tyree|first=Alan|publisher=Butterworths|year=1997|isbn=0 409 31316 5|location=Adelaide, Australia|pages=82, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
The first anti-money laundering legislation in Bangladesh was the ''Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2002''. It was replaced by the ''Money Laundering Prevention Ordinance 2008''. Subsequently, the ordinance was repealed by the ''Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2009''. In 2012, government again replace it with the ''Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money Laundering Act 2012 amended|url=https://resource.ogrlegal.com/money-laundering-act-2012-amended/|website=Resource Portal of OGR Legal|publisher=OGR Legal|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of section 2, "Money Laundering means – (i)  knowingly moving, converting, or transferring proceeds of crime or property involved in an offence for the following purposes:- (1) concealing or disguising the illicit nature, source,  location, ownership or control of the proceeds of crime; or (2) assisting any person involved in the commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal consequences of such offence;  (ii)   smuggling money or property earned through legal or illegal means to a foreign country; (iii)  knowingly transferring or remitting the proceeds of crime to a foreign country or remitting or bringing them into Bangladesh from a foreign country with the intention of hiding or disguising its illegal source; or (iv) concluding or attempting to conclude financial transactions in such a manner so as to reporting requirement under this Act may be avoided;(v) converting or moving or transferring property with the intention to instigate or assist for committing a predicate offence; (vi) acquiring, possessing or using any property, knowing that such property is the proceeds of a predicate offence; (vii) performing such activities so as to the illegal source of the proceeds of crime may be concealed or disguised; (viii) participating in, associating with, conspiring, attempting, abetting, instigate or counsel to commit any offences mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws and Acts|url=https://www.bb.org.bd/aboutus/regulationguideline/lawsnacts.php|website=Bangladesh Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/bangla_pdf_part.php?act_name=&amp;vol=%E0%A7%AA%E0%A7%A8&amp;id=1088|title=মানিলন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন, ২০১২|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent these Illegal uses of money, the Bangladesh government has introduced the Money Laundering Prevention Act. The Act was last amended in the year 2009 and all the financial institutes are following this act. Till today there are 26 circulars issued by Bangladesh Bank under this act. To prevent money laundering, a banker must do the following:
* While opening a new account, the account opening form should be duly filled up by all the information of the customer.
* The [[Know your customer|KYC]] must be properly filled.
* The Transaction Profile (TP) is mandatory for a client to understand his/her transactions. If needed, the TP must be updated at the client's consent.
* All other necessary papers should be properly collected along with the National ID card.
* If any suspicious transaction is noticed, the Branch Anti Money Laundering Compliance Officer (BAMLCO) must be notified and accordingly the Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) must be filled out.
* The cash department should be aware of the transactions. It must be noted if suddenly a big amount of money is deposited in any account. Proper documents are required if any client does this type of transaction.
* Structuring, over/ under invoicing is another way to do money laundering. The foreign exchange department should look into this matter cautiously.
* If any account has a transaction over 1 million taka in a single day, it must be reported in a cash transaction report (CTR).
* All bank officials must go through all the 26 circulars and use them.

===Canada===
In 1991, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was brought into force in Canada to give legal effect to the former [[FATF]] Forty Recommendations by establishing record keeping and client identification requirements in the financial sector to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of money laundering offences under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] and the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]].&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada"&gt;{{cite web |author=Duhaime, Christine |title=AML Legislation in Canada, Duhaime's Financial Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Law |url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law/aml-legislation-in-canada |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was amended to expand the scope of its application and to establish a financial intelligence unit with national control over money laundering, namely [[FINTRAC]].&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada" /&gt;

In December 2001, the scope of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was again expanded by amendments enacted under the Anti-Terrorism Act with the objective of deterring terrorist activity by cutting off sources and channels of funding used by terrorists in response to [[9/11]].  The Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was renamed the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada" /&gt;

In December 2006, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act was further amended, in part, in response to pressure from the FATF for Canada to tighten its money laundering and financing of terrorism legislation.  The amendments expanded the client identification, record-keeping and reporting requirements for certain organizations and included new obligations to report attempted suspicious transactions and outgoing and incoming international electronic fund transfers, undertake risk assessments and implement written compliance procedures in respect of those risks.&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada" /&gt;

The amendments also enabled greater money laundering and terrorist financing intelligence-sharing among enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada" /&gt;

In Canada, casinos, money service businesses, notaries, accountants, banks, securities brokers, life insurance agencies, real estate salespeople and dealers in precious metals and stones are subject to the reporting and record keeping obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.

===European Union===
The fourth and latest iteration of the EU’s anti-money laundering directive (AMLD IV) was published on 5 June 2015, after clearing its last legislative stop at the European Parliament. The new directive brings the EU’s anti-money laundering laws more in line with the US’s, which is welcome news for financial institutions that are operating in both jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/aml-global-alignment.pdf |title= AML global alignment: Two steps forward, one step back |website= pwc.com|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://complyadvantage.com/blog/5mld-fifth-anti-money-laundering-directive/ The Fifth Money Laundering Directive (5MLD)] will come into force on the 10th January 2020. It will address a number of weaknesses in the European Union’s AML/CFT regime that have come to light since the enactment of the Fourth Money Laundering Directive AMLD IV).

Lack of harmonization in AML requirements between the US and EU has complicated the compliance efforts of global institutions that are looking to standardize the Know Your Customer (KYC) component of their AML programs across key jurisdictions. AMLD IV promises to better align the AML regimes by adopting a more risk-based approach compared to its predecessor, AMLD III.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"/&gt;

Certain components of the directive, however, go beyond current requirements in both the EU and US, imposing new implementation challenges on banks. For instance, more public officials are brought within the scope of the directive, and EU member states are required to establish new registries of “beneficial owners” (i.e., those who ultimately own or control each company) which will impact banks. AMLD IV became effective 25 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52013PC0045|title = EUR-Lex – 52013PC0045 – EN – EUR-Lex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Enforcement Directorate}}

In 2002, the [[Parliament of India]] passed an [[Act of Parliament|act]] called the [[Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002]]. The main objectives of this act are to prevent money-laundering as well as to provide for confiscation of property either derived from or involved in, money-laundering.&lt;ref name="Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/P-ACT/2003/The%20Prevention%20of%20Money-laudering%20Act,%202002.pdf|publisher=Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND), Ministry of Finance, India|accessdate=10 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712181014/http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/P-ACT/2003/The%20Prevention%20of%20Money-laudering%20Act,%202002.pdf|archive-date=12 July 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 12 (1) describes the obligations that banks, other financial institutions, and intermediaries have to 
:(a) Maintain records that detail the nature and value of transactions, whether such transactions comprise a single transaction or a series of connected transactions, and where these transactions take place within a month.
:(b) Furnish information on transactions referred to in clause (a) to the Director within the time prescribed, including records of the identity of all its clients.

Section 12 (2) prescribes that the records referred to in sub-section (1) as mentioned above, must be maintained for ten years after the transactions finished. It is handled by the Indian Income Tax Department.

The provisions of the Act are frequently reviewed and various amendments have been passed from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/MoneyLaundering.pdf |title=The Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219064454/http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/MoneyLaundering.pdf |archive-date=19 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/vikas_doc/docs/1253169904~~The%20Prevention%20of%20Money%20Laundering%20Act,%202009.pdf |title=The Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank accountants must record all transactions over Rs. 1&amp;nbsp;million and maintain such records for 10 years. Banks must also make cash transaction reports (CTRs) and suspicious transaction reports over Rs. 1&amp;nbsp;million within 7 days of initial suspicion.

The term ‘money laundering’ is not used as such within the CDSA. Part VI of the CDSA criminalises the laundering of proceeds generated by criminal conduct and drug tracking via the following offences:
* The assistance of another person in retaining, controlling or using the benefits of [[drug dealing]] or criminal conduct under an arrangement (whether by concealment, removal from jurisdiction, transfer to nominees or otherwise) [section 43(1)/44(1)].
* The concealment, conversion, transfer or removal from the jurisdiction, or the acquisition, possession or use of benefits of drug dealing or criminal conduct [section 46(1)/47(1)].
* The concealment, conversion, transfer or removal from the jurisdiction of another person’s benefits of drug dealing or criminal conduct [section 46(2)/47(2)].
* The acquirement, possession or use of another person’s benefits of drug dealing or criminal conduct [section 46(3)/47(3)].

Money Laundering Regulations are designed to protect the UK financial system, as well as preventing and detecting crime. If a business is covered by these regulations then controls are put in place to prevent it being used for money laundering.

The [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]] contains the primary UK anti-money laundering legislation,&lt;ref&gt;Sections 327 – 340, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; including provisions requiring businesses within the "regulated sector" (banking, investment, money transmission, certain professions, etc.) to report to the authorities suspicions of money laundering by customers or others.&lt;ref&gt;Section 330, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Money laundering is broadly defined in the UK.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Section 340, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In effect any handling or involvement with any proceeds of any crime (or monies or assets representing the proceeds of crime) can be a money laundering offence. An offender's possession of the proceeds of his own crime falls within the UK definition of money laundering.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Section 329, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The definition also covers activities within the traditional definition of money laundering, as a process that conceals or disguises the proceeds of crime to make them appear legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Section 327, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike certain other jurisdictions (notably the US and much of Europe), UK money laundering offences are not limited to the proceeds of serious crimes, nor are there any monetary limits. Financial transactions need no money laundering design or purpose for UK laws to consider them a money laundering offence. A money laundering offence under UK legislation need not even involve money, since the money laundering legislation covers assets of any description. In consequence, any person who commits an acquisitive crime (i.e., one that produces some benefit in the form of money or an asset of any description) in the UK inevitably also commits a money laundering offence under UK legislation.

This applies also to a person who, by criminal conduct, evades a liability (such as a taxation liability)—which lawyers call "obtaining a pecuniary advantage"—as he is deemed thereby to obtain a sum of money equal in value to the liability evaded.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The principal money laundering offences carry a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Section 334, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary regulation is provided by the Money Laundering Regulations 2003,&lt;ref name="MLR1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20033075.htm |title=OPSI: Money Laundering Regulations 2003 |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was replaced by the Money Laundering Regulations 2007.&lt;ref name="MLR2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20072157_en_1 |title=OPSI: Money Laundering Regulations 2007 |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are directly based on the EU directives 91/308/EEC, 2001/97/EC and 2005/60/EC.

One consequence of the Act is that solicitors, accountants, tax advisers, and insolvency practitioners who suspect (as a consequence of information received in the course of their work) that their clients (or others) have engaged in tax evasion or other criminal conduct that produced a benefit, now must report their suspicions to the authorities (since these entail suspicions of money laundering). In most circumstances it would be an offence, "tipping-off", for the reporter to inform the subject of his report that a report has been made.&lt;ref&gt;Section 333A, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions do not however require disclosure to the authorities of information received by certain professionals in privileged circumstances or where the information is subject to [[legal professional privilege]]. Others that are subject to these regulations include financial institutions, credit institutions, estate agents (which includes chartered surveyors), trust and company service providers, high value dealers (who accept cash equivalent to €15,000 or more for goods sold), and casinos.

Professional guidance (which is submitted to and approved by the UK Treasury) is provided by industry groups including the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group,&lt;ref name="JMLSG1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmlsg.org.uk/bba/jsp/polopoly.jsp;jsessionid=aH1DPtXgUly-?d=749 |title=Joint Money Laundering Steering Group |accessdate=14 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006131749/http://www.jmlsg.org.uk/bba/jsp/polopoly.jsp;jsessionid=aH1DPtXgUly-?d=749 |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Law Society.&lt;ref name="LS1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/support-services/risk-compliance/anti-money-laundering |title=Law Society AML advice |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB).
However, there is no obligation on banking institutions to routinely report monetary deposits or transfers above a specified value. Instead reports must be made of all suspicious deposits or transfers, irrespective of their value.

The reporting obligations include reporting suspicious gains from conduct in other countries that would be criminal if it took place in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Section 340(2), Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions were later added for certain activities legal where they took place, such as [[bullfighting]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;David Winch, [http://www.accountingevidence.com/documents/articles/Money%20laundering%20law%20changes.pdf "Money Laundering Law Changes"] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 200,000 reports of suspected money laundering are submitted annually to authorities in the UK (there were 240,582 reports in the year ended 30 September 2010. This was an increase from the 228,834 reports submitted in the previous year).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;The Suspicious Activity Reports Regime Annual Report 2010 published by SOCA&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these reports are submitted by banks and similar financial institutions (there were 186,897 reports from the banking sector in the year ended 30 September 2010).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Although 5,108 different organisations submitted [[Suspicious activity report (banking)|suspicious activity reports]] to the authorities in the year ended 30 September 2010, just four organisations submitted approximately half of all reports, and the top 20 reporting organisations accounted for three-quarters of all reports.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The offence of failing to report a suspicion of money laundering by another person carries a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

On May 1, 2018, the UK House of Commons, without opposition,&lt;ref name=aolmay1 /&gt; passed the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, which will set out the UK government’s intended approach to exceptions and licenses when the nation becomes responsible for implementing its own sanctions and will also require notorious overseas British territory tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to establish public registers of the beneficial ownership of firms in their jurisdictions by the end of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sanctions-and-anti-money-laundering-bill-exceptions-and-licences-policy-note|title=Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill: exceptions and licences policy note|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aolmay1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aol.co.uk/news/2018/05/01/mps-back-public-registers-of-ownership-in-bid-to-improve-tax-hav/|title=MPs back public registers of ownership in bid to improve tax haven transparency - AOL|website=www.aol.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation was passed by the House of Lords on May 21 and received Royal Asset on May 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2017-19/sanctionsandantimoneylaundering/stages.html|title=Bill stages — Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 — UK Parliament|website=services.parliament.uk|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Act's public register provision is facing legal challenges from local governments in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, who argue that it violates their Constitutional sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/overseas-territories-to-fight-public-register-demands/5066370.article|title=Overseas territories to fight public register demands|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bureaux de change''====
All UK ''[[Bureaux de change]]'' are registered with [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]], which issues a trading licence for each location. Bureaux de change and [[money transmitter]]s, such as [[Western Union]] outlets, in the UK fall within the "regulated sector" and are required to comply with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007.&lt;ref name="MLR2"/&gt; Checks can be carried out by HMRC on all [[Money Service Business]]es.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (2001) and subsequent amendments have added responsibilities to the FSB to combat money laundering.

===United States===
The approach in the United States to stopping money laundering is usually broken into two areas: preventive (regulatory) measures and criminal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp|title=Anti Money Laundering - AML|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2005-07-21|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fincen.gov/history-anti-money-laundering-laws|title=History of Anti-Money Laundering Laws {{!}} FinCEN.gov|website=www.fincen.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preventive====
In an attempt to prevent dirty money from entering the U.S. financial system in the first place, the United States Congress passed a series of laws, starting in 1970, collectively known as the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] (BSA). These laws, contained in sections 5311 through 5332 of Title 31 of the United States Code, require [[financial institution]]s, which under the current definition include a broad array of entities, including banks, credit card companies, life insurers, [[money service businesses]] and broker-dealers in securities, to report certain transactions to the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. Cash transactions in excess of a certain amount must be reported on a [[currency transaction report]] (CTR), identifying the individual making the transaction as well as the source of the cash. The law originally required all transactions of [[USD|US$]]5,000 or more to be reported, but due to excessively high levels of reporting the threshold was raised to US$10,000.  The U.S. is one of the few countries in the world to require reporting of all cash transactions over a certain limit, although certain businesses can be exempt from the requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/olm_019.htm |title=FFIEC website regarding CTR Exemptions |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, financial institutions must report transaction on a [[Suspicious Activity Report]] (SAR) that they deem "suspicious", defined as a knowing or suspecting that the funds come from illegal activity or disguise funds from illegal activity, that it is structured to evade BSA requirements or appears to serve no known business or apparent lawful purpose; or that the institution is being used to facilitate criminal activity. Attempts by customers to circumvent the BSA, generally by structuring cash deposits to amounts lower than US$10,000 by breaking them up and depositing them on different days or at different locations also violates the law.&lt;ref name=fincen&gt;{{cite web |last=FinCEN |title=Bank Secrecy Act |url=http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/bsa/ |accessdate=2 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307015603/http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/bsa/ |archivedate=7 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial database created by these reports is administered by the U.S.'s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), called the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN), located in Vienna, Virginia. The reports are made available to U.S. criminal investigators, as well as other FIU's around the globe, and FinCEN conducts computer assisted analyses of these reports to determine trends and refer investigations.&lt;ref name="FinCEN Mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fincen.gov/about_fincen/wwd/mission.html |title=FinCEN mission |accessdate=2 March 2011 |last=FinCEN Mission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430233210/http://www.fincen.gov/about_fincen/wwd/mission.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSA requires financial institutions to engage in customer due diligence, or KYC, which is sometimes known in the parlance as [[know your customer]]. This includes obtaining satisfactory identification to give assurance that the account is in the customer's true name, and having an understanding of the expected nature and source of the money that flows through the customer's accounts. Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence because the law deems that those types of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to ongoing monitoring, in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters. If a manual inspection reveals that the transaction is suspicious, the institution should file a [[Suspicious Activity Report]].&lt;ref name="roth monograph"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=John |author2=Douglas Greenburg and Serena Willie |title=Monograph on Terrorist Financing |year=2004 |pages=54–56 |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Monograph.pdf |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulators of the industries involved are responsible to ensure that the financial institutions comply with the BSA. For example, the [[Federal Reserve]] and the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] regularly inspect banks, and may impose civil fines or refer matters for criminal prosecution for non-compliance. A number of banks have been fined and prosecuted for failure to comply with the BSA. Most famously, [[Riggs Bank]], in Washington D.C., was prosecuted and functionally driven out of business as a result of its failure to apply proper money laundering controls, particularly as it related to foreign political figures.&lt;ref name="Joseph USAB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joseph |first=Lester |author2=John Roth |title=Criminal Prosecution of Banks Under the Bank Secrecy Act |journal=United States Attorneys' Bulletin |date=September 2007 |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usab5505.pdf |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the BSA, the U.S. imposes controls on the movement of currency across its borders, requiring individuals to report the transportation of cash in excess of US$10,000 on a form called Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (known as a CMIR).&lt;ref name="CMIR"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/amlsourcetool.htm#8 |title=SEC resources |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, businesses, such as automobile dealerships, that receive cash in excess of US$10,000 must file a Form 8300 with the Internal Revenue Service, identifying the source of the cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=148857,00.html |title=IRS web site regarding Form 8300 |accessdate=2 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222191824/http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=148857,00.html |archivedate=22 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2010, the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] issued an advisory on "[[informal value transfer system]]s" referencing ''[[United States v. Banki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2010-A011.html "Informal Value Transfer Systems", Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, 1 September 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905002704/http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2010-A011.html |date=5 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there are perceived consequences of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. These [[unintended consequences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natcnc.com/msb/the-unintended-consequences-of-aml-regulations/|title=AML Regulation MSBs - National Check &amp; Currency|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; include FinCEN's publishing of a list of "risky businesses," which many believe unfairly targeted money service businesses. The publishing of this list and the subsequent fall-out, banks indiscriminately [[de-risking]] MSBs, is referred to as [[Operation Choke Point]]. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a Geographic Targeting Order to combat against illegal money laundering in the United States. This means that title insurance companies in the U.S. are required to identify the natural persons behind companies that pay all cash in residential real estate purchases over a particular amount in certain U.S. cities.

====Criminal sanctions====
Money laundering has been criminalized in the United States since the [[Money Laundering Control Act]] of 1986. The law, contained at section 1956 of Title 18 of the United States Code, prohibits individuals from engaging in a financial transaction with proceeds that were generated from certain specific crimes, known as "specified unlawful activities" (SUAs). The law requires that an individual specifically intend in making the transaction to conceal the source, ownership or control of the funds. There is no minimum threshold of money, and no requirement that the transaction succeeded in actually disguising the money. A "financial transaction" has been broadly defined, and need not involve a financial institution, or even a business. Merely passing money from one person to another, with the intent to disguise the source, ownership, location or control of the money, has been deemed a financial transaction under the law. The possession of money without either a financial transaction or an intent to conceal is not a crime in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cassella USAB"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usab5505.pdf |title=Money Laundering Laws |accessdate=2 March 2011 |last=Cassella |first=Stefan |journal=United States Attorneys' Bulletin |date=September 2007 |pages=21–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides money laundering, the law contained in section 1957 of Title 18 of the United States Code, prohibits spending more than US$10,000 derived from an SUA, regardless of whether the individual wishes to disguise it. It carries a lesser penalty than money laundering, and unlike the money laundering statute, requires that the money pass through a financial institution.&lt;ref name="Cassella USAB" /&gt;

According to the records compiled by the United States Sentencing Commission, in 2009, the United States Department of Justice typically convicted a little over 81,000 people; of this, approximately 800 are convicted of money laundering as the primary or most serious charge.&lt;ref name="USSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussc.gov/Data_and_Statistics/Federal_Sentencing_Statistics/State_District_Circuit/2009/1c09.pdf |title=US Sentencing Commission Date, 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2011 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] of 1988 expanded the definition of financial institution to include businesses such as car dealers and real estate closing personnel and required them to file reports on large currency transaction. It required verification of identity of those who purchase monetary instruments over $3,000. The [[Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act]] of 1992 strengthened sanctions for BSA violations, required so called "Suspicious Activity Reports" and eliminated previously used "Criminal Referral Forms", required verification and recordkeeping for wire transfers and established the [[Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group]] (BSAAG). The [[Money Laundering Suppression Act]] from 1994 required banking agencies to review and enhance training, develop anti-money laundering examination procedures, review and enhance procedures for referring cases to law enforcement agencies, streamlined the [[Currency transaction report]] exemption process, required each [[Money services business]] (MSB) to be registered by an owner or controlling person, required every MSB to maintain a list of businesses authorized to act as agents in connection with the financial services offered by the MSB, made operating an unregistered MSB a federal crime, and recommended that states adopt uniform laws applicable to MSBs. The [[Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act]] of 1998 required banking agencies to develop anti-money laundering training for examiners, required the Department of the Treasury and other agencies to develop a "National Money Laundering Strategy", created the "High Intensity Money Laundering and Related Financial Crime Area" (HIFCA) Task Forces to concentrate law enforcement efforts at the federal, state and local levels in zones where money laundering is prevalent. HIFCA zones may be defined geographically or can be created to address money laundering in an industry sector, a financial institution, or group of financial institutions.&lt;ref name="hicfa"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a HICFA?|url=http://www.fincen.gov/law_enforcement/hifca/index.html#map_hifca|work=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|accessdate=6 March 2014|author=US Dept Treasury|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306130201/http://www.fincen.gov/law_enforcement/hifca/index.html#map_hifca|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intelligence Reform &amp; Terrorism Prevention Act]] of 2004 amended the Bank Secrecy Act to require the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to prescribe regulations requiring certain financial institutions to report cross-border electronic transmittals of funds, if the Secretary determines that reporting is "reasonably necessary" in "anti-money laundering /combatting financing of terrorists (Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism AML/CFT).

== Digital money and Money laundering == 
To prevent the usage of decentralized digital money such as [[Bitcoin]] for the profit of crime and corruption, Australia is planning to strengthen the nation's anti-money laundering laws.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web |title=Bitcoin one step closer to being regulated in Australia under new anti-money laundering laws|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-23/bitcoin-one-step-closer-to-being-regulated-in-australia/9058582 |accessdate=18 Dec 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an incident has been debated as to the clear definition of money laundering in a stateless environment, leading to [[Ethereum Classic]] to form.

The '''Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004''' (c 5) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was promoted by the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]]. It substantially reforms the [[Town and Country Planning in the United Kingdom|town planning]] and [[Eminent domain|compulsory purchase]] framework in the [[United Kingdom]].

It both amended and repealed significant parts of the existing planning and compulsory purchase legislation in force at the time, including the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]], and introduced reforms such as the abolition of [[Local Plans]] and [[Structure Plans]], and their replacement with [[Local Development Frameworks]].

==History==
The [[Act of Parliament|Act]] took over 18 months to negotiate its passage through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and required special dispensation both to be carried over from one [[Parliament of the United Kingdom#Term|Parliamentary session]] to another and to prevent it being lost on one occasion due to an error in the wording of a [[British House of Commons|Commons]] motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200405/ldselect/ldprohse/48/48.pdf |title=1st Report of Session 2004–05 |author=[[House of Lords]] [[Procedure Committee (House of Lords)|Procedure Committee]] |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |date=10 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-03-23 |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605015243/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200405/ldselect/ldprohse/48/48.pdf |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was introduced in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in December 2002. It was re-committed to [[List of Committees of the United Kingdom Parliament|Commons Committee]] to allow the inclusion of significant new material relating to the removal of [[Crown Immunity]] and [[Compulsory Purchase]] and carried over to the current session.

The Act received [[Royal Assent]] on 13 May 2004 and came into force in mid July 2004; [[Delegated legislation in the United Kingdom#Types of delegated legislation|Regulations]] implementing the parts of the [[Act of Parliament|Act]] reforming [[development plan]]s came into force shortly afterwards.

The remaining sections of the [[Act of Parliament|Act]] are being implemented by further regulations and development orders.

==Structure of The Act==
*Part 1 - Regional Functions
*Part 2 - Local Development
*Part 3 - Development
*Part 4 - Development Control
*Part 5 - Correction of Errors
*Part 6 - [[Town and country planning in Wales|Wales]]
*Part 7 - Crown Application of Planning Acts

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1286">The '''Port District Act''' is a law enacted by the [[Washington State Legislature|Legislature]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in 1911, that enabled citizens to establish public port districts to develop and operate harbors and related transportation facilities.&lt;ref name="historylink"&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7241 "Washington State Legislature enacts law allowing citizens to establish public port districts to develop and operate harbors in March 1911"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is part of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) as ''Title 53''.

The first port district established under the new law was the [[Port of Seattle]], with [[Hiram M. Chittenden]], [[Robert Bridges (politician)|Robert Bridges]], and [[Charles Remsberg]] as the first [[Port Commissioner]]s. Also in 1911, the [[Port of Grays Harbor]] was established. The Port was a breeding ground for scientific discovery and a renaissance of the time. &lt;ref name="historylink" /&gt;

'''Rav akçesi''' was a "[[rabbi]] tax" paid by [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish communities]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turcica: revue d'études turques, Volumes 24-25|year=1992|publisher=Éditions Klincksieck|pages=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3lpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;dq=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ENqtTc77LZCp8APbtrSVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of Rav akçesi are unclear; it has been suggested that it was one of two taxes imposed specifically on Jews, and that it may have developed in parallel with the authority of a senior rabbi in [[Istanbul]], who was at nominally a representative and judge for Jewish communities in the Ottoman empire, although their authority may not have extended far beyond Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The privileges granted by Mehmed II to his Physician|journal=Bulletin of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]|year=1952|volume=14|pages=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rohschürmann|first=Michael|title="Die Tore der Freiheit"- Die Dhimma-Politik am Beispiel des jüdischen Milets im Osmanischen Reich und deren Auswirkungen auf die heutigen türkischen Juden|year=2009|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-28937-0|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that [[Mehmet II]] imposed the tax in return for separate representation of Jews after 1455, as part of a broader effort to rebuild and revive Istanbul; this may also have served to undermine the Greek patriarchy. Under the Ottoman empire there was, at time, friction between "Greeks" and "Jews"; the authorities may at times have favoured one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ankori, Zvi (1977). Greek Orthodox Theological Review. 22 (1): 17–57. "Greek Orthodox-Jewish Relations in Historic Perspective: The Jewish View." &lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''rav akçesi'' was a cash tax, rather than a tax in kind, it could be [[hypothecation|hypothecated]] to provide specific goods; tax records for 1655 show that the rav akçesi in [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] (Bitola) was a significant source of funding of drapery for [[Janissary|janissaries]]; the tax official responsible for purchases would be the same person responsible for collecting the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|issue=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims were usually taxed at a higher rate, overall, in the Ottoman empire, thanks to taxes such as rav akçesi and [[ispence]]. Jews in particular may have been singled out to pay higher rates of ispence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was well aware of this - and even aware that this would tempt nonmuslims to convert; [[Bayezit II]] ruled that courts should treat nonmuslims more leniently (including such measures as lower fines), "''so that the poll-tax payers shall not vanish''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman empire|taxes in the Ottoman empire]], rav akçesi could be affected by a complex patchwork of local rules and exemptions, including [[muafiyet]]; the Jews of Selanik ([[Thessaloniki]]) were among those exempted from taxes by a muafname after the city was conquered by [[Murad II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zachariadou|first=Elisavet|authorlink=Elizabeth Zachariadou|title=The Via Egnatia under Ottoman rule (1380-1699)|year=1992|publisher=Crete University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], '''removal jurisdiction''' sometimes exists for the [[defendant]] to move a [[Lawsuit|civil action]] filed in a [[State court (United States)|state court]] to the [[United States district court]] in the district in which the state court is located. A federal [[statute]], {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1441}} ''[[et seq]]''., governs removal. 

Generally, removal jurisdiction exists only if, at the time plaintiff filed the action in state court, the federal court had a basis for exercising [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over the action, such as [[diversity jurisdiction|diversity of citizenship of the parties]] or where plaintiff's action involves a [[federal question jurisdiction|claim under federal law]]. If removal is based solely on diversity of citizenship, removal jurisdiction does not exist if any properly joined and served defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action action is pending. 28 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;1441(b)(2).

Where removal jurisdiction exists, the defendant may remove the action to federal court by filing a notice of removal in the federal district court within 30 days after receiving the complaint. The defendant must file a copy of the notice of removal in the state court and must notify all other parties of the removal. In a case with more than one defendant named defendant, normally all defendants who have been served with [[legal process]] must join in the notice of removal. 28 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;1446.

If the party contends that removal was improper, based on any ground other than that the federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the party may move the district court to remand the case to state court within 30 days after the defendant filed the notice of removal. 28 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;1447. The district court will grant the motion if it finds that removal was improper. If the district court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction at any time before entry of final judgment, the district court must remand the action to the state court. 28 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;1447.

The [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]] creates a separate basis for defendants to remove specified [[class action]]s filed in a state court to a federal district court.

==Removal and complete diversity==

When there are multiple defendants in a case, if even just one is a citizen of the state where the lawsuit was filed, a plaintiff can successfully object to removal if the only basis for federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Caterpillar, Inc. v. Lewis]]'', {{ussc|519|61|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the rule is that diversity jurisdiction was created by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] in the Constitution to shield defendants from possible discrimination in a foreign forum (i.e., a state not their home state).&lt;ref&gt;[[Federalist No. 80]]&lt;/ref&gt; When an in-state defendant is being sued in a state court, it is expected that he will not be subject to unfair prejudice. With the exception of class actions under CAFA, every defendant must agree to remove; otherwise, the plaintiff or non-removing defendants can request [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]] for failure to satisfy the "rule of unanimity".

Notably, there is a [[circuit split]] (and several intracircuit splits) over whether every defendant ''named'' in the complaint must join in the removal notice, or whether the rule of unanimity applies only to those defendants who have been properly served as of the date of removal.  The reason this is important is that sometimes a plaintiff may not be able to (or may deliberately choose not to) formally serve ''all'' defendants on the same day, or some defendants may become aware of the existence of the complaint before it is formally served (for example, if other already-served defendants send them a "courtesy copy").  In courts that adhere to the latter rule, removal jurisdiction may be proper as long as defendants can show that all defendants who were properly served by the date of removal joined in the removal notice, even though not all named defendants joined in the notice.&lt;ref&gt;''Destfino v. Reiswig'', 630 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

A plaintiff may never remove its own case, even if the defendant files [[counterclaim]]s alleging violations of federal law by the plaintiff. A plaintiff must seek a dismissal without prejudice and refile in federal court.

There exists a small set of cases (e.g., [[workers' compensation]] actions and actions under the [[Federal Employers Liability Act]]) that are barred from removal under all circumstances.

==Removal of criminal cases==

A statute dating back to 1815, the latest analogue of which is codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1442}}, allows removal of state criminal cases where the defendant is a federal officer who alleges that the act was committed in carrying out his federal duties. Under this, a number of state criminal cases have been removed to federal court and there summarily dismissed, thus preventing trial on the merits of whether the officer or agent was in fact carrying out his official duties, or acting outside of them. A famous example of such a removal was the case of ''Idaho v. Lon Horiuchi'', alleged to have committed manslaughter of Vicki Weaver in the [[Ruby Ridge]] encounter.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S. Wilson, [http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/lib_hist/cases/criminal.html Criminal Power ], History of the Sixth Circuit&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal of Cases involving Federal Officers==
The removal jurisdiction in cases involving federal officers who are sued or criminally prosecuted, is pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1442.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1442 RET. April 09, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to removal under 28 U.S.C. 1446. The primary difference between the two statutes is that in the wording of the 1442 statute, the law provides that in the case of federal officers, the federal district court need not otherwise have subject-matter jurisdiction over the type of case presented so long as the federal officer was acting within the scope of the performance of a federal duty, where cases brought under 1446 require the requisite federal subject-matter jurisdiction specifically mentioned in the 1446 statute in order to survive.

==Timeliness of removal==

When defendants want to remove, they ordinarily must do so within 30 days of receiving the complaint, "through service or otherwise", under {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1446}}(b). An exception applies if diversity jurisdiction, and thus removal jurisdiction, is lacking at the time of the initial pleading in state court, but becomes available within a year after initiation of the suit. In such case, defendants may remove under 28 U.S.C. §1446(b) (second paragraph). For example, a federal court would not initially have removal jurisdiction over claims under state law brought by a Texas citizen against another Texas citizen and a New York citizen. However, should the Texas defendant be dropped from the claim, the New York citizen can remove if one year has not passed since the initiation of the suit. Some courts permit equitable tolling of the one-year limitation of §1446(b) if the original complaint was an attempt in bad faith to evade federal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Tedford v. Warner-Lambert Co.'', 327 F.3d 423 (5th Cir. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Defendants may remove state law claims for which a federal court has only [[supplemental jurisdiction]], if they share a common nucleus of operative fact with claims based on federal law. The federal court has the [[discretion]] to accept the case as a whole or remand the issues of state law, however the court must apply state substantive law to state law claims, as opposed to federal law- a practice which is inline to actions brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983.

==Other issues==
{{citations needed|date=September 2018}}
State courts do not adjudicate whether an action could be properly removed. Once a defendant has filed a notice to remove a case, jurisdiction is transferred automatically and ''immediately'' by operation of law from the state court to the federal court. Any [[objection (law)|objection]] to removal must be presented to the federal court. If a federal court finds that the notice of removal was in fact defective, or that the federal court does not have jurisdiction, the case is [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed to the state court.

A defendant used to have to formally petition the federal court for the right to remove, and jurisdiction was not transferred until the federal court entered a formal order to that effect. The petition procedure was abolished around 1980 by Congress and replaced with the simple filing-of-notice removal procedure, although federal courts still see the occasional petition for removal or a motion for remand due to the lack of such a petition.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

There is no reverse "removal". That is, if a case originates in a federal court, there is no ability for a defendant to remove a case from federal court into state court. If the federal court lacks jurisdiction, the case is dismissed. Only cases that originate in a state court and are improperly removed to a federal court may be sent back to the state court where they started.

A defendant can waive the right to remove by contract, although courts take different positions about what language is necessary to create a waiver.&lt;ref&gt;Coale, Visosky &amp; Cochrane, [http://600camp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Right-to-Remove-Article.pdf ''Contractual Waiver of the Right to Remove to Federal Court''],” 29 Rev. Litig. 327 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Remand (court procedure)|Remand]] orders are not generally appealable {{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, but may be appealed in the case of removals brought under the [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]] or where the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation appeals a remand order under 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(C). An alleged waiver of removal rights is also appealable, since the issue is not jurisdiction but the legal effect of the defendant's actions and agreements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5147">The '''Reward Work Act''' of 2018 ([https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2605/text S.2605] and [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr6096 HR 6096]) is a proposed United States [[Act of Congress]] to ban unjustified stock buy-backs, and to require every listed company enable employees to elect one-third of the [[board of directors]]. The Bill was sponsored initially by Senators [[Tammy Baldwin]], [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Brian Schatz]] in March 2018, and joined in April 2018 by [[Kirsten Gillibrand]]. It was sponsored in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in June 2018 by [[Keith Ellison]] and [[Ro Khanna]].

==Contents==
Section 2 prohibits stock buybacks on the open market.

Section 3 requires one-third board representation for employees of listed companies. Specifically, this amends §12b of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] (15 USC 78l(b)(1)) to add "No issuer may register securities on a national exchange unless at least 1⁄3 of the issuer’s directors are chosen by the issuing company’s employees in a one-employee-one-vote election process." It then requires the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], consulting with the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to make regulations ensuring democratic election processes, and 1/3 of an issuer's board to "be composed of employee representatives within 2 years of the date of enactment of this Act."

==Reception==
The problem of stock buybacks as a source of US income inequality had become highly visible as a result of the award-winning 2014 publication of the ''Harvard Business Review'' article, "Profits Without Prosperity: Stock Buybacks Manipulate the Market and Leave Most Americans Worse Off," by [[William Lazonick]].&lt;ref&gt;William Lazonick, "Profits Without Prosperity" ''Harvard Business Review'', September 2014: 46-55 [https://hbr.org/search?term=william+lazonick]&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was welcomed by the [[Roosevelt Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;'STATEMENT: Financial Economy Experts at Roosevelt Institute React to Bill Introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) to Ban Stock Buybacks' (22 March 2018) [http://rooseveltinstitute.org/statement-financial-economy-experts-roosevelt-institute-react-bill-introduced-by-senator-tammy-baldwin-d-wi-ban-stock-buybacks/ Roosevelt Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. D Matthews, 'Workers don’t have much say in corporations.

*[[AFL-CIO]]
*[[Communication Workers of America]]
*[[Public Citizen]]
*[[Take on Wall Street]]
*[[Americans for Financial Reform]]

A Civis poll found people in "the “lean Democrat” category voted 75% in favor of the question, and just 9% opposed. Around 43% of the “lean Republican” category supported the concept, while 31% opposed, and the pure Republican category saw 4% more opposed than in favor. But overall, a clear majority of people favor the concept."&lt;ref&gt;E Anzelotti, 'Want Fairer Workplaces?

'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for journalists and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats.

Journalists can face violence and intimidation for exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression. The range of threats they are confronted to include murder, kidnapping, hostage-taking, offline and online harassment, intimidation, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture. [[Women in journalism|Women journalists]] also face specific dangers and are especially vulnerable to sexual assault, "whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work; mob-related sexual violence aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Increasingly, journalists, and particularly women journalists, are facing abuse and harassment online, such as hate speech, cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking, docking, trolling, public shaming and intimidation and threats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Violence against journalists==

=== Killings of journalists===
[[File:Journalists killed by year and by region 2012-2016 .jpg|thumb|251x251px|Number of journalists killed by year and region. UNESCO's data, ''World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development 2018.'']]

From 2012 to 2016, [[UNESCO]]’s Director-General condemned the killing of 530 journalists, an average of two deaths per week.&lt;ref&gt;Data on the killings of journalists correspond to those condemned by UNESCO's Director-General, following Resolution 29 adopted by the 29th session of the General Conference. Each year, UNESCO's Director-General sends requests to [[Member states of UNESCO|member states]] asking them to inform the organization of the status of ongoing investigations into the killing of journalists about whom the Director-General has made public statements. UNESCO's statistics related to impunity are based on this data, which is published biennially in the Director-General's report to the IPDC Intergovernmental Council and in alternate years in the World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Report, this data is also found on UNESCO's website: https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt; During the previous five-year period, 2007 to 2011, UNESCO recorded 316 killings. The year 2012 proved to be the deadliest year on record, with 124 journalists killed. The majority of journalists killed between 2012 and 2016&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;See, Time to break the cycle of violence against journalists, highlights from the UNESCO Director-General's 2016 report on the Safety of Journalists and Dangers of Impunity: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246409e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; occurred in countries experiencing [[War|armed conflict]], representing 56 per cent of overall killings.&lt;ref&gt;Countries were considered to be in armed conflict if listed in the annual reports of the UN Secretary-General on the protection of civilians in armed conflict.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) nearly 50 per cent of those whose death was confirmed to be related to their work as journalist were murdered, while 36 per cent were caught in the [[crossfire]] and 14 per cent killed while on dangerous assignment.[[Safety of journalists#cite note-6|&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] According to the NGO, political groups were the most likely source of violence (36 per cent) in these killings, followed by military officials (22 per cent) and unknown sources (20 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists. 2017. Journalists Killed since 1992. Available at https://www.cpj.org/killed/. Retrieved 8 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the reliance on [[Freelancer|freelance journalists]] by news organizations is increasing, a rising proportion of journalists killed have been freelance. UNESCO's study, ''[[World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development]] Global Report 2017/2018'', has found that over the past five years, 113 freelance journalists were killed, representing 21 per cent of the total. Freelance journalists are particularly vulnerable, often working alone on stories, in dangerous environments, and without the same level of assistance and protection as staff-journalists.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Director-General. 2016. The Safety of Journalists and the Danger of Impunity: Report by the Director-General to the Intergovernmental Council of the IPDC (Thirtieth Session). Paris: UNESCO. Available at &lt;en.unesco.org/dg-report/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same period, according to UNESCO data, the number of journalists targeted who work primarily online fluctuated significantly, but accounts for 14 per cent of journalists killed overall. Journalists and crew who work primarily in television experienced the most casualties (166), followed by those mainly working for [[Printing press|print]] (142), radio (118), online (75) and those working across multiple platforms (29).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Terrorism and increasing risks===
Terrorism represents a direct and growing threat for journalists, which has taken the form of kidnappings, executions threats or hacking.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/09/08/simon.press.freedom.911/&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1970s, the general policy of welcoming journalists into areas of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] control changed. Organizations such as the [[Khmer Rouge]] in Cambodia, the [[Red Brigades]] in Italy, the [[Shining Path]] in Peru and the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) in [[Algeria]] targeted journalists, considering them as the auxiliaries of the powers they were combating, and thus as enemies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terrorism and the Media. A Handbook for Journalists.|last=Marthoz|first=Jean-Paul|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002470/247074E.pdf|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 1997, more than 100 journalists and media workers were killed in [[Algeria]]. During the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975-1990), kidnapping international journalists became a common tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Act for the Disappeared: http://www.actforthedisappeared.com/our-cause/17000-disappeared-lebanon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Brooke, and Reynolds, Amy, Terrorism and The Press. An Uneasy Relationship, Peter Lang, 2009, 208 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ), 40% of the journalists murdered in 2015 were killed by groups claiming adherence to [[Islamic extremism|radical Islam]]. International press correspondents, in particular, are considered potential hostages, or sacrificial lambs, whose execution is dramatized to serve terrorist propaganda. This happened to [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]], [[Steven Sotloff]] (United States) and [[Kenji Goto]] (Japan), who were beheaded by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Daesh]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cpj.org/blog/2016/06/infographic-islamic-states-assault-on-the-press.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Trauma and the emotional impact of witnessing terrorism is also an issue for journalists, as they may experience [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], irritation and physical problems such as fatigue or headaches. It can also lead to [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], which can cause incapacitating feelings of horror, fear and [[Depression (mood)|despair]]. According to the study Eyewitness Media Hub of 2015, 40% of the journalists who were interviewed admitted that viewing video testimonies had had negative effects on their personal life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eyewitnessmediahub.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[protection of sources]] and surveillance is one of the major issues in the coverage of terrorism in order to protect [[witness]]es and interviewees against [[reprisal]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Impunity for crimes against journalists===
There is a continuing trend of [[impunity]] for crimes against journalists, with over 90% of cases of killings of journalists unresolved.The Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], Edison Lanza considers impunity as a key obstacle to ensuring journalists' safety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Frank William La Rue|Frank La Rue]], UNESCO's former Assistant Director-General for [[Information and communications technology|Communication and Information]] considers that its "root cause has to be attributed to lack of political will to pursue investigations, including for fear of reprisals from criminal networks in addition to inadequate [[Legal doctrine|legal frameworks]], a weak [[Judiciary|judicial system]], lack of resources allocated to [[law enforcement]], negligence, and corruption".&lt;ref&gt;La Rue, Frank. 2011. Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Submission to Human Rights Council. Switzerland: United Nations General Assembly. Available at http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf. Retrieved 17 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Status of judicial inquiry into killings of journalists, UNESCO 2006-2016.jpg|thumb|248x248px|Status of judicial inquiry into killings of journalists, ''UNESCO's 2018'' ''World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development''.]]
UNESCO has set up a mechanism to monitor the status of judicial enquiries into the killings of journalists. Each year, UNESCO’s Director-General sends a request to [[Member states of UNESCO|Member States]]&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/council&lt;/ref&gt; in which killings of journalists have occurred asking them to inform UNESCO of the status of ongoing investigations on each killing condemned by the Organization. UNESCO records the responses to these requests&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in a public report submitted every two years to the [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC) Council by the Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf

https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC's 2016 Report is summarized in the "Time to break the cycle of violence against journalists" publication which highlights key findings, provides analysis of the killings, and of Member States responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time to break the cycle of violence against journalists|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246409e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, UNESCO sent letters to 62 Member States requesting information on the status of unresolved cases that occurred between 2006 and 2016. Based on Member State responses, the percentage of resolved cases has remained low, at less than 10%. Cumulatively, since UNESCO began requesting information on the judicial follow-up to journalists’ killings condemned by the Director-General, the Organization has received information from 63 out of 75 Member States. The information covers 622 cases out of a total of 930 recorded by UNESCO between 2006 and 2016 (67 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;This represents the status of judicial inquiries as of 9 October 2017 for killings that occurred between 2006 and 2016.

At its 68th session in 2013, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution A/RES/68/163 proclaiming 2 November as the [[International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists]]. The day acts to promote understanding of the broader issues that accompany impunity and to strengthen international commitment to ensuring a safe and enabling environment for journalists.&lt;ref&gt;See resolution A/RES/68/163: https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N13/449/23/PDF/N1344923.pdf?OpenElement&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other attacks on the safe practice of journalism===
According to data compiled by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ), the imprisonment of journalists on charges relating to anti-state activities, [[Defamation|criminal defamation]], [[Blasphemy law|blasphemy]], [[Revenge|retaliation]] or on no charge at all, has reportedly continued to rise. In 2016, the CPJ reported that 259 journalists were imprisoned worldwide on a range of charges, the highest number since the non-governmental organization began keeping records in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists. 2016. 2016 prison census: 259 journalists jailed worldwide.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporters Without Borders]] (RSF)—which tracks the imprisonment of [[Citizen journalism|citizen journalists]], [[Netizen]]s and media contributors, along with professional journalists—reported that 348 journalists were detained in 2016 on a range of charges, an increase of six per cent on 2015 figures. 2016 reportedly saw the proportion of [[Women in journalism|women journalists]] detained more than double, with nearly half of those detained located in the Asia-Pacific region. The Western Europe and North America region has the highest number of journalists imprisoned, holding 34 per cent of imprisoned journalists worldwide with 73 journalists imprisoned in Turkey in 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;RSF. 2016.

Threats and actual cases of violence and imprisonment, as well as harassment, are reported to have forced a large number of local journalists into exile each year. Between 1 June 2012 and 31 May 2015, at least 272 journalists reportedly went into exile for work-related persecution worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists. n.d. Journalists Forced Into Exile Since 2010. Available at https://cpj.org/exile/.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-censorship===
One survey conducted by [[PEN America]] of over 520 writers found that the majority reported concerns about [[Surveillance|government surveillance]], which led to a reluctance to write, research or speak about certain topics.&lt;ref&gt;Pen America. 2013.

== Digital safety for journalists==
[[File:Types of threats to the digital safety of journalism, WTR UNESCO.png|thumb|Types of threats to the digital safety of journalism]]
[[Surveillance]], [[data storage]] capabilities and digital attack technologies are becoming more sophisticated, less expensive and more pervasive, making journalists increasingly vulnerable to digital attacks from both state and [[Non-state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis-Boire, Morgan. 2015. How governments are using spyware to attack free speech. Amnesty International. Available at https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/08/how-governments-are-using-spyware-to-attack-free-speech/&lt;/ref&gt;

In a number of states across multiple regions, broadly defined legislative acts have been seen by some as working to silence digital [[dissent]], prosecute [[Whistleblower|whistle blowers]] and expand arbitrary surveillance across multiple digital platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cyber-harassment===
In late 2016, the [[International Press Institute]] launched the OnTheLine database, a project that aims to systematically monitor [[Cyberbullying|online harassment]] of journalists as a response to their reporting. As of July 2017, the project had collected 1,065 instances of online harassment in the two countries ([[Turkey]] and [[Austria]]) in which the project collected data. In [[Pakistan]], the Digital Rights Foundation has launched the country's first cyber harassment [[helpline]] for journalists, which aims to provide [[legal advice]], digital security support, psychological counselling and a referral system to victims.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Rights Foundation. n.d. Cyber Harassment Helpline. Digital Rights Foundation. Available at https://digitalrightsfoundation.pk/services/.&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2017, the helpline handled a total of 563 cases since its launch six months earlier, with 63 per cent of calls received from women and 37 per cent from men.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Rights Foundation. 2017.

=== Threats on women journalists===
Similar to their male counterparts, [[Women in journalism|women journalists]], whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of attacks while exercising their profession but are also particularly vulnerable to attacks of a sexual nature such as, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], or even rape. Such attacks can come from those attempting to silence their coverage but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017.

Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly 1,000 women journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women's Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013, Available at https://newssafety.org/uploads/IWMF.FINALA.PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016.

=== International organizations===
[[File:Sustainable Development Goals.jpg|thumb|The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals]]

==== International instruments====
International legal instruments represent one of the key tools that can support the creation of an enabling environment for the safety of journalists. These include the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; the [[Geneva Conventions]]; the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]; the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] Resolution 2005/81;&lt;ref&gt;http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/alldocs.aspx?doc_id=11120&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations Security Council]] Resolution 1738 (2006).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/sc8929.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The safety of journalists and their role in promoting inclusive and sustainable societies has been recognized by the United Nations in the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. [[Sustainable Development Goal 16|Goal 16]] outlines the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective and inclusive institutions at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/peace-justice/|title=Peace, justice and strong institutions |work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012 there has been a total of 12 [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Cyprus|UN resolutions]] on safety of journalists adopted by several UN organs.

In December 2015, Resolution A/70/125 of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] recognized serious threats to freedom of expression in the context of reviewing progress since the 2005 [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS). The Resolution called for the protection of journalists and media workers.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. 2015.

The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]] also produces reports on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity (in 2014 A/69/268,&lt;ref name="documents-dds-ny.un.org"&gt;https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N14/497/55/PDF/N1449755.pdf?OpenElement&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 A/HRC/30/68&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session30/Pages/ListReports.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, 2017 A/72/290&lt;ref&gt;https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/1304392/files/A_72_290-FR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Sustainable Development Goal 16|SDG 16.10.1]] relates to the number of verified cases of killings, kidnapping, [[Forced disappearance|enforced disappearance]], [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary detention]] and torture of journalists, associated media personnel, trade unionists and human rights defenders. The indicator was decided upon by the United Nations Statistical Commission for tracking progress in the achievement of target 10.

==== The UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists====
The United Nations (UN) Plan of Action, coordinated by UNESCO, was elaborated to provide a comprehensive, coherent, and action-oriented UN-wide approach to the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity. Since its launch, it has become a guiding framework for activities in this area. Following its endorsement by the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination in 2012, the UN Plan of Action has been welcomed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], UNESCO and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]]. Outside of the UN, it has been referred to by various regional bodies, and it has given impetus to and fostered a spirit of cooperation between the UN and various stakeholders in many countries.

==== UNESCO====
[[File:UNESCO-Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.jpg|alt=World Press Freedom day|thumb|UNESCO-Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize, [[World Press Freedom Day]]]]
[[UNESCO]] celebrates [[World Press Freedom Day]] every year on 3 May during which the Guillermo Cano Prize&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/prizes/guillermo-cano&lt;/ref&gt; is attributed to honor the work of an individual or an organization defending or promoting freedom of expression.

===== UNESCO main activities on Safety of Journalists =====

* Following a request from the Office of the UN Secretary General, UNESCO coordinated together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) the formal establishment of a focal points system for the safety of journalists in relevant United Nations entities.
* UNESCO's work on the safety of journalists focuses on six areas: public awareness; standards creation and policy development; monitoring and reporting; capacity building; academic research; and strengthening coalitions.
* The Organization is intensifying its efforts to strengthen the capacity of Member States to implement, on a voluntary basis, mechanisms to prevent attacks against journalists, to protect journalists, and to prosecute the perpetrators of these attacks.
* UNESCO also focuses on activities to raise awareness and train representatives of the judiciary, law enforcement agencies and parliaments on the importance of freedom of the press and the safety of journalists.
* UNESCO is also placing increased emphasis on tackling the specific threats faced by women journalists, both online and offline.

===== UNESCO's Journalists Safety Indicators=====
UNESCO's IPDC developed the Journalists Safety Indicators (JSI) to "pinpoint significant matters that show, or impact upon, the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity".&lt;ref name="en.unesco.org"&gt;https://en.unesco.org/themes/safety-of-journalists/journalists-safety-indicators&lt;/ref&gt; These indicators map the key features that can help assess safety of journalists, and determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;For international-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260892E.pdf

For national-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260893E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis based on the Journalists Safety indicators have been conducted in Guatemala (2013), Kenya (2016), Nepal (2016), Pakistan (2013–2014).&lt;ref name="en.unesco.org"/&gt;

==== The organization for security and cooperation in europe====
The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] Representative on Freedom of the Media performs an early warning function and provides rapid response to serious noncompliance with regard to free media and free expression. The Representative maintains direct contacts with authorities, media and civil society representatives and other parties and shares his/ her observations and recommendations with the OSCE participating States twice a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Regional organizations===

==== The Council of Europe====
In May 2014, the [[Council of the European Union]] adopted the European Union Human Rights Guidelines on Freedom of Expression Online and Offline,&lt;ref&gt;https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/eu_human_rights_guidelines_on_freedom_of_expression_online_and_offline_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that the European Union would ‘take all appropriate steps to ensure the protection of journalists, both in terms of preventive measures and by urging effective investigations when violations occur’. In April 2014, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers adopted a resolution on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors, which called for concerted international efforts and led to the creation of an online platform for monitoring infringements of freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 2016.

[[File:LED bulbs.jpg|thumb|An assortment of [[LED lamps]] commercially available as of 2010 as replacements for screw-in bulbs, including floodlight fixtures (left), reading light (center), household lamps (center right and bottom), and low-power accent light (right) applications]]
'''Solid-state lighting''' ('''SSL''') refers to a type of [[lighting]] that uses [[light-emitting diode|semiconductor light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLED), or [[polymer light-emitting diode]]s (PLED) as sources of illumination rather than [[electrical filament]]s, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (used in [[arc lamps]] such as [[fluorescent lamps]]), or [[gas lighting|gas]].

The term "[[solid state (electronics)|solid state]]" refers commonly to light emitted by solid-state electroluminescence, as opposed to incandescent bulbs (which use thermal radiation) or fluorescent tubes. Compared to incandescent lighting, SSL creates visible light with reduced heat generation and less energy dissipation. Most common "white" LEDs convert blue light from a solid-state device to an (approximate) white light spectrum using photoluminescence, the same principle used in conventional fluorescent tubes.

The typically small mass of a solid-state electronic lighting device provides for greater resistance to shock and vibration compared to brittle glass tubes/bulbs and long, thin filament wires. They also eliminate filament evaporation, potentially increasing the [[service life|life span]] of the illumination device.

Solid-state lighting is often used in [[traffic light]]s and is also used frequently in modern vehicle lights, street and parking lot lights, train marker lights, building exteriors, remote controls etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainca.org/techshowcase/ssl/case_studies California Sustainability Alliance Solid State Lighting], Received July 24th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Controlling the light emission of LEDs may be done most effectively by using the principles of [[nonimaging optics]].&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
Solid-state lighting has made significant advances in industry. In the [[Stage lighting|entertainment lighting]] industry, standard incandescent tungsten-halogen lamps are being replaced by solid-state light lighting fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Kho, Mu-Jeong, Javed, T., Mark, R., Maier, E., and David, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8557">'''South Dakota House Bill 1008''', also known as '''House Bill 1008''', '''HB 1008''', and the '''Bathroom Bill''', was a [[Bill (law)|bill]] passed by the [[South Dakota Legislature]] in 2016 and vetoed by [[Governor of South Dakota]] [[Dennis Daugaard]]. The purpose of the bill was to restrict bathroom and locker room use by [[transgender]] students to facilities that matched their [[biological sex|sex assigned at birth]], not their [[gender identity]]. It was the first such [[bathroom bill]] to be passed in a state legislature in the U.S. and sparked a chain of similar bills across the nation. HB 1008 was opposed by several [[LGBT rights]] organizations, such as the [[Human Rights Campaign|HRC]], [[GLSEN]], and [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]].

==Content==
The bill's purpose was to require transgender students in public schools to use bathroom, shower, and locker facilities that matched their "chromosomes and anatomy at birth".&lt;ref name="sdhb1008"/&gt; It would have also restricted their access to facilities that matched their [[gender identity]], while requiring school districts to provide adequate accommodations for transgender students if requested by that student.

==Legislative process==
HB 1008 was sponsored by Representative [[Fred Deutsch]], who was backed by Representatives [[Scott Craig]], [[Al Novstrup]], Jeff Partridge, [[Lance Russell (politician)|Lance Russell]], Lee Schoenbeck, [[Mike Verchio]], and Larry Zikmund; and Senators [[Brock Greenfield]], Terri Haverly, [[Ried Holien]], Betty Olson, and [[Ernie Otten]].&lt;ref name="sdhb1008"/&gt;

The bill was first proposed to the [[South Dakota House of Representatives]] on January 12, 2016. It was then referred to the House State Affairs Committee on January 13, and on January 25, it was amended and passed 10-3, at which point it was sent back to the House. The House amended the bill to include the language "anatomy as identified at birth" and passed it 58-10 on January 27. HB 1008 was passed in the [[South Dakota Senate]] 20-15 on February 16 and was sent to the [[South Dakota Governor]] [[Dennis Daugaard]]'s office on February 23.&lt;ref name="sdhb1008"/&gt;

Prior to his decision, Daugaard initially said that he had never knowingly met a transgender person and felt he did not need to before making a decision on whether of not to sign the bill into law. He later agreed to meet with transgender people on February 23, which he said "put a human face" to the bill.&lt;ref name="govmeet"/&gt; Daugaard vetoed the bill on March 2, stating that the bill did not solve any pressing issues in the state, and that decisions should be made on a local level.&lt;ref name="cnnveto"/&gt; A veto override in the House failed 36-29 the next day, which Deutsch did not support, in favor of letting the bill die for passage at another time.&lt;ref name="timevetoover"/&gt; Deutsch has said that he would like to revive the bill for the 2017 legislative session.&lt;ref name="argusreturn"/&gt;

==Reaction==

===Support===
HB 1008 was supported by several lawmakers and organizations, such as the [[Heritage Foundation]], Family Heritage Alliance Action, and the Roman Catholic bishops of South Dakota, saying that the bill protected the privacy of children.&lt;ref name="nytimesveto"/&gt; [[South Dakota Senate|Senator]] [[David Omdahl]] pledged support for the bill, saying he believed it would protect child innocence, and calling transgender people "twisted".&lt;ref name="foxpass"/&gt;

===Criticism===
The bill was opposed by several [[LGBT rights]] and children's organizations and celebrities, who said the bill violated transgender students' right to conform to their [[gender identity]]. Among these organizations were the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[Human Rights Campaign]], [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]], and [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref name="hrchb1008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glsenhb1008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acluhb1008"/&gt; [[Laverne Cox]] and [[Caitlyn Jenner]], two transgender activists, were among the celebrities who opposed the measure. Several tourists threatened to boycott the state over social media — South Dakota brings in approximately $3.8 billion in tourism revenue annually.&lt;ref name="latimesveto"/&gt;
Critics of the bill also said that it violated [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], which protects transgender students from public school discrimination, and that passing the bill would have meant South Dakota losing federal funding.&lt;ref name="nytimesveto"/&gt;

{{Constitutional history of Canada}}

The '''Statute of Westminster 1931''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and modified versions of it are now domestic law within [[Australia]] and [[Canada]]; it has been repealed in [[New Zealand]] and [[implied repeal|implicitly]] in former [[Dominion]]s that are [[Commonwealth realm#Former_Commonwealth_realms|no longer Commonwealth realms]]. Passed on 11 December 1931, the act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1931/4/pdfs/ukpga_19310004_en.pdf |title=Statute of Westminster 1931 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Legislation, Government of UK |publisher=Government of UK |access-date=10 February 2017 |quote=All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; either immediately or upon ratification, effectively both established the legislative independence of the self-governing Dominions of the [[British Empire]] from the United Kingdom and bound them all to seek each other's approval for changes to monarchical titles and the common line of succession. It thus became a statutory embodiment of the principles of equality and common allegiance to [[the Crown]] set out in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]]. As the Statute removed nearly all of the British Parliament's authority to legislate for the Dominions, it had the effect of making the Dominions fully sovereign nations in their own right. It was a crucial step in the development of the Dominions as separate states.

The Statute of Westminster's relevance today is that it sets the basis for the continuing relationship between the Commonwealth realms and the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2004-05/895 |title=Early day motion 895: Morganatic Marriage and the Statute of Westminster 1931 |first=Andrew |last=Mackinlay |date=10 March 2005 |publisher=Queen's Printer |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The Statute of Westminster gave effect to certain political resolutions passed by the [[Imperial Conference]]s of [[1926 Imperial Conference|1926]] and [[1930 Imperial Conference|1930]]; in particular, the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]]. The main effect was the removal of the ability of the British parliament to legislate for the Dominions, part of which also required the repeal of the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865]] in its application to the Dominions. King [[George V]] expressed his desire that the laws of royal succession be exempt from the statute's provisions, but it was determined that this would be contrary to the principles of equality set out in the Balfour Declaration. Both Canada and the Irish Free State pushed for the ability to amend the succession laws themselves and section 2(2) (allowing a Dominion to amend or repeal laws of paramount force, such as the succession laws, insofar as they are part of the law of that Dominion) was included in the Statute of Westminster at Canada's insistence.&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;{{cite AV media| people=[[Anne Twomey]]| title=Professor Anne Twomey - Succession to the Crown: foiled by Canada?| medium=Digital video| publisher=University College London| location=London| date=18 September 2014| url=http://vimeo.com/108335929}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Statute was passed, the British parliament could no longer make laws for the Dominions, other than with the request and consent of the government of that Dominion. Before then, the Dominions had legally been self-governing colonies of the United Kingdom. However, the Statute had the effect of making them sovereign nations once they adopted it.

The Statute provides in section 4:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion, unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also provides in section 2(1):
&lt;blockquote&gt;No law and no provision of any law made after the commencement of this Act by the Parliament of a Dominion shall be void or inoperative on the ground that it is repugnant to the Law of England, or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or to any order, rule or regulation made under any such Act, and the powers of the Parliament of a Dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend any such Act, order, rule or regulation in so far as the same is part of the law of the Dominion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The whole Statute applied to Canada, the [[Irish Free State]], and the [[Union of South Africa]] without the need for any acts of ratification; the governments of those countries gave their consent to the application of the law to their respective jurisdiction. Section 10 of the Statute provided that sections 2 to 6 would apply in the other three Dominions—Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]—only after the parliament of that Dominion had legislated to adopt them.

Since 1931, over a dozen new Commonwealth realms have been created, all of which now hold the same powers as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand over matters of change to the monarchy, though the Statute of Westminster is not part of their laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Twomey| first=Anne| title=Changing the Rules of Succession to the Throne| date=October 2011| page=11| publisher=Sydney Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland and South Africa are now republics and Newfoundland is part of Canada.

===Australia===
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2017}}
Australia adopted sections 2 to 6 of the Statute of Westminster with the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]], in order to clarify the validity of certain Australian legislation relating to [[World War II|the Second World War]]; the adoption was backdated to 3 September 1939, the date that Britain and Australia joined the War.

Adopting section 2 of the Statute clarified that the Commonwealth parliament was able to legislate inconsistently with British legislation, adopting section 3 clarified that it could legislate with extraterritorial effect.  Adopting section 4 clarified that Britain could legislate with effect on Australia as a whole only with Australia's request and consent.

Nonetheless, under section 9 of the Statute, on matters not within Commonwealth power Britain could still legislate with effect in all or any of the Australian states, without the agreement of the Commonwealth although only to the extent of "the constitutional practice existing before the commencement" of the Statute.  However, this capacity was never used. In particular, it was not used to implement the result of the [[Western Australian secession referendum, 1933]], as it did not have the support of the Australian government.
 
All British power to legislate with effect in Australia ended with the [[Australia Act 1986]], the British version of which says that it was passed with the request and consent of the Australian parliament, which had obtained the concurrence of the Australian states.&lt;ref name=SydLaw&gt;{{harvnb| Twomey| 2011| p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
This statute limited the legislative authority of the British parliament over Canada, effectively giving the country legal autonomy as a self-governing Dominion, though the British parliament retained the power to amend Canada's constitution at the request of the [[Parliament of Canada]]. That authority remained in effect until the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], which transferred it to Canada, the final step to achieving full sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/proclamation-constitution-act-1982/Pages/proclamation-constitution-act-1982.aspx  |title=Proclamation of the Constitution Act, 1982 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 5, 2014 |website=Canada.ca |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/a-statute-worth-75-cheers/article1329730/|title=A statute worth 75 cheers|first=|date=March 17, 2009|access-date=10 February 2017|location=Toronto|author=|newspaper=Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/2017/canada-is-celebrating-150-years-of-what-exactly-1.3883315 |title=Canada is celebrating 150 years of… what, exactly? |last=Couture |first=Christa |date=January 1, 2017 |website=CBC |publisher=CBC |access-date=February 10, 2017 |quote=... the Constitution Act itself cleaned up a bit of unfinished business from the Statute of Westminster in 1931, in which Britain granted each of the Dominions full legal autonomy if they chose to accept it. All but one Dominion — that would be us, Canada — chose to accept every resolution. Our leaders couldn't decide on how to amend the Constitution, so that power stayed with Britain until 1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[British North America Acts]]—the written elements (in 1931) of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]]—were excluded from the application of the statute because of disagreements between the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] and the federal government over how the British North America Acts could be otherwise amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;page=hist&amp;doc=westminster-eng.htm| last=Privy Council Office| title=Intergovernmental Affairs &gt; History &gt; Why, in 1931, Canada Chose Not to Exercise its Full Autonomy as Provided for Under the Statute of Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disagreements were resolved only in time for the passage of the [[Canada Act 1982]], thus completing the [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution to Canada. At that time, the Canadian parliament also repealed sections 4 and 7(1) of the Statute of Westminster.&lt;ref name=SydLaw/&gt; The Statute of Westminster remains a part of the constitution of Canada by virtue of section 52(2)(b) of the Constitution Act, 1982.

As a consequence of the statute's adoption, the Parliament of Canada gained the ability to abolish appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. Criminal appeals were abolished in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code Amendment Act'', S.C. 1932–33, c. 53, s. 17&lt;/ref&gt; while civil appeals continued until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;''Supreme Court Amendment Act'', S.C. 1949 (2nd. session), c. 37, s. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the Statute of Westminster meant that changes in British legislation governing the succession to the throne no longer automatically applied to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/cru/2013/02/the_royal_succession_and_the_d.html |title=The royal succession and the de-patriation of the Canadian Constitution |author=Anne Twomey |date= February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish Free State===
The [[Irish Free State]] never formally adopted the Statute of Westminster, its [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] taking the view that the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921 had already ended Westminster's right to legislate for the Free State.&lt;ref name=Mohr2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Thomas|year=2011|title=British Imperial Statutes and Irish Sovereignty: Statutes Passed After the Creation of the Irish Free State|journal=Journal of Legal History|volume=32|issue=1|pages=61–85|issn=0144-0365|doi=10.1080/01440365.2011.559120|url=http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/6058/British_Imperial_Statutes_and_Irish_Sovereignty.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Free State's constitution]] gave [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|the Oireachtas]] "sole and exclusive power of making laws". Hence, even before 1931, the Free State did not arrest [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] [[desertion|deserters]] on its territory, even though the UK believed post-1922 British laws gave the Free State's [[Garda Síochána]] the power to do so.&lt;ref name=Mohr2011/&gt; The UK's [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922]] said, however, "{{nowrap|[n]othing}} in the [Free State] Constitution shall be construed as prejudicing the power of [the British] Parliament to make laws affecting the Irish Free State in any case where, in accordance with constitutional practice, Parliament would make laws affecting other self-governing Dominions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Thomas|date=2010|title=British Imperial Statutes and Irish Law: Imperial Statutes Passed Before the Creation of the Irish Free State|journal=Journal of Legal History|volume=31|issue=3|pages=299–321|doi=10.1080/01440365.2010.525930|url=http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/6055/British_Imperial_Statutes_and_Irish_Law.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Motions of approval of the Report of the Commonwealth Conference had been passed by the [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil]] and [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad]] in May 1931&lt;ref name=Mohr2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1931/07/17/00005.asp|title=Dáil Éireann debate - Friday, 17 Jul 1931|date=17 July 1931|website=debates.oireachtas.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/1931/07/23/00003.asp|title=Seanad Éireann debate - Thursday, 23 Jul 1931|date=23 July 1931|website=debates.oireachtas.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final form of the Statute of Westminster included the Irish Free State among the Dominions the British parliament could not legislate for without the Dominion's request and consent.&lt;ref&gt;Statute of Westminster 1931, §§1,10&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the UK government had wanted to exclude from the Statute of Westminster the legislation underpinning the 1921 treaty, from which the Free State's constitution had emerged. [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President]] [[W. T. Cosgrave]] objected, although he promised the Executive Council would not amend the legislation unilaterally. The other Dominions backed Cosgrave and, when an amendment to similar effect was proposed at Westminster by [[John Gretton]], parliament duly voted it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1931/nov/24/new-clause-saving-with-respect-to-irish|title=NEW CLAUSE.—(Saving with respect to Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.) (Hansard, 24 November 1931)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Statute became law in the UK, [[Patrick McGilligan]], the [[Minister for External Affairs (Ireland)|Free State Minister for External Affairs]], stated: "It is a solemn declaration by the British people through their representatives in Parliament that the powers inherent in the Treaty position are what we have proclaimed them to be for the last ten years."&lt;ref name=difp1317&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1317 |title=Press statement by Patrick McGilligan on the Statute of Westminster, Dublin |date=11 December 1931 |nopp=Y |page=No. 617 NAI DFA 5/3 |work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] |accessdate=5 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to present the Statute as largely the fruit of the Free State's efforts to secure for the other Dominions the same benefits it already enjoyed under the treaty.&lt;ref name=difp1317 /&gt;

After [[Éamon de Valera]] led [[Fianna Fáil]] to victory in the [[Irish general election, 1932|Free State election of 1932]], he began removing the monarchical elements of the constitution, beginning with the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]]. De Valera initially considered invoking the Statute of Westminster in making these changes, but [[John J. Hearne]] advised him not to.&lt;ref name=Mohr2011/&gt; Abolishing the Oath of Allegiance in effect [[Denunciation (international law)|abrogated]] the 1921 treaty. Generally, the British thought that this was morally objectionable but legally permitted by the Statute of Westminster. Robert Lyon Moore, a [[Southern Irish unionism|southern unionist]] from [[County Donegal]], challenged the legality of the abolition in the [[Courts of Justice Act 1924|Free State courts]] and then appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC) in London.&lt;ref name="moore_v_AG"/&gt; However, the Free State had also abolished the right of appeal to the JCPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1933/en/act/pub/0045/print.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, the JCPC ruled that both abolitions were valid under the Statute of Westminster.&lt;ref name="moore_v_AG"&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/(WebFiles)/34740D4947655F668025765E0036AE51/$FILE/Moore%20v%20AG_1935.rtf ''Moore v Attorney General''] [1935] 1 I.R.&lt;/ref&gt; The Free State, which [[Enactment of the Constitution of Ireland|in 1937]] was [[Names of the Irish state|renamed ''Ireland'']], left the Commonwealth in 1949 upon the [[coming into force]] of its [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Republic of Ireland Act]].

===New Zealand===
The [[Parliament of New Zealand]] adopted the Statute of Westminster by passing its [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947]] in November 1947. The [[New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947|New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act]], passed the same year, empowered the New Zealand parliament to change the constitution, but did not remove the ability of the British parliament to legislate regarding the New Zealand constitution. The remaining role of the British parliament was removed by the New Zealand [[Constitution Act 1986]] and the Statute of Westminster was repealed in its entirety.&lt;ref name=SydLaw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Currie, ''New Zealand and the Statute of Westminster, 1931'' (Butterworth, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newfoundland===
The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] never adopted the Statute of Westminster, especially because of financial troubles and corruption there. By request of the Dominion's government, the United Kingdom established the [[Commission of Government]] in 1934, resuming direct rule of Newfoundland. That arrangement remained until [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador#Province of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland became a province of Canada]] in 1949.

===Union of South Africa===
Although the [[Union of South Africa]] was not among the Dominions that needed to adopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect, two laws—the [[Status of the Union Act, 1934]], and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act of 1934—were passed to confirm South Africa's status as a sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International law: a South African perspective |first1=John |last1=Dugard |first2=Daniel L. |last2=Bethlehem |first3=Max |last3=Du Plessis |publisher=Juta &amp; Co. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7021-7121-5 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for succession to the throne==
The preamble to the Statute of Westminster sets out conventions which affect attempts to change the rules of succession to [[the Crown]]. The second paragraph of the preamble to the Statute reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And whereas it is meet and proper to set out by way of preamble to this Act that, inasmuch as the Crown is the symbol of the free association of the members of the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]], and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown, it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means, for example, that any change in any realm to the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]]'s provisions barring [[Roman Catholic]]s from the throne would require the unanimous assent of the parliaments of all the other Commonwealth realms if the shared aspect of the Crown is to be retained. The preamble does not itself contain enforceable provisions, it merely expresses a constitutional convention, albeit one fundamental to the basis of the relationship between the Commonwealth realms. (As sovereign nations, each is free to withdraw from the arrangement, using their respective process for constitutional amendment.) Additionally, per section 4, if a realm wished for a British act amending the Act of Settlement in the UK to become part of that realm's laws, thereby amending the Act of Settlement in that realm, it would have to request and consent to the British act and the British act would have to state that such request and consent had been given. Section 4 of the Statute of Westminster has been repealed in a number of realms, however, and replaced by other constitutional clauses absolutely disallowing the British parliament from legislating for those realms.

This has raised some logistical concerns, as it would mean multiple parliaments would all have to assent to any future changes in any realm to its line of succession, as with the [[Perth Agreement]]'s proposals to abolish [[primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consent given for change to royal succession rules|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20600543|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abdication of King Edward VIII===
During the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]] in 1936, British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] consulted the Commonwealth prime ministers at the request of King [[Edward VIII]]. The King wanted to marry [[Wallis Simpson]], whom Baldwin and other British politicians considered unacceptable as queen, as she was an American divorcée. Baldwin was able to get the then five Dominion prime ministers to agree with this and thus register their official disapproval at the King's planned marriage. The King later requested the Commonwealth prime ministers be consulted on a compromise plan, in which he would wed Simpson under a [[morganatic marriage]] pursuant to which she would not become queen. Under Baldwin's pressure, this plan was also rejected by the Dominions. All of these negotiations occurred at a diplomatic level and never went to the Commonwealth parliaments. However, the enabling legislation that allowed for the actual abdication ([[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]) did require the assent of each Dominion parliament to be passed and the request and consent of the Dominion governments so as to allow it to be part of the law of each Dominion. For expediency and to avoid embarrassment, the British government had suggested the Dominion governments regard whomever is monarch of the UK to automatically be their monarch. However, the Dominions rejected this; Prime Minister of Canada [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] pointed out that the Statute of Westminster required Canada's request and consent to any legislation passed by the British parliament before it could become part of Canada's laws and affect the line of succession in Canada.&lt;ref name=Twomey/&gt; The text of the British act states that Canada requested and consented (the only Dominion to formally do both&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E. C. S. W. |title=Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936 |journal=Modern Law Review |volume=1 |number=1 |date=June 1937 |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to the act applying in Canada under the Statute of Westminster, while Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa simply assented.

In February 1937, the South African parliament formally gave its assent by passing [[His Majesty King Edward the Eighth's Abdication Act, 1937]], which declared that Edward had abdicated on 10 December 1936; that he and his descendants, if any, would have no right of succession to the throne; and that the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] would not apply to him or his descendants, if any.&lt;ref name=sac&gt;May. H.J. (1949). ''The South African Constitution''&lt;/ref&gt; The move was largely done for symbolic purposes, in an attempt by Prime Minister [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] to assert South Africa's independence from Britain. In Canada, the federal parliament passed the [[Succession to the Throne Act 1937]], to assent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act and ratify the government's request and consent to it. In the [[Irish Free State]], [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Prime Minister]] [[Éamon de Valera]] used the departure of Edward as an opportunity to remove all explicit mention of the monarch from the constitution of the Irish Free State, through the [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936]], passed on 11 December 1936. The following day, the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]] provided for the king to carry out certain diplomatic functions, if authorised by law. A new [[Constitution of Ireland]], with a president, was approved by Irish voters in 1937, with the Irish Free State becoming simply "Ireland", or, in the Irish language, "Éire". However, the head of state of Ireland remained [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|unclear]] until 1949, when Ireland unambiguously became a republic outside the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] by enacting the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]].

==Commemoration==
In some countries where the Statute of Westminster forms a part of the constitution, the anniversary of the date of the passage of the original British statute is commemorated as Statute of Westminster Day. In Canada, it is mandated that, on 11 December, the [[Union Jack|Royal Union Flag]] (as the Union Jack is called by law in Canada) is to be flown at properties owned by the federal Crown,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.sen.parl.gc.ca/nkinsella/PDF/SpecialEvents/StatuteWestminster-e.pdf| last=Kinsella| first=Noël| title=Statute of Westminster Day| date=11 December 2006| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the requisite second flag pole is available.

Delaney, Strategic Bankruptcy (University of California Press, 1998) for a discussion of this phenomenon by reference to particular cases.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2002 [[Kmart]] filed [[Chapter 11]] for protection from creditors. One of the main problems affecting Kmart's cash flow and therefore its liquidity was that Kmart was locked into long-term leases at premium rates with respect to various unprofitable stores. While in chapter 11 reorganization, Kmart was able to renegotiate or rescind those particular leases.

In some countries, like Sweden, it is common at least for smaller companies with deep debts, to have a bankruptcy, and close down the company, but where the owner has prepared a new company which buys important assets including the name, and continues with much smaller debts.

The '''Stream Control Transmission Protocol''' ('''SCTP''') is a [[computer networking]] [[communications protocol]] which operates at the [[transport layer]] and serves a role similar to the popular protocols [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. It is standardized by [[IETF]] in RFC 4960.

SCTP provides some of the features of both UDP and TCP: it is message-oriented like UDP and ensures reliable, in-sequence transport of messages with [[TCP congestion control|congestion control]] like TCP. It differs from those protocols by providing multi-homing and redundant paths to increase resilience and reliability. 

In the absence of native SCTP support in operating systems, it is possible to [[Tunneling protocol|tunnel]] SCTP over UDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=UDP Encapsulation of Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Packets for End-Host to End-Host Communication |rfc=6951 | first = Michael | last = Tuexen | coauthors = Randall R. Stewart |date=May 2013 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to map TCP API calls to SCTP calls so existing applications can use SCTP without modification.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The reference implementation was released as part of [[FreeBSD]] version 7. It has since been widely ported.

==Formal oversight==
The [[IETF]] Signaling Transport ([[SIGTRAN]]) working group defined the protocol (number 132&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= //www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml |title= Protocol Numbers |website= iana.org |publisher= [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] |accessdate= 2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Stream Control Transmission Protocol |rfc=2960 |date=October 2000|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the IETF Transport Area (TSVWG) working group maintains it. RFC 4960 defines the protocol. RFC 3286 provides an introduction.

==Message-based multi-streaming==
SCTP applications submit their data to be transmitted in messages (groups of bytes) to the SCTP transport layer. SCTP places messages and control information into separate ''chunks'' (data chunks and control chunks), each identified by a ''chunk header''. The protocol can fragment a message into a number of data chunks, but each data chunk contains data from only one user message.  SCTP bundles the chunks into SCTP packets. The SCTP packet, which is submitted to the [[Internet Protocol]], consists of a packet header, SCTP control chunks (when necessary), followed by SCTP data chunks (when available).

One can characterize SCTP as message-oriented, meaning it transports a sequence of messages (each being a group of bytes), rather than transporting an unbroken stream of bytes as does TCP. As in UDP, in SCTP a sender sends a message in one operation, and that exact message is passed to the receiving application process in one operation. In contrast, TCP is a stream-oriented protocol, transporting [[byte stream|streams of bytes]] reliably and in order. However TCP does not allow the receiver to know how many times the sender application called on the TCP transport passing it groups of bytes to be sent out. At the sender, TCP simply appends more bytes to a queue of bytes waiting to go out over the network, rather than having to keep a queue of individual separate outbound messages which must be preserved as such.

The term ''multi-streaming'' refers to the capability of SCTP to transmit several independent streams of chunks in parallel, for example transmitting [[web page]] images together with the web page text. In essence, it involves  bundling several connections into a single SCTP association, operating on messages (or chunks) rather than bytes.

TCP preserves byte order in the stream by including a byte sequence number with each [[TCP segment|segment]]. SCTP, on the other hand, assigns a sequence number or a message-id&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[SCTP packet structure#DATA chunk|DATA chunk]] uses a sequence number for ordered messages, the [[SCTP packet structure#I-DATA chunk|I-DATA chunk]], which solves some problems with the original DATA chunk, uses a message-id for all messages&lt;/ref&gt; to each ''message'' sent in a stream. This allows independent ordering of messages in different streams. However, message ordering is optional in SCTP; a receiving application may choose to process messages in the order of receipt instead of in the order of sending.

==Features==
Features of SCTP include:
* Reliable transmission of both ordered and unordered data streams.
* [[Multihoming]] support in which one or both endpoints of a connection can consist of more than one IP address, enabling transparent fail-over between redundant network paths.
* Delivery of chunks within independent streams eliminate unnecessary [[head-of-line blocking]], as opposed to TCP byte-stream delivery.
* Explicit partial reliability.
* Path selection and monitoring to select a primary data transmission path and test the connectivity of the transmission path.
* Validation and acknowledgment mechanisms protect against flooding attacks and provide notification of duplicated or missing data chunks.
* Improved error detection suitable for [[jumbo frames|Ethernet jumbo frames]].

The designers of SCTP originally intended it for the transport of telephony ([[Signaling System 7]]) over Internet Protocol, with the goal of duplicating some of the reliability attributes of the SS7 signaling network in IP. This IETF effort is known as [[SIGTRAN]]. In the meantime, other uses have been proposed, for example, the [[Diameter (protocol)|Diameter]] protocol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Diameter Base Protocol |rfc=3588 |sectionname=Transport |section=2.1 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=2012-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reliable Server Pooling]] (RSerPool).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=An Overview of Reliable Server Pooling Protocols |rfc=5351 |sectionname=Example Scenario Using RSerPool Session Services |section=4.2 |page=10|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations and adoption==
TCP has provided the primary means to transfer data reliably across the Internet. However, TCP has imposed limitations on several applications. From RFC 4960:
* TCP provides both reliable data transfer and strict order-of-transmission delivery of data.  Some applications need reliable transfer without sequence maintenance, while others would be satisfied with partial ordering of the data. In both of these cases, the head-of-line blocking property of TCP causes unnecessary delay.
* For applications exchanging distinct records or messages, the stream-oriented nature of TCP requires the addition of explicit markers or other encoding to delineate the individual records.
* In order to avoid sending many small IP packets where one single larger packet would have sufficed, the TCP implementation may delay transmitting data while waiting for possibly more data being queued by the application ([[Nagle's algorithm]]). If and when such a small delay is undesirable, the application must explicitly request undelayed transmission on a case-by-case basis using the [http://seclists.org/webappsec/2005/q3/0351.html push facility] (i.e. by setting the PSH flag in the TCP packet header). SCTP on the other hand allows undelayed transmission to be configured as a default for an association, eliminating any undesired delays, but at the cost of higher transfer overhead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4960#section-1.5.5 RFC 4960, section 1.5.5]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The limited scope{{vague|date=December 2017}} of TCP sockets complicates the task of providing highly-available data transfer capability using [[multihoming|multi-homed]] hosts.
* TCP is relatively vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, such as [[SYN attack]]s.

Adoption has been slowed by lack of awareness, lack of implementations (particularly in Microsoft Windows), lack of application support and lack of network support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2222277/cisco-subnet/what-about-stream-control-transmission-protocol--sctp--.html|title=What About Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)?|last=Hogg|first=Scott|newspaper=Network World|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multi homing ==
SCTP provides redundant paths to increase reliability.
[[File:SCTP-Multihoming.png|thumb|500px|SCTP Multihoming]]

Each SCTP end point needs to check reachability of the primary and redundant addresses of the remote end point using a [[Heartbeat_(computing)|heartbeat]].
Each SCTP end point needs to ack the heartbeats it receives from the remote end point.

When SCTP sends a message to a remote address, the source interface will only be decided by the routing table of the host (and not by SCTP).
=== Asymmetric multi homing ===
In asymmetric multi homing, one of the two end points does not support multi homing.
==== Local multi homing - Remote single homing ====
In Local multi homing and Remote single homing, if the remote primary address is not reachable, the SCTP association fails even if an alternate path is possible.

An SCTP packet consists of two basic sections:
# The ''common header'', which occupies the first 12 bytes and is highlighted in blue, and
# The ''data chunks'', which occupy the remaining portion of the packet.  The first chunk is highlighted in green, and the last of ''N'' chunks (Chunk N) is highlighted in red.

Each chunk starts with a one byte type identifier, with 15 chunk types defined by RFC 4960, and at least 5 more defined by additional RFCs&lt;ref&gt;See [[SCTP packet structure]] for more details&lt;/ref&gt;.  Eight flag bits, a two byte length field and the data compose the remainder of the chunk.  If the chunk does not form a multiple of 4 bytes (i.e., the length is not a multiple of 4) then it is padded with zeros which are not included in the chunk length. The two byte length field limits each chunk to a 65,535 byte length (including the type, flags and length fields).

==Security==
Although encryption was not part of the original SCTP design, SCTP was designed with features for improved security, such as 4-way [[Handshaking | handshake]] (compared to [[Three-way handshake#Connection establishment|TCP 3-way handshake]]) to protect against [[SYN flood]]ing attacks, and large "cookies" for association verification and authenticity.

Reliability was also a key part of the security design of SCTP.  [[Multihoming]] enables an association to stay open even when some routes and interfaces are down. This is of particular importance for [[SIGTRAN]] as it carries [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] over an IP network using SCTP, and requires strong resilience during link outages to maintain telecommunication service even when enduring network anomalies.

SCTP is sometimes a good [[OS fingerprinting|fingerprinting]] candidate.  Some operating systems ship with SCTP support enabled, and, as it is not as well known as TCP or UDP, it is sometimes overlooked in firewall and intrusion detection configurations, thus often permitting probing traffic.

==Implementations==
The SCTP reference implementation runs on FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8994">'''Strict scrutiny''' is the most stringent standard of [[judicial review]] used by [[United States]] courts. It is part of the hierarchy of standards that courts use to determine which is weightier, a constitutional right or principle or the government's interest against observance of the principle. The lesser standards are [[rational basis review]] and exacting or [[intermediate scrutiny]]. These standards are used to test statutes and government action at all levels of government within the United States.

The notion of "levels of judicial scrutiny", including strict scrutiny, was introduced in [[United States v. Carolene Products Co.#Footnote Four|Footnote 4]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938), one of a series of decisions testing the constitutionality of [[New Deal]] legislation. The first and most notable case in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard and found the government's actions constitutional was ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' (1944), in which the Court upheld the exclusion of [[Japanese American]]s from designated areas during [[World War II]].

== Applicability ==
U.S. courts apply the strict scrutiny standard in two contexts: when a fundamental constitutional right is infringed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/410/113/case.html Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 155 (1973) (Blackmun, J.)], accessed July 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those found in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and those the court has deemed a [[fundamental right]] protected by the [[Due Process Clause]] or "liberty clause" of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], or when a government action applies to a "[[suspect classification]]", such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[national origin]]. 

To pass strict scrutiny, the law or policy must satisfy three tests:

* It must be justified by a [[government interest|compelling governmental interest]]. While the Courts have never [[bright line rule|brightly defined]] how to determine if an interest is compelling, the concept generally refers to something necessary or crucial, as opposed to something merely preferred. Examples include national security, preserving the lives of a large number of individuals, and not violating explicit constitutional protections.
* The law or policy must be [[narrow tailoring|narrowly tailored]] to achieve that goal or interest. If the government action encompasses too much ([[overbreadth doctrine|overbroad]]) or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest, then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored.
* The law or policy must be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest: there must not be a less restrictive way to effectively achieve the compelling government interest. The test will be met even if there is another method that is equally the least restrictive. Some legal scholars consider this "least restrictive means" requirement part of being narrowly tailored, but the Court generally evaluates it separately.

Legal scholars, including judges and professors, often say that strict scrutiny is "strict in theory, fatal in fact" since popular perception is that most laws subjected to the standard are struck down. However, an empirical study of strict scrutiny decisions in the federal courts found that laws survive strict scrutiny more than 30% of the time. In one area of law, religious liberty, laws that burden religious liberty survived strict scrutiny review in nearly 60% of cases. However, a discrepancy was found in the type of religious liberty claim, with most claims for exemption from law failing and no allegedly discriminatory laws surviving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=897360 Adam Winkler, "Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts", ''Vanderbilt Law Review", Vol. 59, p. 793, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; See also the cases cited below, however; several appear to permit the exemption from laws based upon religious liberty.

The compelling state interest test is distinguishable from the [[rational basis]] test, which involves claims that do not involve a suspect class and involve a [[liberty interest]] rather than a fundamental right. It is also important to note that unlike the [[rational basis]] test, the burden of proof falls on the state, in cases that require strict scrutiny or [[intermediate scrutiny]].

==Suspect classification==
{{Main article|Suspect classification}}
The Supreme Court has established standards for determining whether a statute or policy's classification requires the use of strict scrutiny. The class must have experienced a history of discrimination, must be definable as a group based on "obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics," be a minority or "politically powerless," and its characteristics must have little relationship to the government's policy aims or the ability of the group's members to contribute to society.[Citations needed.]

The Court has consistently found that classifications based on race, national origin, and alienage require strict scrutiny review. The Supreme Court held that all race-based classifications must be subjected to strict scrutiny in ''[[Adarand Constructors v. Peña]],'' 515 U.S. 200 (1995), overruling ''[[Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC]]'' (89-453), 497 U.S. 547 (1990), which had briefly allowed the use of intermediate scrutiny to analyze the Equal Protection implications of race-based classifications in the narrow category of affirmative-action programs established by the federal government in the broadcasting field.

==''De jure'' versus ''de facto'' discrimination==
As applied in ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', which upheld the race-based [[Executive Order 9066|exclusion order]] and internment during [[World War II]] of [[Japanese American]]s who had resided on the West Coast of the United States, strict scrutiny was limited to instances of ''[[de jure]]'' discrimination, where a racial classification is written into the language of a statute.

The Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.]]'' provided further definition to the concept of intent and clarified three particular areas in which intent of a particular administrative or legislative decision becomes apparent, the presence of any of which demands the harsher equal protection test. The Court must use strict scrutiny if one of these tests, among others, is met:
# the impact is so "stark and dramatic" as to be unexplainable on non-racial grounds, as in ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]''
# the historical background of the decision suggests intent
# the legislative and administrative records leading up to the decision show intent

=== Notable cases ===
*''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma|Skinner v. State of Oklahoma]], [[ex rel|ex. rel.]] Williamson'', [[Case citation|316 U.S. 535]] (1942), cf. ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' {{ussc|274|200|1927}}, banning [[Compulsory sterilization|forced sterilization]]
*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954), ending [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public schools
*''[[One, Inc. v. Olesen]]'', 301 U.S. 340 (1958), ending censorship of homosexual publications
*''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'', 374 U.S. 398 (1963), allowing someone fired because of religious conflicts to receive unemployment
*''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479 (1965), allowing the use of [[birth control]]
*''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', 897 U.S. 113 (1967), allowing people of different races to marry
*''[[Wisconsin v. Yoder]]'', 406 U.S. 205 (1972), allowing the [[Amish]] to remove their children from public schools after 8th grade
*''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973), allowing women to receive [[Abortion|abortions]]
*''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'', 494 U.S. 872 (1990), allowing states to deny unemployment benefits to those using illegal drugs for religious purposes
*''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', 380 U.S. 144 (1996), allowing local governments in Colorado to pass discrimination protections for homosexuals
*''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'', 521 U.S. 507 (1997), holding that some zoning laws may be an undue restriction of religious freedom
*''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', 546 U.S. 418 (2006), allowing religious use of illegal drugs
*''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', 191 U.S. 771 (2013), requiring the federal government to recognize [[Same-sex marriage|gay marriage]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s granted by states

The '''Teacher's Oath''' is an oath taken in some countries by teachers. Since 1863, nearly two-thirds of the states have adopted loyalty oaths for teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/teachers-loyalty-oath|title= TEACHERS' LOYALTY OATH|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=  Encyclopedia.com|publisher= Dictionary of American History|access-date= 14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Massachusetts Teachers' Oath]] was a [[loyalty oath]] required to teach in [[Massachusetts]] from 1935 to 1967.

In 1993, the German educator {{ill|Hartmut von Hentig|de}} designed the Socratic Oath, which is supposed to be a set of professional guidelines for educators,  teachers and paedagogues.

''As teacher and educator I undertake,

*to stand by for his and her physical and mental integrity;
*to take aware of his and her emotions, to listen to him and her, to take him and her seriously;
*to search for his consense for all I will do to this child, as I would do with an adult person;
*to interprete the rules of his development in the most positive way and to support the child to accept these own rules;
*to challenge and to promote his gifts and potentials;
*to protect him, where he is weak, to support him, where it is needed, in overcoming fear and guilt, malice and falsehood, doubts and mistrust and snivelling self-help addiction;
*not to break his desire, not even where it appears nonsensical, but to support him to take his will under the reign of his reason, to teach him so the mature use of mind and the art of negotiating understanding;

*to let him learn the world how it is without subjugate to the world how it is;

*to give him a vision of a better world and the confidence that it might be achievable;
*to teach truthfulness, not the truth because "it is with God alone".
''So that I undertake,''
*to give example, as well as I can, how to deal with difficulties, challenges, opportunities of our world and with his own limited gifts and how to cope with his own always given guilt;
*to ensure, according to my power, that the next generation will find a world wothwhile to live in, and where the inherited burdens and difficulties will not crush ideas, hopes and forces;
*to justify publicly my beliefs and deeds, to expose myself to criticism, particularly of stakeholders and experts, and to suspend my judgements by continuous and conscientious review;
*and to resist to all people and circumstances, interest of parts or service provision, if I believe they might hinder intentions expressed here.''

'''Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995''' was a bill vetoed by [[President Bill Clinton]], pushed by the Republican dominated Congress. Business lobby groups had sought change the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] §8(a)(2) to weaken the rule against employer establishment and control of employee involvement programs. The Act was designed to enable employers to displace [[labor unions]] that made free collective agreements.

The '''Thawri''' (Arabic:الثوري) [[Madhhab]] was a short lived school of [[Fiqh|Islamic Jurisprudence]]. Its founder was [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Sufyan Al-Thawri]], a great 8th Century [[alim|scholar]], jurist and hadith compiler.&lt;ref name=Judd&gt;Steven C. Judd, “Competitive hagiography in biographies of al-Awzaʿi and Sufyan al-Thawri”, Journal of the American Oriental Society 122:1 (Jan–March, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Ath-Thawri's]] move to Basra later in his life, his jurisprudential thought ([[Usul al-fiqh|usul]]) became more closely aligned to that of the [[Umayyads]] and of [[al-Awza'i|Al-Azwa'i]].&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt;

He spent the last year of his life hiding after a dispute between him and the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mahdi|Muhammad Ibn Mansur Al-Mahdi]]. After his death, the Thawri [[Madhhab]] was taken up by his students, including notably Yahya al-Qattan.&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt; However, his school did not survive, but his jurisprudential thought and especially hadith transmission are highly regarded in Islam, and have influenced all the major [[madh'hab|schools]].

'''''Truth (NZ) Ltd v Holloway''''' [1961] NZLR 22 (PC) is a case of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on appeal from the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand]] regarding the legal issue of [[defamation]] and [[Freedom of speech|free speech]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The weekly newspaper ''[[New Zealand Truth]]'', in an article dated 24 March 1959, published a story about the allocation of [[import licence]]s, which contained a quote by importer Harry Judd saying to a fellow importer: "see Phil and Phil will fix it" The "Phil" referred to was the Hon. [[Phil Holloway]], the then-Minister for Industries and Commerce under Prime Minister [[Walter Nash]] during the [[Second Labour Government of New Zealand|Second Labour Government]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book |ref = harv |last= Wilson |first= James Oakley |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840–1984 |edition= 4th |origyear=First published in 1913 |year= 1985 |publisher= V.R.

The paper defended the matter on the basis of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], in publishing an article of national significance.

The High Court ruled that the paper did not have such a defence, and awarded damages of [[NZ£]]11,000.

''Truth'' appealed to the Court of Appeal claiming they had the defence of privilege, and also that the judge had misdirected the jury.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal upheld the judgement. ''The Truth'' subsequently unsuccessfully appealed to the Privy Council, but solely on the grounds that the judge had misdirected the jury. 

'''Footnote:''' Defence Counsel here ([[Robin Cooke, Baron Cooke of Thorndon|Robin Cooke]]) later became Justice Cooke.

United for Iran works to raise awareness about human rights abuses and mobilizes pressure on the Iranian government to uphold human rights principles outlined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; United for Iran undertakes programs and campaigns that aim to advance accountability for violations against Iranian citizens and increase the cost for human rights abuses.
Among its policy agenda, United for Iran calls on the Iranian government to:
• Release [[political prisoners]].
• End all restrictions that prevent citizens from accessing information and the Internet freely.
• Reform its laws and practices to adhere to international standards established in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], including the promotion of [[gender equality]]; respect for [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of expression]], and [[freedom of religion]]; and ensuring freedom from torture, arbitrary detention, and extrajudicial execution.
• Institute electoral and democratic reforms and hold genuine democratic elections open to international electoral observation.
• Establish a moratorium on the [[death penalty]] until due process rights are guaranteed and with a view toward joining the global movement toward abolition.
To advance this agenda, United for Iran will pursue the following objectives: contribute to NGO coalition-building and collaboration among organizations that work on human rights promotion in Iran; encourage cooperation by the Iranian government with the international human rights system; and exert international pressure on the Iranian government to carry about the above human rights objectives.
United for Iran is an independent non-profit organization formed in 2009 after the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30iran.html|title=Iran Lashes Out at West Over Protests|first=Nazila|last=Fathi|authorlink=Nazila Fathi|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, a '''voidable floating charge''' refers to a [[floating charge]] entered into shortly prior to the [[company (law)|company]] going into [[liquidation]] which is [[void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]] in whole or in part under applicable insolvency legislation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and section 267 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, a floating charge is only potentially vulnerable if it is entered into within the vulnerability period under applicable law. The vulnerability period is a period prescribed by statute immediately preceding the company going into liquidation. Most jurisdictions provide for alternative vulnerability periods: a longer one for parties who are "connected" to the company, and a shorter one for unrelated third parties.&lt;ref&gt; Under English law, a floating charge in favour of an unconnected third party is only vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 12 months, but a floating charge in favour of a connected person is vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 2 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of laws relating to voidable floating charges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries simply provide that such charge are automatically void or not enforceable,&lt;ref&gt;Under English law they are stated to be "invalid", which is taken to mean unenforceable.&lt;/ref&gt; In other jurisdictions, they are only [[voidable]] and an application must be made by a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] or creditor for the floating charge to be set aside.

In most jurisdictions, a floating charge is only vulnerable to the extent that it does not secure new money for the company.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; So if a bank has a loan of £100 outstanding to a company, and it advances a further £50 but takes an "all-monies" floating charge as security, and the company goes into liquidation 3 months later, the floating charge will validly secure the £50 advance which was made at the time, but not the earlier £100. Legislation relating to voidable floating charges is intended to prevent abuse of a [[security interest]] which catches literally all of the assets of the company, and could be used by person to strip out all of the assets from a company in difficulty from the [[unsecured creditor]]s. However, if the holder of the floating charge has inserted new money, then giving the holder a valid security up to the amount of the new money injected does not prejudice the position of the unsecured creditors.

Most legislation relating to voidable floating charges is also expressed to apply to charges which, as created, were floating charges but which subsequently crystallised into fixed charges.
