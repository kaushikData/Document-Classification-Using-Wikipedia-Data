'''Bessy''' was a long-running Belgian comics series created by [[Willy Vandersteen]] and [[Karel Verschuere]] in 1952. Together with ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' and ''[[De Rode Ridder]]'' it was once one of his most popular and best-selling series, with successful translations in Dutch, French, German and Swedish. It was terminated in 1997.

==Concept==

Inspired by the success of ''[[Lassie]]'', [[Willy Vandersteen]] and [[Karel Verschuere]] decided to make a comic strip series about a female [[collie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/v/verschuere.htm|title=Karel Verschuere|work=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the original ''Lassie'' series, though, it didn't feature any child characters and was set in the [[Wild West]] rather than the present time. Bessy was given an owner, Andy Cayoon, with whom she had many adventures involving cowboys and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

==Publication history==

"Bessy" was first published in the French-language Belgian newspaper ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' on December 24, 1952 and translated into Dutch a year later, when the comics were published in ''[[De Standaard]]'' and ''De Katholieke Illustratie''. The series were also a tremendous success in Germany, where they were published in the youth magazines ''Pony'' and ''Felix''. So much in fact, that Vandersteen's studio had a separate team drawing new titles, many of which were never translated in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicguide.de/index.php/component/comicguide/?controller=details&amp;file=series&amp;display=short&amp;id=422|title=Comic Guide: Bessy|work=comicguide.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 992 different titles, reissues included, "Bessy" has the most album titles of all of Vandersteen's series. 164 albums of these were Dutch, 151 were French. The series was also published in [[Sweden]] under the name ''Bessie'', which spawned 92 albums.

The high production unfortunately also had an effect on the quality of the stories and drawings. As a result, the German editions were discontinued by 1985. One of Vandersteen's assistants, Jeff Broeckx, then created a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] "Bessy Natuurkommando" ("Bessy Nature Commando") (1984-1992), where Andy and Bessy were reimagined as present-day [[conservation (ethic)|conservators of animals and nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/broeckx.htm|title=Jeff Broeckx|work=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy received a love interest, Aneka, and a little street boy named Kid, who travelled along with them on their missions. The scripts were written by Marck Meul. Twenty-three albums were drawn before the series was terminated in 1992. Broeckx tried a new reboot and redrew the first seven stories of the original series, as well as the twelfth story from the first series. By 1997 the series came to a definite halt.

== History ==

Boundless was founded in March 2011 by Ariel Diaz, Aaron White, and Brian Balfour.&lt;ref name=BostInno28-4-11&gt;{{cite news|last=Garbarino|first=Chase|title=Boundless Learning Raises $1.7M, Taking Big Swing in Big Space in Boston|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2011/04/28/boundless-learning-raises-1-7m-taking-big-swing-in-big-space-in-boston/|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=BostInno|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company raised $1.7 million in funding during 2011.&lt;ref name="BostInno28-4-11"/&gt;

In March 2012, the company was sued by three publishers: [[Pearson Education]], [[Cengage Learning]], and Bedford, Freeman &amp; Worth Publishing Group (owned by [[Macmillan Publishers]]).

The company's textbooks consist of educational material taken from free and open sources.&lt;ref name=MITFitz&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitzgerald|first=Michael|title=Free Textbooks Spell Disruption for College Publishers|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506371/free-textbooks-spell-disruption-for-college-publishers/|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=MIT Technology Review|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material is often referred to as "[[open educational resources]]" (OER).  Some of the sources include [[Wikipedia]], the [[Encyclopedia of Earth]], and government web sites.&lt;ref name=Chron5-4-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MITFitz /&gt; The company edits the material and arranges it to create a text in the form of an e-book.

In an "open" textbook, the contents of each chapter and the arrangement of chapters are defined by the company. In its "alternative" textbooks, the material is arranged in a way that is very similar to a specific, commercially available textbook. Alternative textbooks allow students to follow class reading and assignments that are based on a commercial text.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1864">'''Caroline Brown Bourland''' (June 4th, 1871-February 28, 1956) was an American college professor. She was born in Peoria, Illinois to her parents, Benjamin P. and Clara (Parsons) Bourland. She was educated in France and Germany and attended High School in Peoria. In 1893, she graduated from [[Smith College]], with a [[B.A.]]. Bourland subsequently attended the [[Sorbonne]] and [[Collège de France|Collège de France, Paris]], from 1897-98. A fellow in Romance Languages from [[Bryn Mawr College]], she graduated in 1899; and was a graduate scholar and fellow by courtesy in Romance Languages, from 1900. In 1901, Bourland was the holder of the [[Mary Garrett|Mary E. Garrett European fellowship]] and a student in Romance Languages, at Madrid, Spain. In 1905, she received her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Woman's who's who of America|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1914|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A teacher in Pueblo, Colorado, from 1893-94.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15750">'''Deltopia''', originally known as '''Floatopia''', is a social event that has taken place in [[Santa Barbara, California]] since 2004. Floatopia was originated in 2003 by [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] students. In early years attendance usually maxed out with 500–1,000 participants.

Participants consist primarily of college students. The title "Floatopia" describes the main activity the event is known for—floating on rafts and other home-made or store bought floating devices along the coast and partying on the beach. Floatopia has drawn college and highschool students from all over California, although it is patronized largely by students from the [[Santa Barbara City College]] and the University of California, Santa Barbara. The title also references the word utopia, the state of ideal perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=utopia|title=Utopia - Define Utopia at Dictionary.com|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original Floatopia activities included sand-built beer pong tables and a number of loosely organized 'floating parties,' in which beer kegs were used as central flotation devices for 'flotillas' of underage students who had originally taken to the water in order to avoid being ticketed by (terrestrial) IVFP officers.    

Floatopia occurs at the start of [[spring (season)|spring]] quarter "along the beach and in the water in the 6500 and 6600 blocks of [[Del Playa Drive]]."&lt;ref name="draws"&gt;Eric Lindberg, [http://www.thedailysound.com/040609floatopia "Floatopia draws masses, safety personnel"], ''Daily Sound'', Santa Barbara, CA, April 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Floatopia attracted just over 300 students,&lt;ref name="fiasco"&gt;Sara Tan, [http://www.independent.com/news/2009/apr/09/isla-vistas-floatopia-fiasco/?print "Isla Vista's Floatopia Fiasco"], ''[[Santa Barbara Independent]]'', Santa Barbara, CA, April 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 it grew to almost 1,000 people,&lt;ref name="locals"&gt;Taylor Haggerty, [http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=16295 "Locals Get Wet and Wild at Floatopia"], ''The Nexus'', University of California, Santa Barbara newspaper, April 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 it continued to grow to approximately 12,000.&lt;ref name="fiasco"/&gt; Floatopia 2009 was so popular amongst attendees that plans were made for a Floatopia 2 to occur in May. Furthermore, various college campuses made plans to imitate the event, such as Slotopia, which was planned at [[California Polytechnic State University]]. Floatopia also popped up as a major event in San Diego after alcohol was banned on the beaches in 2008. San Diego Floatopia, taking place in Mission Bay, had grown to attract over 10,000 in 2009. Although Floatopia attracts many party goers who enjoy the event, others point out the adverse environmental effects and legal consequences related to minors and alcohol consumption.

==Online networking==
The unprecedented attendance at Floatopia, approximately 12,000 people, is likely attributable to [[Facebook]]. Facebook includes an application that allows users to create "events" and send out "event invitations" to any number of "friends." Using this feature, the UCSB Excursion Club created an event invitation entitled "Floatopia."&lt;ref name="fiasco"/&gt; This invitation was "open," allowing any other user on Facebook to view the event's details and RSVP. The event ultimately listed 9,675 confirmed guests.&lt;ref name="fiasco"/&gt; As many as 67 results appear when searching for "Floatopia" on Facebook; although many of the groups promote the event, a number of the groups are dedicated to either preventing a sequel or organizing clean-up crews.

==Repercussions==

===Legal citations and accident reports===
Throughout Floatopia a number of accident reports and citations were issued. At the event 78 alcohol citations were issued and 13 arrests were made under the charges of drunk in public or disorderly conduct (throwing bottles from the bluffs towards the crowd below). Because of the large number of people concentrated in one area, most of whom were under the influence of alcohol, many injuries occurred. Two party goers were taken to the Cottage Hospital trauma center after falling from the cliffs and 33 people received treatment for head injuries, alcohol poisoning, and lacerations.&lt;ref name="supes"&gt;Colby Frazer, [http://www.thedailysound.com/050209Floatopia2 "Supes to consider alcohol ban on IV beaches"], ''Daily Sound'', Santa Barbara, CA, May 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The police also received a 9-1-1 call reporting a drowning person, but after they dispatched two engines and a truck to [[Del Playa Drive|Del Playa]] and interviewed surrounding witnesses, no injury was actually apparent. The police stated a prevalent problem they encountered was attempting to determine which reports they received were valid.&lt;ref name="fiasco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="locals"/&gt;

===Safety personnel===
During its peak hours, Floatopia was patrolled by a dozen Foot Patrol officers, Goleta deputies, and officers from the UCSB police department, 4 county fire engines, 2 ambulances, a search and rescue crew, and a helicopter. Lt. Brian Olmstead of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol stated that about 20 county firefighters were assigned to the event. The main problem was that Floatopia required so many officials to be present that it caused a redistribution of safety personnel. Olmstead stated,"this event had an impact on the county as a whole."&lt;ref name="draws"/&gt; The increased size of Floatopia caught emergency officials off guard and cost an estimated $20,000 in taxpayer money to patrol.&lt;ref name="supes"/&gt;

===Environmental impact===
As attendees dispersed and debris remained, many people began to focus their attention on the aftermath of Floatopia. UCSB's Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, Michael D. Young, sent out an email to UCSB students the first Wednesday following Floatopia regarding the event. Young expressed his concerns regarding the number of party goers who likely "urinate[d] in our ocean, destroy[ed] vegetation on the cliffs, drop[ped] broken glass and plastics of all shapes, sizes and varieties onto the sand and into the water, allow[ed] garbage to be strewn along the shoreline down to Santa Barbara and beyond, destroy[ed] habitat for any number of species, and kill[ed] untold numbers of fish and birds." Young concluded the letter asking students to "organize against the event" by discouraging potential participants and encouraging awareness.

In an effort to reduce the environmental impact of Floatopia, the Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, Surfrider Foundation Isla Vista, and Coastal Fund organized beach cleanups. This is thought to have been relatively unsuccessful considering much of the debris was carried out to sea as a result of the high tide.&lt;ref name="fiasco"/&gt; After seeing the aftermath of Floatopia, Bradley Cardinale, a professor of ecology, revealed that even though he has "traveled all over the world for [his] research…, [he has] only seen dumping like this in third world countries." Cardinale urged students to consider "how much urine went into our coastal zone… You just don't clean that up. Sure we can pick up the beer cans, but the other stuff is out there permanently".&lt;ref name="fiasco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Haggerty, [http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=18642 "Floatopia Threatens Environment"], ''The Nexus'', University of California, Santa Barbara newspaper, April 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==

===Slotopia===
Following Floatopia, a number of college students in the central coast hoped to continue the party 100 miles north, in San Luis Obispo. The event was dubbed "Slotopia." Ryan Magill, a senior at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, created the "Slotopia" event on Facebook. The event was to take place at Shell Beach, an unincorporated community in Pismo Beach, on May 2, 2009. Initially, the event was sponsored by Obsession Entertainment. Obsession Entertainment agreed to shuttle students from Cal Poly to Shell Beach throughout the day, as a measure to prevent drinking and driving.

After the large number of injuries and citations and the excessive environmental pollution of Floatopia, the Pismo beach police, university officials, and a campaign led by a Cal Poly student named Ryan Featherson, all combined to stop the event. T&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santamariatimes.com/articles/2009/05/01/news/centralcoast/news06.txt "College bash planned for Shell Beach dead in water"], ''Santa Maria Times'', May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Featherson created his own event on Facebook entitled "Stop Slotopia." Once the event drew the negative attention of the media, Slotopia's sponsor, Obsession Entertainment, pulled out, along with the many deejays that were scheduled to play music that day. Unlike Floatopia, which took place on the beaches of Isla Vista, Slotopia was scheduled to occur at Shell Beach, which is not as heavily populated by college students. Shell Beach is a relatively small location in comparison to the beaches in Isla Vista, which could have potentially magnified the environmental impact and further upset the community of Shell Beach. The efforts to stop Slotopia were ultimately successful and Slotopia was cancelled. On May 2, 2009, Shell Beach had an unusually low number of college attendees for a weekend day.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Wilson, [http://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/story/699503.html "Concerns cause organizers to cancel Slotopia party in Shell Beach"], ''San Luis Obispo Tribune, April 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The low attendance is largely attributable to the poor weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KSBP/2009/5/2/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Shell%20Beach&amp;req_state=CA&amp;req_statename=California|title=Weather History for San Luis Obispo, CA - Weather Underground|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floatopia 2===
Despite the controversy over Floatopia, students from UCSB chose to plan a sequel, Floatopia 2. This event was planned to take place May 9, 2009. The event originated on Facebook once again, urging for a bigger and better beach party than the last, quickly drawing approximately 12,000 confirmed guests. The creators of the event sent out 25,000 invitations to Facebook users. In response to the initial Floatopia, authorities took serious steps in order to prevent a sequel. These efforts mainly consisted of a potential emergency ordinance that would ban alcohol on beaches surrounding the seaside enclave. The ordinance would have been effective from the beach stretching to the west from 6885 [[Del Playa Drive|Del Playa Dr.]], to the 6500 block of that same street, on the coastal bluffs to the north, and the properties fronting Del Playa Drive in the 6500 to 6800 blocks. The fines for violating this potential ordinance would have been $100 for the first citation, $200 for the second if it occurred within one year of the first, and up to $500 for each additional violation within one year. Floatopia 2 had an estimated cost of $50,000 to fully staff emergency personnel.&lt;ref name="supes"/&gt;

Floatopia 2 never occurred, because of the publicized controversial issues, but some UCSB students believe other factors also contributed to its cancellation. Tommy Curran of the Daily Nexus claimed that Mother's Day, bad weather, and the Jesusita Fire were the real reasons Floatopia 2 did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Tommy Curran, [http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=18979 "Final Thoughts on Floatopia 2"], Opinion, ''The Nexus'', University of California, Santa Barbara newspaper, May 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floatopia/Deltopia 2010===
On Tuesday April 6, 2010, Santa Barbara officials told county supervisors that they planned to barricade beach access points around UC Santa Barbara in an effort to stop Floatopia 2010 scheduled for Saturday April 10. In response, local Isla Vista residents staged "Deltopia" demonstrations to take place on Del Playa street to protest the decision &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/event.php?eid=389533105934|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to close public beach access. Furthermore, several block parties (dubbed as "ragers") took place on April 10 along Del Playa.

===Floatopia/Deltopia 2011===
Floatopia 2011, scheduled for April 9, 2011, had over 14,248 confirmed guests on the official Facebook fanpage as of March 30, 2011, suggesting that attendance would set a new record. Also on March 30, 2011, Dustin Olson, UC Santa Barbara Chief of Police issued a campus-wide email alert stating that "campus beaches will be closed Saturday, April 2 and Sunday, April 3, 2011 and not accessible to the public or campus community. This beach closure is in response to unsafe and unsanitary conditions that have been associated with this unplanned event in the past."

The Facebook page for the event stressed that participants would be required to enter the beaches empty-handed with the exception of a towel and a float, and leave with the items (towel and float) that they brought in. Participants were also given strict warnings on conduct and the prohibition on alcohol at the event. However, the page also advertised that "ragers" (house parties) would be thrown all day until midnight.

===Floatopia/Deltopia 2014===
Authorities arrested about 100 attendees of Deltopia 2014. According to police, the party turned violent after some of the approximately 15,000 attendees objected to the arrest of a partygoer by the University of California Santa Barbara Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-deputies-injured-about-100-arrested-in-isla-vista-melee-20140406-story.html|title=Deputies injured, 100 arrested at Isla Vista street party|first=Carlos|last=Lozano|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-06/deltopia-leads-to-civil-unrest-in-iv-streets/|title=Deltopia Leads to ‘Civil Unrest’ in IV Streets|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of International Relations''' at [[Sakarya University]], located at the Esentepe campus, Serdivan, [[Sakarya Province|Sakarya]], provides undergraduate and graduate education about international politics. As a department within [[Faculty of Political Sciences at Sakarya University|Faculty of Political Sciences]], it has an integrated curriculum with other departments of this faculty such as public administration, and economics. Established in 1997, the department of international relations has more than 4.000 alumni including business leaders, journalists, diplomats, district governors, and academics. The department has 14 full-time faculty and 11 research assistants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uli.sakarya.edu.tr/tr&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Department of International Relations established in 1996 under the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences. It admitted its first students during the academic year of 1997-1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uli.sakarya.edu.tr/en/icerik/7173/8384/tarihce&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the department inaugurated its PhD program. At the same year, the department started to send its students to Europe and receive students from European universities as part of [[Erasmus Programme]]. The Department of International Relations has continued to evolve, adding online graduate programs such as International Relations and European Union and Middle Eastern Studies in 2012. When the Faculty of Political Science was established in 2015, the department moved to this new faculty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Dietrich Schwanitz''' (April 23, 1940 – December 17, 2004) was a [[Germany|German]] writer and literary scholar. He became known to larger audiences after publishing the bestselling [[campus novel]] ''Der Campus'' in 1995.

== Life ==

Schwanitz's parents were teaching living in the northern [[Ruhr|Ruhr area]]. In the late phase of [[World War II]] his mother send him with help of the [[Red Cross]] to [[Switzerland]] to escape the bombing raids in war torn [[Germany]]. In Switzerland Schwanitz stayed for six years with [[Mennonite]] mountain farmers rather isolated from society and without attending a school. He returned to his parents in 1950 and school director who took a liking in him (seeing him as a modern "[[Kaspar Hauser]]") got him accepted directly into a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] (highschool) and helped him to catch up with the curriculum. Schwanitz graduated ultimately as best of his class and went on to pursue English studies, history and philosophy at universities in [[Münster]], [[London]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Freiburg]]. In 1971 he received his [[PhD]] from the [[University of Freiburg|Albert Ludwig University]] in Freiburg for thesis on [[George Bernard Shaw]]. In 1978 he became a tenured professor for [[English studies]] at the [[University of Hamburg]] where he stayed until his early retirement in 1997 due to health issues.&lt;ref name=Blom&gt; Philipp Blom: [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dietrich-schwanitz-754521.html ''Dietrich Schwanitz - English professor who wrote a bestseller'']. The Independent, January 2005 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sued&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/dietrich-schwanitz-bestsellerautor-tot-aufgefunden-1.659906 ''Bestsellerautor tot aufgefunden'']. Süddeutsche Zeitung, 17 May 2010 (publication date given on the newspaper's website, presumably correct date is late December 2004, German)&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement Schwanitz moved to Southern Germany. He continued to write and in 2001 he purchased  the ''Salmen'' in [[Hartheim am Rhein]], a restaurant with a theater stage. Schwanitz planned to turn it into a cultural center and had its theater room painted with Shakespearean motives. He was found dead in the ''Salmen'' in late December 2004. The police investigation concluded that there was no indication of a crime or suicide and that he had died of [[hypothermia]]. Originally it was reported that Schwanitz was suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]] but after his death it became known that in fact he had suffered from [[Huntington's disease]] instead. He was married, and the couple had one son and one daughter.&lt;ref name=Schulze&gt;Bettina Schulze: [http://www.badische-zeitung.de/literatur-1/gasthaus-zum-salmen-wie-shakespeare-nach-hartheim-kam--49397239.html ''Gasthaus "Zum Salmen": Wie Shakespeare nach Hartheim kam'']. Badische Zeitung, 10 September 2011 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sued/&gt;

== Work ==

Schwanitz main academic work during his tenure at the University of Hamburg was applying [[system theory]] to [[literary theory]] and he published two books on that subject. First his main work ''[[Systemtheorie]] und Literatur. Ein neues Paradigma'' ("System Theory and Literature. A New Paradigm", 1990) which was later followed by ''Shakespeare und die Liebe. Ein Beispiel für die Applikation der Systemtheorie auf die Literatur.'' ("Shakespeare and Love. An Example for the Application of System Theory to Literature", 1996). He also published an introduction in English studies and a cultural history of the English speaking world.&lt;ref name=sued/&gt;

Schwanitz was popular with students as a teacher, in 1980 he found the ''University Players'' an English theater group that still existed long after he had left the university. It garnered attraction in 1988 when it performed the play "MacBarsch" alluding to [[Uwe Barschel]] the leading figure in [[Uwe_Barschel#"Waterkant-Gate"|''Waterkantgate'']], one [[West Germany]]'s biggest political scandals.&lt;ref name=Schiller&gt;Maike Schiller: [http://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/article106941892/Professor-Autor-Uni-Kritiker.html ''Professor, Autor, Uni-Kritiker'']. Hamburger Abendblatt, 23 December 2004 (German) &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Schwanitz published ''Der Campus'', which is a [[campus novel]], a genre that didn't really exist in German at the time. It quickly became a bestseller in German speaking countries and was adapted into a movie of the same name in 1998.&lt;ref name=Brockmann&gt;Stephen M. Brockmann: ''The Politics of German Comedy''.

Education reform has been a topic for [[Kentucky]] government officials and citizens for over 20 years.  The most significant piece of reform legislation was passed in 1990, and was known as the [[Kentucky Education Reform Act]] (KERA).  This act instituted six basic initiatives, some of the most important being a focus on core subjects, community service, and self-sufficiency.  Kentucky education has seen improvements in terms of equalizing funding among various schools, but still has a long way to go in becoming nationally competitive in its educational outcomes and standardized test scores.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, William H. An Evaluation of the Kentucky Education Reform Act. http://cber.uky.edu/Downloads/kentucky_education_reform_act.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voluntary Charter Schools ==

	One viable reform option that has gotten little attention is the possibility of voluntary  [[charter schools]], especially in areas of poor public school opportunities.  The [[U.S. Department of Education]] defines charter schools as “tuition-free public schools freed from regulation in exchange for greater accountability.”  &lt;ref&gt;Challenge and Opportunity: The Impact of Charter Schools on School Districts.  US Department of Education.  http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/choice/summary.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the charter school system, individual schools and administrations have more control over the structure of various curricula and school programs which provides for a more tailored emphasis for each student.  And, by and large, students and parents felt that the students “{received} more individualized attention at the charter school than they did at their previous school.”  &lt;ref&gt;General Conclusions about Charter Schools.  US Charter Schools. http://www.uscharterschools.org/pub/uscs_docs/fs/sped_natl_study.htm?page=10&lt;/ref&gt;  These same parents said that they felt their students were able to learn more efficiently because teachers were more able to adapt their methods to fit the child’s individual learning style.

Another benefit of charter schools is their effect on the competitiveness of the education market.  Recent research conducted by the U.S. Department of Education proves that voluntary charter schools will provide greater educational choices and help to create a more competitive educational market that encourages all schools to improve.&lt;ref&gt;K-8 Charters: Closing the Achievement Gap.  US Department of Education.  http://www.uscharterschools.org/cs/fs/query/q/1829.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Education’s research shows that the creation and inclusion of charter schools in school systems led to visible improvements in the test scores and student behaviors of almost every school in that school system, whether they were public, private, charter, or anything else.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Allen.  AP Classes – Why They Matter.  College Admissions.  http://collegeapps.about.com/od/apadvancedplacement/tp/ap-classes.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advanced Placement Classes ==

	Voluntary charter schools certainly provide one aspect to bettering the educational system in Kentucky.  But while charter schools benefit students by creating a more competitive educational marketplace, one still needs to consider how to institute reform that better prepares Kentucky students for [[post-secondary education]], should they choose to pursue it.  One of the ways that absolutely every school in Kentucky can improve its educational standards is with the greater inclusion of [[advanced placement]] (or AP) classes.  Advanced placement classes are those with a higher degree of difficulty that seek to prepare high school students for post-secondary education.  One college admissions website says that some of the reasons AP classes are important are because they impress college admissions offices, help better prepare students for college-level curriculum, and help students to make better decisions after high school.&lt;ref&gt;Switzer, Liz.  Statistics show AP courses boost success. The Center of Gifted Studies, Western Kentucky University. The Daily News.  http://www.b-g.k12.ky.us/districtNewsArticle.aspx?artID=477.  
&lt;/ref&gt;
   
With a proven record of helping to better prepare students for post-secondary education, AP classes are being discussed more and more by Kentucky high school teachers and administrators.  This open dialogue about AP classes is extremely important as current data from [[Western Kentucky University]]’s Center of Gifted Studies reveal that “college students who have not taken an AP course have only a 33 percent chance of completing a [[bachelor’s degree]].”   &lt;ref&gt;Croyle, William.  Bill would give superintendents more say in principal hiring.  NKYpolitics.  http://cincinnati.com/blogs/nkypolitics/2011/03/02/bill-would-give-superintendents-more-say-in-principal-hiring/.&lt;/ref&gt;  But, that success rate increases exponentially with the inclusion of AP courses in Kentucky students’ high school educations.  The Center of Gifted Studies reports that “College students who have completed one AP course have a 59 percent chance of completing a four-year degree, while students with two or more AP courses under their belt have a 76 percent chance of completing a bachelor’s degree” (Switzer).

Research institutes aren’t the only entities supporting the greater inclusion of AP courses in high school curricula though; in fact, some of the biggest advocates for an increased number of AP courses are the teachers who would be charged with leading said classes.  Vicki Schmitt, an AP English and literature teacher at Greenwood High School in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]], believes that AP courses are the very best way to prepare students for a college education (Switzer).  On the benefits of AP classes for both the students and teachers, Schmitt said, “AP helps teachers teach kids how to think.  Students tell me there was not a class in high school that prepared them for college except for their AP classes” (Switzer).  At [[Greenwood High School (Kentucky)|Greenwood High School]], where Schmitt has taught for the past 12 years, there are currently 14 AP classes offered for students.  However, that number is much higher than the vast majority of Kentucky schools, and there is much more work to be done to make Kentucky public schools look more like Greenwood High School.  Based on the research provided and the opinions of many teachers like Schmitt, it seems that if more schools were to include AP options in their programs, Kentucky students would be more ready for post-secondary education, and become more successful members of society.

== Greater Authority for Local School Superintendents ==

	Another form of education reform that may require legislative action is the granting of greater authority to superintendents.  One of the effects of the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990 was the creation of “site-based councils at each school . . . {which} generally consists of the principal, three teachers and two parents.”   &lt;ref&gt;Senator David Williams on Education &amp; Such.  Updated: 12/9/2010. http://pageonekentucky.com/2010/12/09/senator-david-williams-on-education-such/.&lt;/ref&gt;  These site-based councils would be charged with the hiring of all new principals for whatever school it represented.  But Wilson Sears, executive director of the Kentucky Association of School Superintendents, believes that KERA’s reliance on these site-based councils to hire principals is misplaced.  Instead, Sears believes that superintendents should have the responsibility of hiring principals, and he has lobbied tirelessly for the recently passed Kentucky Senate Bill 12 which says that superintendents will temporarily replace fired principals and will also have a vote in choosing who the subsequent principal will be (Croyle).  Like Sears, Campbell County Schools Superintendent Anthony Strong also thinks superintendents should have greater authority in personnel hiring.  Strong says that the “superintendent of a school district {is} similar to the CEO of a company, and . . . it would be unheard of for a CEO not to have input into who runs his or her company’s different divisions” (Croyle).

Granting superintendents greater authority in choosing school principals is only one of the ways to increase autonomy at the local school board level.  Another means of increasing local autonomy is to give principals and school administrators greater authority over the spending of instructional funds and resources.  One 2011 Kentucky Gubernatorial candidate, [[David L. Williams (politician)|David L. Williams]], believes that local administrators should have greater “input on how to use the funds they are provided to ensure children are getting the best possible education.”   &lt;ref name="ConklinSmith"&gt;Conklin, Kristin D. and Stephen Smith.  Stronger Fiscal Incentives Can Improve High School and Postsecondary Options.  NGA Center for Best Practices.  www.nga.org/cda/files/0407HIGHSCHOOL.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams’ assertion that principals and local school administrators should have greater power in deciding how funds are spent is supported by research by the National Governors Association’s Center for Best Practices.  NGA research proves that “Principals need discretion to direct resources in ways that match curriculum, instruction, and support services with students’ identified needs.”   &lt;ref name="ConklinSmith"/&gt;  This research also suggests that “decentralized budget authority is a contributing factor to school effectiveness,” primarily in high-performing, high-poverty schools (Conklin and Smith, 1).  Bearing this research in mind, it seems as if granting greater authority to local school administrators in terms of personnel hiring and budget distribution may lead to a more successful Kentucky educational system for all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16975">'''Education sector responses to substance abuse''' refers to the way in which the [[Education#Education sector|education sector]] strategizes, developments and implements policies and practices that address the use of [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[drug]]s in educational settings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247509e.pdf|title=Education sector responses to the use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100211-3|location=|pages=30–37, 41, 44, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education response ecosystem ==
Within the education sector, there is a diversity of actors and systems to address substance use. These  are elements of an effective education sector response which include
* A policy framework to prevent and address substance use among children and young people;
* National and/or subnational [[Curriculum|curricula]] (contents and methods for the delivery of those contents) including skills-based prevention education;
* Training and support for teachers, school health practitioners and other school staff to plan, develop and implement a comprehensive school-based intervention strategy;
* Evidence-based interventions related to curricula implemented in educational institutions;
* Evidence-based interventions related to the school environment implemented in educational institutions, including substance use policies in schools, as well as other evidence-based prevention interventions delivered in the context of educational institutions;
* School health services, providing both prevention and care and support for young people who use substances;
* Management, coordination and evaluation of the response in the education sector, including monitoring of prevalence of substance use among children and young people.

== Curricula ==
Substance use is one of several important social and health issues that society calls on the education sector to address through the curriculum, along with other behavioural prevention areas, for example, mental health, sexual health, nutrition and bullying. In a curriculum, substance use prevention education is usually and most appropriately accommodated in a health-related subject area (variously termed healthy active living, health and family living, health and physical education, personal and social skills education, health and career education, life-skills education, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many schools choose also to supplement or replace the standard life-skills or other health-related curriculum with a manualized programme, i.e., a programme standardized through the creation of manuals and protocols for those who implement it. This has been shown by research to be effective in preventing substance use later in life and/ or supporting resilient mental health or acquiring life or academic skills.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNODC. 2013. ''International Standards on Drug Use Prevention''. Vienna: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/prevention/prevention-&lt;/nowiki&gt; standards.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Curriculum aiming to prevent substance use before the typical age of first use within the school system is directed at children who are around 6–12 years old. The typical age of first use of any substance will vary according to the national or local situation. Prevention education curriculum during this period is centred on what is referred to as ‘skills-based health education’.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. 2003. ''Skills for Health. Skills-based health education including life skills: An important component of a Child- Friendly/Health-Promoting School''. Geneva: WHO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. who.int/school_youth_health/media/en/sch_skills4health_03. pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It aims to develop key personal and social skills such as those that support healthy emotional and social development during this period, and protect against later substance use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to protecting against later substance use, skills-based education has also been shown to have a positive effect on general problem behaviours, commitment to school, academic performance, self-esteem, mental well- being, self-management and other social skills (besides Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States, the evidence also originates from Africa, Latin America and India).&lt;ref&gt;Durlak, J.A., Weissberg, R.P., Dymnicki, A.B., Taylor, R.D. and Schellinger, K.B. 2011. The impact of enhancing students’ social and emotional learning: a meta-analysis of school-based universal interventions. ''Child Development'', Vol. 82, pp. 405–432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foxcroft, D.R. and Tsertsvadze, A. 2011b. Universal multi- component prevention programs for alcohol misuse in young people. ''Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' (Online). Issue 9, Art No.: CD009307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Training and supporting educators and other personnel ==
Research has found that training increases the likelihood that a teacher will actually deliver skills-based prevention content, and do it in the way it was intended. Training can help teachers adapt programme methods to their own teaching styles and aptitudes, while retaining the core components of the programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller-Day, M., Pettigrew, J. and Hecht, M.L. 2013. How prevention curricula are taught under real-world conditions: Types of and reasons for teacher curriculum adaptations. ''Health Education'', Vol. 113, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence-based responses at school level ==
At the school level, approaches to responding to substance use can be broken down into two categories: Universal prevention and selective and indicated prevention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Universal prevention ===
Universal prevention aims to prevent substance use in the school population at large. This approach aims to reduce risks across the school or target age/ year group by providing knowledge and skills that are protective towards substance use, or by changing school policies and environment in ways that prevent and reduce substance use among all students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Selective and indicated prevention ===
Selective and indicated prevention targets individuals or groups deemed at particular risk of initiating substance use or who are already involved in substance use behaviours. These approaches involve identifying at-risk individuals or groups and targeting prevention efforts towards them, or identifying those who are showing early signs of substance use and then intervening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== School health services ==
[[School health and nutrition services|School health services]] are most commonly led by nurses, but doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, dentists, social workers and counsellors may also be involved. By virtue of their professional training, nurses are very well positioned to provide a central role with school-based health services and with substance use prevention. Their professional role permits them to:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== National education sector policies on substance use prevention ==
At the national level, education sector involvement is most effective in the context of a long-term integrated substance use prevention and control system or strategy that targets various ages and levels of vulnerability through a full range of sectors. A majority of countries have national policies or strategies/ action plans concerned with tobacco and the reduction of supply and demand of drugs, and many have a separate alcohol policy or strategy. However, the trend is toward comprehensive and balanced policies or strategies that integrate the various substances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Current substance use control strategies increasingly understand substance use to be first and foremost a health issue that is best addressed through a range of demand reduction measures including: early intervention; treatment; [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]; recovery and social reintegration measures; and measures to minimize the public health and social consequences of substance abuse.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;UNODC. 2014. E/CN.7/2014/7. Action taken by Member States to implement the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem. Report of the Executive Director. Available at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/CND_Sessions/ CND_57/_E-CN7-2014-07/E-CN7-2014-7_V1389056_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; All of these functions, including prevention, can fall within the purview of a public health system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The national education sector derives a clear mandate to respond to substance use through policy language that typically calls the sector to take responsibility for promoting ‘health and safety’, ‘healthy lifestyles’ or ‘life- skills’ among students. For example, within the Eastern European and Central Asian region, most countries address the primary goal of substance use prevention by establishing education laws that oblige schools to build skills and foster a culture of healthy lifestyles and safe behaviour among children and young people.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2015b. Substance use prevention in educational settings in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Moscow: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this context, national education sector substance use prevention policy has taken a number of forms, and can be categorized as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mandatory school substance policies ===
National substance policies may mandate school policies to prevent substance use and its health and social consequences within schools. This typically includes bans on substances (use, selling and advertising) on school premises or surrounding properties. School rules relating to substance use often include the behaviours of teachers and other adults, and policies regarding dealing with substance use-related incidents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Statutory health and substance use education ===
National education policies may enshrine the duty of schools to provide health and/or substance use- related education and training. Such training is often incorporated within other subject headings such as science or physical education, or in free-standing health or personal skills curricula. This often implies that prevention methodologies and contents are part of the mandatory teacher training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Provision of school health services ===
National policies may mandate the implementation of school health services. These services allow for the provision of an accessible range of health services including preventive, routine and acute health services for students. They may include a range of personnel, including school nurses, advisors and counsellors and mental health professionals. The services provided often contribute to preventive education, the development of school health and substance use policies, early identi cation and interventions and connections with the social and health sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== National quality standards for school-based prevention efforts ===
School substance use prevention can be encouraged and guided by quality standards. They are increasingly available (e.g. European drug prevention quality standards;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/manuals/prevention-&lt;/nowiki&gt; standards&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Standards for School-based Youth Substance Abuse Prevention),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ccsa.ca/Eng/topics/Children-and-Youth/Drug-Prevention-&lt;/nowiki&gt; Standards/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and typically advocate for evidence-based programming, sound planning and design, comprehensive activity, monitoring, evaluation, professional development and sustainability. Quality standards help to support national policy initiatives and guide schools in meeting their mandate to promote health and prevent substance use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Monitoring of substance use among children and young people ===
Some countries participate in global or regional monitoring or conduct national- level monitoring of substance use prevalence among children and adolescents. This is not an education sector activity per se but it does indicate that the issue is a priority, providing a measure of endorsement and most importantly, guidance, for school prevention activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== International frameworks to guide Education sector responses to substance abuse ==
A number of international statutes stipulate the responsibility of various sectors, including the education sector, to prevent and minimize harm from substance use among children and young people. Most relevant are the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== International policy initiatives that enshrine the right of children and young people to health and safety ===
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966);
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989);
* [[Education For All|Dakar Framework for Action – Education for All]] (2000), and [[Incheon declaration|Incheon Declaration – Education 2030]]: Towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all (2015);
* Declaration and Plan of Action ‘A World Fit for Children’ (2002);
* UN Global Monitoring Framework (2013).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Recent policy conventions focusing on the management of psychoactive substances and substance use call for broad action ===
* [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (2005); 
* Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem (2009); 
* WHO Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol (2010).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== UN International Drug Control Conventions that provide a framework for efforts to control the supply and demand for illicit drugs ===
* [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] (1961);
* The Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971);
* Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Recent initiatives that may inform and mandate an education sector response ===
* In the 2030 Development Agenda adopted in 2015, the UN Member States commit to strengthen prevention and treatment of substance abuse by 2030, in the sub goal 3.5.
* The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] (CND) calls on ‘Member States to formulate and implement, where appropriate, a broad system of primary prevention and early intervention based on scientifoc evidence, such as the International Standards on Drug Use Prevention and other measures, including educational activities and interactive campaigns’.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The Outcome Document of the UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs, organized in 2016, highlights a balanced health- and human rights-based approach to addressing the world drug problem, giving an additional mandate to drug prevention and treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Emeritus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|ɛr|ᵻ|t|ə|s}}),{{#tag:ref|
feminine '''''emerita''''' or '''''emeritus'''''; plural '''''emeriti''''' (masc.) or '''''emeritae''''' (fem.); abbreviation '''''emer.'''''
|group=Note}} in its current usage, is an adjective used to designate a retired [[professor]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|pastor]], [[bishop]], [[pope]], [[Company director|director]], [[president]], [[prime minister]], [[rabbi]], or other person.

In some cases, the term is conferred automatically upon all persons who retire at a given rank, but in others, it remains a mark of distinguished service, awarded to only a few on retirement. It is also used when a person of distinction in a profession retires or hands over the position, enabling their former rank to be retained in their title, e.g., "Professor Emeritus". The term ''emeritus'' does not necessarily signify that a person has relinquished all the duties of their former position, and they may continue to exercise some of them.

== Etymology ==
''Emerere'' is a compound of the [[Latin]] prefix ''e-'' (a variant of ''ex-'') meaning "out of, from" and ''merere'' meaning "earn"; ''emeritus'' is the past participle of the verb.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=emeritus Etymonline: "emeritus"]&lt;/ref&gt; The female equivalent, '''''emerita''''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|m|ɛr|ᵻ|t|ə}}{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-01-26|emerita}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-26|emerita}}}}), is also sometimes used, but as is often true of [[loanword]]s, the use of the donor language's [[inflection]]al system faces limits in the recipient language; in English,  ''emeritus'' is often unmarked for gender.

==In academia==
In the United States, a fully [[tenure]]d professor who retires from an educational institution in good standing may be given the title "professor emeritus" regardless of gender. The title "professor emerita" is sometimes used for women. In most systems and institutions, the rank is bestowed on all professors who have retired in good standing, while at others, it needs a special act or vote. Professors emeriti may, depending on local circumstances, retain office space or other privileges. The word is used either as a postpositional adjective (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;"professor emeritus", [[Noam Chomsky]], the renowned scholar and MIT professor emeritus), or as a prepositional adjective (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;"emeritus professor"). The concept has in some places been expanded to include tenured associate professors or non-tenure-track faculty.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and most other parts of the world,{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} the term "emeritus professor" is given only to a person of outstanding merit who had full professorial status before he or she retired. The possession of a PhD or other higher degree, or even full professorial status, is not sufficient for calling oneself "emeritus professor" upon retirement. The term "Professor Emeritus" is also recognised in the [[United Kingdom]]. The word is capitalized when it forms part of a title which is capitalized. [[Oxbridge]] [[Collegiate university|colleges]] may appoint distinguished [[Oxford fellow|fellows]] who have retired as "Emeritus Fellow".

==Other uses==

When a diocesan bishop or auxiliary bishop retires, the word ''emeritus'' is added to his former title, i.e., "Archbishop Emeritus of ...", "Bishop Emeritus of ...", or "Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus of ..."  Examples of usage are: "The Most Reverend (or Right Reverend) John Jones, Bishop Emeritus of Anytown"; and "His Eminence Cardinal James Smith, Archbishop Emeritus of Anycity". The term "Bishop Emeritus" of a particular see can apply to several people, if the first lives long enough. The sees listed in the 2007 Annuario Pontificio as having more than one (Arch)Bishop Emeritus included Zárate-Campana, Villavicencio, Versailles, and Uruguaiana. There were even three Archbishops Emeriti of Taipei. The same suffix was applied to the [[Bishop of Rome]], [[Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI]], on his retirement. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] the word ''emeritus'' does not imply that the person in question is no longer a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Since 2001, the honorary title of [[President pro tempore emeritus of the United States Senate|president pro tempore emeritus]] has been given to a Senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore of the [[United States Senate]]. The position has been held by [[Strom Thurmond]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]]) (2001-2003), [[Robert Byrd]] (D-[[List of United States Senators from West Virginia|West Virginia]]) (2003-2007), [[Ted Stevens]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Alaska|Alaska]]) (2007-2009), and [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-[[List of United States Senators from Vermont|Vermont]]) (2015-present).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-resolution/6/text Text - S.Res.6 - 114th Congress (2015-2016): A resolution expressing the thanks of the Senate to the Honorable Patrick J. Leahy for his service as President Pro Tempore of the...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also commonly used in business and [[nonprofit organization]]s to denote perpetual status of the founder of an organization or individuals who moved the organization to new heights as a former key member on the [[board of directors]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[chairman]] emeritus; director emeritus; president of the board emeritus).

In [[Community of Christ]], the status of emeritus is occasionally granted to senior officials upon retirement.  In 1938, Frederick A. Smith was given the title of "president emeritus" of the Order of Evangelists (one of the presiding councils of the church), though the president of that body at that time was more commonly known as Presiding Patriarch.  Roy A. Cheville became Presiding Patriarch Emeritus  in 1974.  W. Wallace Smith became the first person to retire as President of the Church (all prior presidents having served until death), and was accorded the title President Emeritus in 1978.  His successor, Wallace B. Smith, was also given the title of President Emeritus, upon his own retirement in 1996.  He continues to hold that status to this day.

The history of the ENPEG started with the foundation of a sculpture and wood carving school in the former [[La Merced Cloister]] (Exconvento de la Merced) in the [[Historic center of Mexico City]] by [[Guillermo Ruiz (artist)|Guillermo Ruiz]] in 1927. In the 1930s, the school moved to the alley Callejón de la Esmeralda (now Calle San Fernando), [[Colonia Guerrero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2013/05/30/cultura/a05n1cul|newspaper=Jornada|date=2013-05-30|title=El edificio de La Esmeralda hecho por un arquitecto de firma, causa polémica|trans-title=The La Esmeralda building made by a firm's architect causes controversy|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave it the name "La Esmeralda". Also [[Raúl Anguiano]], [[Feliciano Peña]] and [[José Chávez Morado]] taught in Ruiz' school. In 1943 [[Antonio M. Ruiz]] became head of the seemingly provisorily school. He redesigned the building, separated the training in classes and developed the first curriculum, which achieved certification by the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]] in 1943 accompanied by the official status of an art school.&lt;ref name="Ruiz"&gt;[http://bibart.cenart.gob.mx/boletin/boletin01.pdf.

[[File:Akademia FSB.jpg|right|200px|FSB Emblem]]
The '''FSB Academy''' (Академия федеральной службы безопасности Российской Федерации, formerly known as The Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the [[KGB]]), is an education and research institution federally chartered to prepare Russian Intelligence personnel for the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] in particular and for the [[Russian Intelligence Community]] in general.

The academy was formed by [[President of Russia|presidential]] decree in August 24, 1992 on the foundation of the Higher School of the [[KGB]], and is located in Michurinsky Prospekt, [[Moscow]], Russia. It consists of the [[Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science]] (Институт криптографии, связи и информатики, ИКСИ) and the [[Institute for Operational Training]] (Институт подготовки оперативного состава, ИПОС&lt;ref&gt;Which its training site is located in Balashikha, in [[Moscow Oblast]], and called Balashikha-1.&lt;/ref&gt;) in various facilities. &lt;ref&gt;[http://newsru.com/russia/21jun2008/fsb.html Бортников напутствовал медалистов Академии ФСБ: вы "будете верны традициям, заложенным нашими ветеранами"], ''Bortnikov, to the medalists of FSB Academy: Shall all of you "will be true to the traditions laid down by our veterans"'', NEWSru.com&lt;/ref&gt;

General-Colonel Victor Ostroukhov has been Head of the Academy since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academy.fsb.ru/i_rukovodstvo.html The Head of FSB Academy - Viktor Ostroukhov], FSB Academy official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Presidium of the [[Cheka|VChK]] (The first security service of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]]) decided in January 25, 1921 to establish a special institute for operational training. The first course began April 26, 1921, and the first Head of the course was M. Romanovsky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 the course was renamed the Higher Courses of the [[State Political Directorate]] (GPU).

In May 1930 [[Moscow]] created higher schools for basic and advanced training of secret agents; in June 4, 1930 the school was known as the Central School of OGPU. July 14, 1934, after the formation of the [[NKVD|People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs]], the former OGPU Central School was renamed the Central School of General Directorate for State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD.

On March 21, 1939 the Central School of GUGB NKVD was reorganized as the Graduate School of the NKVD. By the early 1940s, every third head of the Soviet security organs was a graduate of the course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Patriotic War]], the school trained more than seven thousand security officers who organized the fight against the [[Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/smi/overview/single.htm!id%3D10342507@fsbSmi.html АКАДЕМИЯ ФСБ - TERRA INCOGNITA], FSB.Ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Six graduates of the Higher School became [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]]: Dmitry N. Medvedev, V.A. Molodtsov (posthumously), A. M. Rabtsevich, V.A. Lyagin (posthumously), P.A Zhidkov and E.I. Mirkovsky.

On August 30, 1945 the Graduate School of the NKVD was awarded the Red Banner and the Diploma by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. By resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on July 15, 1952, the Graduate School of the MGB (Ministry for State Security) was established as a special institution of higher education with a three-year apprenticeship program for students of law schools.

By Resolution of the Council of Ministers on August 2, 1962 the [[KGB]] Higher School was named after Dzerzhinsky. During the 1960s to 1980s, graduates took part in countering foreign intelligence services and conducting operational and combat activities.

In 1995 the Higher School of the KGB was renamed the FSB Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nomad.su/?a=10-200301250019 Татьянин день, бывший когда-то праздником Московского государственного университета, сегодня с удовольствием отмечают все российские студенты.

'''Health humanities''' refers to the application of the creative or [[The arts|fine arts]] (including [[visual arts]], [[music]], [[performing arts]]) and [[humanities]] disciplines (including [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], [[languages]], [[law]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], etc.) to discourse about, express, and/or promote dimensions of [[human]] [[health]] and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/scope/about/|title="What is Health Humanities?"|last=|first=|date=2016|website=SCOPE: The Health Humanities Learning Lab|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applied capacity of the humanities is not itself a novel idea; however, the construct of the health humanities has only recently begun to emerge over the first decade of the 21st Century. Historically, the roots informing the health humanities can be traced back to, and can now be considered to include, such multidisciplinary areas as the [[medical humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mh.bmj.com/ |title=Medical Humanities - BMJ Journals |publisher=Mh.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Expressive therapy|expressive therapies/creative arts therapies]].

In the health humanities, health (and the promotion of health) is understood according to the [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] (and other [[non-positivist]]) principles indigenous to the humanities, as opposed to the [[positivism]] of [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Squier, S. M. (2007). Beyond nescience: The intersectional insights of health humanities. ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 50'' (3), 334-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emua.ac.uk/downloads/BBsept09/healthhumanities.pptx&lt;/ref&gt; The health humanities are rooted in dialogical (negotiated, intersubjective voices of multiple truths), versus monological (a singular, authoritative voice of "the" truth) perspectives on health. As such, evidence upon which health practices are based is generally considered [[Axiology|axiological]] (based in meanings, values, and aesthetics), versus [[Epistemology|epistemological]] (based in factual knowledge), in orientation. The health humanities are not an alternative to the health sciences, but rather offer a contrasting paradigm and pragmatic approach with respect to health and its promotion, and can function in a manner that is complementary and simultaneous relative to the health sciences.  

The health humanities are a growing movement internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org&lt;/ref&gt;  A conference on the health humanities was held October 13–15, 2006, at [[Green College, University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhum.arts.ubc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was co-organized by Judy Segal (UBC English) and Alan Richardson (UBC Philosophy) and featured presentations by Jacalyn Duffin, Carl Elliott, Nicholas King, Lorelei Lingard, Robert Proctor, Susan Squier, Andrea Tone, and Kathleen Woodward.  In January 2009, [[Paul Crawford (academic)|Paul Crawford]] became the world's first Professor of Health Humanities at [[The University of Nottingham]], and with Dr Victoria Tischler, Charley Baker, Dr Brian Brown, Dr Lisa Mooney-Smith and Professor Ronald Carter created an international health humanities initiative that included the AHRC-funded International Health Humanities Conference (IHHC). The first field description for Health Humanities was presented in the key article "Health Humanities: The future of Medical Humanities" (Crawford, Brown, Tischler, &amp; Baker, 2010), published in the Mental Health Review Journal.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, P., Brown, B., Tischler, V. &amp; Baker, C. (2010) Health Humanities: The future of medical humanities? ''Mental Health Review Journal, 15'' (3): 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st International Health Humanities Conference was held 6–8 August 2010, at [[The University of Nottingham]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madnessandliterature.org/Resources/IHHC-flyer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madnessandliterature.org/Resources/First-International-Health-Humanities-Conference-Programme.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference opened with Professor Crawford's address entitled ‘Health humanities: Literature and Madness’ and included keynote lectures by Professor Kay Redfield Jamison and Professor Elaine Showalter. Mark A. Radcliffe, who also spoke at the conference, reported on 'health humanities' in his weekly column for the Nursing Times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursingtimes.net/forums-blogs-ideas-debate/nursing-blogs/health-humanities-feared-by-the-bad-loved-by-the-good/5018154.article?referrer=RSS&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was also reported in the Bethlem Blog.&lt;ref&gt;'Madness and Literature: Report from International Health Humanities Conference’, 16 August 2010. http://bethlemheritage.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd International Health Humanities Conference was hosted in the USA, 9–11 August 2012, at [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey, with the theme of "Music, Health, and Humanity." The 3rd International Health Humanities Conference was held 5-7 September 2014, once again at the University of Nottingham, and featured the theme of "Traumatextualities: Trauma in the Clinical, Arts and Humanities Contexts."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org/blog/view/0/50&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th International Health Humanities Conference was held 30 April and 1-2 May 2015, at the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, [[Anschutz Medical Campus]], [[University of Colorado]], Denver, featuring the theme of "Health Humanities: The Next Decade (Pedagogies, Practices, Politics)." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/centers/BioethicsHumanities/ArtsHumanities/Pages/Health%20Humanities%20Conference.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th International Health Humanities Conference will be held 15-17 September 2016, at the [[University of Seville]], Seville, Spain, featuring the theme of "Arts and Humanities for Improving Social Inclusion, Education, and Health: Creative Practice and Mutuality." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihhcsevilla2016.es/index?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Textbooks on the health humanities include ''Health Humanities Reader''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, T., Wear, D., &amp; Friedman, L. D. (Eds.). (2014). ''Health Humanities Reader''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Health Humanities''.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, P., Brown, B., Baker, C., Tischler, V., &amp; Abrams, B. (2015). ''Health Humanities''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a Health Humanities Centre was established at University College London, dedicated to research and teaching in the Health Humanities, including an MA in Health Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-humanities|title=UCL Health Humanities Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hope credit''', provided by {{UnitedStatesCode|26|25A}}(b), was available to [[taxpayer]]s who have incurred expenses related to the first two years of postsecondary education.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch03.html Publication 970 (2009), ''Tax Benefits for Education'': Hope Credit&lt;/ref&gt; For this credit to be claimed by a taxpayer, the student must attend school on at least a part-time basis. The credit can be claimed for education expenses incurred by the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or the taxpayer's dependent. Starting with tax year 2009, the Hope credit had been supplanted by the more generous [[American Opportunity Tax Credit]].

This credit allows for the first $1,200 in "qualified tuition and related expenses," as well as half of qualifying expenses between $1,200 and $2,400, to be fully creditable against the taxpayer's total tax liability. The maximum amount of the credit is $1,800 per eligible student.

==Qualifying requirements==
An eligible student must meet all of the following requirements to deduct the Hope credit:
*  be enrolled in one of the first two years of post-secondary education;or a trade school in which they may receive an education
*  be enrolled in a program that leads to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential;
*  be taking at least half of the normal full-time work load for his/her course of study for at least one academic period beginning during the calendar year;
*  not have a felony conviction for possessing or distributing a controlled substance.&lt;ref name="webtax"&gt;[http://www.wwwebtax.com/credits/hope_credit.htm The Hope Credit and College, IRS and Tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231135201/http://www.wwwebtax.com/credits/hope_credit.htm |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Qualified tuition and related expenses" is defined as "the tuition and fees paid at most colleges, universities, and any trade school for the enrollment or attendance of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or any dependent of the taxpayer.&lt;ref name=Donaldson&gt;Samuel A. Donaldson, ''Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials'', 2nd edition (St. Paul: Thomson/West, 2007), 37-8.&lt;/ref&gt; These qualifying expenses do not include student activity fees, athletic fees, insurance costs, or room and board expenses.&lt;ref name=Donaldson/&gt;

==Limitations==
The Hope credit is subject to limitations. First, the credit will be lost if the student is convicted of a [[felony]] drug offense.&lt;ref name=Donaldson/&gt; Second, a taxpayer may not take both a Hope credit and a [[Lifetime Learning Credit]] or tuition and fees deduction for the same student in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Form 8863: Education Credits. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8863.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Third, a taxpayer may only take the credit during the first two years of post-secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;RS Publication 970 (2006): Tax Benefits for Education. https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch02.html#d0e1756&lt;/ref&gt;  The credit amount is phased out gradually once a taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $50,000 ($100,000 if filing jointly) and the credit is phased out entirely once a taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $60,000 ($120,000 if filing jointly).&lt;ref&gt;IRS. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

According to Paulsen and Smart,&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Paulsen &amp; John C. Smart. ''The Book the Finance of Higher Education: Theory, Research, Policy, and Practice'', pages 351-352.&lt;/ref&gt; the federal Hope tax credit gets its name from Georgia's merit-based scholarship program of the same name, HOPE (Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtae.org/hope.html Technical College System of Georgia – Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511140534/http://www.dtae.org/hope.html |date=2012-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Georgia state scholarship is a merit scholarship, the tax credit is not.

The Georgia state lottery-funded [[HOPE Scholarship]] program (1993) pre-dates the federal tax credit (1998) by five years.

'''Industrial management''', as a field of [[business administration]], studies the structure and organization of [[Industry|industrial]] companies. It comprises those fields of business administration that are necessary for the success of companies within the [[manufacturing]] sector and the encompassing services (primarily [[operations management]], [[marketing]], and [[financial management]]).

== Term industrial company ==
The term industrial company is generally applied to a manufacturing firm that – contrary to a crafts business – produces consumer durables in [[Factory|factories]] from raw materials in mass and serial production ([[division of labour]]) using modern manufacturing machines.

== History of industrial management ==
The precursor of the study field industrial management was [[factory]] management. It had a strong similarity with technical [[Business administration|management]] and was geared towards the engineering fields. Parallel to this, there was also a factory management that was more in the area of business economics. This dealt with the organizational questions of factory and [[office administration]] as well as financial [[accounting]], e.g. the factory [[bookkeeping]] and late also [[management accounting]].

The term and the contents of present-day industrial management were strongly influenced by the establishment of MIT School of Industrial Management in 1952 (renamed the [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan School of Management]] in 1964 after its benefactor, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., MIT graduate and then-chairman of General Motors). MIT School of Industrial Management set itself the goal of educating the "ideal manager" through this (post)graduate management program.

== Course of studies ==
Graduate programs in industrial management draw on Sloan’s idea and provide engineers with a strategic management education with a focus on production management, marketing, financial management, human resources as well as commercial law – supplemented by [[corporate governance]], [[corporate social responsibility]] and [[sustainability]] topics. The primary goal is to enable students and professionals to take a holistic approach to industry management.

Most graduate studies in industrial management are full-time [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree programs that, in addition to a preferably engineering bachelor’s degree, also require several years of professional experience. In general, students spend the first year of their degree acquiring both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills needed to practice them. After the second year, students usually seek internships and pursue elective courses, which often go towards a specialization in their master’s thesis.

Study programs in industrial management are very popular in economies with a high value of manufacturing output, such as the United States and Germany. Especially German research universities incorporate a large number of advanced courses in engineering in their graduate program in industrial management and are, thus, more like [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.-]] programs. On the other hand, U.S. universities and [[Vocational university|universities of applied sciences]] in Germany offer MBA programs in industrial management that follow more the original idea of Sloan and emphasize hands-on application of theory.

Indian institutes such as National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Mumbai, offers two year full time residential course PGDIM - Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Management which is equivalent to MBA.

'''Interior design''' is the [[art]] and [[science]] of enhancing the interior of a [[building]] to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. An '''interior designer''' is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and execution of the design.

==History and current terms==
[[Image:Vlkolínec, Slovakia 020.jpg|thumb|right|Typical interior of one of the houses in the Folk Architecture Reservation in [[Vlkolínec]] ([[Slovakia]])]]
In the past, interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Pile, J., 2003, Interior Design, 3rd edn, Pearson, New Jersey, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex [[architecture]] that has resulted from the development of industrial processes. The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of ''interior decorator'', a term commonly used in the US. The term is less common in the UK where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.

In ancient India, architects used to work as interior designers. This can be seen from the references of Vishwakarma the architect - one of the gods in Indian mythology. Additionally, the sculptures depicting ancient texts and events are seen in palaces built in 17th-century India.

In ancient Egypt, "soul houses" or models of houses were placed in tombs as receptacles for food offerings.  From these, it is possible to discern details about the interior design of different residences throughout the different Egyptian dynasties, such as changes in ventilation, porticoes, columns, loggias, windows, and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, R.G. ''History of Interior Design Furniture: From Ancient Egypt to Nineteenth-Century Europe''. J. Wiley, 2006, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 17th and 18th century and into the early 19th century, interior decoration was the concern of the homemaker, or an employed [[upholsterer]] or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an interior space. Architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to complete interior design for their buildings.

===Commercial interior design and management===
In the mid-to-late 19th century, interior design services expanded greatly, as the [[middle class]] in [[industrial revolution|industrial]] countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to cement their new status. Large [[furniture]] firms began to branch out into general interior design and management, offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles. This business model flourished from the mid-century to 1914, when this role was increasingly usurped by independent, often amateur, designers. This paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Clive|date=4 February 2013|title=Complete House Furnishers: The Retailer as Interior Designer in Nineteenth-Century London|journal=Journal of Interior Design|volume=38|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/joid.12000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shoolbred catalogue.jpg|thumb|Illustrated catalog of the [[James Shoolbred|James Shoolbred Company]], published in 1876.]]
In the 1950s and 1960s, upholsterers began to expand their business remits. They framed their business more broadly and in artistic terms and began to advertise their furnishings to the public. To meet the growing demand for contract interior work on projects such as [[office]]s, [[hotel]]s, and [[public building]]s, these businesses became much larger and more complex, employing builders, joiners, plasterers, textile designers, artists, and furniture designers, as well as engineers and technicians to fulfil the job. Firms began to publish and circulate [[Trade literature|catalogs]] with prints for different lavish styles to attract the attention of expanding middle classes.&lt;ref name="wiley" /&gt;

As department stores increased in number and size, retail spaces within shops were furnished in different styles as examples for customers. One particularly effective advertising tool was to set up model rooms at national and international [[exhibition]]s in showrooms for the public to see. Some of the pioneering firms in this regard were [[Waring &amp; Gillow]], [[James Shoolbred]], [[Mintons]], and Holland &amp; Sons. These traditional high-quality furniture making firms began to play an important role as advisers to unsure middle class customers on taste and style, and began taking out contracts to design and furnish the interiors of many important buildings in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/Default.aspx?ContentID=156993&amp;CategoryID=36646|title=Amanda Girling-Budd’s Statement|accessdate=2012-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829143857/http://rca.ac.uk/Default.aspx?ContentID=156993&amp;CategoryID=36646|archive-date=2012-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of firm emerged in America after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Herter Brothers]], founded by two German emigre brothers, began as an upholstery warehouse and became one of the first firms of furniture makers and [[interior decorator]]s. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers were prepared to accomplish every aspect of interior furnishing including decorative paneling and mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, and carpets and draperies.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Katherine S. ''Herter Brothers: Furniture and Interiors for a Gilded Age.'' Harry N. Abrams: Metropolitan Museum of Art in association with the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8109-3426-4}}.1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wallpaper group-p6m-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Illustration from ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), by interior designer [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]].]]
A pivotal figure in popularizing theories of interior design to the middle class was the architect [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], one of the most influential design theorists of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Clouse, Doug. "The Handy Book of Artistic Printing: Collection of Letterpress Examples with Specimens of Type, Ornament, Corner Fills, Borders, Twisters, Wrinklers, and other Freaks of Fancy". Princeton Architectural Press, 2009. p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' first project was his most important—in 1851 he was responsible for not only the decoration of [[Joseph Paxton]]’s gigantic [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] for the [[Great Exhibition]], but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within. He chose a controversial [[color theory|palette]] of red, yellow, and blue for the interior ironwork and, despite initial negative publicity in the newspapers, was eventually unveiled by [[Queen Victoria]] to much critical acclaim. His most significant publication was ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856),&lt;ref&gt;Clouse, Doug. "The Handy Book of Artistic Printing: Collection of Letterpress Examples with Specimens of Type, Ornament, Corner Fills, Borders, Twisters, Wrinklers, and other Freaks of Fancy". Princeton Architectural Press, 2009. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; in which Jones formulated 37 key principles of interior design and decoration.

Jones was employed by some of the leading interior design firms of the day; in the 1860s he worked in collaboration with the London firm Jackson &amp; Graham to produce furniture and other fittings for high-profile clients including art collector [[Alfred Morrison]] and the [[Khedive]] of Egypt, [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]].

In 1882, the [[Kelly's Directory|London Directory]] of the [[Post Office]] listed 80 interior decorators. Some of the most distinguished companies of the period were [[John Dibblee Crace|Crace]], Waring &amp; Gillow and Holland &amp; Sons; famous decorators employed by these firms included [[Thomas Edward Collcutt]], [[Edward William Godwin]], [[Charles Barry]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[George Edmund Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcLc-1rLq5oC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Turning Houses Into Homes: A History of the Retailing and Consumption of Domestic Furnishings|author=Clive Edwards|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to professional interior design===
[[File:Design for a room by John Dibblee Crace.jpg|thumb|300px|This interior was designed by [[John Dibblee Crace]], President of the Institute of British Decorators, established in 1899.]]
By the turn of the 20th century, amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design. English [[feminism|feminist]] author [[Mary Haweis]] wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIARJjg8w_gC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gender and Art|author=Gillian Perry|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She advocated the individual adoption of a particular style, tailor made to the individual needs and preferences of the customer:
:"One of my strongest convictions, and one of the first canons of good taste, is that our houses, like the fish’s shell and the bird’s nest, ought to represent our individual taste and habits.''

The move towards decoration as a separate artistic profession unrelated to the manufacturers and retailers, received an impetus with the 1899 formation of the Institute of British Decorators; with [[John Dibblee Crace]] as its president it represented almost 200 decorators around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facultyofdecoration.org/history.htm|title=History|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915, the London Directory listed 127 individuals trading as interior decorators, of which 10 were women. Rhoda and Agnes Garrett were the first women to train professionally as home decorators in 1874. The importance of their work on design was regarded at the time as on a par with that of [[William Morris]]. In 1876, their work - ''Suggestions for House Decoration in Painting, Woodwork and Furniture'' - spread their ideas on artistic interior design to a wide middle-class audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=53628&amp;back=|title=Garrett sisters|publisher=DNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the situation was described by ''The Illustrated Carpenter and Builder'':
:"Until recently when a man wanted to furnish he would visit all the dealers and select piece by piece of furniture ....Today he sends for a dealer in art furnishings and fittings who surveys all the rooms in the house and he brings his artistic mind to bear on the subject."&lt;ref&gt;The Illustrated Carpenter and Builder, December 7 (1900): Suppl. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, [[Candace Wheeler]] was one of the first woman [[interior designers]] and helped encourage a new style of American design. She was instrumental in the development of art courses for women in a number of major American cities and was considered a national authority on homedesign. An important influence on the new profession was ''[[The Decoration of Houses]]'', a manual of interior design written by [[Edith Wharton]] with architect [[Ogden Codman]] in 1897 in America. In the book, the authors denounced Victorian-style [[interior decoration]] and interior design, especially those rooms that were decorated with heavy window curtains, [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian bric-a-brac]] and overstuffed furniture. They argued that such rooms emphasized upholstery at the expense of proper space planning and architectural design and were, therefore, uncomfortable and rarely used. The book is considered a seminal work and its success led to the emergence of professional decorators working in the manner advocated by its authors, most notably [[Elsie de Wolfe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/wharton/whar3.htm "Edith Wharton's World"] National Portrait Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Elsiedewolfe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elsie de Wolfe]], taken from ''The House in Good Taste'', 1913.]]
[[Elsie De Wolfe]] was one of the first interior designers. Rejecting the Victorian style she grew up with, she chose a more vibrant scheme, along with more comfortable furniture in the home. Her designs were light, with fresh colors and delicate [[Chinoiserie]] furnishings, as opposed to the Victorian preference of heavy, red drapes and upholstery, dark wood and intensely patterned wallpapers. Her designs were also more practical;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Flanner |first=J. |year=2009 |publisher=The New Yorker |title= Archive, Handsprings Across the Sea |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1938/01/15/1938_01_15_025_TNY_CARDS_000170753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she eliminated the clutter that occupied the Victorian home, enabling people to entertain more guests comfortably. In 1905, de Wolfe was commissioned for the interior design of the [[Colony Club]] on [[Madison Avenue]]; its interiors garnered her recognition almost over night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munhall|first=Edward|title=Elsie de Wolf: The American pioneer who vanquished Victorian gloom|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/architecture/archive/dewolfe_article_012000|publisher=Architectural Digest|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher (2003), "Streetscapes/Former Colony Club at 120 Madison Avenue; Stanford White Design, Elsie de Wolfe Interior," ''The New York Times'', 28 September 2003 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5D6143DF93BA1575AC0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print]&lt;/ref&gt; She compiled her ideas into her widely read 1913 book, ''The House in Good Taste''.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"&gt;Lees-Maffei, G, 2008, Introduction: Professionalization as a focus in Interior Design History, Journal of Design History, Vol. 21, No. 1, Spring.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Syrie Maugham]] became a legendary interior designer credited with designing the first all-white room. Starting her career in the early 1910s, her international reputation soon grew; she later expanded her business to [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Plunket, Robert. "Syrie's Turn: Once, everyone read W. Somerset Maugham. But now his late ex-wife is the one selling books", ''Sarasota Magazine'', 2006, v. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Born during the [[Victorian Era]], a time characterized by dark colors and small spaces, she instead designed rooms filled with light and furnished in multiple shades of white and mirrored screens. In addition to mirrored screens, her trademark pieces included: books covered in white vellum, cutlery with white porcelain handles, console tables with plaster palm-frond, shell, or dolphin bases, upholstered and fringed sleigh beds, fur carpets, dining chairs covered in white leather, and lamps of graduated glass balls, and wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5wYRQAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Pauline+C.+Metcalf%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtoUUqSIN47Ysgb2_YG4DA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ|title=Syrie Maugham: Staging the Glamorous Interiors|author=Pauline C. Metcalf|year=2010|publisher=Acanthus PressLlc|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
The interior design profession became more established after [[World War II]]. From the 1950s onwards, spending on the home increased. Interior design courses were established, requiring the publication of textbooks and reference sources. Historical accounts of interior designers and firms distinct from the decorative arts specialists were made available. Organisations to regulate education, qualifications, standards and practices, etc. were established for the profession.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt;

Interior design was previously seen as playing a secondary role to architecture. It also has many connections to other design disciplines, involving the work of [[architects]], [[industrial designers]], [[engineers]], builders, craftsmen, etc. For these reasons, the government of interior design standards and qualifications was often incorporated into other professional organisations that involved design.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt; Organisations such as the [[Chartered Society of Designers]], established in the UK in 1986, and the American Designers Institute, founded in 1938, governed various areas of design.

It was not until later that specific representation for the interior design profession was developed. The US National Society of Interior Designers was established in 1957, while in the UK the Interior Decorators and Designers Association was established in 1966. Across Europe, other organisations such as The Finnish Association of Interior Architects (1949) were being established and in 1994 the International Interior Design Association was founded.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt;

Ellen Mazur Thomson, author of ''Origins of Graphic Design in America'' (1997), determined that professional status is achieved through education, self-imposed standards and professional gate-keeping organizations.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt; Having achieved this, interior design became an accepted profession.

==Interior decorators and interior designers==
[[File:Michelin two-starred Shang Palace main dining hall.jpg|thumb|280px|Interior design in a restaurant]]
Interior design is the art and science of understanding people's behavior to create functional spaces within a building. Decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with fashionable or beautiful things. In short, interior designers may decorate, but decorators do not design.

===Interior designer===
Interior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning, [[functional design]] and the effective use of space, as compared to interior decorating. An interior designer in fineline design can undertake projects that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building as well as projects that require an understanding of technical issues such as window and door positioning, [[acoustics]], and [[lighting]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Although an interior designer may create the layout of a space, they may not alter load-bearing walls without having their designs stamped for approval by a structural engineer. Interior designers often work directly with architects, engineers and contractors.

Interior designers must be highly skilled in order to create interior environments that are functional, safe, and adhere to building codes, regulations and ADA requirements. They go beyond the selection of color palettes and furnishings and apply their knowledge to the development of construction documents, occupancy loads, healthcare regulations and sustainable design principles, as well as the management and coordination of professional services including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and life safety—all to ensure that people can live, learn or work in an innocuous environment that is also aesthetically pleasing.

Someone may wish to specialize and develop technical knowledge specific to one area or type of interior design, such as residential design, commercial design, hospitality design, healthcare design, universal design, exhibition design, furniture design, and spatial branding. 
Interior design is a creative profession that is relatively new, constantly evolving, and often confusing to the public. It is not an artistic pursuit and relies on research from many fields to provide a well-trained understanding of how people are influenced by their environments.

=== Color in interior design ===
Color is a powerful design tool in decoration, as well as in interior design which is the art of composing, and coordinating colors together to create a stylish scheme on the interior architecture of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interiordezine.com/color/|title=Color Wheel, Color Schemes, Color Therapy, Colors by Interiordezine |website=www.interiordezine.com| access-date = 2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential to interior designers to acquire a deep experience with colors, understand their psychological effects, and understand the meaning of each color in different locations and situations in order to create suitable combinations for each place.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designlike.com/the-psychology-of-color-for-interior-design/|title=The Psychology of Color for Interior Design – Interior Design, Design News and Architecture Trends|website=designlike.com|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining colors together could result in creating a state of mind as seen by the observer, and could eventually result in positive or negative effects on them. Colors make the room feel either more calm, cheerful, comfortable, stressful, or dramatic. Color combination make a tiny room seem larger or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hgtv.com/remodel/interior-remodel/the-psychology-of-color|title=The Psychology of Color|newspaper=HGTV| access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; So it is the Interior designer profession to choose appropriate colors for a place in a way people want to look and feel in the space.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Specialties==
[[Image:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|280px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] decoration [[fair]].]]

===Residential===
Residential design is the design of the interior of private residences. As this type design is very specific for individual situations, the needs and wants of the individual are paramount in this area of interior design. The interior designer may work on the project from the initial planning stage or may work on the remodelling of an existing structure. It is often a very involved process that takes months to fine-tune and create a space with the vision of the client.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Piotrowski, C, 2004, Becoming an Interior Designer, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New Jersey, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===
Commercial design encompasses a wide range of subspecialties.
* Retail: includes malls and shopping centers, department stores, specialty stores, visual merchandising, and showrooms.
* Visual and spatial branding: The use of space as a medium to express a corporate brand.
* Corporate: office design for any kind of business such as banks.
* Healthcare: the design of hospitals, assisted living facilities, medical offices, dentist offices, psychiatric facilities, laboratories, medical specialist facilities.
* Hospitality and recreation: includes hotels, motels, resorts, cruise ships, cafes, bars, casinos, nightclubs, theaters, music and concert halls, opera houses, sports venues, restaurants, gyms, health clubs and spas, etc.
* Institutional: government offices, financial institutions (banks and credit unions), schools and universities, religious facilities, etc.
* Industrial facilities: manufacturing and training facilities as well as import and export facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;
* Exhibition: includes museums, gallery, exhibition hall, specially the design for showroom and exhibition gallery.
* Traffic building: includes bus station, subway station, airports, pier, etc.
* Sports: includes gyms, stadiums, swimming rooms, basketball halls, etc.
* Teaching in a private institute that offer classes of interior design
* Self-employment
* Employment in private sector firms

===Other===
Other areas of specialization include amusement and theme park design, museum and exhibition design, [[exhibit design]], event design (including ceremonies, weddings, baby and bridal showers, parties, conventions, and concerts), interior and prop styling, craft styling, food styling, product styling, tablescape design, theatre and performance design, stage and set design, [[scenic design]], and [[production designer|production design]] for film and television. Beyond those, interior designers, particularly those with graduate education, can specialize in healthcare design, gerontological design, educational facility design, and other areas that require specialized knowledge. Some university programs offer graduate studies in theses and other areas. For example, both [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Florida]] offer interior design graduate programs in environment and behavior studies.

===Education===
{{main|Interior design education}}
There are various paths that one can take to become a professional interior designer. All of these paths involve some form of training. Working with a successful professional designer is an informal method of training and has previously been the most common method of education. In many states, however, this path alone cannot lead to licensing as a professional interior designer. Training through an institution such as a college, art or design school or university is a more formal route to professional practice.

In the UK and the U.S, several university degree courses are now available, including those on interior architecture, taking three or four years to complete.

A formal education program, particularly one accredited by or developed with a professional organization of interior designers, can provide training that meets a minimum standard of excellence and therefore gives a student an education of a high standard. There are also university graduate and Ph.d. programs available for those seeking further training in a specific design specialization (i.e. gerontological or healthcare design) or those wishing to teach interior design at the university level.

===Working conditions===
There are a wide range of working conditions and employment opportunities within interior design. Large and tiny corporations often hire interior designers as employees on regular working hours. Designers for smaller firms and [[online renovation platforms]] usually work on a contract or per-job basis. Self-employed designers, which make up 26% of interior designers,&lt;ref&gt;"Employment." Occupational Outlook Handbook: 2008-09 Edition, [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos293.htm#empty US Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; usually work the most hours. Interior designers often work under stress to meet deadlines, stay on budget, and meet clients' needs.

In some cases, licensed professionals review the work and sign it before submitting the design for approval by clients or construction permisioning. The need for licensed review and signature varies by locality, relevant legislation, and scope of work. Their work can involve significant travel to visit different locations. However, with technology development, the process of contacting clients and communicating design alternatives has become easier and requires less travel.&lt;ref name="IBIS World"&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial Design Industry Report |url=http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=1410&amp;chid=1 |publisher=ibisworld.com |date= July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They also renovate a space to satisfy the specific taste for a client.

==Styles==

===Art Deco===
[[File:Eastern Columbia Building entrance.jpg|thumb | upright | right | [[Terracotta]] [[Art Deco]] [[Sunburst|sunburst design]] above front doors of the [[Eastern Columbia Building]] in Los Angeles; built 1930.]]
The [[Art Deco]] style began in Europe in the early years of the 20th century, with the waning of [[Art Nouveau]]. The term "Art Deco" was taken from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, a world’s fair held in Paris in 1925.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Tinniswood, Adrian.

New York. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco rejected many traditional classical influences in favour of more streamlined geometric forms and metallic color. The Art Deco style influenced all areas of design, especially interior design, because it was the first style of interior decoration to spotlight new technologies and materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"&gt;Striner, Richard. "Art Deco: Polemics and Synthesis". WInterthur portfolio, Vol 25. No. 1 spring, 1990. PP. 26-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco style is mainly based on geometric shapes, streamlining, and clean lines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;Beusterien, John. Rodriguez, EduardoLuis. Narciso G. The Architectural Avant-Garde: From Art Deco to Modern Regionalism. The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, Vol. 22, Cuba Theme Issue (1996), PP. 254-277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Stanley, Meisler. ’Art Deco: High Style. Smithsonian’, Nov 2004, Vol. 35 Issue 8, PP 57-60&lt;/ref&gt; The style offered a sharp, cool look of mechanized living utterly at odds with anything that came before.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Bayer, Patricia, Art Deco Interiors: Decoration and Design Classics of the 1920s and 1930s, Thames &amp; Hudson, London 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco rejected traditional materials of decoration and interior design, opting instead to use more unusual materials such as [[chrome plating|chrome]], [[glass]], [[stainless steel]], shiny fabrics, [[mirror]]s, [[aluminium]], [[lacquer]], [[inlay|inlaid wood]], [[sharkskin]], and zebra skin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt; The use of harder, metallic materials was chosen to celebrate the machine age. These materials reflected the dawning modern age that was ushered in after the end of the [[First World War]]. The innovative combinations of these materials created contrasts that were very popular at the time - for example the mixing together of highly polished wood and black lacquer with satin and furs.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Jian. "Art Deco 1910-39". Craft Arts International, 2003, Issue 59, PP. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt; The barber shop in the Austin Reed store in London was designed by P. J. Westwood. It was soon regarded as the trendiest barber shop in Britain due to its use of metallic materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

The color themes of Art Deco consisted of metallic color, neutral color, bright color, and black and white. In interior design, cool metallic colors including silver, gold, metallic blue, charcoal grey, and platinum tended to predominate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tinniswood, Adrian. ‘The Art Deco House: Avant-Garde House of the 1920s and 1930s’. Watsonguptill publishing company. New York. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serge Chermayeff]], a Russian-born British designer made extensive use of cool metallic colors and luxurious surfaces in his room schemes. His 1930 showroom design for a British dressmaking firm had a silver-grey background and black mirrored-glass wall panels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Striner, Richard. ‘Art Deco: Polemics and Synthesis’. WInterthur portfolio, Vol 25. No. 1 ( spring, 1990). PP. 26-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black and white was also a very popular color scheme during the 1920s and 1930s. Black and white checkerboard tiles, floors and wallpapers were very trendy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Jian. ‘Art Deco 1910-39’. Craft Arts International, 2003, Issue 59, PP. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt; As the style developed, bright vibrant colors became popular as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, David. ‘Art Deco Renaissance’. Silvester-Carr, Denise. History Today, Jul, Vol. 49. Issue 7. PP.4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco furnishings and lighting fixtures had a glossy, luxurious appearance with the use of inlaid wood and reflective finishes. The furniture pieces often had curved edges, geometric shapes, and clean lines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Art Deco lighting fixtures tended to make use of stacked geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Alastair. "Art Deco Lighting". The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts. Vol. 1 (spring. 1986). PP. 20-31&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Art ===
"Modern design grew out of the decorative arts, mostly from the [[Art Deco]], in the early 20th century."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Modern Interior Design|url = http://homeguides.sfgate.com/modern-interior-design-8659.html#|website = Home Guides {{!}} SF Gate|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to introduce this style was [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who hadn't become hugely popularized until completing the house called [[Fallingwater]] in the 1930s. "Modern art reached its peak in the 1950s and 60s which is why designers and decorators today may refer to modern design as being "mid-century."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Modern Art does not refer to the era or age of design. "Modern art is not the same as contemporary design, which is a term that interior designers apply to a shifting group of recent styles and trends."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arab Materials===
“[[Majlis]] painting”, also called [[nagash painting]], is the decoration of the [[majlis]] or front parlor of traditional Arabic homes in the [[Asir]] province of [[Saudi Arabia]] and adjoining parts of [[Yemen]] These wall paintings, an [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] form of [[mural]] or [[fresco]], show various geometric designs in bright colors: “Called 'nagash' in Arabic, the wall paintings were a mark of pride for a woman in her house.”&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201304/the.majlis.painters.htm Yunis, Alia, "The Majlis Painters,"] Saudi Aramco World Magazine, July/August 2013, pages 24-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area’s textile and weaving patterns. “In contrast with the sobriety of architecture and decoration in the rest of Arabia, exuberant color and ornamentation characterize those of 'Asir. The painting extends into the house over the walls and doors, up the staircases, and onto the furniture itself. When a house is being painted, women from the community help each other finish the job. The building then displays their shared taste and knowledge. Mothers pass these on to their daughters. This artwork is based on a [[geometry]] of straight lines and suggests the patterns common to textile [[weaving]], with solid bands of different colors. Certain motifs reappear, such as the triangular [[mihrab]] or 'niche' and the [[palmette]]. In the past, paint was produced from mineral and vegetable [[pigment]]s. [[Clove]]s and [[alfalfa]] yielded green. Blue came from the [[indigo]] plant. Red came from [[pomegranate]]s and a certain mud. [[Paintbrush]]es were created from the tough hair found in a goat's tail. Today, however, women use modern manufactured paint to create new looks, which have become an indicator of social and economic change.”&lt;ref&gt;Maha Al Faisal and Khalid Azzam. 1999. "Doors of the Kingdom" Saudi Aramco World. This article appeared on pages 68-77 of the January/February 1999 print edition of Saudi Aramco World# http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/doors.of.the.kingdom.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the Asir province often complete the decoration and painting of the house interior. “You could tell a family’s wealth by the paintings,” [[Um Abdullah]] says: “If they didn’t have much money, the wife could only paint the [[motholath]],” the basic straight, simple lines, in patterns of three to six repetitions in red, green, yellow and brown.” When women did not want to paint the walls themselves, they could [[barter]] with other women who would do the work. Several Saudi women have become famous as majlis painters, such as [[Fatima Abou Gahas]].&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"/&gt;

The interior walls of the home are brightly painted by the women, who work in defined patterns with lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns. “Some of the large triangles represent mountains. Zigzag lines stand for water and also for lightning. Small triangles, especially when the widest area is at the top, are found in pre-Islamic representations of female figures. That the small triangles found in the wall paintings in ‘Asir are called banat may be a cultural remnant of a long-forgotten past.”&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"/&gt;

"[[Courtyard]]s and upper pillared [[porticoes]] are principal features of the best Nadjdi architecture, in addition to the fine incised plaster wood ([[jiss]]) and painted window shutters, which decorate the reception rooms. Good examples of plasterwork can often be seen in the gaping ruins of torn-down buildings- the effect is light, delicate and airy. It is usually around the [[majlis]], around the coffee hearth and along the walls above where guests sat on rugs, against cushions. Doughty wondered if this "[[parquet]]ting of jis", this "[[gypsum]] fretwork... all adorning and unenclosed" originated from [[India]]. However, the Najd fretwork seems very different from that seen in the Eastern Province and [[Oman]], which are linked to Indian traditions, and rather resembles the [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s and patterns found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. The rosette, the star, the triangle and the stepped pinnacle pattern of dadoes are all ancient patterns, and can be found all over the [[Middle East]] of antiquity. [[Al-Qassim Province]] seems to be the home of this art, and there it is normally worked in hard white [[plaster]] (though what you see is usually begrimed by the smoke of the coffee hearth). In [[Riyadh]], examples can be seen in unadorned [[clay]].&lt;ref&gt;Mostyn, Trevor. 1983. Saudi Arabia. London: Middle East Economic Digest. Pages 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media popularization==
{{main|Interior design magazine}}
Interior design has become the subject of [[television]] shows. In the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), popular interior design and decorating programs include ''[[60 Minute Makeover]]'' ([[ITV Network|ITV]]), ''[[Changing Rooms]]'' ([[BBC]]), and ''Selling Houses'' ([[Channel 4]]). Famous interior designers whose work is featured in these programs include [[Linda Barker]] and [[Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen]]. In the [[United States]], the [[TLC Network]] aired a popular program called ''[[Trading Spaces]]'', a show based on the UK program ''Changing Rooms''. In addition, both [[HGTV]] and the [[DIY Network]] also televise many programs about interior design and decorating, featuring the works of a variety of interior designers, decorators, and home improvement experts in a myriad of projects.

Fictional interior decorators include the Sugarbaker sisters on ''[[Designing Women]]'' and [[Grace Adler]] on ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. There is also another show called ''Home MADE''. There are two teams and two houses and whoever has the designed and made the worst room, according to the judges, is eliminated. Another show on the [[Style Network]], hosted by [[Niecy Nash]], is ''[[Clean House]]'' where they re-do messy homes into themed rooms that the clients would like. Other shows include ''[[Design on a Dime]]'', ''[[Designed to Sell]]'', and ''[[The Decorating Adventures of Ambrose Price]]''. The show called ''[[HGTV Design Star|Design Star]]'' has become more popular through the 5 seasons that have already aired. The winners of this show end up getting their own TV shows, of which are ''[[Color Splash]]'' hosted by [[David Bromstad]], ''Myles of Style'' hosted by [[Kim Myles]], ''Paint-Over!'' hosted by [[Jennifer Bertrand]], ''[[The Antonio Treatment]]'' hosted by Antonio Ballatore, and finally ''Secrets from a Stylist'' hosted by [[Emily Henderson]]. [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] also has a variety of shows that explore the lives of interior designers. These include ''[[Flipping Out]]'', which explores the life of [[Jeff Lewis (real estate speculator)|Jeff Lewis]] and his team of designers; ''[[Million Dollar Decorators]]'' explores the lives of interior designers [[Nathan Turner]], Jeffrey Alan Marks, Mary McDonald, Kathryn Ireland, and [[Martyn Lawrence Bullard]].

Interior design has also become the subject of [[radio]] shows. In the U.S., popular interior design &amp; lifestyle shows include ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' and ''Living Large'' featuring Karen Mills. Famous interior designers whose work is featured on these programs include Bunny Williams, [[Barbara Barry]], and [[Kathy Ireland]], among others.

Many interior design magazines exist to offer advice regarding color palette, furniture, art, and other elements that fall under the umbrella of interior design. These magazine often focus on related subjects to draw a more specific audience. For instance, architecture as a primary aspect of ''[[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]]'', while ''[[Veranda (magazine)|Veranda]]'' is well known as a luxury living magazine. ''[[Lonny (magazine)|Lonny Magazine]]'' and the newly relaunched, ''[[Domino (magazine)|Domino Magazine]]'', cater to a young, hip, metropolitan audience, and emphasize accessibility and a do-it-yourself ([[DIY]]) approach to interior design.

The '''International Society for Comparative Adult Education''' (or '''ISCAE''') is a network of individuals and organizations with members in more than thirty countries.

==Purpose==
[[Comparative education]] is a well-established field of study that examines [[education]] in one country (or group of countries) by using data and insights drawn from the practices and situation in another country or countries.  [[Adult education]] focuses on the unique needs and characteristics of students who are not [[children]] or [[adolescent]]s.  The focus of ISCAE then is the study of the education of adults as practiced in various countries; it also explores the methods, problems and pitfalls of international [[comparative research]] in general.

ISCAE serves as a network of contacts for professionals in the field of comparative adult education; such [[business network|networking]] encourages research assistance and [[cross-fertilization]], exchange of information, international cooperation, and similar activities.  There are no statutes and no membership fees. Most of the printing and distribution of newsletters and conference proceedings is done by members from the United States, Germany, or Australia.

==History==
ISCAE's origins can be traced back to 1960, when Dr. [[Alexander N. Charters]], professor of adult education at [[Syracuse University]], and Canadian scholar of adult education [[J. Roby Kidd]] formed a working group on international and comparative adult education at the first world conference of the World Council for Comparative Education in [[Ottawa]].  They named their group the Committee for Study and Research in Comparative Adult Education (CSRCAE).&lt;ref&gt;http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/a/AlexanderNCharters/ms_docs/charters44.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The growing International interest in comparative adult education led, in 1992, to a restructuring with a new board and a new president: Jost Reischmann, Chair of [[Andragogy]] at Bamberg University, Germany), and to a renaming into "International Society for Comparative Adult Education ISCAE". The upcoming new Internet-technology with an [http://www.ISCAE.org homepage] and a mailing list allowed much easier and faster communication and access for scholars from many countries around the globe. These new developments and the conferences increased the number of members from about 50 in 1992 to 250 in 2012. In 2009 Michal Bron Jr, Assoc. Professor Södertörn University, Sweden became new president.

==Publications and meetings==
ISCAE publishes a newsletter, ''ISCAE-Communication'',  irregularly (once or twice a year). Members meet at international [[Academic conference|conference]]s, held every three or four years in locations around the world: in Bamberg, Germany 1995, Radovljica, Slovenia 1998, St. Louis, Mo, USA 2002, Bamberg, Germany 2006, Las Vegas, USA 2012.  At the conferences, individuals present [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|paper]]s on completed (or nearly complete) research; others present research in progress or ideas for future research.  Studies must include two or more countries in the research in order to qualify as "comparative."
ISCAE published two volumes with papers from their conferences:

Over the last nineteen years, three independent educational centers have in fact been set up in the vicinity of the museum: first (in the 1980s) a German-Polish youth center, then a Catholic center, and most recently (in 2000) a [[Oświęcim Synagogue|Jewish center]] ... Collectively, the establishment of these centers means that Auschwitz is not only a site of mourning and meditation, a site of memory, but also a site of researching, learning, and encounter, interreligious or otherwise.

The '''International Youth Meeting Center in Oświęcim/Auschwitz''' is an educational institution whose campus lies between the center of the Polish city of [[Oświęcim]] and the former [[Auschwitz concentration camp|German concentration camp of Auschwitz]]. More than one million persons, mostly Jewish and Polish, were murdered at Auschwitz during the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–1945). Proposed in 1971, the Center was opened in 1986 following years of planning, negotiations, and fundraising.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt; It seeks to "develop the understanding of [[National Socialism]] and its consequences, particularly among young Germans, through dialogue and encounter between people of different origins", and is particularly engaged with Germans and Poles, Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name=ARSP /&gt; In 2010, the Center hosted more than 17,000 overnight stays by youth groups participating in its programs.&lt;ref name=ASF10 /&gt; Many young Germans and Austrians have held year-long voluntary positions at the Center that satisfy their [[civilian service]] (''Zivildienst'') responsibility. One of these, [[Robert Thalheim]], wrote and directed the German-language dramatic film ''[[And Along Come Tourists]]'' (2007) that features the Center and its activities.

The Polish and German names for the Center are '''''Międzynarodowy Dom Spotkań Młodzieży w Oświęcimiu''''' and '''''Internationale Jugendbegegnungsstätte in Oświęcim/Auschwitz''''', respectively; the two names are conjoined in the abbreviation MDSM/IJBS for the Center.

==History==
The idea for the construction of a youth meeting center in Poland came from [[:de:Volker von Törne|Volker von Törne]] (1934–1980), who saw an opportunity for creating it following the signing of the 1970 [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] between [[West Germany]] and Poland. von Törne was a poet and then business manager of the [[Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP)]], which is a private German organization (''Aktion Sühnezeichen Friedensdienst'') working towards reconciliation with countries and peoples harmed during German occupation in World War II. Following von Törne's death in 1980, [[:de:Christoph Heubner|Christoph Heubner]] led the project for ARSP.&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt;&lt;ref name=VW /&gt; In a 1986 interview, Heubner explained the importance of placing the Center near Auschwitz, which "symbolized the lowest point in German-Polish history, the lowest point in Jewish-German relations, one of the lowest points in man's inhumanity to man. The motivation to speak with one another is greater there. The greater emotion opens people up more for dialogue than would be the case in [[Masuria]] [an area in northeast Poland] or in some sunny mountain meadow."&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s the proposal was very controversial. The location of the buildings, the architecture of the project, the operations as well as the Polish partner for the ARSP were contentious issues. In 1978, [[Andreas Maislinger]] unsuccessfully approached President [[Rudolf Kirchschläger]] about Austrian support for the project.&lt;ref name=Maislinger /&gt;&lt;ref name=Buchholz /&gt;

The project received the support of many survivors of the concentration camps at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]], [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and Auschwitz, and by December 1985 a turning point was reached. Alfred Przybylski, former prisoner #471 at the Auschwitz camp and the representative of the Union of Polish Architects, supported by the plans drawn up by German architect Helmut Morlok, contributed decisively to the realization of the project.&lt;ref name=Morlok /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAB /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAB2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Toporowsky /&gt;

After obtaining contributions of 4.6 million Deutschmarks ($2.1 million), sufficient for 2/3 of the construction costs, ground was finally broken in May 1986. The handoff of the initial buildings to the foundation that operates it was celebrated on December 7, 1986, which was the sixteenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; The entire building project was completed in October, 1998. The Center is primarily supported by the Polish municipality of Oświęcim and by the ARSP,&lt;ref name=mdsm /&gt; which sponsors three such centers.&lt;ref name=ARSP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Morlok /&gt; In 2010, the Center hosted more than 17,000 overnight stays by youth groups participating in its programs.&lt;ref name=ASF10 /&gt;

The Center has become well known in German-speaking Europe following release of the dramatic film ''Am Ende kommen Touristen'' (2007) (''[[And Along Come Tourists]]''), which was partly filmed at the Center. The film was written and directed by [[Robert Thalheim]]. While the film's characters and story are fictional, in writing the screenplay Thalheim drew from his own experience as a German [[civilian service]] worker at the Center in 1996-97.&lt;ref name=Louk&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with 'And Along Come Tourists' Director Robert Thalheim |work=[[The Epoch Times]] |last=Louk |first=Lidia |date=September 14, 2007 |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/7-9-14/59762.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The Center is on one bank of the [[Soła|Soła river]], and consists of several pavilions laid out around a large garden. There is a forum, a multi-purpose room, a library, and four seminar rooms. There are about one hundred beds, as well as a campground and a sports field.

Katrin Buchholz has described the architecture as follows: "Modesty in construction and form, simplicity in the interior furnishings, ... the center of the campus is a meeting place that is open in all directions ... where all can move or loiter freely and unobserved, and in which one can find community but also security, as well as time and space to be alone."&lt;ref name=KBuchholz /&gt;

==Programming==
The Center sponsors activities of several types, including workshops to bring together groups of Polish and German students, seminars and development programs for adults and teachers, and exhibitions for general visitors. Groups using the Center typically stay for four or five days. In addition to visits to the remains of the concentration camps Auschwitz I, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Auschwitz III-Monowitz, groups can plan excursions in the area, especially to the city of [[Kraków]], and conversations can be arranged with experts on the major concerns of the Center.

The Center has been among the sites &lt;!--Einsatzstellen--&gt;for the work of young German and Austrian citizens doing [[civilian service]] (''Zivildienst'') sponsored by the ARSP, the German ''[[:de:Internationaler Bund|Internationaler Bund]]'', and by the [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service]].&lt;ref name=Ainetter /&gt;

'''Jon Sudbø''' (born May 3, 1961) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] dentist, physician, and former [[medical research]]er, who was exposed as a [[scientific fraud]]ster in 2006. Over a period of several years, he fabricated results in the field of [[oncology]] which he published in leading medical journals. The article that led to his downfall, which was published in ''[[The Lancet]]'', was based on 900 patients Sudbø had fabricated entirely. The editor of ''The Lancet'' described this as the biggest scientific fraud conducted by a single researcher ever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/Læger/Jon_Sudbø&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudbø graduated from the [[University of Oslo]] faculty of dentistry in 1989 and the faculty of medicine in 1994, both top of his class.

Sudbø was formerly employed as a consultant oncologist at the [[Radiumhospitalet|Radium Hospital]] in Oslo and as an associate professor at the [[University of Oslo]], but as a result of the fabrication scandal, he resigned from these positions in 2006. The same year, his licenses to practice medicine and dentistry were revoked. An inquiry by the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Oslo found that most of Sudbø's work, including his doctoral dissertation, were based on fraud, and the University of Oslo revoked his [[Doctor Medicinae (Danish and Norwegian degree)|doctorate in medicine]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 2007, he was granted a strictly limited license to work as an assistant dentist under supervision, and in 2009, he regained licenses to practice medicine and dentistry with some restrictions. He is currently working as an assistant dentist in [[Seljord]], [[Telemark]].

His wife [[Wanja Kildal]] was his co-author of 7 of the articles that were found to be fraudulent and subsequently retracted, while his brother [[Asle Sudbø]] was a co-author of two of these articles.

==Scandal==
In January 2006 it was revealed that his October 2005 fast track submission to ''[[The Lancet]]'' was based upon fraudulent patient data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Fraud charges against Norwegian researcher stoke confusion over painkillers |quote=Fraud accusations against a Norwegian researcher have muddied the question of whether popular over-the-counter pain relievers fight cancer or harm the heart.

The leader of the [[epidemiology]] division at [[Norwegian Institute of Public Health]], [[Camilla Stoltenberg]], found the article suspicious at the end of 2005 because the data was supposedly from a cancer patient database which had not yet opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vitalitymagazine.com/article/medical-research-fraud/|title=Medical Research Fraud|last=Ferrie|first=Helke|date=April 2006|publisher=Vitality Magazine|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'' reported that of the 908 subjects in the Lancet study 250 had the same birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudbø has later acknowledged that he has used fictional data in at least two more
papers, published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Clinical Oncology]]''.

An independent Commission of Inquiry led by [[Sweden|Swedish]] Professor Anders Ekbom, that also included a member from the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Cancer Institute]], was set up by [[Rikshospitalet]] and the [[University of Oslo]] to discern the details of the fraud. They were also to try to identify the role of the [[Collaborative writing|co-authors]], which included, among others, Jon Sudbø's brother and wife.

In May 2006, Norwegian and Swedish media reported that the committee was investigating some 60 scientists from 6 countries, and a total of 38 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The commission reported on 30 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rikshospitalet.no/view/readavdi.asp?nPubID%3D6628%26department%3DEnglish |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823045626/http://www.rikshospitalet.no/view/readavdi.asp?nPubID=6628&amp;department=English |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission deemed much of Sudbø's work invalid because of manipulation and fabrication of raw data: of the 38 articles he had published since 1993, 15 were condemned as fraudulent, including his doctoral [[dissertation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the dissertation and the other fraudulent articles will be [[Rescission (contract law)|rescinded]]. The commission also criticised the co-authors of Sudbø's papers. Professor Anders Ekbom, the Chair of the Commission, said: "One explanation of this catastrophe was that Sudbø was a lone wolf. Few or anyone had insight into his work". The commission found no evidence that any of his co-authors had taken part in the fraud or otherwise been party to the deceit, although Sudbø's supervisor accepted criticism for lack of vigilance and follow-up.

In November 2006 his authorizations as a physician and a dentist were revoked by the [[Norwegian Board of Health Supervision]], but in 2007 he was granted a strictly limited authorization to work as an assistant dentist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/innenriks/Jon-Sudboe-kan-bli-tannlege-1846261.html#.TxGfgc2DGLg |title=Jon Sudbø kan bli tannlege |publisher=Bergens Tidende |language=Norwegian |work=bt.no |date=2 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he was granted restricted authorizations to practice as dentist and as a physician, however he cannot involve himself in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studenttorget.no/index.php?show=3378&amp;expand=3795,3378&amp;artikkelid=9464 |title=Exam cheaters who got away |work=Studenttorget.no |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=10 November 2013 |author=Meland, Ragnhild |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016031213/http://studenttorget.no/index.php?show=3378&amp;expand=3795%2C3378&amp;artikkelid=9464 |archivedate=16 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of fraud==
Rikshospitalet and the University were both criticized for "a lack of preliminary control and organization with a view to the researcher's [Sudbø's] PhD project". The hospital was also criticized for "a lack of training and consciousness-raising in respect of the researcher and other employees with a view to the rules for handling patient material, preliminary assessments of research projects and authorship" and for "a lack of leadership and routines designed to expose and deal with non-conformance with its rules of procedure".

The fraud may also have had international effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission could not rule out that Sudbø's false conclusions could have affected cancer patients around the world, because his findings were used by other scientists and incorporated into cancer treatments, although Sudbø's solicitor Erling O. Lyngtveit had said on behalf of his client that none of the fraudulent articles had had any consequences for patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://depesjer.no/saker/sudb%C3%B8-case-co-author-responsibilities-disregarded/{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway's scientific reputation could also be damaged by the affair, and "massive lawsuits" may be imminent from the national and international organisations that funded Sudbø's fraudulent papers.

According to the Norwegian [[news site|news website]] ''[[Depesjer]]'' ("Dispatches"), scientific experts they consulted felt that Sudbø's [[Collaborative writing|co-authors]] were "severely exploited", but also that closer observations of the [[Vancouver guidelines]] and other rules by co-authors would "hamper future attempts at publishing fabricated material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depesjer.no/nyheter/aktualitet/medisin/sudboe_case_co_author_responsibilities_disregarded/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927172028/http://depesjer.no/nyheter/aktualitet/medisin/sudboe_case_co_author_responsibilities_disregarded/ |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Atle Klovning, a leading European authority on [[evidence-based medicine]], said in the article that Sudbø's co-authors had probably not lived up to their responsibilities according to the Vancouver rules.

'''Dame Kathleen Mary Ollerenshaw''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DBE}} ([[né]]e '''Timpson'''; 1 October 1912 – 10 August 2014) was a British mathematician and politician who was [[List of mayors of Manchester|Lord Mayor of Manchester]] from 1975 to 1976 and an advisor on educational matters to [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government in the 1980s.

==Early life and education==
Born Kathleen Mary Timpson in [[Withington]], Manchester, where she attended [[Lady Barn House School]] (1918–1926).{{cn|date=April 2018}} She was a grandchild of the founder of the [[Timpson (retailer)|Timpson]] shoe repair business, who had moved to Manchester from [[Kettering]] and established the business there by 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Manchester Memoirs |first=Kahtleeen |last=Ollerenshaw |publisher=E. J. Morton |year=1982 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf since the age of eight, her fascination with mathematics was inspired by her Lady Barn headmistress, Miss Jenkin Jones. It was during her time at Lady Barn that she met her future husband, Robert Ollerenshaw. Today, Lady Barn House School recognises her as a 'Lady Barn legend' and she features heavily in a major historical display in the school Dining Room.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

As a young woman, she attended [[St Leonards School]] and Sixth Form College in St Andrews, Scotland where today the house of young male boarders is named after her. At the age of 19 she gained admittance to [[Somerville College, Oxford]], to study [[mathematics]]. She completed her doctorate at Somerville in 1945 on "Critical Lattices" under the supervision of [[Theodore William Chaundy|Theo Chaundy]]. She wrote five original research papers which were sufficient for her to earn her [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] degree without the need of a formal written thesis.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

While an undergraduate, she became engaged to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] Robert Ollerenshaw, who became a distinguished military surgeon, a pioneer of [[medical illustration]]. They married in September 1939 and had two children, Charles (1941–1999) and Florence (1946–1972). In 1942 she suffered a miscarriage and "cried nonstop for three days" as a result of stress when her husband was suddenly mobilised and deployed for [[World War II|war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Centenarian Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw – Conqueror of Magic Squares, Rubik's Cube and Mauna Kea|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dame-kathleen-ollerenshaw/|work=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]]|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After the Second World War, the Ollerenshaws moved to Manchester, where Kathleen worked as a part-time lecturer in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|mathematics department at Manchester University]] while raising her children and continued her work on lattices. In 1949, at the age of 37, she received her first effective hearing aid.

Outside of academics, Ollerenshaw served as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Councillor]] for [[Rusholme]] for twenty-six years (1956–1981), Lord Mayor of Manchester (1975–1976), [[High Sheriff of Greater Manchester]] from 1978 to 1979, and the prime motivator in the creation of the [[Royal Northern College of Music]]. She was made a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman of the City]] of Manchester and was an advisor on educational matters to [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government in the 1980s.

She was President of the [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]] from 1978 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ima.org.uk/about_us/institute_history/ima_presidents.cfm.html | title=IMA Presidents | publisher=[[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]] |year=2014 | accessdate=4 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She published at least 26 mathematical papers, her best-known contribution being to [[Magic square|most-perfect pandiagonal magic squares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ima.org.uk/publications/|title=Category : Publications|website=ima.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her death, she left a legacy in trust to support distinguished research visitors and public engagement activities at the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester]]. An annual public lecture at the University is named in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mims.manchester.ac.uk/events/ollerenshaw-lectures/|title=Ollerenshaw lectures - The University of Manchester - School of Mathematics|website=www.mims.manchester.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An amateur astronomer, Ollerenshaw donated her telescope to [[Lancaster University]], and an [[observatory]] there bears her name. She was an honorary member of the Manchester Astronomical Society and held the post of Vice-President for a number of years.

Ollerenshaw attended [[St Leonards School]] in [[St Andrews]], Fife, and served as the school's president from 1981 to 2003. She was succeeded by [[Hazel Byford, Baroness Byford|Baroness Byford]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] spokeswoman in the [[House of Lords]]. She [[centenarian|turned 100]] in October 2012.&lt;ref name="Centenary"&gt;{{cite web|title = The 2012 Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Lecture|work = News|publisher = [[University of Manchester]]|date = 3 October 2012|url = http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=8777|accessdate = 3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in [[Didsbury]] on 10 August 2014, at the age of 101.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/dame-kathleen-ollerenshaw-former-lord-7597607 | author=Emma Flanagan | date=12 August 2014 | accessdate=12 August 2014 | publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]] | title=Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw former Lord Mayor of Manchester dies aged 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband and both their children had predeceased her.

[[File:Barbara Hutton May 1931.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barbara Hutton]]]]

'''''Lady Hutton''''' is a former [[luxury yacht]] built in 1924 at [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] in [[Kiel]], Germany.  She has now been converted to a hotel and restaurant ship, riding at anchor at the [[Riddarholmen]] in [[Stockholm]] since 1982.&lt;ref name="vanadis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/vanadis_1924.htm|title=M/S VANADIS (1924)|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to its size and proximity to the old city, much of her fame is tied to Barbara Hutton, for whom the ship is named.

== Background ==
With a 240-foot (73{{nbsp}}m) steel-and-nickel hull, this 1924 [[yacht#Motor yachts|motor yacht]] was "the largest of its day."&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

It was originally named ''Vanadis'', was ordered by [[C. K. G. Billings]].&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; The diesel-driven vessel was his second yacht by that name..&lt;ref name="vanadis"/&gt;

In 1926 she was owned by [[Harrison Williams (entrepreneur)|Harrison Williams]], who took his new bride on a year-long around-the-world honeymoon cruise on  the ''Warrior''.

[[Barbara Hutton]], [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] heiress, reputedly received the vessel in 1930 as a present from her father on her 18th birthday.{{efn-ua|"In 1939 [sic], on the Woolworth heiress's 18th birthday, Barbara Hutton's father gave her a little present: a 240-foot yacht named ''Vanadis''. 3 years later Daddy gave her another trinket: a check for $1 million. The million dollars is long gone, but the ''Vanadis'' still exists."&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;  There is an evident discrepancy between the date of her birth, her age, and the "1939" claim that is reported in [[The Milwaukee Journal]].  She was born in November 14, 1912.  She was awarded it as part of her share in a 1935 divorce.  Applying [[Occam's razor]], it is reasonable to deduce that she received it on her 18th birthday in November of 1930, and that the "9" was a typographical error.&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19881123&amp;id=HWsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0SsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2659,7335508 |newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=November 23, 1988 |title=All Aboard: Luxury Yacht Rocks Gently at Stockholm Harbor |first1=Margo |last1=Hammond |format=PDF |pages=33, 35 |accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The yacht was twice [[eponym]]ously named in Hutton's honor, and she is ''Vanadis'''s most celebrated owner.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brook Hill |last1=Snow |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-03-15/features/8701160473_1_stockholm-lady-hutton-prices-increase |location=Stockholm, Sweden |date=March 15, 1987|title=Off The Beaten Path The Lady Hutton, One Of The World's Largest Luxury Yachts, Is Now An Elegant Hotel In Downtown Stockholm |newspaper=[[Sun Sentinel]] |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanadis to Lady Hutton, Kajsa Karlsson, (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|This yacht should not be confused with the ''[[Sea Cloud]]'' {{ndash}}a [[barque]] owned by another 'Lady Hutton' {{ndash}} which was built in 1931 and "at that time [was] the biggest yacht" and named ''Hussar''.  That sailing yacht was owned by [[Marjorie Merriweather Post|Lady Marjorie Hutton]], whose husband, financier [[Edward Francis Hutton]] purchased it.  In contrast, Barbara Hutton acquired the ''Lady Hutton'' in 1930, and was awarded it in her 1935 divorce, at which time it was renamed.  See also ''[[RV Vema]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sea Cloud - IMO 8843446  Sea Cloud, bt. 1931, gt. 2531 |url=http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=689469   |accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Though Hutton is popularized as though she is the current owner (by the ship's operators), she "only kept it" for one year.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

In 1940 the yacht was sold to the British [[Royal Navy]]. After the [[Second World War]], it was stationed in [[Panama]] and also used as a schoolship in [[Norway]] from 1948. At the start of the 1950s it was renamed ''Cort Adeles'' at Stadsgårdskajen, Sweden. The vessel was also used as a regular passenger ship to and from [[Åbo]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="vanadis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/vanadis_1924.htm|title=M/S VANADIS (1924)|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The yacht was later slated for scrap, but was purchased by a group of Swedish businessmen who spent more than $2.5 million to renovate her.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;

== Current use ==
[[File:Mälardrottningen 2006a.jpg|thumb|The hotel in winter as located near visible [[Stockholm City Hall]].]]
Begun in 1980, the renovation and rebuilding as a hotel for business travelers and a restaurant ship was completed in 1982. Most of the rooms or cabins are comparatively small. The vessel includes meeting facilities for up to 20 people and a [[Finnish sauna]].&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; The yacht is registered as the ''Lady Hutton'', and this name appears on the [[stern]], but the name on the [[prow]] is ''Mälardrottningen'' (the Queen of [[Mälaren|Lake Mälar]]).&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; And Barbara Hutton's name is used once again, as the ship is renamed ''Lady Hutton''.&lt;ref name="mälardrottningen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniquehotels.se/malardrottningen-hotel.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141017145019/http://www.uniquehotels.se/malardrottningen-hotel.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 October 2014 |title=Hotell Mälardrottningen – Riddarholmen i Gamla stan – Unique Hotels |publisher=Uniquehotel.se |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 1982, the yacht has been docked at Riddarholmen in Stockholm. It is owned by the family company Mälardrottningen Holding AB;&lt;ref name="mälardrottningen"/&gt; "Mälardrottningen" has been a nickname for the city of Stockholm since the end of the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Nordensvan Georg Mälardrottningen: En skildring i ord och bild af Sveriges hufvudstad och dess omgifningar (1895)&lt;/ref&gt;

The lounge is glass-floored, so that the guests can view the [[engine room]] below.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;  The Captain's Lounge has the best view, overlooking city hall. The 59 eccentric rooms are generally described as "tiny."  On the other hand, one writer notes that parents traveling with their children will probably opt for separate rooms for their offspring.  And sleeping in a floating palace is proferred as a unique way to calm them down.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

The hotel has conference rooms which will hold up to 20 guests.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;  Meals are said to be relatively expensive at the gourmet restaurant.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;

A positive attraction is its central location.  It combines easy access with ample parking, and is just a brief jaunt to the [[Gamla stan]], the Old Town city core. It is near [[Stockholm Palace]] and [[Stockholm City Hall|City Hall]] where the [[Nobel Prize#Award ceremonies|Nobel Prize]] [[Nobel Banquet|award dinners]] are fêted.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;

==Earlier names==
Before the yacht had its current name, it was changed no less than ten times:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/ship.php?ship_id=63718&amp;name=Vanadis|title=Plimsoll ship data – the Lloyds Register searchable database|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miramarshipindex.org.nz/ship/show?nameid=73101&amp;shipid=161091|title=Miramar Ship Index|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2014}}{{subscription}}{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luther Parmalee Christman''' (February 26, 1915{{spaced ndash}}June 7, 2011) was an American nurse, professor of nursing, university administrator and advocate for gender and racial diversity in nursing. His career included service with the Michigan Department of Mental Health and academic posts at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Vanderbilt University]] and [[Rush University]]. In 1967, Christman became the first man to hold the position of dean at a nursing school.

While serving as vice president for nursing affairs at [[Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center]], Christman implemented the Rush Model of Nursing, an influential model for delivering hospital nursing services. He was involved in the founding of the National Male Nurse Association, which later became the [[American Assembly for Men in Nursing]]. After his 1987 retirement, Christman received several awards and honors for his contributions to nursing. He died in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 2011.

==Biography==

===Education===
Christman earned a diploma from the Pennsylvania Hospital School of Nursing for Men in 1939. He received an undergraduate degree from [[Temple University]] in 1948, then an Ed.M. degree in clinical psychology from the Philadelphia Psychoanalytic Institute. He completed a Ph.D. from [[Michigan State University]], where he studied anthropology and sociology.&lt;ref name=Pioneer&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Luther Christman, Nursing Pioneer, Passes Away at 96|url=http://nursing.umich.edu/about-our-school/news-portal/201106/1704#.UUqWkr4o7IU|publisher=University of Michigan School of Nursing|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christman overcame gender discrimination during his own education; he was refused admission to two university nursing programs because he was male. While a nursing student, he was denied a maternity clinical rotation for the same reason.&lt;ref name=Jordan/&gt;

===Career===
Christman said that he faced hostility from female coworkers early in his career, and that night shift positions in psychiatric nursing and urology were virtually the only openings for men.&lt;ref name=Markoutsas&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoutsas|first=Elaine|title=Medicine: Sex Roles Are Changing Slowly... But Changing|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9NJaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3lgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3458,1712243&amp;dq=luther+christman&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 23, 2013|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=January 9, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christman was denied admission to the U.S. Army Nurse Corps on the basis of his gender;&lt;ref name=Jordan/&gt; instead, he served in the U.S. Maritime Service as a pharmacist's mate during [[World War II]]. After returning from the war, Christman worked as a private duty nurse and assistant head nurse at [[Pennsylvania Hospital]]. After completing his Ed.M., he became director of nursing at Yankton State Hospital in South Dakota.&lt;ref name=MNA/&gt;

In 1956, Christman went to work for the Michigan Department of Mental Health. In that position, he coordinated nursing school training at hospitals in the state. Christman was named associate professor of psychiatric nursing at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=Pioneer/&gt; In 1967, he assumed a dual role as nursing school dean at [[Vanderbilt University]] and director of nursing at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]]. In 1972, he took on similar responsibilities at [[Rush University]] and [[Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center]]. While Christman was at Rush, the school and hospital implemented the Rush Model of Nursing. The model highlighted the importance of clinical expertise among faculty members, which was similar to the established practice in medicine. His faculty practice model required that nursing professors spend most of their time in clinical practice. He retired in 1987.&lt;ref name=RNL&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Jane|title=Luther Christman: Legacy of a Legend|journal=Reflections on Nursing Leadership|date=June 23, 2011|volume=37|issue=2|url=http://www.reflectionsonnursingleadership.org/Pages/Vol37_2_NoteFeat_Christman.aspx|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career, Christman advocated for the advancement of nursing education. In the late 1960s, Christman predicted increased specialization in the next generation of nurses; he advocated for nurses to be freed of non-clinical tasks so that they could keep up with the nursing demands in an increasingly technological environment.&lt;ref name=Breed&gt;{{cite news|title=New Breed of Nurses Seen|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NHFYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-vcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7342,973175&amp;dq=luther+christman&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 21, 2013|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|date=April 2, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1978 presentation in Australia, he argued against systems which utilized a combination of registered nurses, nurse aides and student nurses; he highlighted statistics which showed that nurse aides were unoccupied up to 25 percent of the typical work day.&lt;ref name=McIlraith&gt;{{cite news|last=McIlraith|first=Shaun|title=US Trend to Graduate-Only Nurses|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X_tjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=feYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4071,7077445&amp;dq=luther+christman&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 21, 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=March 21, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christman served multiple terms as president of the Michigan Nurses Association and he proposed the idea that led to the founding of the [[American Academy of Nursing]].&lt;ref name=MNA&gt;{{cite book|title=Proud of Our Past, Preparing for Our Future:A History of the Michigan Nurses Association, 1904-2004|year=2004|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Even after his retirement, Christman remained an active participant in nursing affairs for many years. He died of pneumonia on June 7, 2011 in Nashville. He was predeceased by his wife, Dorothy Black, in 2003. They had married in 1939 and had three children.&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Zoe|title=Remembering a Nursing Icon: Luther Christman (1915–2011)|journal=PACEsetterS|date=July–September 2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=15–16|url=http://journals.lww.com/jbipacesetters/Fulltext/2011/07000/Remembering_a_Nursing_Icon__Luther_Christman.4.aspx|accessdate=March 21, 2013|doi=10.1097/01.jbi.0000405537.66667.b4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Pollan''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ə|n}} is an American author, journalist, activist, and the Lewis K. Chan Arts Lecturer and Professor of Practice of Non-Fiction at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Michael Pollan: Lewis K. Chan Arts Lecturer and Professor of the Practice of Non-Fiction |url=https://english.fas.harvard.edu/faculty/pollan/ |website=Harvard University Department of English |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollan is also professor of [[journalism]] at the [[UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Graduate School of Journalism |title=Faculty: Michael Pollan |url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/pollan |publisher=UC Berkeley |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Pollan was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family on [[Long Island]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/50-most-influential-Jews-Places-31-40 |title=50 most influential Jews: Places 31-40 |date=May 25, 2012 |quote=Michael Pollan, 57 |author=STEVE LINDE|author2=A.

==Career==
===''The Botany of Desire''===
In ''[[The Botany of Desire]]'', Pollan explores the concept of [[co-evolution]], specifically of humankind's evolutionary relationship with four plants — [[apple]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and [[potato]]es — from the dual perspectives of humans and the plants. He uses case examples that fit the [[archetype]] of four basic human desires, demonstrating how each of these [[botany|botanical]] species are selectively grown, bred, and [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]]. The apple reflects the desire for sweetness, the tulip beauty, the marijuana intoxication, and the potato control. Pollan then unravels the narrative of his own experience with each of the plants, which he intertwines with a well-researched exploration into their social history. Each section presents a unique element of human domestication, or the "human bumblebee" as Pollan calls it. These range from the true story of [[Johnny Appleseed]] to Pollan's first-hand research with sophisticated marijuana [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] in [[Amsterdam]], to the alarming and [[paradigm]]-shifting possibilities of genetically engineered potatoes.

===''The Omnivore's Dilemma''===
In ''[[The Omnivore's Dilemma]]'', Pollan describes four basic ways that human societies have obtained food: the current industrial system, the big organic operation, the local self-sufficient farm, and the [[hunter-gatherer]]. Pollan follows each of these processes—from a group of plants [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] calories through a series of intermediate stages, ultimately into a meal. Along the way, he suggests that there is a fundamental tension between the logic of nature and the logic of human industry, that the way we eat represents our most profound engagement with the natural world, and that industrial eating obscures crucially important ecological relationships and connections. On December 10, 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' named ''The Omnivore's Dilemma'' one of the five best nonfiction books of the year. On May 8, 2007, the [[James Beard Foundation]] named ''The Omnivore's Dilemma'' its 2007 winner for the best food writing. It was the book of focus for the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Reading Project in 2007, and the book of choice for [[Washington State University]]'s Common Reading Program in 2009–10.

[[File:Michael Pollan.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Pollan speaks to the [[Marin Academy]] community.]]

Pollan's discussion of the industrial food chain is in large part a critique of modern [[agribusiness]]. According to the book, agribusiness has lost touch with the natural cycles of farming, wherein livestock and crops intertwine in mutually beneficial circles. Pollan's critique of modern agribusiness focuses on what he describes as the overuse of corn for purposes ranging from fattening [[cattle]] to massive production of [[corn oil]], [[high-fructose corn syrup]], and other corn derivatives. He describes what he sees as the inefficiencies and other drawbacks of [[factory farming]] and gives his assessment of [[organic food]] production and what it's like to hunt and gather food. He blames those who set the rules (e.g., politicians in Washington, D.C., bureaucrats at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[Wall Street]] capitalists, and agricultural [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] like [[Archer Daniels Midland]]) of what he calls a destructive and precarious agricultural system that has wrought havoc upon the diet, nutrition, and well-being of Americans. Pollan finds hope in [[Joel Salatin]]'s [[Polyface Farm]] in Virginia, which he sees as a model of [[sustainability]] in commercial farming. Pollan appears in the [[documentary film]] ''[[King Corn (film)|King Corn]]'' (2007).

===''In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto''===
[[File:Michael Pollan at TED.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pollan speaking at [[TED (conference)|TED]] in 2007]]
Pollan's book ''[[In Defense of Food]]: An Eater's Manifesto'', released on January 1, 2008, explores the relationship with what he terms ''[[nutritionism]]'' and the Western diet, with a focus on late 20th century food advice given by the science community. Pollan holds that consumption of fat and dietary cholesterol does not lead to a higher rate of coronary disease, and that the reductive analysis of food into nutrient components is a mistake. He questions the view that the point of eating is to promote health, pointing out that this attitude is not universal and that cultures that perceive food as having purposes of pleasure, identity, and sociality may end up with better health. He explains this seeming paradox by vetting, and then validating, the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western framework through which we intellectualize the value of food is more a religious and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research. Pollan spends the rest of his book explicating his first three phrases: "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have recognized as food.


===''Food Rules: An Eater's Manual''===
In 2009, ''[[Food Rules: An Eater's Manual]]'' was published. This short work is a condensed version of his previous efforts, intended to provide a simple framework for a healthy and sustainable diet. It is divided into three sections, further explicating Pollan's principles of "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." It includes his rules (''i.e.,'' "let others sample your food" and "the whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead").

===''Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation''===
In ''[[Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation]]'', published in 2013, Pollan explores the methods by which cooks mediate "between nature and culture." The book is organized into four sections corresponding to the [[classical element]]s of Fire (cooking with heat), Water (braising and boiling with pots), Air (breadmaking), and Earth (fermenting), and features [[Samin Nosrat]], who later became known for the bestselling cookbook ''Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat,'' as "the chef who taught Michael Pollan how to cook."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2017/04/samin-nosrat-salt-fat-acid-heat-soup-chez-panisse/|title=This simple advice completely changed the way I eat|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''How to Change Your Mind''===
In 2018, Pollan wrote ''[[How to Change Your Mind]],'' a book about the history and future of mind-altering substances. He argues that [[psilocybin]] and [[LSD]] are not drugs that make people crazy, which he calls the biggest misconception people have about psychedelics,&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |last= OAKLANDER |first=Mandy |date=May 16, 2018 |title=This Will Change Your Mind About Psychedelic Drugs |url=http://time.com/5278036/michael-pollan-psychedelic-drugs/ |work=Time |access-date=May 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather drugs that can help a person become "more sane," for example by eliminating a fear of death. While promoting his book on national TV, he explained that along with LSD and psilocybin, his research included ingesting [[ayahuasca]] and [[5-MeO-DMT]], and that he experienced a [[Ego death#Psychedelics|dissolution of ego]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBOcWgMD49o Michael Pollan On The Healing Power Of Psychedelics] (Time, posted to YouTube on May 18, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzgtJleG3r8&amp;t=2m22s Michael Pollan Tried A Series Of Psychedelic Drugs... For Research!] (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, posted to YouTube on May 15, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Pollan is a contributing writer for the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' and a former executive editor for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''. His first book, ''[[Second Nature (book)|Second Nature: A Gardener's Education]]'', was published in 1991. 

Pollan has contributed to ''Greater Good'', a social psychology magazine published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His article "Edible Ethics" discusses the intersection of ethical eating and [[social psychology]].

In his 1998 book ''[[A Place of My Own]]: The Education of an Amateur Builder'', Pollan methodically traced the design and construction of the out-building where he writes. The 2008 re-release of this book was re-titled ''A Place of My Own: The Architecture of Daydreams.''

In 2014, Pollan wrote the foreword in the healthy eating cookbook ''The Pollan Family Table''. The book is co-authored by his mother, Corky Pollan, and sisters, Lori Pollan, Dana Pollan, and [[Tracy Pollan]].

Pollan also co-starred in the documentary, ''[[Food, Inc.]]'' (2008), for which he was also a consultant. In 2010 Pollan was interviewed for the film ''[[Queen of the Sun|Queen of the Sun: What are the bees telling us?]]'', a feature-length documentary about [[honey bees]] and [[colony collapse disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenofthesun.com/2010/11/michael-pollan-author-omnivores-dilemma/ Michael Pollan]. ''Queen of the Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also interviewed for ''[[Vanishing of the Bees]]'', a documentary also about colony collapse, directed by [[Maryam Henein]] and George Langworthy. In 2015, a documentary version of Pollan's book ''In Defense of Food'' premiered on PBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Watch Full Episodes Online of In Defense of Food on PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/show/in-defense-of-food/|website = PBS|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Netflix released a four-part documentary series, which was based on Pollan's book, ''Cooked'' (2013), and was directed by [[Alex Gibney]].

In the [[American Enterprise Institute]]'s magazine, Blake Hurst argues that Pollan offers a shallow assessment of factory farming that does not take cost into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Blake |last=Hurst |title=The Omnivore’s Delusion: Against the Agri-intellectuals |url=https://www.aei.org/publication/the-omnivores-delusion-against-the-agri-intellectuals/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Engber criticized Pollan in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' for arguing that food is too complex a subject to study scientifically and blaming [[reductionism]] for today's health ills, while using nutritional research to justify his own diet advice. Engber likened Pollan's "anti-scientific method" to the rhetoric used by health gurus who peddle diet scams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Engber |title=Survival of the Yummiest: Should we buy Michael Pollan's nutritional Darwinism? |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2158736|work=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollan's work has also been discussed and criticized by [[Jonathan Safran Foer]] in his non-fiction book ''[[Eating Animals]]''.
Foer criticizes Pollan's argument regarding table-fellowship. According to Foer, Pollan claims that a vegetarian dinner guest causes socially reprimandable inconvenience for the host. Foer responds that in the year 2010 it is easier for hosts to accommodate vegetarians than locavores as hosts will need to do extensive research to find (expensive) non factory-farmed meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jonathan Safran Foer Takes on Michael Pollan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH-ZtLfoqaY |accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollan has been accused by [[Jon Entine]], who supports GMOs (genetically modified organisms), of using his influence to promote "anti-GMO junk science". A number of scientists and journalists have similarly characterized Pollan's work as biased against GMOs. For example, after Pollan posted a tweet that was critical of a ''[[New York Times]]'' article on GMOs, U.C. Berkeley biologist Michael Eisen posted a tweet calling Pollan's comment "a new low even in Pollan's 'anti-GMO crusade'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pointed talk: Michael Pollan and Amy Harmon dissect a GM controversy|url = http://grist.org/food/pointed-talk-michael-pollan-and-amy-harmon-dissect-a-gm-controversy/|website = Grist|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=je&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2013/10/24/michael-pollan-promotes-denialist-anti-gmo-junk-science-brags-he-manipulates-new-york-times-editors/2/ Michael Pollan Promotes 'Denialist' Anti-GMO Junk Science, Says He Manipulates New York Times' Editors], Jon Entine. Forbes, October 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Pollan's statement that GMOs have been one "tremendous disappointment," food writer James Cooper criticized Pollan's tendency to cite poor or selected scientific sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Food-Myths-Debunked-food-safe/dp/1502386003|title=Food Myths Debunked: Why our food is safe|last=Cooper|first=James W.|date=2014-09-27|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781502386007|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Pollan co-hosted a discussion and informal debate on the topic of genetic modification at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] featuring prominent plant geneticist [[Pamela Ronald]], professor at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], whose research-based position "strongly disagrees with Pollan’s view that G.M.O. crops, broadly, are failing."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-journalist-and-a-scientist-break-ground-in-the-g-m-o-debate|title=A Journalist and a Scientist Break Ground in the G.M.O. Debate|date=2014-04-25|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''New Yorker'' reporter observed that Pollan's largely anti-GMO student base at the discussion itself constituted, "a kind of monoculture," yet that Pollan sought "to introduce an invasive species" by engaging Ronald. The event, while predictably contentious, reportedly produced a rare instance of courteous, productive exchange between the two main sharply-opposed viewpoints on genetically-modified crops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Ministry of Education of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics''' ('''USSR''') ({{lang-ru|Министерство просвещения СССР}}), formed on 3 August 1966, was one of the most important government offices in the [[Soviet Union]]. It was known as the '''[[People's Commissariat for Education]]''' ({{lang-ru|Народный комиссариат просвещения}}), or '''Narkompros''', until 1946. Narkompros was a Soviet agency founded by the State Commission on Education ({{lang-ru|Государственная комиссия по просвещению}}) and charged with the administration of public education and most of other issues related to culture.

Its first head was [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]]. However he described [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] as the "soul of Narkompros".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aHkkdjbc00UC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=Vestnik+teatra&amp;source=web&amp;ots=yB8am4YNP9&amp;sig=5_dy_omF9FoGqYWSlM5Ayj8P1Ak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1 The Commissariat of Enlightenment]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] and [[Evgraf Litkens]] also played important roles.

Lunacharsky protected most of the avant-garde artists such as [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]. Despite his efforts, the official policy after [[Joseph Stalin]] put him in disgrace.

Narkompros had a number of sections, in addition to the main ones related to general education, e.g.,
* [[Likbez]], a section for liquidation of illiteracy,
* "Profobr", a section for professional education,
* [[Glavlit]] a section for literature and publishing (also in charge of censorship in publishing),
* "Glavrepertkom" (Главрепертком), a commission for approval of performers' repertoires.
* Department of the Mobilisation of Scientific Forces, to which the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] reported to after 1918.
* A Theatre Department which published [[Vestnik Teatra]]
* ''Vneshkol'nyi Otdel'', the adult Education Department run by Krupskaya
Some of these evolved into separate entities, others discontinued.

==History==
The Ministry's predecessor, the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), was established by a decree of the second convocation of the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] on {{OldStyleDate|8 November|1917|26 October}} and was part of the [[Sovnarkom]]. The first Commissar was [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] appointed in 1917.

The Ministry of Education, at the all-Union level, was established on 3 August 1966. It was merged, on 5 March 1988, with the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Higher and Middle Special Education]] and the State Committee for Vocational and Technical Education to form the State Committee for People's Education of the Soviet Union headed by {{ill|Gennady Yagodin|ru|Ягодин, Геннадий Алексеевич}} from 11 March 1988 to 10 December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://2snk.ru/s12.html#%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%20%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0&lt;/ref&gt;

{{third party|date=October 2018}}
The '''OSA Fellow''' is a membership designation of [[The Optical Society]] (OSA) that denotes distinguished scientific accomplishment. The bylaws of this society only allow 10% of its membership to be designated as an OSA Fellow. The OSA Fellow requires peer group nomination.

==The nominee==
An OSA member can only become an OSA Fellow when nominated by a peer group of other current,  OSA Fellows. Review of the nomination is then passed to the OSA Fellow Members Committee. This committee then nominates the candidate to the Board of Directors on an annual basis. Finally, the purpose of this award is to designate a member as one who has "made significant contributions to the advancement of optics".&lt;ref name=briefly&gt;

==The process==
The process includes actively identifying possible candidates who might qualify for this award. Contributing factors for qualification are diverse within the optics community. These factors include significant or distinguishing scientific accomplishments, technical achievements, inventions, technical innovations, technical management, and demonstration of leadership. The fields of such achievement are significant instrument technique, and measurement technique (including original software). Other fields include distinguished sustained accomplishments in engineering, education, service to the global optics community (including photonics and the OSA). Other factors may also include a record of significant publications, patents, and invited review papers for the various levels of meetings related to the covered fields.

Letters of recommendation are solicited from outside the nominee's field of work. Finally references from at least three and no more than five people familiar with the nominee's work are required.&lt;ref name=briefly/&gt; Once all the relevant information has been considered, the OSA Fellow Members Committee votes on the applications and those selected are forwarded to the Board of Directors.

From 1999-2001, he served as head archivist at the library of the Don Calabria Institute in Rome, and in 2001 became curator of the visual arts section of the Cini Cultural Institute in Ferrara. He has exhibited his painting in Italy. In 2005, he returned to Albania to take part in the parliamentary elections as a candidate for the Republican Party in his native Kavaja.

Teferiçi has published two slender volumes of poetry: Bërë me largësi (Made from a Distance), Tirana 1996, and Meqenëse sytë (Since the Eyes), Tirana 2003. His discriminating works have proven him to be among Albania's major contemporary poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_modern1/teferici.html|title=Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pluralsight''' is an [[United States|American]] publicly held [[online education]] company that offers a variety of video training courses for [[software developers]], [[Information technology|IT administrators]], and [[creative professional]]s through its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=225723693 | title=Pluralsight LLC: Private Company Information - Businessweek | publisher=[[Businessweek]] | accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2004 by [[Aaron Skonnard]] (current CEO), [[Keith Brown (author)|Keith Brown]], Fritz Onion, and Bill Williams,&lt;ref name="Perez1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/02/developer-training-platform-pluralsight-raises-27-5-million-from-insight-venture-partners/ | title=Developer Training Platform Pluralsight Raises $27.5 Million From Insight Venture Partners To Expand Its Online Catalog - TechCrunch | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | author=Perez, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company has its headquarters in [[Farmington, Utah]].

==History==
Pluralsight was founded in 2004 as a classroom training company that involved sending an instructor to a business or training event. By 2007, the company shifted its emphasis to online video training.&lt;ref name="Perez1" /&gt;

Since 2011, the company has seen rapid growth. It has been named to the [[Inc. 5000]] list of fastest growing private companies, ranking as the #9 Top Education company and the #19 Top Utah company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inc.com/profile/pluralsight | title=Pluralsight - Layton, Ut | publisher=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]] | accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Pluralsight was named #29 on MountainWest Capital Network's Utah 100 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mwcn.org/utah-100/|title=Utah 100|work=Mountain West Capital Network|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was named a 2017 Best Workplaces in the medium-sized company category by Great Place to Work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greatplacetowork.com/best-workplaces/smb/2017/medium-companies|title=Best Medium Workplaces 2017|website=Great Place To Work United States|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, it ranked #20 on the [[Forbes]] Cloud 100 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/list/|title=Cloud 100|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Pluralsight filed for an [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pluralsight-confidentially-filed-for-ipo-2018-4|title=Pluralsight, an online learning startup for coders, has confidentially filed for an IPO|last=Peterson|first=Becky|date=2018-04-02|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Through a [[subscription business model]], Pluralsight provides online professional tech training to individual and business customers.&lt;ref name="Karol1" /&gt; The company pays its course authors a [[Royalties|royalty]], based on how often their videos are viewed. In 2013, author Scott Allen became the first of its authors to earn over $1 million in royalties from his courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pando.com/2013/07/08/lessons-from-the-first-millionaire-online-teacher/ | title=Lessons from the first millionaire online teacher | publisher=PandoDaily | date=2013-07-08 | author=Lacy, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also offers a complete [[Software as a service|SaaS]] platform for its enterprise users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworlduk.com/it-vendors/how-pluralsights-saas-training-platform-plans-close-skills-gap-3660159/|title=How Pluralsight's SaaS Training Platform Plans To Close The Skills Gap|last=Carey|first=Scott|work=ComputerworldUK|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO Aaron Skonnard has stated that roughly 40% of Fortune 500 companies have a Pluralsight enterprise license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maribellopez/2017/10/12/online-education-a-new-weapon-in-your-digital-transformation-arsenal/|title=Online Education: A New Weapon In Your Digital Transformation Arsenal|last=Lopez|first=Maribel|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cio.com/article/3227831/it-skills-training/how-doing-good-can-help-cios-do-better.html|title=How doing good can help CIOs do better|last=Bonasio|first=Alice|work=CIO|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the company announced its participation in the Pledge 1% movement—a global initiative to encourage [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate philanthropy]] by asking companies to commit 1% of their efforts towards nonprofit organizations. The company launched Pluralsight One in September, 2017, with the goal of improving technology education in the nonprofit sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/news/pluralsight-pledges-one-percent|title=Introducing Pluralsight One: Our commitment to closing the technology skills gap|website=www.pluralsight.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venture funding==
When Pluralsight first started, all four of its founders contributed $5,000 each. For the first nine years, the company and its founders received no outside funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://beehivestartups.com/blog/rise-pluralsight/ | title=The Rise of Pluralsight | publisher=Beehive Startups | date=2015-02-04 | author=Rawle, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2015, the company has received US$169 million in [[Venture capital financing|venture funding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pluralsight | title=Pluralsight - CrunchBase | publisher=[[TechCrunch#CrunchBase|CrunchBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, [[Microsoft]] and Pluralsight announced a partnership making Pluralsight courses available to [[MSDN]] subscribers and through its [[DreamSpark]], [[BizSpark]], WebsiteSpark, and Engineer Excellence programs.&lt;ref name="Perez1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/10/11/msdn-subscribers-worldwide-get-pluralsight-starter-subscription.aspx | title=MSDN subscribers worldwide get Pluralsight Starter Subscription - Brian Harry's blog - Site Home - MSDN Blogs | publisher=[[Microsoft Developer Network#Blogs|MSDN]] | date=2012-10-11 | author=Harry, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customized "Pluralsight Starter Subscription" consisted of several [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio 2012]] courses. In November 2014, the two companies partnered again, giving MSDN subscribers a 12-month access to a selection of Pluralsight's courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Connect-event-2014/612 | title=New MSDN e-learning Benefit: Pluralsight Training | publisher=Channel 9 | date=2014-11-12 | author=Askilsrud, Cathrine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Pluralsight launched a free programming [[Coding Bootcamp|coding bootcamp]] for kids ages 10 and up to help teach coding in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pando.com/2013/05/09/pluralsight-turns-philanthropic-launches-free-coding-bootcamp-in-utah-public-schools/ | title=Pluralsight turns philanthropic, launches free coding bootcamp in Utah public schools | publisher=PandoDaily | date=2013-05-09 | author=Carney, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Pluralsight partnered with the state of Utah's Office of Economic Development to offer Utah K-12 teachers a free one-year subscription to their training library. Utah Governor [[Gary Herbert]] valued the donation between $5 million and $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stem.utah.gov/for-educators/opportunities/ | title=Get A+ Skills With A Free Year Of Online Education | publisher=State of Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://davisclipper.com/view/full_story/25541785/article-Pluralsight--a-tech-business-magnet-for-Davis-County- | title=The Davis Clipper - Pluralsight a tech business magnet for Davis County | publisher=The Davis Clipper | accessdate=2014-09-12 | author=Metcalf, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.utahbusiness.com/articles/view/pluralsight_opens_new_headquarters_launches_goed | title=Pluralsight Opens New Headquarters, Launches GOED Initiative | date=2014-08-04 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230021952/http://www.utahbusiness.com/articles/view/pluralsight_opens_new_headquarters_launches_goed | archivedate=2014-12-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluralsight also partnered with [[LaunchCode]] in November 2014 to help candidates secure jobs in technology by offering one year of free access to the Pluralsight course library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/pluralsight-teams-with-launchcode/article_f9fa89c5-e759-5e18-a73a-90bfac63faea.html | title=Pluralsight teams with LaunchCode | publisher=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date=2014-11-07 | author=Gallagher, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the company supported the "[[Code.org#Hour of Code challenge|Hour of Code]]" movement by hosting an hour of code for a week.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17269">'''Post-law school employment in the United States''' reflects the extent to which students who obtain a [[law degree]] after attending [[law school in the United States]] are able to find [[employment]] which pays well enough to enable them to at least recoup the costs of their degrees. 

==Employment statistics and salary information==

According to the Employment Summary Report prepared by the ABA's Section on Legal Education, around 86% of recent law graduates were employed 9 months after graduation, but only 62% of U.S. law school graduates who graduated in May 2016 were employed in full-time, long term positions that required a law degree.&lt;ref name="employmentsummary.abaquestionnaire.org"/&gt;  This is consistent with findings in labor economists Michael Simkovic and Frank McIntyre's peer-reviewed study of U.S. Census Bureau data from 1996 to 2013, ''The Economic Value of a Law Degree'' which found that 40 percent of law school graduates do not practice law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014). "Our analysis of Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data suggests that
about three of five law school graduates work as lawyers"&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''National Law Journal'' compiles employment information tracking the proportion of recent graduates working in the 250 largest law firms in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202589189668&amp;interactive=true National Law Journal To Go to Law School rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although relatively few law graduates obtain these highly paid positions, law graduates, even graduates of low-ranked law schools, have much lower student loan default rates than average according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2015/10/new-york-times-editorial-board-is-wrong-law-student-loans-are-safe-and-profitable-for-the-government.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Professor Simkovic &amp; McIntyre's study found that law graduates who do not practice law still derive substantial benefits from their law degrees.  Law graduates earn around $30,0000 to $60,000 more per year than they likely would have been had they never attended law school.  Unemployment and underemployment rates are higher for similar undergraduates than for law graduates.  Long term earnings data is available from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation, a nationally representative survey first used to measure law degree holder earnings premiums in a widely cited study by Simkovic and McIntyre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate study of law graduates earnings sponsored by the American Bar Foundation and National Association for Law Placement, "After the JD", came to substantially similar conclusions.  "After the JD II" and "After the JD III" found that law graduates, even from low ranked law schools, typically had six figure incomes within 12 years of graduation and made substantial progress toward paying down their debts.&lt;ref&gt;After the JDIII https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10659607&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.du.edu/documents/directory/publications/sterling/AJD2.pdf After the JII]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A working paper by University of Chicago economics graduate student David Burk used another Census data source and came to conclusions broadly similar to those of Simkovic &amp; McIntyre and ''After the JD''.&lt;ref&gt;David Burk, [http://home.uchicago.edu/~dburk/jobmarketpaper.pdf Returns to Legal Education], 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, such as Brian Tamanaha, questioned whether a law degree would continue to provide similar benefits to law graduates who graduated during a recession.

Subsequent peer reviewed research by McIntyre and Simkovic using U.S. Census data and [[Backtesting|"back testing"]] investigated differences in earnings premiums between law school graduates graduating into strong and weak economies to try to better understand the impact of the 2008-2009 recession.  Simkovic &amp; McIntyre found that over the course of a lifetime, the differences were too small to sway the decision about whether or not law school was a good financial investment.&lt;ref&gt;Frank McIntyre &amp; Michael Simkovic, Timing Law School, 14 J. Empirical Legal Stud. 258–300 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank McIntyre &amp; Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2574587 Timing Law School (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/business/dealbook/despite-forecasts-of-doom-signs-of-life-in-the-legal-industry.html Steven Davidoff Solomon, Law Schools and Industry Show Signs of Life, Despite Forecasts of Doom, N.Y.

The second Simkovic &amp; McIntyre study also found that current unemployment does not predict future unemployment in 3 or 4 years when those currently entering law school would graduate.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2015/03/the-perils-of-prediction-michael-simkovic.html The Perils of Prediction, Brian Leiter's Law School Reports], March 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research by McIntyre and Simkovic investigated variability in earnings for law graduates by college major and race.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic &amp; Frank McIntyre, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2742674 Value of a Law Degree by College Major] (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank McIntyre &amp; Michael Simkovic, Are Law Degrees as Valuable to Minorities?, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3037749 International Review of Law &amp; Economics] (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; These studies found that law degrees tend to benefit humanities majors more than STEM majors and tend to benefit whites more than unrepresented minorities.  However, the benefits to STEM majors and minorities still usually exceed the costs of law degrees.

In 2010, law professor Brian Tamanaha had questioned the accuracy of employment statistics provided by some law schools to the National Association for Law Placement and the American Bar Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo14279340.html Brian Tamanaha, ''Failing Law Schools''], University of Chicago Press, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that employment and salary information provided by law schools was based on surveys of recent graduates. This information is consolidated and made available by the American Bar Association.&lt;ref name="employmentsummary.abaquestionnaire.org"&gt;http://employmentsummary.abaquestionnaire.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book entitled "Failing Law Schools," Tamanaha explained that he would advise members of his own family against attending the law schools where he has taught because they are too expensive relative to the financial benefits they provide.&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian Z. (2012-06-18). Failing Law Schools (Chicago Series in Law and Society) (Kindle Locations 3413-3414). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor Economist Frank McIntyre and Michael Simkovic criticized Professor Tamanaha's research, noting it had factual errors, misleading and selective citations to sources that contradicted the proposition for which Tamanaha cited them, and inappropriate and misleading uses of data.&lt;ref name="colloquy.law.northwestern.edu"&gt;Michael Simkovic &amp; Frank McIntyre, Populist Outrage, Reckless Empirics: A Review of Failing Law Schools, Northwestern University Law Review, Feb. 3, 2014, {{cite web |url=http://colloquy.law.northwestern.edu/main/2014/02/populist-outrage-reckless-empirics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103204/http://colloquy.law.northwestern.edu/main/2014/02/populist-outrage-reckless-empirics.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Simkovic and McIntyre praised Tamanaha for his lively writing style and creative policy proposals.

==Lifetime value of a law degree==

According to a peer reviewed study published in the University of Chicago's Journal of Legal Studies and authored by labor economists Michael Simkovic and Frank McIntyre, a law degree increases lifetime earnings by $1,000,000 compared to a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/debating-yet-again-the-worth-of-law-school/ Steven M. Davidoff, Debating, Yet Again, the Worth of Law School, N.Y.

After taxes, the mean present value will be around $700,000. At the median, or 50th percentile, the pretax present value is $610,000 and the after tax value is $430,000. After tuition, the median law graduate becomes around $330,000 richer.  Even toward the bottom of the distribution, the value of a law degree will typically exceed its costs by hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United States Department of Labor,  Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national average salary for lawyers in 2016 was $140,000.&lt;ref name="BLS OES Lawyers"&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics, Lawyers]&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries vary by geography, with higher average salaries in big cities—especially New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, and Los Angeles—and lower salaries in rural areas.  An unpublished table produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that unemployment rates among experienced lawyers are lower than those for most high-income occupations.&lt;ref name="Tableau"&gt;[http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/gallery/who039s-got-biggest-salary Tableau, Who's got the Biggest Salary]&lt;/ref&gt;  BLS data also suggests that lawyer employment has grown slightly faster than other occupations, with lawyers comprising a growing share of the work force over the last decade.

BLS figures exclude law firm partner profits.  Profits per partner at the 200 largest law firms by revenue are reported by the ''American Lawyer'' magazine in its [[List of law firms by profits per partner|AmLaw 100]] and AmLaw 200 rankings.  According to ''American Lawyer'', profits per partner at these firms have ranged from around $300,000 at the least profitable to $5,000,000 at the most.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanlawyer.com/PubArticleTAL.jsp?id=1202596369694&amp;Profits_Per_Partner_Profits_Increase_Moderately ''American Lawyer'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all law school graduates work as lawyers.  According to Simkovic and McIntyre's study of U.S. Census Bureau data, around 40 percent of U.S. residents with law degrees do not practice law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Law graduates are disproportionately represented in leadership positions in business and government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Association for Legal Career Professionals produces an annual report summarizing the employment of recent graduates of U.S. law schools at a single point in time, 9 months of graduation.  Employment at that point is typically around 90 percent, although from 2009 to 2011, the numbers were lower, at around 86 to 88 percent.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"&gt;[http://www.nalp.org/0712research National Association for Law Placement]&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 2 percent of graduates were employed in non-professional jobs.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"/&gt;  Approximately 75 to 85 percent work in jobs classified by NALP as "JD required" or "JD preferred", and another 5 percent work in other professional jobs.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"/&gt; A law degree increases earnings, even including those who do not practice law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because federal tax rates are around 30 percent, and the mean value of a law degree is $1,000,000, the benefit to the federal government's budget is on average $300,000 per law student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, student loans to law students are profitable because of low default rates relative to other degree programs, high interest rates on loans to graduate students, and high recovery rates on defaulted loans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;   Default rates on loans to law students were low both before and after the availability of programs such as Income Based Repayment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/uploads/Simkovic_McIntyre_2014_The%20Economic%20Value%20of%20a%20Law%20Degree.pdf The Economic Value of a Law Degree], 43 J.

===Lawsuits related to American legal education===

In 2011, several law schools were sued by plaintiffs who alleged fraud and misleading job placement statistics.  Most of these suits have been dismissed on the merits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/072012cooleyopinion.pdf | work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2013/02/nlj-update-on-.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2014/09/three-chicago-law-schools-.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OzBU3w89StcJ:www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id%3D1202671671262/Dismissal-of-Fraud-Claims-Against-Law-Schools-Affirmed-%3Fmcode%3D1202615432217%26curindex%3D0+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, students of the for-profit Charlotte Law School filed a class action lawsuit against the school, alleging among other things that Charlotte had failed to inform them that it was at risk of losing its access to federal student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2016/12/26/charlotte-school-of-law-students-file-class-action-lawsuit-for-fraud/|title=CLS students file class action lawsuit|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Advert section|date=October 2017}}
Quizlet began as an idea conceptualized by Sutherland to memorize 111 animal names for his French class.&lt;ref&gt;Tynan, Dan. PC World. (March 9, 2008) [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/PCWorld/story?id=4417827 "Meet the Whiz Kids: 10 Overachievers Under 21"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilSPvgo0K38 The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet].&lt;/ref&gt; To aid in memorizing the names, he began writing a program to help him study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These first lines of code were deleted and then rewritten over a course of 420 days. In October 2005, Quizlet was released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;MIT / "Quiz Yourself"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2011, Quizlet shared staff and financial resources with the [[Collectors Weekly]] web site.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

==Study modes and games==
As a memorization tool, Quizlet lets registered users create sets of terms and definition customized for their own needs.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Boswell. Life Hacker. (January 28, 2007) [http://lifehacker.com/#!231993/practice-your-vocabulary-with-quizlet "Practice your vocabulary with Quizlet"].&lt;/ref&gt; These sets of terms can then be studied under several study modes.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Feldman. The Boston Globe (November 26, 2010) [http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/family/articles/2010/11/26/surfing_the_net_with_kids_vocabulary_sites/].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://quizlet.com/faqs/faq-how-do-i-study-my-flash-cards/ "What are the different ways I can study my flash cards?".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103165630/http://quizlet.com/faqs/faq-how-do-i-study-my-flash-cards/ |date=November 3, 2009 }} Quizlet FAQ.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Flash Cards:
: This mode is similar to paper flash cards. In it, users are shown a "card" for each term. Users can click to flip over the card or use their arrow keys or space bar, and see the definition for that term.&lt;ref name="modes"&gt;{{Cite web
| title =  Engagement for Memory: Try Quizlet
| work = Jeanne Farrington
| accessdate = 2015-02-01

| url = http://www.jfarrington.com/2014/10/engagement-for-memory-try-quizlet/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user has the option for the face of the card to be a picture, writing, or both if it is desired.
; Gravity:
: In this study mode, definitions scroll vertically down the screen in the shape of asteroids. The user must type the term that goes with the definition before it reaches the bottom of the screen. It is one of the 'Play' study modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Quizlet Raises $12M Series A|url = http://www.vcnewsdaily.com/quizlet/venture-capital-funding/tjldfhxjvy|website = VentureTracker|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravity was adapted from a previous game, Space Race. The user can pick the level of difficulty and game type.
; Write:
: In this study mode, users are shown a term or definition and must type the term or definition that goes with what is shown. After entering their answer, users see if their answer was correct or not, and can choose to override the automatic grading and count their answer as right if needed.
; Long-Term Learning
: In this study mode, users are given a recommended study set based on whether or not they answer study set questions correctly. Repetition of terms answered incorrectly increases in frequency and a dashboard shows learning progress over time. The mode uses spaced repetition concepts to focus on longer-term retention and subject mastery versus shorter-term memorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Announcing Quizlet's first funding round and what's next for us|url = https://quizlet.com/blog/announcing-quizlets-first-funding-round-and-whats-next-for-us|website = quizlet.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Speller:
: In this mode, the term is read out loud and users must type in the term with the correct spelling. If the user gets every answer correct, they are rewarded with a video of a monster truck doing a jump, wheelie, and a flip. &lt;ref name="modes" /&gt;
; Match:
: In this study mode, users are presented with a grid with terms scattered around it. Users drag terms on top of their associated definitions to remove them from the grid and try to clear the grid in the fastest time possible. Micro-match is a related matching game geared towards mobile devices and devices with small screens. Users may access the Micromatch mode on non-mobile devices by manually editing the URL in Match mode to use "micromatch" instead of "match".&lt;ref name="modes" /&gt; Match was previously attributed as "Scatter". Though the name of the study mode changed, the game itself did not.
; Live
:In this study mode, a Quizlet user with a Teacher upgrade (usually a teacher) breaks their class up into teams of however number of teams they want. The teacher chooses whether to start with a definition or term. Each team will have to choose the correct term/definition to win, with the team that has the most points winning. If the teacher decides to shuffle the teams, the groups are randomly put into new teams. This game works by choosing a set of flashcards and putting these flashcards into a format which works for the game.

==API==

Quizlet provides an [[application programming interface|API]] that allows others to access Quizlet data. Available functions include uploading and downloading flashcards, modifying users' flashcards, and finding definitions created by Quizlet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Reflective practice''' is the ability to reflect on one's actions so as to engage in a process of continuous learning.&lt;ref name="Schon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schön |first=Donald A. |authorlink=Donald Schön |date=1983 |title=The reflective practitioner: how professionals think in action |location=New York |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=046506874X |oclc=8709452 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one definition it involves "paying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively. This leads to developmental insight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Gillie |date=2010 |origyear=2001 |title=Reflective practice: writing and professional development |edition=3rd |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=9781848602113 |oclc=458734364 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XSNiMpiHuwcC&amp;pg=PR19 xix]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key rationale for reflective practice is that experience alone does not necessarily lead to learning; deliberate [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] on experience is essential.&lt;ref name="Loughran"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loughran |first=J.

Reflective practice can be an important tool in [[practice-based professional learning]] settings where people learn from their own professional experiences, rather than from [[formal learning]] or [[knowledge transfer]]. It may be the most important source of personal [[professional development]] and improvement. It is also an important way to bring together theory and practice; through reflection a person is able to see and label forms of thought and theory within the context of his or her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McBrien |first=Barry |date=July 2007 |title=Learning from practice—reflections on a critical incident |journal=[[Accident and Emergency Nursing]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1016/j.aaen.2007.03.004 |pmid=17540574}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who reflects throughout his or her practice is not just looking back on past actions and events, but is taking a conscious look at emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that information to add to his or her existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding.&lt;ref name="paterson-chapman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paterson |first1=Colin |last2=Chapman |first2=Judith |date=August 2013 |title=Enhancing skills of critical reflection to evidence learning in professional practice |journal=Physical Therapy in Sport |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=133–138 |doi=10.1016/j.ptsp.2013.03.004 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Judith_Chapman4/publication/236637498_Enhancing_skills_of_critical_reflection_to_evidence_learning_in_professional_practice/links/540992db0cf2822fb739aff7.pdf |pmid=23643448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
[[File:Donald schon pic.jpg|thumb|right|Donald Schön]]
[[Donald Schön]]'s 1983 book ''The Reflective Practitioner'' introduced concepts such as ''reflection-on-action'' and ''reflection-in-action'' which explain how professionals meet the challenges of their work with a kind of [[improvisation]] that is improved through practice.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt; However, the concepts underlying reflective practice are much older. Earlier in the 20th century, [[John Dewey]] was among the first to write about reflective practice with his exploration of experience, interaction and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dewey |first=John |authorlink=John Dewey |date=1998 |origyear=1933 |title=How we think: a restatement of the relation of reflective thinking to the educative process |location=Boston |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |isbn=0395897548 |oclc=38878663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, other researchers such as [[Kurt Lewin]] and [[Jean Piaget]] were developing relevant theories of human learning and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alice Y. |last1=Kolb |first2=David A. |last2=Kolb |authorlink2=David A. Kolb |year=2005 |title=Learning styles and learning spaces: enhancing experiential learning in higher education |journal=[[Academy of Management Learning and Education]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=193–212 |citeseerx=10.1.1.127.6489 |doi=10.5465/AMLE.2005.17268566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have claimed to find precursors of reflective practice in ancient texts such as [[Buddhist]] teachings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winter |first=Richard |date=March 2003 |title=Buddhism and action research: towards an appropriate model of inquiry for the caring professions |journal=Educational Action Research |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=141–160 |doi=10.1080/09650790300200208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Meditations]]'' of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suibhne |first=Seamus Mac |date=September 2009 |title='Wrestle to be the man philosophy wished to make you': Marcus Aurelius, reflective practitioner |journal=Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=429–436 |doi=10.1080/14623940903138266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the development of reflective theory was interest in the integration of theory and practice, the cyclic pattern of experience and the conscious application of lessons learned from experience. Since the 1970s, there has been a growing literature and focus around [[experiential learning]] and the development and application of reflective practice.

As [[adult education]] professor David Boud and his colleagues explained: "Reflection is an important human activity in which people recapture their experience, think about it, mull it over and evaluate it. It is this working with experience that is important in learning."&lt;ref name="Boud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boud |first1=David |last2=Keogh |first2=Rosemary |last3=Walker |first3=David |date=1985 |title=Reflection, turning experience into learning |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Kogan Page]]; Nichols |isbn=0893972029 |oclc=11030218 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BGUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is experiencing something, he or she may be [[implicit learning|implicitly learning]]; however, it can be difficult to put emotions, events, and thoughts into a coherent sequence of events. When a person rethinks or retells events, it is possible to categorize events, emotions, ideas, etc., and to compare the intended purpose of a past action with the results of the action. Stepping back from the action permits [[critical reflection]] on a sequence of events.&lt;ref name="paterson-chapman"/&gt;

The emergence in more recent years of [[blogging]] has been seen as another form of reflection on experience in a technological age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wopereis |first1=Iwan G.J.H. |last2=Sloep |first2=Peter B. |last3=Poortman |first3=Sybilla H. |title=Weblogs as instruments for reflection on action in teacher education |journal=Interactive Learning Environments |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=245–261 |year=2010 |doi=10.1080/10494820.2010.500530 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Sloep/publication/220095297_Weblogs_as_instruments_for_reflection_on_action_in_teacher_education/links/02bfe50fd8c738b584000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models&lt;!--Section linked from [[Learning cycle]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
Many models of reflective practice have been created to guide [[reasoning]] about action.

[[File:Steph Rol Model.jpg|thumb|Terry Borton's reflective model (1970), as adapted by Gary Rolfe and colleagues (2001)]]
Terry Borton's 1970 book ''Reach, Touch, and Teach'' popularized a simple [[learning cycle]] inspired by [[Gestalt therapy]] composed of three questions which ask the practitioner: ''What'', ''So what'', and ''Now what''?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Borton |first=Terry |date=1970 |title=Reach, touch, and teach: student concerns and process education |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |oclc=178000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this analysis, a description of a situation is given which then leads into the scrutiny of the situation and the construction of knowledge that has been learnt through the experience. Subsequently, practitioners reflect on ways in which they can personally improve and the consequences of their response to the experience. Borton's model was later adapted by practitioners outside the field of education, such as the field of nursing and the helping professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rolfe |first1=Gary |last2=Freshwater |first2=Dawn |last3=Jasper |first3=Melanie |date=2001 |title=Critical reflection for nursing and the helping professions: a user's guide |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]] |isbn=0333777956 |oclc=46984997 |pages=26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kolb and Fry 1975===
[[File:Steph Kol Model.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of Kolb's reflective model]]
Learning theorist [[David A. Kolb]] was highly influenced by the earlier research conducted by [[John Dewey]] and [[Jean Piaget]]. Kolb's reflective model highlights the concept of [[experiential learning]] and is centered on the transformation of information into knowledge. This takes place after a situation has occurred, and entails a practitioner reflecting on the experience, gaining a general understanding of the concepts encountered during the experience, and then testing these general understandings in a new situation. In this way, the knowledge that is formed from a situation is continuously applied and reapplied, building on a practitioner's prior experiences and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kolb |first1=David A. |authorlink1=David A. Kolb |last2=Fry |first2=Ronald E. |date=1975 |chapter=Towards an applied theory of experiential learning |editor-last=Cooper |editor-first=Cary L. |title=Theories of group processes |series=Wiley series on individuals, groups, and organizations |location=London; New York |publisher=Wiley |pages=33–58 |isbn=0471171174 |oclc=1103318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argyris and Schön 1978===

[[Management]] researchers [[Chris Argyris]] and [[Donald Schön]] pioneered the idea of ''single-loop learning'' and ''[[double-loop learning]]'' in 1978. Their theory was built around the recognition and correction of a perceived fault or error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Mark K. |year=2013 |origyear=2001 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/argyris.htm |title=Chris Argyris: theories of action, double-loop learning and organizational learning |publisher=The encyclopedia of informal education |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-loop learning is when a practitioner or organisation, even after an error has occurred and a correction is made, continues to rely on current strategies, techniques or policies when a situation again comes to light. Double-loop learning involves the modification of objectives, strategies or policies so that when a similar situation arises a new framing system is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Argyris |first1=Chris |authorlink1=Chris Argyris |last2=Schön |first2=Donald A. |authorlink2=Donald Schön |date=1996 |origyear=1978 |title=Organizational learning: a theory of action perspective |series=Addison-Wesley OD series |volume=1 |location=Reading, MA |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=0201001748 |oclc=503599388}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}

Schön claimed to derive the notions of "reflection-on-action, reflection-in-action, responding to problematic situations, problem framing, problem solving, and the priority of practical knowledge over abstract theory" from the writings of [[John Dewey]], although education professor Harvey Shapiro has argued that Dewey's writings offer "more expansive, more integrated notions of professional growth" than do Schön's.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Harvey |date=2010 |title=John Dewey's reception in 'Schönian' reflective practice |journal=Philosophy of Education Archive |pages=311–319 [311] |url=http://ojs.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/pes/article/view/3049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schon advocated 2 types of reflective practice. Firstly, reflection-on-action, which involves reflecting on an experience that you have already had, or an action that you have already taken, and considering what could have been done differently, as well as looking at the positives from that interaction. The other type of reflection Schon notes is reflection-in-action, or reflecting on your actions as you are doing them, and considering issues like best practice throughout the process.

For Schön, professional growth really begins when a person starts to view things with a critical lens, by doubting his or her actions. [[Doubt]] brings about a way of thinking that questions and frames situations as "problems". Through careful planning and systematic elimination of other possible problems, doubt is settled, and people are able to affirm their knowledge of the situation. Then people are able to think about possible situations and their outcomes, and deliberate about whether they carried out the right actions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Gibbs 1988===
[[File:Steph Gib Model.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the Gibbs reflective model]]
Learning researcher Graham Gibbs discussed the use of structured [[debriefing]] to facilitate the reflection involved in Kolb's experiential [[learning cycle]]. Gibbs presents the stages of a full structured debriefing as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=Graham |year=1988 |title=Learning by doing: a guide to teaching and learning methods |location=London |publisher=Further Education Unit |isbn=1853380717 |oclc=19809667 |url=http://www2.glos.ac.uk/gdn/gibbs/ |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs' suggestions are often cited as "Gibbs' reflective cycle" or "Gibbs' model of reflection", and simplified into the following six distinct stages to assist in structuring reflection on learning experiences:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Finlay |first=Linda |date=January 2008 |title=Reflecting on 'reflective practice' |number=PBPL paper 52 |institution=Practice-based Professional Learning Centre, [[The Open University]] |url=http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/sites/www.open.ac.uk.opencetl/files/files/ecms/web-content/Finlay-(2008)-Reflecting-on-reflective-practice-PBPL-paper-52.pdf |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johns 1995===
[[File:Steph Joh Model2.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the Johns reflective model]]
Professor of nursing Christopher Johns designed a structured mode of reflection that provides a practitioner with a guide to gain greater understanding of his or her practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johns |first1=Christopher |last2=Burnie |first2=Sally |date=2013 |origyear=2000 |title=Becoming a reflective practitioner |edition=4th |location=Chichester, UK; Ames, Iowa |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |isbn=9780470674260 |oclc=823139850 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWifyeS9ol0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to be carried out through the act of sharing with a colleague or mentor, which enables the experience to become learnt knowledge at a faster rate than reflection alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Johns |editor-first=Christopher |date=2010 |origyear=2002 |title=Guided reflection: a narrative approach to advancing professional practice |edition=2nd |location=Chichester, UK; Ames, Iowa |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=9781405185684 |oclc=502392750 |doi=10.1002/9781444324969 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uf-3GyLX1QwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johns highlights the importance of experienced knowledge and the ability of a practitioner to access, understand and put into practice information that has been acquired through empirical means. Reflection occurs though "looking in" on one's thoughts and emotions and "looking out" at the situation experienced. Johns draws on the work of Barbara Carper to expand on the notion of "looking out" at a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Barbara A. |last1=Carper |title=Fundamental patterns of knowing in nursing |date=October 1978 |journal=Advances in Nursing Science |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–24 |doi=10.1097/00012272-197810000-00004 |pmid=110216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five [[Carper's fundamental ways of knowing|patterns of knowing]] are incorporated into the guided reflection: the aesthetic, personal, ethical, empirical and reflexive aspects of the situation. Johns' model is comprehensive and allows for reflection that touches on many important elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johns |first1=Christopher |title=Framing learning through reflection within Carper's fundamental ways of knowing in nursing |journal=[[Journal of Advanced Nursing]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=226–234 |date=August 1995 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.1995.22020226.x |pmid=7593941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brookfield 1998===
[[Adult education]] scholar [[Stephen Brookfield]] proposed that critically reflective practitioners constantly research their assumptions by seeing practice through four complementary lenses: the lens of their autobiography as learners of reflective practice, the lens of other learners' eyes, the lens of colleagues' experiences, and the lens of theoretical, philosophical and research literature.&lt;ref name="Brookfield1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brookfield |first=Stephen D. |authorlink=Stephen Brookfield |title=Critically reflective practice |journal=Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions |date=Autumn 1998 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=197–205 |doi=10.1002/chp.1340180402 |url=http://library.sau.edu/committee/brookfieldCritically.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093458/http://library.sau.edu/committee/brookfieldCritically.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing practice through these lenses makes us more aware of the power dynamics that infuse all practice settings. It also helps us detect hegemonic assumptions—assumptions that we think are in our own best interests, but actually work against us in the long run.&lt;ref name="Brookfield1998"/&gt; Brookfield argued that these four lenses will reflect back to us starkly different pictures of who we are and what we do.
* ''Lens 1: Our autobiography as a learner''. Our autobiography is an important source of insight into practice. As we talk to each other about critical events in our practice, we start to realize that individual crises are usually collectively experienced dilemmas. Analysing our autobiographies allows us to draw insight and meanings for practice on a deep visceral emotional level.
* ''Lens 2: Our learners' eyes''. Seeing ourselves through learners' eyes, we may discover that learners are interpreting our actions in the way that we mean them. But often we are surprised by the diversity of meanings people read into our words and actions. A cardinal principle of seeing ourselves through learners' eyes is that of ensuring the anonymity of their critical opinions. We have to make learners feel safe. Seeing our practice through learners' eyes helps us teach more responsively.
* ''Lens 3: Our colleagues' experiences''. Our colleagues serve as critical mirrors reflecting back to us images of our actions. Talking to colleagues about problems and gaining their perspective increases our chance of finding some information that can help our situation.
* ''Lens 4: Theoretical literature''. Theory can help us "name" our practice by illuminating the general elements of what we think are idiosyncratic experiences.

==Application==
Reflective practice has been described as an unstructured or semi-structured approach directing learning, and a self-regulated process commonly used in health and teaching professions, though applicable to all professions.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larrivee |first1=Barbara |title=Transforming teaching practice: becoming the critically reflective teacher |journal=Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=293–307 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/713693162 |url=http://ed253jcu.pbworks.com/f/Larrivee_B_2000CriticallyReflectiveTeacher.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective practice is a learning process taught to professionals from a variety of disciplines, with the aim of enhancing abilities to communicate and making informed and balanced decisions. Professional associations such as the [[American Association of Nurse Practitioners]] are recognizing the importance of reflective practice and require practitioners to prepare reflective portfolios as a requirement to be licensed, and for yearly quality assurance purposes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Education===
The concept of reflective practice has found wide application in the field of education, for learners, teachers and those who teach teachers. Hadiya Habib(2017) assert that there is one quality above all that makes a good teacher -the ability to reflect on what, why and how we do things and to adopt and develop our practice within lifelong learning. Reflection is the key to successful learning for teachers and for learners.

====Students====
Students can benefit from engaging in reflective practice as it can foster the critical thinking and decision making necessary for continuous learning and improvement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Portfolio Organizer: Succeeding with Portfolios in your Classroom|last = Rolheiser, C.  Bower, B.  Stevahn, L|first = |publisher = Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Alexandria, VA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When students are engaged in reflection, they are thinking about how their work meets established criteria; they analyze the effectiveness of their efforts, and plan for improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rolheiser and et al. (2000) assert that "Reflection is linked to elements that are fundamental to meaningful learning and cognitive development: the development of metacognition – the capacity for students to improve their ability to think about their thinking; the ability to self-evaluate - the capacity for students to judge the quality of their work based on evidence and explicit criteria for the purpose of doing better work; the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making; and the enhancement of teacher understanding of the learner." (p 31-32)

When teachers teach metacognitive skills, it promotes student self-monitoring and self-regulation that can lead to intellectual growth, increase academic achievement, and support transfer of skills so that students are able to use any strategy at any time and for any purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.edugains.ca/resourcesCurrImpl/Secondary/FSL/SupplementaryMaterials/ConnectingPracticeandResearchMetacognitionGuide.pdf|title = Connecting Practice and Research: Metacognition Guide|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = Connecting Practice and Research: Metacognition Guide|publisher = Queens Printer|last = Ontario Ministry of Education|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guiding students in the habits of reflection requires teachers to approach their role as that of "facilitator of [[meaning-making]]" – they organize instruction and classroom practice so that students are the producers, not just the consumers, of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Learning and leading with habits of mind: 16 essential characteristics for success.|last = Costa, A., Kallick, B.|first = |publisher = Association for supervision and Curriculum Development|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Alexandria, VA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolheiser and colleagues (2000) state that "When students develop their capacity to understand their own thinking processes, they are better equipped to employ the necessary cognitive skills to complete a task or achieve a goal. Students who have acquired metacognitive skills are better able to compensate for both low ability and insufficient information." (p.&amp;nbsp;34)

The Ontario Ministry of Education (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/studentselfassessment.pdf|title = Capacity Building Series: Student Self Assessment|date = 2007|accessdate = |website = Literacy and Numeracy Secretariat Capacity Building Series|publisher = Queens Printer|last = Ontario Ministry of Education|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes many ways in which educators can help students acquire the skills required for effective reflection and self-assessment, including: modelling and/or intentionally teaching critical thinking skills necessary for reflection and self-assessment practices; addressing students' perceptions of self-assessment; engaging in discussion and dialogue about why self-assessment is important; allowing time to learn self-assessment and reflection skills; providing many opportunities to practice different aspects of the self-assessment and reflection process; and ensuring that parents/guardians understand that self-assessment is only one of a variety of assessment strategies that is utilized for student learning.

====Teachers====
The concept of reflective practice is now widely employed in the field of teacher education and teacher professional development and many programmes of initial teacher education claim to espouse it.&lt;ref name="Loughran"/&gt; In education, a minimalist understanding of reflective practice is that it refers to the process of the educator studying his or her own teaching methods and determining what works best for the students and the consideration of the ethical consequences of classroom procedures on students; a broader understanding would accept that it also involves questioning the organisational, social and political context in which the teaching takes place.&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"/&gt; Education professor Hope Hartman has described reflective practice in education as teacher [[metacognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartman |first=Hope J. |date=2001 |chapter=Teaching metacognitively |editor-last=Hartman |editor-first=Hope J. |title=Metacognition in learning and instruction: theory, research, and practice |series=Neuropsychology and cognition |volume=19 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |pages=149–172 |isbn=079236838X |oclc=45655382 |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2243-8_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is broad consensus that teaching effectively requires a reflective approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hatton |first1=Neville |last2=Smith |first2=David |date=January 1995 |title=Reflection in teacher education: towards definition and implementation |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–49 |doi=10.1016/0742-051X(94)00012-U}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cochran-Smith |first=Marilyn |date=January 2003 |title=Learning and unlearning: the education of teacher educators |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=5–28 |doi=10.1016/S0742-051X(02)00091-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Jones |first2=Karrie A. |date=January 2013 |title=Teaching reflective practice: implementation in the teacher-education setting |journal=The Teacher Educator |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=73–85 |doi=10.1080/08878730.2012.740153 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08878730.2012.740153 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reflective practice "is a term that carries diverse meaning"&lt;ref name="Loughran"/&gt; and about which there is not complete consensus.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leitch |first1=Ruth |last2=Day |first2=Christopher |date=March 2000 |title=Action research and reflective practice: towards a holistic view |journal=Educational Action Research |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=179–193 |doi=10.1080/09650790000200108 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09650790000200108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davey |first1=Ronnie |last2=Ham |first2=Vince |date=March 2010 |title='It's all about paying attention!' … but to what?

Reflecting on different approaches to teaching, and reshaping the understanding of past and current experiences, can lead to improvement in teaching practices.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2000"/&gt; Schön's reflection-in-action can help teachers explicitly incorporate into their decision-making the professional knowledge that they gain from their experience in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fien |first1=John |last2=Rawling |first2=Richard |title=Reflective practice: a case study of professional development for environmental education |journal=The Journal of Environmental Education |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=11–20 |date=April 1996 |doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9941462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As professor of education Barbara Larrivee argues, reflective practice moves teachers from their knowledge base of distinct skills to a stage in their careers where they are able to modify their skills to suit specific contexts and situations, and eventually to invent new strategies.&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"/&gt; In implementing a process of reflective practice teachers will be able to move themselves, and their schools, beyond existing theories in practice.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2000"/&gt; Larrivee concludes that teachers should "resist establishing a classroom culture of control and become a reflective practitioner, continuously engaging in a critical reflection, consequently remaining fluid in the dynamic environment of the classroom".&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"/&gt;

[[Video]] recordings of classroom activities have been used to help trainee teachers / education interns develop more detailed reflective practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosaen |first1=Cheryl L. |last2=Lundeberg |first2=Mary |last3=Cooper |first3=Marjorie |last4=Fritzen |first4=Anny |last5=Terpstra |first5=Marjorie |date=September 2008 |title=Noticing noticing: how does investigation of video records change how teachers reflect on their experiences? |journal=[[Journal of Teacher Education]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=347–360 |doi=10.1177/0022487108322128 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cheryl_Rosaen/publication/230853172_Noticing_Noticing/links/0deec53c9731066097000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to physiotherapists Colin Paterson and Judith Chapman, reflection or learning from experience is key to staying accountable, and maintaining and developing aptitude throughout a teacher's practice.&lt;ref name="paterson-chapman"/&gt; Without reflection, teachers are not able to look objectively at their actions or take into account the emotions, experience, or consequences of actions to improve their practice. It is argued that, through the process of reflection, teachers are held accountable to the standards of practice for teaching, such as those in [[Ontario]]: commitment to students and student learning, professional knowledge, professional practice, leadership in learning communities, and ongoing [[Professional learning community|professional learning]].&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;{{cite web |title=Standards of practice |publisher=[[Ontario College of Teachers]] |url=http://www.oct.ca/public/professional-standards/standards-of-practice |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through reflective practice, teachers look back on their practice and reflect on how they have supported students by treating them "equitably and with respect and are sensitive to factors that influence individual student learning".&lt;ref name="Ontario"/&gt; By doing this, teachers ask themselves: "Have I to the best of my abilities supported student learning, and provided all of my students with an entry point into learning?" Through reflection, and sharing their reflection, teachers show strong leadership because they show that they are willing to learn from their mistakes and improve their practice for everyone affected by it.&lt;ref name="Ontario"/&gt;

====Teacher educators====

For students to acquire necessary skills in reflection, their teachers need to be able to teach and model reflective practice (see above); similarly, teachers themselves need to have been taught reflective practice during their initial teacher education, and to continue to develop their reflective skills throughout their career.

However, Mary Ryan has noted that students are often asked to "reflect" without being taught how to do so,&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Ryan, M. (2013) 'The pedagogical balancing act: teaching reflection in higher education', Teaching in Higher Education, 18:2, pp 144-155&lt;/ref&gt; or without being taught that different types of reflection are possible; they may not even receive a clear definition or rationale for reflective practice.&lt;ref name="Hebert"&gt;Hébert, C. (2015) 'Knowing and/or experiencing: a critical examination of the reflective models of John Dewey and Donald Schön', Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives&lt;/ref&gt; Many new teachers do not know how to transfer the reflection strategies they learned in college to their classroom teaching.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, J.L. and Jones, K.A. (2013): 'Teaching Reflective Practice: Implementation in the Teacher-Education Setting'; The Teacher Educator, 48 p.1, 73-85)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have advocated that reflective practice needs to be taught explicitly to student teachers because it is not an intuitive act;&lt;ref name="Will"&gt;Williams, R. and Grudnoff, L. (2011) "Making sense of reflection: a comparison of beginning and experienced teachers' perceptions of reflection for practice". Reflective practice: international and multidisciplinary perspectives, 9, 177-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; it is not enough for teacher educators to provide student teachers with "opportunities" to reflect: they must explicitly "teach reflection and types of reflection" and "need explicitly to facilitate the process of reflection and make transparent the metacognitive process it entails".&lt;ref name="Nagle"&gt;Nagle JF (2008), 'Becoming a Reflective Practitioner in the Age of Accountability', The Educational Forum, 73 p.1, 76-86&lt;/ref&gt; Larrivee notes that (student) teachers require "carefully constructed guidance" and "multifaceted and strategically constructed interventions" if they are to reflect effectively on their practice.&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"/&gt;

Rod Lane and colleageues list strategies by which teacher educators can promote a habit of reflective practice in pre-service teachers, such as discussions of a teaching situation, reflective interviews or essays about one's teaching experiences, action research, or journaling or blogging.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;Lane, R., McMaster, H., Adnum J., and Cavanagh, M. (2014) 'Quality reflective practice in teacher education: a journey towards shared understanding,' Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives, 15 p.4, 481-494 [282]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neville Hatton and David Smith, in a brief literature review, conclude that teacher education programmes do use a wide range of strategies with the aim of encouraging students teachers to reflect (e.g. action research, case studies, video-recording or supervised practicum experiences), but that "there is little research evidence to show that this [aim] is actually being achieved".&lt;ref name="Hatton"&gt;Hatton N and Smith D (1995), 'Reflection in Teacher Education: towards definition and implementation', Teaching &amp; Teacher Education, Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 33-49 [36]&lt;/ref&gt;

The implication of all this is that teacher educators must also be highly skilled in reflective practice. Andrea Gelfuso and Danielle Dennis, in a report on a formative experiment with student teachers, suggest that teaching how to reflect requires teacher educators to possess and deploy specific competences.&lt;ref name="Gelfuso"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gelfuso A., Dennis D. | year = 2014 | title = Getting reflection off the page: the challenges of developing support structures for pre-service teacher reflection | url = | journal = Teaching and Teacher Education | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 1–11 | doi=10.1016/j.tate.2013.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Janet Dyment and Timothy O'Connell, in a small-scale study of experienced teacher educators, noted that the teacher educators they studied had received no training in using reflection themselves, and that they in turn did not give such training to their students; all parties were expected to know how to reflect.&lt;ref name="Dyment"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dyment J.E., O'Connell T.S. | year = 2014 | title = When the Ink Runs Dry: Implications for Theory and Practice When Educators Stop Keeping Reflective Journals | url = | journal = Innovation in HE | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 417–429 | doi=10.1007/s10755-014-9291-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers advocate for teacher educators themselves to act as models of reflective practice.&lt;ref name="Lough"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Loughran J., Berry A. | year = 2005 | title = Modelling by teacher educators | url = | journal = Teaching and Teacher Education | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 193–203 | doi=10.1016/j.tate.2004.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russ"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Russell T | year = 2013 | title = Has Reflective Practice Done More Harm than Good in Teacher Education? | url = | journal = Phronesis | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 80–88 | doi=10.7202/1015641ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the way that teacher educators teach their students needs to be congruent with the approaches they expect their students to adopt with pupils; teacher educators should not only model the way to teach, but should also explain why they have chosen a particular approach whilst doing so, by reference to theory; this implies that teacher educators need to be aware of their own tacit theories of teaching and able to connect them overtly to public theory.&lt;ref name="swennen"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Swennen A., Lunenberg M., Korthagen F. | year = 2008 | title = Preach what you teach! Teacher educators and congruent teaching | url = | journal = Teachers and Teaching: theory and practice | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 531–542 | doi=10.1080/13540600802571387}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some teacher educators do not always "teach as they preach";&lt;ref name="Lunenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lunenberg M., Korthagen F.A.J. | year = 2003 | title = Teacher educators and student-directed learning | url = | journal = Teaching and Teacher Education | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 29–44 | doi=10.1016/s0742-051x(02)00092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; they base their teaching decisions on "common sense" more than on public theory&lt;ref name="Lunen2"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lunenberg M., Korthagen F., Swennen A. | year = 2007 | title = The teacher educator as a role model | url = | journal = Teaching and Teacher Education | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 586–601 | doi=10.1016/j.tate.2006.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and struggle with modelling reflective practice.&lt;ref name="Lough"/&gt;

Tom Russell, in a reflective article looking back on 35 years as teacher educator, concurs that teacher educators rarely model reflective practice, fail to link reflection clearly and directly to professional learning, and rarely explain what they mean by reflection, with the result that student teachers may complete their initial teacher education with "a muddled and negative view of what reflection is and how it might contribute to their professional learning".&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, T. (2013) 'Has Reflective Practice Done More Harm than Good in Teacher Education?' Phronesis, 2(1), pp. 80-88&lt;/ref&gt; For Russell, these problems result from the fact that teacher educators have not sufficiently explored how theories of reflective practice relate to their own teaching, and so have not made the necessary "paradigmatic changes" which they expect their students to make.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt;

===Health professionals===
Reflective practice is viewed as an important strategy for health professionals who embrace lifelong learning. Due to the ever-changing context of healthcare and the continual growth of medical knowledge, there is a high level of demand on healthcare professionals' expertise. Due to this complex and continually changing environment, healthcare professionals could benefit from a program of reflective practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hendricks |first1=Joyce |last2=Mooney |first2=Deborah |last3=Berry |first3=Catherine |date=April 1996 |title=A practical strategy approach to use of reflective practice in critical care nursing |journal=Intensive and Critical Care Nursing |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=97–101 |doi=10.1016/S0964-3397(96)81042-1 |pmid=8845631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrienne Price explained that there are several reasons why a healthcare practitioner would engage in reflective practice: to further understand one's motives, perceptions, attitudes, values, and feelings associated with client care; to provide a fresh outlook to practice situations and to challenge existing thoughts, feelings, and actions; and to explore how the practice situation may be approached differently.&lt;ref name="Price 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Adrienne |date=August 2004 |title=Encouraging reflection and critical thinking in practice |journal=Nursing Standard |volume=18 |issue=47 |pages=46–52 |doi=10.7748/ns2004.08.18.47.46.c3664}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of nursing there is concern that actions may run the risk of habitualisation, thus dehumanising patients and their needs.&lt;ref name="Walker1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=Susan |title=Reflective practice in the accident and emergency setting |journal=[[Accident and Emergency Nursing]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27–30 |date=January 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0965-2302(96)90034-X |pmid=8696852}}&lt;/ref&gt; In using reflective practice, nurses are able to plan their actions and consciously monitor the action to ensure it is beneficial to their patient.&lt;ref name="Walker1996"/&gt;

The act of reflection is seen as a way of promoting the development of autonomous, qualified and self-directed professionals, as well as a way of developing more effective healthcare teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghaye |first=Tony |date=2005 |title=Developing the reflective healthcare team |location=Oxford; Malden, MA |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |isbn=1405105917 |oclc=58478682 |doi=10.1002/9780470774694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engaging in reflective practice is associated with improved quality of care, stimulating personal and professional growth and closing the gap between theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasper |first=Melanie |date=2013 |origyear=2003 |title=Beginning reflective practice |series=Nursing and health care practice series |edition=2nd |location=Andover |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9781408075265 |oclc=823552537}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2010}} Medical practitioners can combine reflective practice with [[checklist]]s (when appropriate) to reduce diagnostic error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Graber |first1=Mark L. |last2=Kissam |first2=Stephanie |last3=Payne |first3=Velma L. |last4=Meyer |first4=Ashley N. D. |last5=Sorensen |first5=Asta |last6=Lenfestey |first6=Nancy |last7=Tant |first7=Elizabeth |last8=Henriksen |first8=Kerm |last9=LaBresh |first9=Kenneth |last10=Singh |first10=Hardeep |date=July 2012 |title=Cognitive interventions to reduce diagnostic error: a narrative review |journal=[[BMJ Quality &amp; Safety]] |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=535–557 |doi=10.1136/bmjqs-2011-000149 |pmid=22543420 |url=http://www.ajustnhs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cog-interventions-diag-error-graber-BMJ-QS-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities to promote reflection are now being incorporated into undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education across a variety of health professions.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Karen |last2=Gordon |first2=Jill |last3=MacLeod |first3=Anna |date=November 2007 |title=Reflection and reflective practice in health professions education: a systematic review |journal=Advances in Health Sciences Education |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=595–621 |doi=10.1007/s10459-007-9090-2 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jill_Gordon/publication/5813985_Reflection_and_reflective_practice_in_health_professions_education_a_systematic_review/links/0c960517f54e18b6dd000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of medical education Karen Mann and her colleagues found through a 2009 literature review that in practising professionals the process of reflection appears to include a number of different aspects, and practicing professionals vary in their tendency and ability to reflect. They noted that the evidence to support curricular interventions and innovations promoting reflective practice remains largely theoretical.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;

Samantha Davies identified benefits as well as limitations to reflective practice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Samantha |title=Embracing reflective practice |journal=Education for Primary Care |date=January 2012 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=9–12 |pmid=22306139 |doi=10.1080/14739879.2012.11494064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits to reflective practice include:
* Increased learning from an experience or situation
* Promotion of deep learning
* Identification of personal and professional strengths and areas for improvement
* Identification of educational needs
* Acquisition of new knowledge and skills
* Further understanding of own beliefs, attitudes and values
* Encouragement of self-motivation and self-directed learning
* Could act as a source of feedback
* Possible improvements of personal and clinical confidence

Limitations to reflective practice include:
* Not all practitioners may understand the reflective process
* May feel uncomfortable challenging and evaluating own practice
* Could be time consuming
* May have confusion as to which situations/experiences to reflect upon
* May not be adequate to resolve clinical problems&lt;ref name="Price 2004"/&gt;

===Environmental management and sustainability===
The use of reflective practice in [[environmental management]], combined with [[system monitoring]], is often called ''[[adaptive management]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salafsky |first1=Nick Redford |last2=Margoluis |first2=Richard |last3=Redford |first3=Kent Hubbard |date=2001 |title=Adaptive management: a tool for conservation practitioners |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Biodiversity Support Program |oclc=48381963 |url=http://www.fosonline.org/resource/am-tool}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some criticism that traditional environmental management, which simply focuses on the problem at hand, fails to integrate into the decision making the wider systems within which an environment is situated.&lt;ref name="Bryant 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=Raymond L. |last2=Wilson |first2=Geo A. |title=Rethinking environmental management |journal=[[Progress in Human Geography]] |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=321–343 |date=June 1998 |doi=10.1191/030913298672031592}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While research and science must inform the process of environmental management, it is up to the practitioner to integrate those results within these wider systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fazey |first1=Ioan |last2=Fazey |first2=John A. |last3=Salisbury |first3=Janet G. |last4=Lindenmayer |first4=David B. |last5=Dovers |first5=Steve |title=The nature and role of experiential knowledge for environmental conservation |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=33 |pages=1 |year=2006 |doi=10.1017/S037689290600275X |url=http://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/1629/1/Fazey2006EnvironmentalConservation33ExperientialKnowledge.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to deal with this and to reaffirm the utility of environmental management, Bryant and Wilson propose that a "more reflective approach is required that seeks to rethink the basic premises of environmental management as a process".&lt;ref name="Bryant 1998"/&gt; This style of approach has been found to be successful in [[sustainable development]] projects where participants appreciated and enjoyed the educational aspect of utilising reflective practice throughout. However, the authors noted the challenges with melding the "circularity" of reflective practice theory with the "doing" of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Simon |last2=Morse |first2=Stephen |title=Delivering sustainability therapy in sustainable development projects |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=37–51 |year=2005 |pmid=15748802 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.11.006 |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/120/1/Deliv._Sus_Bell__Morse_JEM051.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership positions===
Reflective practice provides a development opportunity for those in leadership positions. Managing a team of people requires a delicate balance between people skills and technical expertise, and success in this type of role does not come easily. Reflective practice provides leaders with an opportunity to critically review what has been successful in the past and where improvement can be made.

Reflective learning organizations have invested in [[coaching]] programs for their emerging and established leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Avolio |first1=Bruce J. |last2=Avey |first2=James B. |last3=Quisenberry |first3=David |date=August 2010 |title=Estimating return on leadership development investment |journal=The Leadership Quarterly |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=633–644 |doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.06.006 |url=http://uwtv.org/files/2013/01/roldleaqua650.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders frequently engage in self-limiting behaviours because of their over-reliance on their preferred ways of reacting and responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turesky |first1=Elizabeth Fisher |last2=Gallagher |first2=Dennis |title=Know thyself: coaching for leadership using Kolb's experiential learning theory |journal=The Coaching Psychologist |date=June 2011 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |url=http://people.usm.maine.edu/eturesky/Articles/KnowThyself.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaching can help support the establishment of new behaviours, as it encourages reflection, critical thinking and transformative learning. Adults have acquired a body of experience throughout their life, as well as habits of mind that define their world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mezirow |first=Jack |authorlink=Jack Mezirow |title=Transformative learning: theory to practice |journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education |date=Summer 1997 |volume=74 |pages=5–12 |doi=10.1002/ace.7401 |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ntzcl1/literature/elearning/mezirow.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaching programs support the process of questioning and potentially rebuilding these pre-determined habits of mind. The goal is for leaders to maximize their professional potential, and in order to do this, there must be a process of critical reflection on current assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helsing |first1=Deborah |last2=Howell |first2=Annie |last3=Kegan |first3=Robert |authorlink3=Robert Kegan |last4=Lahey |first4=Lisa Laskow |title=Putting the 'development' in professional development: understanding and overturning educational leaders' immunities to change |date=Fall 2008 |journal=[[Harvard Educational Review]] |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=437–465 |url=http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/cms/lib07/MA01906464/Centricity/Domain/142/Kegan%20-%20Putting%20the%20Professional%20Development%20in%20PD.pdf |ref=harv |doi=10.17763/haer.78.3.888l759g1qm54660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other professions===
Reflective practice can help any individual to develop personally, and is useful for professions other than those discussed above. It allows professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge and consider new ways to interact with their colleagues. David Somerville and June Keeling suggested eight simple ways that professionals can practice more reflectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Somerville |first1=David |last2=Keeling |first2=June |title=A practical approach to promote reflective practice within nursing |journal=[[Nursing Times]] |volume=100 |issue=12 |pages=42–45 |date=24 March 2004 |pmid=15067912 |url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/specialisms/educators/a-practical-approach-to-promote-reflective-practice-within-nursing/204502.article}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Seek feedback: Ask "Can you give me some feedback on what I did?"
# Ask yourself "What have I learnt today?" and ask others "What have you learnt today?"
# Value personal strengths: Identify positive accomplishments and areas for growth
# View experiences objectively: Imagine the situation is on stage and you are in the audience
# Empathize: Say out loud what you imagine the other person is experiencing
# Keep a journal: Record your thoughts, feelings and future plans; look for emerging patterns
# Plan for the future: Plan changes in behavior based on the patterns you identified
# Create your own future: Combine the virtues of the dreamer, the realist, and the critic

==Biography==
Haviv was born in [[Nachshonim]], [[Israel]], where he spent his early life. He studied at the Telma Yelin art high school in [[Givataim]]. In 1996, Haviv moved to New York. He studied graphic design at [[The Cooper Union]] School of Art where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts.

Haviv began his design career when he joined [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar]] in 2003. There he created "Logomotion",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svOrt6w55P4 Logomotion]&lt;/ref&gt; an award-winning ten-minute motion graphics tribute to the firm’s famous trademarks which was widely exhibited, appearing in New York at [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] (2003), in [[Washington, D.C.]] (2004), the Ginza Graphic Gallery in Tokyo (2005), Centro in Mexico City (2006), and the [[Pera Museum]] Istanbul (2007).

In 2006 he became a partner at Chermayeff &amp; Geismar,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100726163603/http://www.gdusa.com/issue_2009/01_jan/ptw/p19.php|title=Sagi Haviv {{!}} January 2009 Issue {{!}} Graphic Design USA|date=2010-07-26|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he has since developed institutional and corporate identities, print and motion graphics and art in architecture for a diverse array of clients worldwide. Haviv’s motion graphics work includes the main titles for the [[PBS]] documentary series ''[[Carrier (documentary)|Carrier]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/weta/carrier/the_film_credits.htm PBS Credits for Carrier]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2010 PBS documentary series ''Circus'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/opb/circus/about/credits/ PBS Credits for Circus]&lt;/ref&gt; and a typographic animation for the centerpiece performance at [[Alicia Keys]]’s Black Ball, 2009 for [[Keep A Child Alive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printmag.com/Article/Great-Balls-of-Video/ Print Magazine on Haviv's video for Alicia Keys]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 he co-authored with his partners, [[Tom Geismar]] and [[Ivan Chermayeff]] the book ''Identify: Basic Principles of Identity Design in the Iconic Trademarks of Chermayeff &amp; Geismar''. The book was published by [[Print (magazine)|Print magazine]]'s book imprint, ({{ISBN|978-1440310324}}).

In 2013 Haviv's name was added to the masthead of the 56 year old firm Chermayeff &amp; Geismar and it became known as Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv.&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/business/media/news-from-the-advertising-industry.html?_r=0 New York Times announcement that Sagi Haviv's name was added to Chermayeff &amp; Geismar's masthead]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sal Tarbut Strauss encompasses five areas of Arts and Culture: 
*Drama 
*Dance 
*Music
*Visual Arts
*Media Arts and Crafts

Sal Tarbut Strauss has provided cultural enrichment to children since 1987, reaching over three million students, and exposing them to different aspects of music, theater and the visual arts than they would normally encounter.
Most of these programs were approved and recommended by the Ministry of Education, and conformed to their official curriculum.
Sal Tarbut Strauss has independently produced many educational theater shows, working together with the none-profit organization A.V.I.(The Organization for Israeli Stage Arts).

==History==

Sal Tarbut Strauss began operating in 1987 in [[Jerusalem]], and moved to [[Tel Aviv]] around 1990.

In its early years, Sal Tarbut Strauss put an emphasis on introducing students to aspects of American 20th century music that were relatively unfamiliar in Israeli culture.

These include traditional and modern day [[Blues]], [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]], [[Folk music|Folk]], [[Jazz]], and early [[Rock and Roll]].
Sal Tarbut Strauss has supplied and supported thousands of shows notably thru Strauss Mifaley Tarbut Ltd. Omanut Laam, Sal Tarbut Artzi, Keren Karev, Israeli Ministry of Education, and various other organizations.

The program works all over Israel and reaches the many cities and places where the Israeli Ministry program of artistic and cultural enrichment, run by the Matnasim company Sal Tarbut Artzi does not function.

==Goals==
*Introduction to Art
*To present artistic cultural concepts/values to children and teenagers.
*To present the main genres and styles in Art.
*To present the tools used in art – musical instruments, props, masks and puppets used in theater, basic materials in  plastic arts, cameras in photography and cinema, etc.
*Introduction to the tools of art criticism and analysis, aesthetics and forming personal tastes.
*Introduction to classic works and the great artists in history and their works.
*Workshops and activities that bring children and teenagers together with professionals at the top of their field.

==Culture==
*Getting to know your own cultural identity, getting to know other cultural identities.
*Pluralism in art – art is not a barrier between cultures, but a dialogue between cultures that can bring people from different cultures together.

==Artistic and cultural enrichment==

*Creating challenges such as abstract thought, developing the imagination, analytic thought, creativity, etc.
*Utilizing art to trigger thinking about societal issues, [[ecology]], environmental issues, violence, [[the Holocaust]], cultural roots, personal commitment, [[Hygiene#Personal hygiene|personal hygiene]], etc.
*Utilizing art to trigger thinking about science, the [[water cycle]] in nature, illusions of movement, persistence of vision, fluid mechanics (e.g. communicating vessels), basic properties of materials (hardness, elasticity, flexibility, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12217">'''School organizational models''' are methods of structuring the [[curriculum]], functions, and facilities for [[school]]s, [[college]]s, and [[universities]].  The organizing of teaching and learning has been structured since the first educational institutions were established.  With greater specialization and expertise in a particular field of knowledge, and a gathering of like-minded individuals, instructors clustered into specialized groups, schools, and eventually departments within larger institutions. This structure spread rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries with [[factory model school]]s and their "assembly-line" method of standardized curriculum and instructional methods.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/opinion/schools-for-wisdom.html?_r=0 ''Schools for wisdom'', David Brooks, NY Times, October 16, 2015].  Retrieved 2016-03-26&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning with the [[progressive education]]al movement in the early-mid 20th century, and again with similar trends in the late 20th and early 21st century, alternative models structured towards deeper learning, higher retention, and [[21st century skills]] developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cea-ace.ca/education-canada/article/liberated-spaces-purposeful-school-design-says-goodbye-cells-and-bells ''Liberated Spaces: Purposeful School Design Says Goodbye to Cells and Bells'',  Jennifer Lewington, in Education Canada].  Retrieved 2016-03-26&lt;/ref&gt;  The organizational models of schools fall into several main categories, including: departmental, integrative, project-based, academy, small learning communities, and school-within-a-school.

==Departmental model==
The '''departmental model''' is an organization where the departments and faculties of different academic subjects are separate and distinct. Each department (e.g. Math, Humanities, Science) may also have its own head (or manager or dean) that is responsible for different aspects of the department.  Educators in that department may report to that head who in turn reports to a higher level administration, such as a school or college in a university, or directly to the main administration, such as the principal or head of a school.  Educational institutions using the departmental model often provide [[traditional education]]. This is a traditional form of organization with an emphasis on [[factory model school|traditional classroom forms and organizations]] that has been the dominant organizing model of [[high schools|high or secondary schools]], colleges, and universities since the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED391257 ERIC: The Subjects in Question: ''Departmental Organization and the High School. The Series on School Reform.''] Abstract, 1995.  Siskin, Leslie Santee, Ed.; Little, Judith Warren, Ed.  Teachers College Press, Columbia University.  {{ISBN|0-8077-3454-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/how-to-break-free-of-our-19th-century-factory-model-education-system/256881/ ''How to Break Free of Our 19th-Century Factory-Model Education System'',  Joel Rose, The Atlantic, May 9, 2012].  Retrieved 2016-03-26&lt;/ref&gt;  This is reflected in the design of educational facilities with separate faculty buildings on a campus, or in a wing or cluster of standard classrooms or laboratories in a high school (e.g. science labs, vocational shops).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designshare.com/index.php/design-patterns/traditional-classroom Design Patterns:  Traditional Classroom, DesignShare].  Retrieved 2016-04-07&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://visionnationals.org/masters-school-building-floor-plan-2/ Master's School Building - traditional plan school]

==Integrative model==
{{Main|Integrative learning}}
The '''integrative model''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] organization that combines, rather than separates, academic subjects, faculties, and disciplines.  A departmental structure may be in place for each field or discipline, but the physical organization of the educational facilities may place different subject-based classrooms or labs in groupings, such as in a defined area, wing, or small learning community.  For example, each grouping may contain co-located classrooms with different instructors focusing on math, English, and Social Sciences near to a [[Science lab]], [[Makerspace]], or [[Vocational education|Vocational shop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/integrated-studies-history ''Integrated Studies:  A Short History,'' Edutopia, December 6, 2011].  Retrieved 2016-04-07&lt;/ref&gt;  Support spaces for instructors, such as offices or workrooms, and for students, such as seminar rooms and common workspaces, may also be located directly adjacent or nearby.  
*[http://www.designshare.com/images/chap6_designing_new_learning_environments.pdf Integrative model diagram, DesignShare P.131].

==Project based learning model==
{{Main|Project-based learning}}
The '''project-based learning model''' is a model that supports students "learning by doing."  It may or not be fully interdisciplinary in its organization of subjects. Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom-based instruction, students often must organize their own work and manage their own time in a project-based class, with an emphasis on student collaboration and hands-on work.  It involves independent research, real-world experiences, opportunities and requirements for students to present and defend their learning, to practice and rehearse. Student projects are at the core of their learning.  This is reflected in the design of educational facilities appearing similar to the integrative model, but with a de-emphasis on traditional instructional spaces such as classrooms and labs, and a greater emphasis on student collaboration spaces and workspaces, such as individual study and group seminar rooms, and workspaces such as Makerspaces and rooms with 2D or [[3D printing]] and production.  The design is student-centered, meaning it is to support the project work, not primarily the convenience of the teachers (e.g. classrooms).  A noted example of this model is [[Gary and Jerri-Ann Jacobs High Tech High Charter School|High Tech High]].  
*[http://www.designshare.com/images/chap6_designing_new_learning_environments.pdf Project-based learning model:  plan diagram, P. 139 and P. 141]

==Academy model==
The '''Academy model''' is an organization that includes specific themes or grades-based organizational groupings within a single institution.  These are sometimes referred to as "Career Academies" or "Career Pathways". The school may be organized along largely departmental or integrated models, with specially courses geared towards the theme or focus of each academy provided within each academy and the students be enrolled and following their academy's prescribed course of study as they take courses in different departments.  Alternatively, the school may be organized with each academy providing its own core and specialty themed courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/stw-career-technical-education-academy-model ''Academies:  School Within a School,'' Kathy Baron, Etutopia, September 27, 2010].  Retrieved 2016-04-07&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be reflected in the design of educational facilities in several ways: a departmental-type configuration with specialty spaces located in separate areas, or along a single common area with each academy's themed spaces adjacent and observables by students in other academies; or in a similar manner to a SLC or school-within-a-school, with each academy co-located with their specialty space.  For example, a justice-themed academy may have a fully functioning country courtroom off of the commons, such as along the "Main Street" in the [[Jack E. Singley Academy]].  In England, [[Academy (English school)|''Academy'']] normally refers to an entire institution offering a distinct program or theme, not a separate division within.

==Small learning communities model==
{{Main|Small Learning Communities}}
The '''Small Learning Community (SLC) model''' is an organization geared towards providing a more [[personalized learning]] environment. A cohort of students and instructors may stay within a given SLC from grade to grade. Teachers in the SLC usually have common planning time to foster collaboration, development of interdisciplinary projects, and to track progress of individual students across subjects.  These include several types, including:  Theme-Based SLCs or Focus Schools, usually formed around a specific curricular theme, such as "Success Academy" or "Humanities"; grade-based SLCs or Houses, such as Freshman Academies which are structured to support students transitioning into higher-level schools; Career Academies, developed around a career theme or [[Career Clusters]]; Magnet Schools, career-themed SLCs that include accelerated course-work for Gifted &amp; Talented students.  This is reflected in the design of educational facilities with SLCs designed into separate clusters or groupings, often with a central common or flexible learning area at its heart of the cluster, with a variety of learning and group meeting rooms opening onto it, including several classrooms or learning studios, a science lab, and potentially a makerspace or vocational shop.  A school would have multiple SLCs, often with between 100 and 200 students.&lt;ref name="AFA"&gt;''Architecture for Achievement - building patterns of small school learning'', Victoria Bergsagel, Tim Best, Kathleen Cushman, Lorne McConachie, Wendy Sauer, David Stephen.

==School-within-a-school model==
The '''school-within-a-school model''' is similar to the Small Learning Communities model of personalization for both students and schools, but with additional administrative and support functions located within each school or "community".  Each school has both multiple disciplines as well as separate administrators, either fully stand-alone or as subordinate to a whole-school administration or principal. This is reflected in the design of educational facilities with a larger school building, or a campus, with separate identities, entries, and often names for each small school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpsd.ca/pdfs/Synopsis-School_within_School.pdf ''Synopsis - School within a school,'' Mission Public Schools].

Retrieved 2016-04-07&lt;/ref&gt;   An example of this model is the [[Marysville Getchell High School|Marysville Getchell Campus]] with separate buildings for each of the three small schools as well as a common a shared facility for the physicals.education, cafeteria, and services functions not as easily supported by smaller schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationdesignshowcase.com/view.esiml?pid=342 ''Marysville Getchell High School Campus,'' Education Design Showcase, 2015].

'''Student teams-achievement divisions''' (STAD) is a [[Cooperative learning]] strategy in which small groups of learners with different levels of ability work together to accomplish a shared learning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Team Achievement Division|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/pages/4770|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was devised by [[Robert Slavin]] and his associates at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

STAD is considered as one of the most researched, simplest and straightforward of all the cooperative learning. It was established based on the fulfillment of instructional pedagogy. It is used in meeting well-defined instructional objectives. It is a learning strategy in which there are small group of learners with different levels of abilities, wherein they all come together to accomplish a shared learning goal.&lt;ref&gt;[[student/team/achievement-division]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2015}}

==Working of STAD==

The students are placed in small groups or teams. The class in its entirety is presented with a lesson and students are subsequently tested. Individuals are graded on the team's performance . Although the tests are taken individually, students are encouraged to work together to improve the overall performance of the group. It is basically a team work, but students are graded individually according to their contribution that they make towards their team. Usually in STAD students are assigned 4 to 5 members in a group that are mixed in performance level, gender and ethnicity. The teacher teaches a lesson to the students and they then work in teams and ensure that they have mastered the lesson. Then finally students take individual quizzes on the material, at which they may not help each other. Then their scores are compared to their own past averages and points are awarded on the basis of the degree to which students meet or exceed their own earlier performance. It encourages the students to take up responsibility for other members in their group as well as themselves.Thus in this way it is guaranteed that all group members with different levels are equally motivated to do their best. 
&lt;ref&gt;[[student/team/achievement-division]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2015}}

Slavin (1995) enumerated three main concepts of STAD as team rewards, individual accountability and for equal opportunities for success . Team rewards are certificates or either rewards which are given if a STAD group achieves higher than predetermined level . In this way a spirit of positive competition is reinforced and all or none of the groups would be rewarded based on how they score. In terms of individual accountability, the individual learning of each of the group members determines the success of the terms.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ojs.academypublisher.com/index.php/tpls/article/viewfile/tpls020919711975/5409&lt;/ref&gt;

STAD has been used in a wide variety of subjects from mathematics to language, arts to social science and used from 2nd grade in schools through college. It is the most appropriate for teaching well defined objectives by incorporating more open-ended assessments, such as essays or performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.innovativelearning.com/educational.../cooperative-learning.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

In STAD, students are assigned to 4 or 5-member heterogeneous groups. Once these assignments are made, a four-step cycle is initiated: (i) teach, (ii) team study, (iii) test and (iv) recognition.

== Teach ==
In the teaching stage, the teacher presents materials usually in a lecture-discussion format. Students should be told what it is they are going to learn and why it is important.

== Team study ==
In the team study stage, group members work cooperatively with teacher-provided worksheets and answer sheets.

== Test ==
In the testing stage, each student individually takes a quiz. The teacher grades the quiz and notes the current scores as well as the improvement over previous quizzes.

== Recognition ==
Each team receives recognition awards depending on the average scores of each team. For example, teams that average 15 to 19 improvement points receive a GOOD TEAM certificate, teams that average 20 to 24 improvement points receive a GREAT TEAM certificate, and teams that average 25 to 30 improvement points receive a SUPER TEAM certificate.&lt;ref&gt;http://college.cengage.com/education/pbl/tc/coop.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of STAD==

    Quizzes
    Individual improvement score
    Team recognition 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/emmmie/the-effectiveness-of-STAD&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

    Group has greater information resources than individuals do
    Group has to employ a greater number of creative problem-solving methods
    Group members gain a better understanding of themselves as they interact with each other.
    Working in a group foster learning and comprehension of idea discussed. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/emmmie/the-effectiveness-of-STAD&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

    An individual group member may dominate the discussion.
    Some group members may rely too much on others to get the job done.
    Group members may [[groupthink|pressure others to conform to the majority opinion]].

'''''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching''''' ('''''SMART''''') is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Wichita State University]] covering both theoretical and practical aspects of teaching on the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]]. The journal publishes articles on scholarly and [[pedagogical]] topics. The [[editor-in-chief]] is Kristie Bixby (Wichita State University) and the journal adheres to the guidelines in ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''.

== History ==
The journal began as ''Ralph—A Newspaper for Undergraduate Teaching: Medieval and Renaissance Humanities'', first published in 1974 at [[Kent State University]], with Joanne Kantrowitz credited as the founding editor. ''Ralph'' moved to [[Central Missouri State University]] in 1977, and was edited by Robert Kindrick and Robert Graybill; Kindrick was to remain with the journal for decades, until his death in 2004. The name was changed to ''SMART'' in 1982. While until then it was published in newspaper format, in 1982 it changed to journal format, and came out three times a year. Between 1980 and 1990 the journal also published four volumes of selected papers under the title ''Teaching the Middle Ages''; these papers were culled from four different "Teaching the Middle Ages Conferences".

In 1990, ''SMART'' moved again, this time to [[Indiana State University]], and began to publish twice a year, with a new numbering (New Series). From 1993 to 1997 the journal was on hiatus, resuming publication at the [[University of Montana]], and in 2002 moved (with Robert Kindrick) to [[Wichita State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=SMART&amp;p=/historySMART/ |title=Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching: History of SMART |year=2013 |publisher=[[Wichita State University]] |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">A '''train-and-equip program''' is a military operation in which one country provides [[Military education and training|training]] and [[Military technology|equipment]] to an [[Allies|ally]]. The practice typically involves the transfer of expertise and materiel from a stronger military to a weaker one, as an alternative to fighting together outright. The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has run several train-and-equip programs in recent [[military history]].
__NOTOC__
==Bosnia==
During the [[Bosnian War]], American president [[Bill Clinton]] and Bosnian president [[Alija Izetbegović]] agreed to a train-and-equip program for Bosnia, valued at an estimated $500 million [[United States Dollar|USD]]. American diplomat [[James W. Pardew]] oversaw the implementation of the plan. The Bosnian Train and Equip Program was carried out in a multi-agency effort over the course of two years and led to a reduction of military tensions between warring factions in the country and removed foreign extremist influence from the political process.It is widely considered a success in securing the peace in Bosnia and allowing the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] partners to responsibly extract themselves from the conflict. &lt;ref&gt;The Bosnian Train and Equip Program: A Lesson in Interagency Integration of Hard and Soft Power

From 2002 to 2004, the American military spent {{US$|64 million}} training the [[Georgian Armed Forces]] for service in the [[Global War on Terror]]. The [[British Army]] also helped train and equip Georgian forces. Georgia would go on to fight with the [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|coalition forces]] in the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=HELPING-GEORGIA&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3746">'''Universities Central Council on Admissions''' ('''UCCA''') provided a clearing house for university applications in the [[United Kingdom]] from its formation in 1961 until its merger with [[Polytechnics Central Admissions System|PCAS]] (Polytechnics Central Admissions System) to form [[UCAS]] in 1993. 

== History ==
UCCA was created in response to concerns during the 1950s that the increase in University applications was unmanageable using the systems then in place, where each student applied individually to as many institutions as they chose. This concern led to the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals ([[CVCP]]) setting up an ad hoc committee in 1957 to review the matter; this committee in its Third Report of January 1961 recommended the setting up of a central agency, which subsequently became known as UCCA. Its First and Second Reports had already made a number of recommendations aimed at harmonising admissions procedures across different universities.

The name UCCA referred originally to the management board (the Central Council) overseeing the new process, but soon came to refer to the organisation responsible for its day-to-day operation. This was based initially in London, and moved to [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]] in 1968  . The new scheme had a pilot year handling a subset of applications for entry in 1963, and its first full year of operation handled admissions for 1964.

The scheme was essentially a collaborative venture between independent universities, and membership was voluntary. Most English universities joined from the start. Oxford and Cambridge joined (with slightly modified procedures) for the 1966 entry; the London medical and dental schools, as well as Belfast and Stirling for 1967. By 1968 the office was handling 592,000 applications from 110,400 candidates to 80 institutions.

Initially, processing of applications was carried out using [[punched card]] technology. In 1964, UCCA started using the services of a [[computer bureau]] with a [[Univac]] machine; in 1967 it installed its own [[Univac]] computer.

=== Applications process ===
The actual application process remained largely unchanged during the life of the organisation, except for minor details. Candidates submitted a single application listing six (later five) universities. Copies of the application were sent to these universities (unlike UCCA's modern counterpart, [[UCAS]]), which could make various kinds of offer: unconditional, or conditional on grades achieved in the subsequent [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] examinations. Students could hold a maximum of two of these offers, a first choice, plus a reserve choice held in case they failed to achieve the grades asked by their first choice (if they received an unconditional or a pass-level offer from the university listed first on their application, no reserve could be held). In August, when the exam results were published, students who achieved their required grades (or who fell short of them, if the University had enough places available) would receive confirmation of their offer. Those who failed to receive a confirmed offer could apply for ''Clearing'', a process that matched the remaining unplaced candidates to the remaining unfilled places.
