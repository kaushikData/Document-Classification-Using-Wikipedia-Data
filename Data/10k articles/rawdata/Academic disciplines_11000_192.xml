'''Acceleration''' in human development process is the phenomenon which has been registered in many populations around the world. This applies equally to the growth of certain anthropometric parameters and the speed of reaching sexual maturity.

Increases in human stature are a main indicator of improvements in the average health of populations. The newest data set for the average height of adult male birth cohorts, from the mid-nineteenth century to 1980, in 15 European countries was studied (in the populations listed). 

During a century average height increased by 11 cm representing a dramatic improvement of this phenomenon. The apparent acceleration of body height occurred during the Ĝ.{{clarify|What is Ĝ?|date=September 2018}

'''Ahl al-Hadith''' ({{lang-ar|أهل الحديث}}, "The people of [[hadith]]"; also ''Așḥāb al-ḥadīṯ''; {{lang|ar|أصحاب الحديث}}, "The adherents of [[hadith]]") first emerged in the 2nd/ 3rd Islamic centuries as a movement of [[hadith]] scholars who considered the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only authority in matters of law and creed.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ahl al-Hadith|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-72|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents are also known as '''traditionalists''' and '''traditionists''' (from "tradition" as a translation of the word ''hadith'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hodgson|2009|page=1589 (Kindle location)}}; {{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and general characteristics ==

The Ahl al-Hadith movement emerged toward the end of the eighth century CE among scholars of hadith who held the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only acceptable sources of law and creed.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first these scholars formed minorities within existing religious study circles, but by the early ninth century they coalesced into a separate movement under the leadership of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In legal matters, these scholars criticized the use of personal opinion (''ra'y'') common among the [[Hanafi]] jurists of Iraq as well as the reliance on living local traditions by [[Malikite]] jurists of [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; They also rejected the use of ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction) and other methods of jurisprudence not based on literal reading of scripture.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In matters of faith, they were pitted against [[Mu'tazilite]]s and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; Ahl al-Hadith were also characterized by their avoidance of all state patronage and by their social activism.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; They attempted to follow the injunction of "[[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|commanding good and forbidding evil]]" by preaching asceticism and launching vigilante attacks to break wine bottles, musical instruments and chessboards.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt;

== Convergence of legal schools ==
{{further|Fiqh|Madhhab}}

The next two centuries witnessed a broad convergence of legal methodologies which gave rise to the classical theory of Sunni jurisprudence (''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|uṣūl al-fiqh]]''). Hanafi and Maliki jurists gradually came to accept the primacy of the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement, restricting the use of other forms of legal reasoning to interpretation of these scriptures.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; This "traditionalizing" of legal reasoning is exemplified in the work of [[Malik ibn Anas|Malik]]'s student [[Al-Shafi‘i]], which laid the foundation of the [[Shafi'i]] legal school.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; In turn, Hanbali jurists, who led the traditionalist movement and initially opposed the use of qiyas, gradually came to accept it as long as its application was strictly founded on scriptural sources.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt;

== Creed ==
{{main|Traditionalist Theology (Islam)}}

Ahl al-Hadith believed that the ''[[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]]'' (literal, apparent) meaning of the Qur'an and the hadith have sole authority in matters of faith and that the use of rational disputation is forbidden even if it verifies the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, accepting them without asking "how" (''[[bi-la kaifa]]''), and asserted that their realities should be consigned to God alone (''[[tafwid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=36-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that every part of the Qur'an is uncreated (''ghayr makhluq'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agwan|first1=A. R.|last2=Singh|first2=N. K.|title=Encyclopedia of the Holy Qur'an|date=2000|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|isbn=8187746009|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Melchert, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Oneworld Publ., 2006, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; Ahl al-Hadith also held that ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' (faith) increases and decreases in correlation with the performance of prescribed rituals and duties, such as the five daily prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Mason, Humaniora Islamica, Volume 1, p 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theological controversies ==
{{Salafi}}
{{main|Traditionalist Theology (Islam)}}

In 833 the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] tried to impose Mu'tazilite theology on all religious scholars and instituted an inquisition (''[[mihna]]'') which required them to accept the Mu'tazilite doctrine that the Qur'an was a created object, which implicitly made is subject to interpretation by caliphs and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=49}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hanbal led traditionalist resistance to this policy, affirming under torture that the Quran was uncreated and hence coeternal with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|pages=49, 51}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mu'tazilism remained state doctrine until 851, the efforts to impose it only served to politicize and harden the theological controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy persisted until [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] (874-936) found a middle ground between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, using the rationalistic methods championed by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rival compromise between rationalism and traditionalism emerged  from the work of [[al-Maturidi]] (d. c. 944), and one of these two schools of theology was accepted by members of all Sunni [[madhhab]]s, with the exception of most Hanbalite and some Shafi'i scholars, who ostensibly persisted in their rejection of kalam, although they often resorted to rationalistic arguments themselves, even while claiming to rely on the literal text of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the scholars who rejected the [[Ash'ari]]/[[Maturidi]] synthesis were in the minority, their emotive, narrative-based approach to faith remained influential among the urban masses in some areas, particularly in Abbasid Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berkey|2003|page=2081–2091 (Kindle locations)}}; {{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ash'arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni "orthodoxy", traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith.&lt;ref name="Brown 2009 page=180"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brown|2009|page=180}}: "The Ash‘ari school of theology is often called the Sunni ‘orthodoxy.’ But the original ahl al-hadith, early Sunni creed from which Ash‘arism evolved has continued to thrive alongside it as a rival Sunni ‘orthodoxy’ as well."&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era it has had a disproportionate impact on Islamic theology, having been appropriated by [[Wahhabi]] and other traditionalist [[Salafi]] currents and spread well beyond the confines of the Hanbali school of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hoover|2014|page=625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such signing may be considered complex enough to be called a form of language if the inventory of signs is large, the signs are relatively arbitrary, and the animals seem to produce them with a degree of volition (as opposed to relatively automatic conditioned behaviors or unconditioned instincts, usually including facial expressions). In experimental tests, animal communication may also be evidenced through the use of [[lexigram]]s (as used by [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s). While the term "animal language" is widely used, researchers agree that animal languages are not as complex or expressive as human language.

Many researchers argue that animal communication lacks a key aspect of human language, that is, the creation of new patterns of signs under varied circumstances. (In contrast, for example, humans routinely produce entirely new combinations of words.) Some researchers, including the linguist [[Charles F. Hockett|Charles Hockett]], argue that human language and animal communication differ so much that the underlying principles are unrelated.&lt;ref name="Hockett 1960"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hockett, Charles F.|year=1960|chapter=Logical considerations in the study of animal communication|title=Animals sounds and animal communication|editor1-first=W.E.|editor1-last=Lanyon|editor2-first=W.N.|editor2-last=Tavolga|pages=392–430|publisher=American Institute of Biological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, linguist [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] has proposed to not use the term "language" for animal sign systems.&lt;ref name="Martinelli 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinelli|first1=Dario|title=Introduction to Zoosemiotics|volume=5|year=2010|pages=1–64|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-9249-6_1|journal=Biosemiotics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Hauser]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[W.

We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB)and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations). |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of human language==
[[File:Claudine andre.jpg|thumb|250px|Human and chimp, in this case [[Claudine André]] with a [[bonobo]].]]

The following properties of human language have been argued to separate it from animal communication:&lt;ref name=denham&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9781428205833|title=Linguistics for Everyone: An Introduction|author1=Denham, Kristin|author2=Lobeck, Anne|edition=Instructor's|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|year=2010|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Arbitrariness]]''': there is usually no rational relationship between a sound or sign and its meaning.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = Unity and diversity in human language. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 366 | issue = 1563 | pages = 376–88 |date=Feb 2011 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2010.0223 | pmid = 21199842 |pmc = 3013471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is nothing intrinsically house-like about the word "house".
*'''Discreteness:''' language is composed of small, repeatable parts (discrete units) that are used in combination to create meaning.
*'''[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]:''' languages can be used to communicate ideas about things that are not in the immediate vicinity either spatially or temporally.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt;
*'''[[Duality of patterning]]:''' the smallest meaningful units (words, morphemes) consist of sequences of units without meaning.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt; This is also referred to as '''double articulation'''.
*'''[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]:''' users can understand and create an indefinitely large number of utterances.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt;
*'''[[Semanticity]]''': specific signals have specific meanings.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt;

In the wild, [[chimpanzee]]s have been seen "talking" to each other when warning about approaching danger. For example, if one chimpanzee sees a snake, he makes a low, rumbling noise, signaling for all the other chimps to climb into nearby trees. In this case, the chimpanzees' communication does not indicate displacement, as it is entirely contained to an observable event.

Arbitrariness has been noted in [[meerkat]] calls; [[Waggle dance|bee dance]]s demonstrate elements of spatial displacement; and cultural transmission has possibly occurred between the celebrated [[bonobo]]s [[Kanzi]] and [[Panbanisha]].&lt;ref name = Smithsonain&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/10022981.html | accessdate = 2008-03-18 | date = November 2006 | publisher = [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Simithsonian]] | title = Speaking Bonobo | last = Raffaele | first = P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language may not be completely "arbitrary." Research has shown that almost all humans naturally demonstrate limited [[Crossmodal|crossmodal perception]] (e.g.&amp;nbsp;[[synesthesia]]) and [[multisensory integration]], as illustrated by the [[Bouba/kiki effect|Kiki and Booba]] study.&lt;ref name="Maurer 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Maurer | first1 = D. | last2 = Pathman | first2 = T. | last3 = Mondloch | first3 = CJ. | title = The shape of boubas: sound-shape correspondences in toddlers and adults. | journal = Dev Sci | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–22 |date=May 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00495.x | pmid = 16669803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kubovy 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kubovy | first1 = M. | last2 = Yu | first2 = M. | title = Multistability, cross-modal binding and the additivity of conjoined grouping principles. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 367 | issue = 1591 | pages = 954–64 |date=Apr 2012 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2011.0365 | pmid = 22371617| pmc = 3282311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent research has tried to explain how the structure of human language emerged, comparing two different aspects of hierarchical structure present in animal communication and proposing that human language arose out of these two separate systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miyagawa|first=Shigeru|title=The emergence of hierarchical structure in human language|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/Language_Sciences/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00071/full|work=Frontiers in Language Sciences|accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims that animals have language skills akin to humans however, are extremely controversial. As Steven Pinker illustrates in his book ''The Language Instinct'', claims that chimpanzees can acquire language are exaggerated and rest on very limited or specious data.&lt;ref name="Pinker 2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | title = The language instinct : how the mind creates language | publisher = Perennial Classics | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780060958336 | oclc = 45992871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American linguist Charles Hockett theorized that there are sixteen features of human language that distinguished human communication from that of animals. He called these the [[design features of language]]. The features mentioned below have so far been found in all spoken human languages and at least one is missing from all other animal communication systems.
* Vocal-auditory channel: sounds emitted from the mouth and perceived by the auditory system.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt; This applies to many animal communication systems, but there are many exceptions. Ex. An alternative to vocal-auditory communication is visual communication. An example is cobras extending the ribs behind their heads to send the message of intimidation or of feeling threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cobra Master |url=http://www.cobras.org/cob_1.htm |title=Introduction |publisher=Cobras.org |date=2003-12-12 |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, [[sign languages]] provide many examples of fully formed languages that use a visual channel.
* Broadcast transmission and directional reception:&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt; this requires that the recipient can tell the direction that the signal comes from and thus the originator of the signal.
* Rapid fading (transitory nature): Signal lasts a short time.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt; This is true of all systems involving sound. It does not take into account audio recording technology and is also not true for written language. It tends not to apply to animal signals involving chemicals and smells which often fade slowly. For example, a skunk's smell, produced in its glands, lingers to deter a predator from attacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/skunk/ |title=Skunks, Skunk Pictures, Skunk Facts – National Geographic |publisher=Animals.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interchangeability: All utterances that are understood can be produced.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt; This is different from some communication systems where, for example, males produce one set of behaviours and females another and they are unable to interchange these messages so that males use the female signal and vice versa. For example, Heliothine moths have differentiated communication: females are able to send a chemical to indicate preparedness to mate, while males cannot send the chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00206989?LI=true |title=Chemical communication in heliothine moths|date=1991-09-01 |accessdate=2013-05-19 |doi=10.1007/BF00206989 |volume=169 |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Total feedback: The sender of a message is aware of the message being sent.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt;
* Specialization: The signal produced is intended for communication and is not due to another behavior.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt; For example, dog panting is a natural reaction to being overheated, but is not produced to specifically relay a particular message.
* Semanticity: There is some fixed relationship between a signal and a meaning.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2011"/&gt;

==Primate: studied examples==
Humans are able to distinguish real words from fake words based on the phonological order of the word itself. In a 2013 study, [[baboon]]s have been shown to have this skill, as well. The discovery has led researchers to believe that reading is not as advanced a skill as previously believed, but instead based on the ability to recognize and distinguish letters from one another. The experimental setup consisted of six young adult baboons, and results were measured by allowing the animals to use a touch screen and selecting whether or not the displayed word was indeed a real word, or a nonword such as "dran" or "telk." The study lasted for six weeks, with approximately 50,000 tests completed in that time. The experimenters explain the use of bigrams, which are combinations of two (usually different) letters. They tell us that the bigrams used in nonwords are rare, while the bigrams used in real words are more common. Further studies will attempt to teach baboons how to use an artificial alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haghighat|first=Leila|title=Baboons Can Learn to Recognize Words|url=http://www.nature.com/news/baboons-can-learn-to-recognize-words-1.10432|journal=Nature News|accessdate=15 April 2013|doi=10.1038/nature.2012.10432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 study, a team of biologists from several universities concluded that [[macaque]]s possess [[vocal tract]]s physically capable of speech, "but lack a speech-ready brain to control it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitch |first=W.

==Non-primates: studied examples==
{{Tone|section|date=April 2013}}
Among the most studied examples of animal languages are:

===Birds===
* [[Bird song]]s: Songbirds can be very articulate. [[Grey parrot]]s are famous for their ability to mimic human language, and at least one specimen, [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], appeared able to answer a number of simple questions about objects he was presented with. [[Parrots]], [[hummingbirds]] and [[songbirds]] – display vocal learning patterns.

===Insects===
* [[Waggle dance|Bee dance]]: Used to communicate direction and distance of food source in many species of bees.

===Mammals===
* [[African forest elephant]]s: Cornell University's Elephant Listening Project&lt;ref name="Elephant Listening Project"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = The Elephant Listening Project | url = http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/elephant/index.html | publisher = Cornell University | date =  | accessdate = 28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began in 1999 when [[Katharine Payne|Katy Payne]] began studying the calls of African forest elephants in [[Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve|Dzanga National Park]] in the Central African Republic. Andrea Turkalo has continued Payne's work in Dzanga National Park observing elephant communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Elephant Listening Project|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/elephant/cyclotis/language/language.html|publisher=Cornell University Lab|accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly 20 years, Turkalo has spent the majority of her time using a [[spectrogram]] to record the noises that the elephants make. After extensive observation and research, she has been able to recognize elephants by their voices. Researchers hope to translate these voices into an elephant dictionary, but that will likely not occur for many years. Because elephant calls are often made at very low frequencies, this spectrogram is able to detect lower frequencies that human ears are unable to hear, allowing Turkalo to get a better idea of what she perceives the elephants to be saying. Cornell’s research on African forest elephants has challenged the idea that humans are considerably better at using language and that animals only have a small repertoire of information that they can convey to others. As Turkalo explained on ''60 Minutes''’ “The Secret Language of Elephants,” “Many of their calls are in some ways similar to human speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret Language of Elephants|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-6045121.html?pageNum=4|publisher=CBS News 60 Minutes|accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mustached bat]]s: Since these animals spend most of their lives in the dark, they rely heavily on their auditory system to communicate. This acoustic communication includes echolocation or using calls to locate each other in the darkness. Studies have shown that [[mustached bat]]s use a wide variety of calls to communicate with one another. These calls include 33 different sounds, or "syllables," that the bats then either use alone or combine in various ways to form "composite" syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kanwal | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Matsumura | first2 = S. | last3 = Ohlemiller | first3 = K. | last4 = Suga | first4 = N. | year = 1994 | title = Analysis of acoustic elements and syntax in communication sounds emitted by mustached bats | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 94 | issue = 3| pages = 1229–1254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Prairie dog]]s: Dr. [[Con Slobodchikoff]] studied prairie dog communication and discovered:
**different alarm calls for different species of predators;
**different escape behaviors for different species of predators;
**transmission of semantic information, in that playbacks of alarm calls in the absence of predators lead to escape behaviors that are appropriate to the type of predator which elicited the alarm calls;
** alarm calls containing descriptive information about the general size, color, and speed of travel of the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/cns3/|title=Con Slobodchikoff|work=nau.edu|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers noted that it appeared that both dolphins knew who they were speaking with and what they were speaking about. Not only do dolphins communicate via nonverbal cues, but they also seem to chatter and respond to other dolphin’s vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret Language of Dolphins|url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/stories/animalsnature/dolphin-language/|publisher=National Geographic Kids|accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Whale sound|Whales]]: Two groups of whales, the [[humpback whale]] and a subspecies of [[blue whale]] found in the [[Indian Ocean]], are known to produce repetitious sounds at varying frequencies known as whale song. Male humpback whales perform these vocalizations only during the mating season, and so it is surmised the purpose of songs is to aid sexual selection. Humpbacks also make a sound called a feeding call, five to ten seconds in length of near constant frequency. Humpbacks generally feed cooperatively by gathering in groups, swimming underneath shoals of fish and all lunging up vertically through the fish and out of the water together. Prior to these lunges, whales make their feeding call. The exact purpose of the call is not known, but research suggests that fish react to it. When the sound was played back to them, a group of herring responded to the sound by moving away from the call, even though no whale was present.
*[[Sea lion]]s: Beginning in 1971 and continuing until present day, Dr. Ronald J. Schusterman and his research associates have studied sea lions’ cognitive ability. They have discovered that sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers, rather than only the stimuli's common features. This is called "equivalence classification". This ability to recognize equivalence may be a precursor to language.&lt;ref name=SSTW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/nsn09.sci.life.reg.sealion/|title=NOVA scienceNOW: Smart Marine Mammals – Smart Sea Lions|work=teachersdomain.org|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is currently being conducted at the Pinniped Cognition &amp; Sensory Systems Laboratory to determine how sea lions form these equivalence relationships. Sea lions have also been proven to be able to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language similar to the one used with primates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pinnipedlab.org/ The Pinniped Cognition &amp; Sensory Systems Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; The sea lions studied were able to learn and use a number of syntactic relations between the signs they were taught, such as how the signs should be arranged in relation to each other. However, the sea lions rarely used the signs semantically or logically.&lt;ref name="Gisiner Schusterman 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gisiner|first1=Robert|last2=Schusterman|first2=Ronald J.|title=Sequence, syntax, and semantics: Responses of a language-trained sea lion (Zalophus californianus) to novel sign combinations.|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=106| issue=1|year=1992| pages=78–91|url=http://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/publications/pub_077_1992.pdf|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.106.1.78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild it's thought that sea lions use the reasoning skills associated with equivalence classification in order to make important decisions that can affect their rate of survival (e.g.&amp;nbsp;recognizing friends and family or avoiding enemies and predators).&lt;ref name=SSTW/&gt; Sea lions use the following to display their language:
** Sea lions use their bodies in various postural positions to display communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/california-sea-lion/communication.htm |title=CALIFORNIA SEA LION – Communication |publisher=Seaworld.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Sea lion's vocal cords limit their ability to convey sounds to a range of barks, chirps, clicks, moans, growls and squeaks.
** There has yet to be an experiment which proves for certain that sea lions use echolocation as a means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dolphins.org/sea_lion_info|title=Sea Lion Info – Dolphin Research Center|work=dolphins.org|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effects of learning on auditory signaling in these animals is of special interest. Several investigators have pointed out that some marine mammals appear to have an extraordinary capacity to alter both the contextual and structural features of their vocalizations as a result of experience. Janik and Slater (2000) have stated that learning can modify the emission of vocalizations in one of two ways: (1) by influencing the context in which a particular signal is used and/or (2) by altering the acoustic structure of the call itself.&lt;ref name="Janik 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Janik | first1 = VM. | last2 = Slater | first2 = PJ. | title = The different roles of social learning in vocal communication. | journal = Anim Behav | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1410 | pmid = 10924198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male California sea lions can learn to inhibit their barking in the presence of any male dominant to them, but vocalize normally when dominant males are absent.&lt;ref name="Schusterman 1968"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schusterman | first1 = RJ. | last2 = Dawson | first2 = RG. | title = Barking, dominance, and territoriality in male sea lions. | journal = Science | volume = 160 | issue = 3826 | pages = 434–6 |date=Apr 1968 | doi =  10.1126/science.160.3826.434| pmid = 5689412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work on gray seals show different call types can be selectively conditioned and placed under biased control of different cues&lt;ref name="Shapiro  2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Shapiro | first1 = AD. | last2 = Slater | first2 = PJ. | last3 = Janik | first3 = VM. | title = Call usage learning in gray seals (Halichoerus grypus). | journal = J Comp Psychol | volume = 118 | issue = 4 | pages = 447–54 |date=Dec 2004 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.118.4.447 | pmid = 15584781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Schusterman, in press) and the use of food reinforcement can also modify vocal emissions. "Hoover", a captive male harbor seal demonstrated a convincing case of vocal mimicry. However similar observations have not been reported since. Still shows under the right circumstances pinnipeds may use auditory experience, in addition to environmental consequences such as food reinforcement and social feedback to modify their vocal emissions.

In a 1992 study, Robert Gisiner and Ronald J. Schusterman conducted experiments in which they attempted to teach Rocky, a female California sea lion, syntax.&lt;ref name="Gisiner Schusterman 1992"/&gt; Rocky was taught signed words, then she was asked to perform various tasks dependent on word order after viewing a signed instruction. It was found that Rocky was able to determine relations between signs and words, and form a basic form of syntax.&lt;ref name="Gisiner Schusterman 1992"/&gt; A 1993 study by Ronald J Schusterman and David Kastak found that the California sea lion was capable of understanding abstract concepts such as symmetry, sameness and transitivity. This provides a strong backing to the theory that [[equivalence relation]]s can form without language.

The distinctive sound of sea lions is produced both above and below water. To mark territory, sea lions "bark", with non-alpha males making more noise than alphas. Although females also bark, they do so less frequently and most often in connection with birthing pups or caring for their young. Females produce a highly directional bawling vocalization, the pup attraction call, which helps mother and pup locate one another. As noted in ''Animal Behavior'', their amphibious lifestyle has made them need acoustic communication for social organization while on land.

Sea lions can hear frequencies as low as 100&amp;nbsp;Hz and as high as 40,000&amp;nbsp;Hz and vocalize between the ranges of 100 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/life/sealion3.htm |title=Oceanography |publisher=Onr.navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234007/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/life/sealion3.htm |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of the terms "animal language" and "animal communication"==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
It is worth distinguishing "animal language" from "animal communication", although there is some comparative interchange in certain cases (e.g.&amp;nbsp;Cheney &amp; Seyfarth's [[vervet monkey]] call studies).&lt;ref name="Seyfarth 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80704-3 | last1 = Seyfarth | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Cheney | first2 = D.L. | year = 1990 | title = The assessment by vervet monkeys of their own and other species' alarm calls | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 754–764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "animal language" typically does not include bee dancing, bird song, whale song, dolphin signature whistles, prairie dogs, nor the communicative systems found in most social mammals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The features of language as listed above are a dated formulation by [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]] in 1960. Through this formulation [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]] made one of the earliest attempts to break down features of human language for the purpose of applying Darwinian gradualism. Although an influence on early animal language efforts (see below), is today not considered the key architecture at the core of "animal language" research.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:CleverHans.jpg|thumb|250px|"Clever Hans", an [[Orlov Trotter]] horse that was claimed to have been able to perform [[Elementary arithmetic|arithmetic]] and other intellectual tasks.]]
Animal Language results are controversial for several reasons. (For a related controversy, see also [[Clever Hans]].) In the 1970s [[John C. Lilly|John Lilly]] was attempting to "break the code": to fully communicate ideas and concepts with wild populations of dolphins so that we could "speak" to them, and share our cultures, histories, and more. This effort failed.
Early [[chimpanzee]] work was with chimpanzee infants raised as if they were human; a test of the nature vs. nurture hypothesis.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
Chimpanzees have a laryngeal structure very different from that of humans, and it has been suggested that chimpanzees are not capable of voluntary control of their breathing, although better studies are needed to accurately confirm this. This combination is thought to make it very difficult for the chimpanzees to reproduce the vocal intonations required for human language. Researchers eventually moved towards a gestural (sign language) modality, as well as "keyboard" devices laden with buttons adorned with symbols (known as "lexigrams") that the animals could press to produce artificial language. Other chimpanzees learned by observing human subjects performing the task.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
This latter group of researchers studying chimpanzee communication through symbol recognition (keyboard) as well as through the use of sign language (gestural), are on the forefront of communicative breakthroughs in the study of animal language, and they are familiar with their subjects on a first name basis: Sarah, Lana, Kanzi, Koko, Sherman, Austin and Chantek.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Perhaps the best known critic of "Animal Language" is Herbert Terrace. Terrace's 1979 criticism using his own research with the chimpanzee [[Nim Chimpsky]]&lt;ref name="Terrace 1979"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Terrace | first1 = Herbert S. | title = Nim | year = 1979 | publisher = Knopf : distributed by Random House | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-394-40250-5 | oclc = 5102119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Terrace Petitto 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.504995 | last1 = Terrace | first1 = H.S. | last2 = Petitto | first2 = L.A. | last3 = Sanders | first3 = R.J. | last4 = Bever | first4 = T.G. | year = 1979 | title = Can an ape create a sentence? | url = | journal = Science | volume = 206 | issue = 4421| pages = 891–902 | pmid = 504995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was scathing and basically spelled the end of animal language research in that era, most of which emphasized the production of language by animals. In short, he accused researchers of over-interpreting their results, especially as it is rarely [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] to ascribe true intentional "language production" when other simpler explanations for the behaviors (gestural hand signs) could be put forth. Also, his animals failed to show generalization of the concept of reference between the modalities of comprehension and production; this generalization is one of many fundamental ones that are trivial for human language use. The simpler explanation according to Terrace was that the animals had learned a sophisticated series of context-based behavioral strategies to obtain either primary (food) or social [[reinforcement]], behaviors that could be over-interpreted as language use.

In 1984 during this anti-Animal Language backlash, [[Louis Herman]] published an account of artificial language in the bottlenosed dolphin in the journal Cognition.&lt;ref name="Herman 1984"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(84)90003-9 | last1 = Herman | first1 = L.

R. Schusterman duplicated many of the dolphin results in his California sea lions ("Rocky"), and came from a more behaviorist tradition than Herman's cognitive approach.

However, overall, there has not been any meaningful dialog between the linguistics and animal language spheres, despite capturing the public's imagination in the popular press. Also, the growing field of language evolution is another source of future interchange between these disciplines. Most primate researchers tend to show a bias toward a shared pre-linguistic ability between humans and chimpanzees, dating back to a common ancestor, while dolphin and parrot researchers stress the general cognitive principles underlying these abilities. More recent related controversies regarding animal abilities include the closely linked areas of [[Theory of mind]], Imitation (e.g.&amp;nbsp;Nehaniv &amp; Dautenhahn, 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Nehaniv | first1 = Chrystopher |last2=Dautenhahn |first2=Kerstin  | title = Imitation in animals and artifacts | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780262271219 | oclc = 51938434 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal Culture (e.g.&amp;nbsp;Rendell &amp; Whitehead, 2001),&lt;ref name="Rendell 2001"&gt;* {{Cite journal | last1 = Rendell | first1 = L. | last2 = Whitehead | first2 = H. | year = 2001 | title = Culture in whales and dolphins | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 309–382 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X0100396X | pmid=11530544}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Language Evolution (e.g.&amp;nbsp;Christiansen &amp; Kirby, 2003).&lt;ref name="Christiansen 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = Morten H. | last2 = Kirby | first2 = Simon | title = Language evolution | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-924484-3 | oclc = 51235137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a recent emergence in animal language research which has contested the idea that animal communication is less sophisticated than human communication. Denise Herzing has done research on dolphins in the Bahamas whereby she created a two-way conversation via a submerged keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herzing|first=Denise L.|last2=Delfour|first2=Fabienne|last3=Pack|first3=Adam A.|date=2012|title=Responses of human-habituated wild Atlantic Spotted Dolphins to play behaviours using a two-way human/dolphin interface|url=http://www.wilddolphinproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Herzing_etal-copy-2.pdf|journal=International Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=25|pages=137–165|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard allows divers to communicate with wild dolphins. By using sounds and symbols on each key the dolphins could either press the key with their nose or mimic the whistling sound emitted in order to ask humans for a specific prop. This ongoing experiment has shown that in non-linguistic creatures brilliant and rapid thinking does occur despite our previous conceptions of animal communication. Further research done with Kanzi using lexigrams has strengthened the idea that animal communication is much more complex then we once thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savage-Rumbaugh | first1 = S. | last2 = Rumbaugh | first2 = D. | last3 = Fields | first3 = W. | year = | title = Empirical kanzi: The ape language controversy revisited.

In [[social science]], '''antipositivism''' (also '''interpretivism''' or '''negativism''') is a theoretical stance that proposes that the social realm cannot be studied with the [[scientific method]] of investigation applied to the [[Nature|natural world]] and that investigation of the social realm requires a different [[epistemology]]. Fundamental to this epistemology is the belief that the concepts and language researchers bring to their research shape their perception of the social world under investigation.&lt;ref name="7th Canadian"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda M. |title=Sociology |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3 |page=32 |edition=7th Canadian|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept ==

Interpretivism (anti-positivism) developed among researchers dissatisfied with [[post-positivism]], the theories of which they considered too general and ill-suited to reflect the nuance and variability found in human interaction. Because the values and theoretical beliefs of researchers cannot fully be removed from their inquiry, interpretivists believe research ''on'' human beings ''by'' human beings cannot yield objective results. Thus, rather than seeking an objective perspective, interpretivists look for meaning in the subjective experiences of individuals engaging in social interaction. Many interpretivist researchers immerse themselves in the social context they are studying, seeking to understand and formulate theories about a community or group of individuals by observing from the inside. Interpretivism is an inductive practice influenced by philosophical frameworks such as [[hermeneutics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[symbolic interactionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, K. (2004). Interpretive Perspectives on Theory Development. In Communication Theories: Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts (pp. 46–59). Boston, Massachusetts: McGraw-Hill.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning with [[Giambattista Vico]], in the early eighteenth century, and later with [[Montesquieu]], the study of natural history and human history were separate fields of intellectual enquiry. Natural history is not under human control, whereas human history is a human creation. As such, antipositivism is informed by an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] distinction between the natural world and the social realm. The natural world can only be understood by its external characteristics, whereas the social realm can be understood externally and internally, and thus can be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 978-0710077462|location = London|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, intellectuals, led by the [[Hegelian]]s, questioned the prospect of empirical social analysis.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Karl Marx]] died before the establishment of formal social science, but nonetheless rejected the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]]—despite his attempt to establish an [[historical materialist]] science of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Zbigniew A. |last=Jordan |title=The Evolution of Dialectical Materialism: A Philosophical and Sociological Analysis |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1967 |pages=131, 321 |isbn=}} [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/jordan2.htm] [https://books.google.com/?id=l2MHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22science+of+society%22#search_anchor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The enhanced positivism of [[Émile Durkheim]] served as foundation of modern academic [[sociology]] and [[social research]], yet retained many mechanical elements of its predecessor.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} [[Hermeneutic]]ians such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] theorized in detail on the distinction between natural and social science ('[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'), whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophers such as [[Heinrich Rickert]] maintained that the social realm, with its abstract meanings and symbolisms, is inconsistent with scientific methods of analysis. [[Edmund Husserl]], meanwhile, negated positivism through the rubric of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p. 20-5&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the twentieth century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced ''verstehende'' (interpretive) sociological antipositivism, proposing research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a resolutely [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective{{clarify|date=June 2014}}. As an antipositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2014}} as those pursued by natural scientists.

The interaction between theory (or constructed [[concept]]s) and data is always fundamental in [[social science]] and this subjection distinguishes it from physical science{{According to whom|date=June 2014}}. Durkheim himself noted the importance of constructing concepts in the abstract (e.g. "[[collective consciousness]]" and "[[social anomie]]") in order to form workable categories for experimentation{{clarify|date=June 2014}}. Both Weber and [[Georg Simmel]] pioneered the [[verstehen]] (or 'interpretative') approach toward social science; a systematic process in which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point of view.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

{{Quote
|text = ''[Sociology is ]'' ... the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful'' ... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history, and any kind of ''a priori'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning.
|sign = [[Max Weber]]
|source = The Nature of Social Action 1922&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'' in Runciman, W.G. 'Weber: Selections in Translation' Cambridge University Press, 1991. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[Existentialism|existential]] writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix.&lt;/ref&gt; His sociology engaged in a [[neo-Kantian]] critique of the limits of human perception.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipositivism thus holds there is no methodological unity of the sciences: the three goals of positivism - ''description, control, and prediction'' - are incomplete, since they lack any ''understanding''.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Science aims at understanding causality so control can be exerted. If this succeeded in sociology, those with knowledge would be able to control the ignorant and this could lead to [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].{{According to whom|date=July 2014}}

This perspective has led to controversy over how one can draw the line between [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] research, much less draw an artificial line between environment and human organization (see [[environmental sociology]]), and influenced the study of [[hermeneutics]]. The base concepts of antipositivism have expanded beyond the scope of [[social science]], in fact, [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] has the same basic principles at its core. Simply put, positivists see sociology as a science, while anti-positivists do not.

=== Frankfurt School ===
The antipositivist tradition continued in the establishment of [[critical theory]], particularly the work associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of social research. Antipositivism would be further facilitated by rejections of '[[scientism]]'; or science ''as ideology''. [[Jürgen Habermas]] argues, in his ''On the Logic of the Social Sciences'' (1967), that "the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] ... access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone."&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]] argued that "our innate tendency to express moral concern and identify with the Other's wants is stifled in modernity by positivistic science and dogmatic bureaucracy. If the Other does not "fit in" to modernity's approved classifications, it is liable to be extinguished."&lt;ref&gt;John Scott. ''Fifty Key Sociologists: The Contemporary Theorists.'' Routledge. 2006. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Several kinds of '''archaeological remnants of the Jerusalem Temple''' exist, both for the Temple that stood before the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Babylonia]] in 586 BCE, and for the rebuilt Temple that stood until  destruction by [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in the year 70.

==First Temple==

The term [[First Temple]] is customarily used to describe the Temple of the Biblical period, which is thought to have been destroyed by the Babylonian conquest. It is described in the Bible as having been built by King [[Solomon]], and is understood to have been constructed with its [[Holy of Holies]] centered on a stone hilltop now known as the [[Foundation Stone]] which had been a traditional focus of worship in Jerusalem. 

==Archaeology==
Because of the religious and political sensitivities involved, no archaeological excavations and only limited surface surveys of the Temple Mount have been conducted since [[Charles Warren]]'s expedition of 1867–70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Charles |last=Warren |authorlink=Charles Warren |url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundjerus00warruoft |title=Underground Jerusalem: An Account of Some of the Principal Difficulties Encountered in Its Exploration and the Results Obtained.

* An [[ostracon]] (excavated prior to 1981), sometimes referred to as the [[House of Yahweh ostracon]], was discovered at [[Tel Arad]], dated to 6th century BCE which mentions a temple which is probably the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521227179 |page=397 |author=T.

* A thumb-sized [[ivory pomegranate]] (which came to light in 1979) measuring {{convert|44|mm|in}} in height, and bearing an ancient Hebrew inscription "Sacred donation for the priests in the House of ---h,]", was believed to have adorned a sceptre used by the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] in Solomon's Temple. It was considered the most important item of biblical antiquities in the [[Israel Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Myre |first=Greg |date=December 30, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/30/international/middleeast/30mideast.html |title=Israel Indicts 4 in 'Brother of Jesus' Hoax and Other Forgeries |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2004, the Israel Antiquities Authority reported the inscription to be a [[forgery]], though the ivory pomegranate itself was dated to the 14th or 13th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4123595.stm |title=Ivory pomegranate 'not Solomon's{{'-}} |publisher=BBC News |date=December 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the report's claim that three incised letters in the inscription stopped short of an ancient break, as they would have if carved after the ancient break was made. Since then, it has been proven that one of the letters was indeed carved prior to the ancient break, and the status of the other two letters are in question. Some paleographers and others have continued to insist that the inscription is ancient, some dispute this so the authenticity of this writing is still the object of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shanks |first=Hershel |title=Fudging with Forgeries |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |date=November–December 2011 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=56–58 |authorlink=Hershel Shanks |issn=0098-9444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another artifact, the [[Jehoash Inscription]], which first came to notice in 2003, contains a 15-line description of King Jehoash's ninth-century BCE restoration of the Temple. Its authenticity was called into question by a report by the Israel Antiquities Authority, which said that the surface patina contained microfossils of [[foraminifera]]. As these fossils do not dissolve in water, they cannot occur in a calcium carbonate patina, leading initial investigators to conclude that the patina must be an artificial chemical mix applied to the stone by forgers.  As of late 2012, the academic community is split on whether the tablet is authentic or not. Commenting on a 2012 report by geologists arguing for the authenticity of the inscription, in October 2012, [[Hershel Shanks]] (who believes the inscription is genuine) wrote the current situation was that most Hebrew language scholars believe that the inscription is a forgery and geologists that it is genuine, and thus "Because we rely on experts, and because there is an apparently irresolvable conflict of experts in this case, [[Biblical Archaeology Review|BAR]] has taken no position with respect to the authenticity of the Jehoash Inscription."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shanks |first=Hershel |authorlink=Hershel Shanks |title=Authentic or Forged?

* By 2006, the [[Temple Mount Sifting Project]] had recovered numerous artifacts dating from the 8th to 7th centuries BCE from soil removed in 1999 by the Islamic Religious Trust (Waqf) from the [[Solomon's Stables]] area of the Temple Mount. These include stone weights for weighing silver and a First Temple period [[bulla (seal)|bulla]], or seal impression, containing ancient Hebrew writing which includes the name ''Netanyahu ben Yaush.'' Netanyahu is a name mentioned several times in the Book of Jeremiah while the name Yaush appears in the [[Lachish letters]]. However, the combination of names was unknown to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1350 |title=Building Remains From The Time Of The First Temple Were Exposed West Of The Temple Mount |publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority |date=March 13, 2008 |quote=a personal Hebrew seal made of a semi-precious stone that was apparently inlaid in a ring. The scarab-like seal is elliptical and measures c. {{convert|1.1|cm|1|abbr=on}} x {{convert|1.4|cm|1|abbr=on}}. The surface of the seal is divided into three strips separated by a double line: in the upper strip is a chain decoration in which there are four pomegranates and in the two bottom strips is the name of the owner of the seal, engraved in ancient Hebrew script. It reads: לנתניהו בן יאש ([belonging] to Netanyahu ben Yaush). The two names are known in the treasury of biblical names: the name נתניהו (Netanyahu) is mentioned a number of times in the Bible (in the Book of Jeremiah and in Chronicles) and the name יאש (Yaush) appears in the Lachish letters. The name Yaush, like the name יאשיהו (Yoshiyahu) is, in the opinion of Professor Shmuel Ahituv, derived from the root או"ש which means “he gave a present” (based on Arabic and Ugaritic). It is customary to assume that the owners of personal seals were people that held senior governmental positions. It should nevertheless be emphasized that this combination of names – נתניהו בן יאוש (Netanyahu ben Yaush) – was unknown until now. |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shragai |first=Nadav |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=776621 |title=Temple Mount dirt uncovers First Temple artifacts |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, artifacts dating to the 8th to 6th centuries BCE were described as being possibly the first physical evidence of human activity at the Temple Mount during the First Temple period. The findings included animal bones; ceramic bowl rims, bases, and body sherds; the base of a juglet used to pour oil; the handle of a small juglet; and the rim of a storage jar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org.il/news40.html |title=Temple Mount First Temple Period Discoveries |publisher=The Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Milstein |first=Mati |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/10/071023-jerusalem-artifacts.html |title=Solomon's Temple Artifacts Found by Muslim Workers |work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic News]] |date=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving evidence of the Second Temple==

The term "[[Second Temple]]" describes the temple described in the Bible as having been built after the accession of [[Cyrus the Great]] to the throne of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible.&lt;ref name="Albright 1963"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey|last = Albright|first = William|authorlink = William F.

Consecrated in 516 BCE&lt;ref name=MagnessArchaeology/&gt; by the [[Babylonian captivity|exiles]] returning from [[Babylon]] under [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]], it is contained within a far grander edifice. This edifice of the ancient Temple Mount was expanded at least twice more, once under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] and then under [[Herod the Great]], who turned it into one of the largest built structures in the ancient world.&lt;ref name=MagnessArchaeology&gt;''The Archaeology of the Holy Land: From the Destruction of Solomon's Temple to the Muslim Conquest,'' [[Jodi Magness]], Cambridge University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|1139510207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasmonean expansion===

The [[Hasmonean dynasty]] expanded the 500 cubit square Temple platform toward the south; distinctive Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, ''Jerusalem; The Temple Mount,'' Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, {{ISBN|9789652208552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herodian expansion===

The massive Herodian expansion produced the Temple of Jesus' time.

====Inscriptions====

The [[Trumpeting Place inscription]] and the [[Temple Warning inscription]] are surviving pieces of the Herodian expansion of the Temple Mount. Both inscribed stones are on display in the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeology in the Israel Museum," eds. Michal Dayagi-Mendels, Silvia Rosenberg, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2010, p. 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jerusalem Temple Warning Inscription.jpg|thumb|Jerusalem Temple Warning Inscription]]
During Temple times, entry to the Mount was limited by a complex set of [[Tumah|purity laws]]. Those who were not of the Jewish nation were prohibited from entering the inner court of the Temple. A hewn stone measuring 60 x 90&amp;nbsp;cm. and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered in 1871 near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in which it outlined this prohibition:
:ΜΗΟΕΝΑΑΛΛΟΓΕΝΗΕΙΣΠΟ
:ΡΕΥΕΣΟΑΙΕΝΤΟΣΤΟΥΠΕ
:ΡΙΤΟΙΕΡΟΝΤΡΥΦΑΚΤΟΥΚΑΙ
:ΠΕΡΙΒΟΛΟΥΟΣΔΑΝΛΗ
:ΦΘΗΕΑΥΤΩΙΑΙΤΙΟΣΕΣ
:ΤΑΙΔΙΑΤΟΕΞΑΚΟΛΟΥ
:ΘΕΙΝΘΑΝΑΤΟΝ
Translation: "Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death." Today, the stone is preserved in [[Museum of Antiquities, Istanbul|Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities]].

====Walls====

Enormous Herodian lower courses of the massive northern, [[Eastern Wall|Eastern]], [[Southern Wall|Southern]] and [[Western Wall]]s survive.

== Archaeological records and cultural views ==
[[Excavation (archaeology)|Archaeological excavation]]s in [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]] produced an upper [[canine tooth]], a [[navicular]] and a [[metacarpal bone]] that were identified as being of a tiger. It has therefore been suggested that the tiger was present in Borneo during the [[late Pleistocene]] and early [[Holocene]].&lt;ref name="PiperRabett2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Piper, P.

Archaeologists considered it unlikely that these fragments were traded between different regions during the Pleistocene. Natives of Borneo keep the memory of the tiger alive in their culture by treating its body parts as [[heirloom]]s. Therefore, it has been suggested that the Bornean tiger existed longer than prehistoric times.&lt;ref name="Piper et al., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Piper |first1=P.

== Characteristics ==
It has been assumed that the Bornean tiger might have been rather small in size, similar to the [[Sumatran tiger]].&lt;ref name=Kitchener1999&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Seidensticker, J. |editor2=Jackson, P. |editor3=Christie, S. |title=Riding the Tiger: Tiger Conservation in Human-Dominated Landscapes |author=Kitchener, A.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Borneo is home to species that the tiger would prey on, such as the [[Bornean bearded pig|bearded pig]], and [[Bornean yellow muntjac|muntjak]] and [[sambar (deer)|sambar deer]].

{{English grammar}}

In [[corpus linguistics]], a '''collocation''' is a sequence of words or [[terminology|terms]] that [[co-occurrence|co-occur]] more often than would be expected by chance. In [[phraseology]], '''collocation''' is a sub-type of [[phraseme]]. An example of a phraseological collocation, as propounded by  [[Michael Halliday]],&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K., 'Lexis as a Linguistic Level', Journal of Linguistics 2(1) 1966: 57-67&lt;/ref&gt; is the expression ''strong tea''. While the same meaning could be conveyed by the roughly equivalent ''powerful tea'', this expression is considered excessive and awkward by English speakers. Conversely, the corresponding expression in technology, ''powerful computer'' is preferred over ''strong computer''. Phraseological collocations should not be confused with [[idiom]]s, where an idiom's meaning is derived from its convention as a stand-in for something else while collocation is a mere popular composition.

There are about six main types of collocations: adjective+noun, noun+noun (such as [[collective nouns]]), verb+noun, adverb+adjective, verbs+prepositional phrase ([[phrasal verb]]s), and verb+adverb.

[[Collocation extraction]] is a computational technique that finds collocations in a document or corpus, using various [[computational linguistics]] elements resembling [[data mining]].

==Expanded definition==
Collocations are partly or fully fixed expressions that become established through repeated context-dependent use. Such terms as 'crystal clear', 'middle management', 'nuclear family', and 'cosmetic surgery' are examples of collocated pairs of words.

Collocations can be in a [[syntax|syntactic]] relation (such as [[subject–verb–object|verb–object]]: 'make' and 'decision'), [[lexicon|lexical]] relation (such as [[antonymy]]), or they can be in no linguistically defined relation.  Knowledge of collocations is vital for the competent use of a language: a [[grammar|grammatically]] correct sentence will stand out as awkward if collocational preferences are violated.  This makes collocation an interesting area for language teaching. Recently, a mobile version of Collocation Dictionary was published on Google Play.&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idiotsapps.oxford.collocation.dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpus linguists specify a [[Keyword (linguistics)|key word]] in context ([[key word in context|KWIC]]) and identify the words immediately surrounding them.  This gives an idea of the way words are used.

The processing of collocations involves a number of parameters, the most important of which is the ''measure of association'', which evaluates whether the [[co-occurrence]] is purely by chance or statistically [[Statistical significance|significant]].  Due to the non-random nature of language, most collocations are classed as significant, and the association scores are simply used to rank the results.  Commonly used measures of association include [[mutual information]], [[Student's t-test|t scores]], and [[log-likelihood]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, Ted (1993): "[http://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J93/J93-1003.pdf Accurate methods for the statistics of surprise and coincidence]". [[Computational Linguistics (journal)|Computational Linguistics]] 19, 1 (Mar. 1993), 61-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tdunning.blogspot.com/2008/03/surprise-and-coincidence.html |title=Surprise and Coincidence |author=Dunning, Ted|date=2008-03-21 |publisher=blogspot.com |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than select a single definition, Gledhill&lt;ref&gt;Gledhill C. (2000): Collocations in Science Writing, Narr, Tübingen&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that collocation involves at least three different perspectives: (i) co-occurrence, a statistical view, which sees collocation as the recurrent appearance in a text of a node and its collocates,&lt;ref&gt;Firth J.R. (1957): Papers in Linguistics 1934–1951. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair J. (1996): "The Search for Units of Meaning", in Textus, IX, 75–106.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smadja F. A &amp; McKeown, K. R. (1990): "[http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P90/P90-1032.pdf Automatically extracting and representing collocations for language generation]", Proceedings of ACL'90, 252–259, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) construction, which sees collocation either as a correlation between a lexeme and a lexical-grammatical pattern,&lt;ref&gt;Hunston S. &amp; Francis G. (2000): Pattern Grammar — A Corpus-Driven Approach to the Lexical Grammar of English, Amsterdam, John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt; or as a relation between a base and its collocative partners&lt;ref&gt;Hausmann F. J. (1989): Le dictionnaire de collocations. In Hausmann F.J., Reichmann O., Wiegand H.E., Zgusta L.(eds), Wörterbücher : ein internationales Handbuch zur Lexikographie. Dictionaries. Dictionnaires. Berlin/New-York : De Gruyter. 1010-1019.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) expression, a pragmatic view of collocation as a conventional unit of expression, regardless of form.&lt;ref&gt;
Moon R. (1998): Fixed Expressions and Idioms, a Corpus-Based Approach. Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frath P. &amp; Gledhill C. (2005): "Free-Range Clusters or Frozen Chunks? Reference as a Defining Criterion for Linguistic Units," in Recherches anglaises et Nord-américaines, vol. 38 :25–43&lt;/ref&gt; It should be pointed out here that these different perspectives contrast with the usual way of presenting collocation in phraseological studies. Traditionally speaking, collocation is explained in terms of all three perspectives at once, in a continuum:

:'Free Combination' ↔ 'Bound Collocation' ↔ 'Frozen Idiom'

==In dictionaries==

In 1933, [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]]'s ''Second Interim Report on English Collocations'' highlighted the importance of collocation as a key to producing natural-sounding language, for anyone learning a [[foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, A.P., English Dictionaries for Foreign Learners, Oxford University Press 1999:54-56&lt;/ref&gt; Thus from the 1940s onwards, information about recurrent word combinations became a standard feature of [[Monolingual learner's dictionary|monolingual learner's dictionaries]]. As these dictionaries became 'less word-centred and more phrase-centred',&lt;ref&gt;Bejoint, H., The Lexicography of English, Oxford University Press 2010: 318&lt;/ref&gt; more attention was paid to collocation. This trend was supported, from the beginning of the 21st century, by the availability of large text [[Corpus linguistics|corpora]] and intelligent [[Text_mining|corpus-querying software]], making possible to provide a more systematic account of collocation in dictionaries. Using these tools, dictionaries such as the ''[[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'' included boxes or panels with lists of frequent collocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/about/med/key-features-of-the-macmillan-english-dictionary-second-edition/#7|title=MED Second Edition - Key features - Macmillan|work=macmillandictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of [[Specialized dictionary|specialized dictionaries]] devoted to describing the frequent collocations in a language.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, T. and Klotz, M. 'Syntagmatic and Phraseological Dictionaries' in Cowie, A.P. (Ed.) The Oxford History of English Lexicography, 2009: part 2, 234-243&lt;/ref&gt; These include (for Spanish) ''Redes: Diccionario combinatorio del español contemporaneo'' (2004),  (for French) ''Le Robert: Dictionnaire des combinaisons de mots'' (2007), and (for English) the ''LTP Dictionary of Selected Collocations'' (1997) and the ''Macmillan Collocations Dictionary'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/features/how-dictionaries-are-written/macmillan-collocations-dictionary/|title=Macmillan Collocation Dictionary - How it was written  - Macmillan|work=macmillandictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistically significant collocation ==
[[Student's t-test]] can be used to determine whether the occurrence of a collocation in a corpus is statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing|last=Manning|first=Chris|last2=Schütze|first2=Hinrich|publisher=MIT Press|year=1999|isbn=0262133601|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[bigram]] &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;P(w_1) = \frac{\#w_1}{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the unconditional probability of occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; in a corpus with size &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;P(w_2) = \frac{\#w_2}{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the unconditional probability of occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; in the corpus. Then the t-score for the bigram &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; is calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{N}}}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac{\# w_iw_j}{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean of the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\#w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; is the number of occurrences of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu = P(w_i)P(w_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; under the null-hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; appear independently in the text, and &lt;math&gt;s^2 = \bar{x}(1-\bar{x}) \approx \bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample variance. With a large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the t-test is equivalent to a [[z-test]].

A '''cooling tower''' is a heat rejection device that rejects [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]] through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature. Cooling towers may either use the [[evaporation]] of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the [[Wet-bulb temperature|wet-bulb air temperature]] or, in the case of ''closed circuit dry cooling towers'', rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near the  [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry-bulb air temperature]].

Common applications include cooling the circulating water used in [[oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and other  [[chemical plant]]s, [[thermal power station]]s and [[HVAC]] systems for cooling buildings. The classification is based on the type of air induction into the tower: the main types of cooling towers are [[Natural convection|natural draft]] and [[Forced convection|induced draft]] cooling towers.

Cooling towers vary in size from small roof-top units to very large [[hyperboloid structure]]s (as in the adjacent image) that can be up to {{convert|200|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|100|m|ft}} in diameter, or rectangular structures that can be over {{convert|40|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|80|m|ft}} long. The hyperboloid cooling towers are often associated with [[nuclear power plant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;CleanEnergy Footprints (cleanenergy.org). [http://blog.cleanenergy.org/2012/12/31/identifying-nuclear-reactors-in-google-earth/ ''Identifying Nuclear Reactors in Google Earth''] Retrieved 5/19/2014&lt;/ref&gt; although they are also used in some coal-fired plants and to some extent in some large chemical and other industrial plants. Although these large towers are very prominent, the vast majority of cooling towers are much smaller, including many units installed on or near buildings to discharge heat from [[air conditioning]].

==History==
[[File:Barnard's fanless self-cooling tower.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1902 engraving of "Barnard's fanless self-cooling tower", an early large evaporative cooling tower that relied on [[Natural Draft|natural draft]] and open sides rather than a fan; water to be cooled was sprayed from the top onto the radial pattern of vertical wire-mesh mats.]]

==Classification by use==
===Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)===
[[File:Loop Shopping Centre Exterior I.jpg|thumb|Two HVAC cooling towers on the rooftop of a shopping center (Germany)]]
{{main|HVAC}}

An [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) cooling tower is used to dispose of ("reject") unwanted heat from a [[chiller]]. Water-cooled chillers are normally more energy efficient than air-cooled chillers due to [[heat rejection]] to tower water at or near [[wet-bulb temperature]]s.  Air-cooled chillers must reject heat at the higher [[dry-bulb temperature]], and thus have a lower average reverse-[[Carnot cycle]] effectiveness. In areas with a hot climate, large office buildings, hospitals, and schools typically use one or more cooling towers as part of their air conditioning systems.  Generally, industrial cooling towers are much larger than HVAC towers.

HVAC use of a cooling tower pairs the cooling tower with a water-cooled chiller or water-cooled condenser. A [[Refrigeration#Capacity ratings|''ton'' of air-conditioning]] is defined as the removal of 12,000 [[British thermal unit|BTU/hour]] (3500 W). The ''equivalent ton'' on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 BTU/hour (4400 W) due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller's compressor. This ''equivalent ton'' is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 US gallons/minute (1,500 pound/hour) of water 10&amp;nbsp;°F (6&amp;nbsp;°C), which amounts to 15,000 BTU/hour, assuming a chiller [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) of 4.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheremisinoff|first1=Nicholas|title=Handbook of Chemical Processing Equipment|date=2000|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780080523828|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This COP is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 14.

Cooling towers are also used in HVAC systems that have multiple water source [[heat pumps]] that share a common piping ''water loop''. In this type of system, the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode, then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the [[atmosphere]].  By contrast, when the heat pumps are working in heating mode, the condensers draw heat out of the loop water and reject it into the space to be heated.  When the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building, the cooling tower is normally shut down (and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage), and heat is supplied by other means, usually from separate [[boiler]]s.

===Industrial cooling towers===
[[File:Cenk Endustri Field Erected Industrial Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|Industrial cooling towers for a power plant]]
[[File:Industrial Counterflow Cooling Towers.jpg|thumb|Industrial Cooling Towers for Fruit Processing Industry ]]
Industrial cooling towers can be used to remove heat from various sources such as machinery or heated process material.  The primary use of large, industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating [[cooling water]] systems used in [[power plants]], [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] plants, [[natural gas]] processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants, and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns, for cooling liquid in crystallization, etc.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite report |title=Profile of the Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation Industry |url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/assistance/sectors/notebooks/fossil.html |author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). |year= 1997 |publisher= Washington, D.C |accessdate= }} Document No. EPA/310-R-97-007. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 MW [[coal-fired power plant]] with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour (315,000 US gallons per minute)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/presentations/maulbetsch.pdf Cooling System Retrofit Costs] EPA Workshop on Cooling Water Intake Technologies, John Maulbetsch, Maulbetsch Consulting, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent (i.e., 3,600 cubic metres an hour).

Furthermore, discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem. Elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms (see ''[[thermal pollution]]''), or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of [[zebra mussel]]s or [[algae]]. A cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water. Evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used.
Some coal-fired and [[nuclear power plant]]s located in [[coastal]] areas do make use of once-through ocean water. But even there, the offshore discharge water outlet requires very careful design to avoid environmental problems.

Petroleum refineries also have very large cooling tower systems. A typical large refinery processing 40,000 metric tonnes of crude oil per day ({{convert|300000|oilbbl}} per day) circulates about 80,000 cubic metres of water per hour through its cooling tower system.

==Classification by build==

=== Package type ===
[[File:Field_Errected_Cooling_Towers.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Field_Errected_Cooling_Towers.jpg|thumb|Field Erected Cooling Towers]]
[[File:Brotep_Eco_coolin_tower.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brotep_Eco_coolin_tower.jpg|thumb|Brotep-Eco cooling tower]]
[[File:Package_type_cooling_tower.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Package_type_cooling_tower.JPG|thumb|Package cooling tower]]
These types of cooling towers are factory preassembled, and can be simply transported on trucks, as they are compact machines. The capacity of package type towers is limited and, for that reason, they are usually preferred by facilities with low heat rejection requirements such as food processing plants, textile plants, some chemical processing plants, or buildings like hospitals, hotels, malls, automotive factories etc.

Due to their frequent use in or near residential areas, sound level control is a relatively more important issue for package type cooling towers.

=== Field erection type ===
Facilities such as power plants, steel processing plants, petroleum refineries, or petrochemical plants usually install field erected type cooling towers due to their greater capacity for heat rejection. Field erected towers are usually much larger in size compared to the package type cooling towers.

A typical field erected cooling tower has a [[Pultrusion|pultruded]] [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] (FRP) structure, FRP [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]], a mechanical unit for [[air draft]], drift eliminator, and fill.

==Heat transfer methods==
With respect to the [[heat transfer]] mechanism employed, the main types are:
* '''dry cooling towers''' operate by [[heat transfer]] through a surface that separates the working fluid from ambient air, such as in a tube to air [[heat exchanger]], utilizing convective heat transfer. They do not use evaporation.
* '''wet cooling towers''' (or '''open circuit cooling towers''') operate on the principle of [[evaporative cooling]].  The working fluid and the evaporated fluid (usually water) are one and the same.
* '''fluid coolers''' (or '''closed circuit cooling towers''') are hybrids that pass the working fluid through a tube bundle, upon which clean water is sprayed and a fan-induced draft applied.  The resulting heat transfer performance is much closer to that of a wet cooling tower, with the advantage provided by a dry cooler of protecting the working fluid from environmental exposure and contamination.

In a wet cooling tower (or open circuit cooling tower), the warm water can be cooled to a temperature ''lower'' than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, if the air is relatively dry (see [[dew point]] and [[psychrometrics]]). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, a small portion of the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately 970 BTU of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 MJ/kg). Evaporation results in saturated air conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to [[wet-bulb temperature]], which is lower than the ambient [[dry-bulb temperature]], the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.

To achieve better performance (more cooling), a medium called ''fill'' is used to increase the surface area and the time of contact between the air and water flows. ''Splash fill'' consists of material placed to interrupt the water flow causing splashing. ''Film fill'' is composed of thin sheets of material (usually [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]) upon which the water flows.  Both methods create increased surface area and time of contact between the fluid (water) and the gas (air), to improve heat transfer.

==Air flow generation methods==
[[File:Stairway to nowhere^ - geograph.org.uk - 455003.jpg|thumb|Access stairs at the base of a massive hyperboloid cooling tower give a sense of its scale (UK)]]
With respect to drawing air through the tower, there are three types of cooling towers:
* '''[[Natural draught|Natural draft]]''' — Utilizes buoyancy via a tall chimney.  Warm, moist air ''naturally'' rises due to the density differential compared to the dry, cooler outside air. Warm [[Lighter than air#Water vapour|moist air]] is less dense than drier air at the same pressure.  This moist air buoyancy produces an upwards current of air through the tower.
* '''Mechanical draft''' — Uses power-driven fan motors to force or draw air through the tower.
** '''Induced draft''' — A mechanical draft tower with a fan at the discharge (at the top) which pulls air up through the tower. The fan ''induces'' hot moist air out the discharge. This produces low entering and high exiting air velocities, reducing the possibility of ''recirculation'' in which discharged air flows back into the air intake.  This fan/fin arrangement is also known as ''draw-through''. 
** '''Forced draft''' — A mechanical draft tower with a blower type fan at the intake. The fan ''forces'' air into the tower, creating high entering and low exiting air velocities. The low exiting velocity is much more susceptible to recirculation. With the fan on the air intake, the fan is more susceptible to complications due to freezing conditions. Another disadvantage is that a forced draft design typically requires more motor horsepower than an equivalent induced draft design. The benefit of the forced draft design is its ability to work with high [[static pressure]]. Such setups can be installed in more-confined spaces and even in some indoor situations. This fan/fin geometry is also known as ''blow-through''.
* '''Fan assisted natural draft''' — A hybrid type that appears like a natural draft setup, though airflow is assisted by a fan.

[[hyperboloid structure|Hyperboloid]] (sometimes incorrectly known as [[hyperbolic paraboloid|hyperbolic]]) cooling towers have become the design standard for all natural-draft cooling towers because of their structural strength and minimum usage of material. The hyperboloid shape also aids in accelerating the upward [[convection|convective]] air flow, improving cooling efficiency.  These designs are popularly associated with [[nuclear power plant]]s.  However, this association is misleading, as the same kind of cooling towers are often used at large coal-fired power plants as well. Conversely, not all nuclear power plants have cooling towers,  and some instead cool their heat exchangers with lake, river or ocean water.

Thermal efficiencies up to 92% have been observed in hybrid cooling towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gul|first=S.|date=2015-06-18|title=Optimizing the performance of Hybrid: Induced-Forced Draft Cooling Tower|url=http://www.piche.org.pk/journal/index.php?journal=jpiche&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=192|journal=Journal of the Pakistan Institute of Chemical Engineers|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|issn=1813-4092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorization by air-to-water flow==

===Crossflow===
[[File:Crossflow diagram.svg|thumb|left]]
[[File:factory assembled crossflow.jpg|thumb|Mechanical draft crossflow cooling tower used in an HVAC application]]
[[File:Crossflow cooling tower.jpg|thumb|Package crossflow cooling tower]]Typically lower initial and long-term cost, mostly due to pump requirements.
Crossflow is a design in which the air flow is directed perpendicular to the water flow (see diagram at left). Air flow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet the fill material. Water flows (perpendicular to the air) through the fill by gravity. The air continues through the fill and thus past the water flow into an open plenum volume. Lastly, a fan forces the air out into the atmosphere.

A ''distribution'' or ''hot water basin'' consisting of a deep pan with holes or ''nozzles'' in its bottom is located near the top of a crossflow tower. Gravity distributes the water through the nozzles uniformly across the fill material.

Advantages of the crossflow design:
* Gravity water distribution allows smaller pumps and maintenance while in use.
* Non-pressurized spray simplifies variable flow.

Disadvantages of the crossflow design:
* More prone to freezing than counterflow designs.
* Variable flow is useless in some conditions.
* More prone to dirt buildup in the fill than counterflow designs, especially in dusty or sandy areas.

===Counterflow===
[[File:Counterflow Cooling Towers.jpg|thumb|Induced Draft Counterflow Cooling Towers]]
[[File:Counterflow diagram.svg|thumb|left]]
[[File:Crossflow Cooling tower.jpg|thumb|Forced draft counter flow package type cooling towers]]
In a counterflow design, the air flow is directly opposite to the water flow (see diagram at left). Air flow first enters an open area beneath the fill media, and is then drawn up vertically. The water is sprayed through pressurized nozzles near the top of the tower, and then flows downward through the fill, opposite to the air flow.

&lt;br/&gt;
Advantages of the counterflow design:
* Spray water distribution makes the tower more freeze-resistant.
* Breakup of water in spray makes heat transfer more efficient.
&lt;br/&gt;
Disadvantages of the counterflow design:
* Typically higher initial and long-term cost, primarily due to pump requirements.
* Difficult to use variable water flow, as spray characteristics may be negatively affected.
* Typically noisier, due to the greater water fall height from the bottom of the fill into the cold water basin

===Common aspects===
Common aspects of both designs:
*The interactions of the air and water flow allow a partial equalization of temperature, and evaporation of water.
*The air, now saturated with water vapor, is discharged from the top of the cooling tower.
*A "collection basin" or "cold water basin" is used to collect and contain the cooled water after its interaction with the air flow.

Both crossflow and counterflow designs can be used in natural draft and in mechanical draft cooling towers.

==Wet cooling tower material balance==
Quantitatively, the material balance around a wet, evaporative cooling tower system is governed by the operational variables of make-up [[volumetric flow rate]], [[evaporation]] and windage losses, draw-off rate, and the concentration cycles.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] |edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year=1967|id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}} (available in many university libraries)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beychok2&gt;{{cite journal| author=Milton R. Beychok|date=October 1952|title=How To Calculate Cooling Tower Control Variables|journal= Petroleum Processing| volume=|issue=|pages=1452–1456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the adjacent diagram, water pumped from the tower basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and [[condenser (steam turbine)|condensers]] in an industrial facility.  The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns to the top of the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower.  As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to [[evaporation|evaporate]]. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.

|}

A water balance around the entire system is then:&lt;ref name=Beychok2/&gt;

:M = E + D + W

Since the evaporated water (E) has no salts, a chloride balance around the system is:&lt;ref name=Beychok2/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M X_M = D X_C + W X_C = X_C (D + W)&lt;/math&gt;

and, therefore:&lt;ref name=Beychok2/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {X_C \over X_M} = \text{Cycles of concentration} ={ M \over (D + W)} = {M \over (M - E)} = 1 + {E \over (D + W)}&lt;/math&gt;

From a simplified heat balance around the cooling tower:

:&lt;math&gt; E = {C \Delta T c_p \over H_V} &lt;/math&gt;

|}

Windage (or drift) losses (W) is the amount of total tower water flow that is entrained in the flow of air to the atmosphere. From large-scale industrial cooling towers, in the absence of manufacturer's data, it may be assumed to be:

:'''W''' = 0.3 to 1.0 percent of C for a natural draft cooling tower without windage drift eliminators
:'''W''' = 0.1 to 0.3 percent of C for an induced draft cooling tower without windage drift eliminators
:'''W''' = about 0.005 percent of C (or less) if the cooling tower has windage drift eliminators
:'''W''' = about 0.0005 percent of C (or less) if the cooling tower has windage drift eliminators and uses sea water as make-up water.

===Cycles of concentration===
Cycle of concentration represents the accumulation of dissolved minerals in the recirculating cooling water. Discharge of draw-off (or blowdown) is used principally to control the buildup of these minerals.

The chemistry of the make-up water, including the amount of dissolved minerals, can vary widely. Make-up waters low in dissolved minerals such as those from surface water supplies (lakes, rivers etc.) tend to be aggressive to metals (corrosive). Make-up waters from [[ground water]] supplies (such as [[water well|wells]]) are usually higher in minerals, and tend to be [[Limescale|scaling]] (deposit minerals). Increasing the amount of minerals present in the water by cycling can make water less aggressive to piping; however, excessive levels of minerals can cause scaling problems.

[[File:Cycles-Of-Concentration.png|thumb|Relationship between cycles of concentration and flow rates in a cooling tower]] As the cycles of concentration increase, the water may not be able to hold the minerals in solution. When the [[solubility]] of these minerals have been exceeded they can [[precipitate]] out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the [[heat exchangers]]. The temperatures of the recirculating water, piping and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water.  Often a professional [[Industrial water treatment|water treatment]] consultant will evaluate the make-up water and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for the cycles of concentration. The use of water treatment chemicals, pretreatment such as [[water softening]], [[pH]] adjustment, and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration.

Concentration cycles in the majority of cooling towers usually range from 3 to 7. In the United States, many water supplies use well water which has significant levels of dissolved solids. On the other hand, one of the largest water supplies, for [[New York City water supply system|New York City]], has a surface rainwater source quite low in minerals; thus cooling towers in that city are often allowed to concentrate to 7 or more cycles of concentration.

Since higher cycles of concentration represent less make-up water, [[water conservation]] efforts may focus on increasing cycles of concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://energy.gov/eere/femp/best-management-practice-cooling-tower-management |title = Best Management Practice Cooling Tower Management |publisher = Department of Energy |date = 30 April 2005 |website = Energy.gov |accessdate= 16 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly treated recycled water may be an effective means of reducing cooling tower consumption of potable water, in regions where potable water is scarce.&lt;ref name="Diego"&gt;{{cite journal | last = San Diego County Water Authority | date = July 2009 | title = Technical Information for Cooling Towers Using Recycled Water | url = http://www.sdcwa.org/sites/default/files/files/water-management/recycled/techinfo-cooling-towers.pdf | website = www.sdcwa.org | publisher    = San Diego County Water Authority | accessdate  = 18 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
Surfaces with any visible biofilm (i.e., slime) should be cleaned.

Disinfectant and other chemical levels in cooling towers and hot tubs should be continuously maintained and regularly monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/downloads/toolkit.pdf |title=Developing a Water Management Program to Reduce Legionella Growth &amp; Spread in Buildings: A Practical Guide to Implementing Industry Standards | publisher =CDC |date = 5 June 2017|page= 13 {17 of 32}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular checks of water quality (specifically the aerobic bacteria levels) using [[Dip slide|dipslides]] should be taken as the presence of other organisms can support legionella by producing the organic nutrients that it needs to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dip-slides.com/cooling-water/69-cooling-water-dipslides-box-of-10.html|title=Cooling Water Dipslides (Box of 10) - Dip-slides.com|website=Dip-slides.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water treatment===
{{see also|Industrial water treatment}}
Besides treating the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and [[fouling]], the water should be [[Filter (water)|filtered]] to remove particulates, and also be dosed with [[biocide]]s and [[algaecide]]s to prevent growths that could interfere with the continuous flow of the water.&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; Under certain conditions, a [[biofilm]] of micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water, and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower. Biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using [[chlorine]] or other chemicals. A normal industrial practice is to use two biocides, such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack. In most cases, a continual low level oxidizing biocide is used, then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing biocides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bvwater.co.uk/cooling-water-system-chemicals/ |title=B &amp; V Group, Cooling Water System Chemical Range, Non-Oxidising Biocides |access-date=14 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829064240/http://www.bvwater.co.uk/cooling-water-system-chemicals/#.WFFOPqZ4e7k |archive-date=29 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Legionnaires' disease====
[[File:Legionella pneumophila (SEM) 2.jpg|thumb|''Legionella pneumophila'' (5000x magnification)]]
{{further|Legionellosis|Legionella}}

Another very important reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of ''[[Legionella]]'', including species that cause [[legionellosis]] or Legionnaires' disease, most notably ''L. pneumophila'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryan K.J.; Ray C.G. (editors)|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=0-8385-8529-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Mycobacterium avium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/4/3/pdfs/v4-n3.pdf Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – Emerging Infectious Diseases]&amp;thinsp; (page 495)&lt;/ref&gt; The various ''Legionella'' species are the cause of Legionnaires' disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to [[particulate|aerosol]]s—the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources of ''Legionella'' include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems, domestic hot water systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply. Natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks.&lt;ref name=Cun2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunha|first1=BA|last2=Burillo|first2=A|last3=Bouza|first3=E|title=Legionnaires' disease.|journal=Lancet|date=23 January 2016|volume=387|issue=10016|pages=376–85|pmid=26231463|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60078-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2016Start&gt;{{cite web|title=Legionella (Legionnaires' Disease and Pontiac Fever) About the Disease|url=https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=17 June 2017 |date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French researchers found that ''Legionella'' bacteria travelled up to {{convert|6|km|mi}} through the air from a large contaminated cooling tower at a petrochemical plant in Pas-de-Calais, France. That outbreak killed 21 of the 86 people who had a laboratory-confirmed infection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080922134426/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/521680 Airborne Legionella May Travel Several Kilometres] (access requires free registration)  &lt;/ref&gt;

Drift (or windage) is the term for water droplets of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge. Drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.001–0.005% of the circulating flow rate. A typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets. A well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for ''Legionella'' or water treatment chemical exposure.

The CDC does not recommend that health-care facilities regularly test for the ''Legionella pneumophila'' bacteria. Scheduled microbiologic monitoring for ''Legionella'' remains controversial because its presence is not necessarily evidence of a potential for causing disease. The CDC recommends aggressive disinfection measures for cleaning and maintaining devices known to transmit ''Legionella'', but does not recommend regularly-scheduled microbiologic assays for the bacteria. However, scheduled monitoring of potable water within a hospital might be considered in certain settings where persons are highly susceptible to illness and mortality from ''Legionella'' infection (e.g. [[hematopoietic stem cell]] transplantation units, or solid organ transplant units).  Also, after an outbreak of legionellosis, health officials agree that monitoring is necessary to identify the source and to evaluate the efficacy of biocides or other prevention measures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/eic_in_HCF_03.pdf CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities, pages 223 &amp; 224, Water Sampling Strategies and Culture Techniques for Detecting Legionellae]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found ''Legionella'' in 40% to 60% of cooling towers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cti.org/downloads/WTP-148.pdf Cooling Tower Institute, July 2008. Page 5 of 12, column 1, paragraph 3. Most professional and government agencies do not recommend testing for ''Legionella'' bacteria on a routine basis.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Floor of cooling tower, Iru Power Plant, 2.jpg|thumb|Fill plates at the bottom of the [[Iru Power Plant]] cooling tower (Estonia).  Tower is shut down, revealing numerous water spray heads.]]

{{anchor |Windage|Drift}}
*'''Windage''' or '''Drift''' — Water droplets that are carried out of the cooling tower with the exhaust air. Drift droplets have the same concentration of impurities as the water entering the tower. The drift rate is typically reduced by employing baffle-like devices, called drift eliminators, through which the air must travel after leaving the fill and spray zones of the tower.  Drift can also be reduced by using warmer entering cooling tower temperatures.
{{anchor |Blow-out}}
*'''Blow-out''' — Water droplets blown out of the cooling tower by wind, generally at the air inlet openings. Water may also be lost, in the absence of wind, through splashing or misting. Devices such as wind screens, louvers, splash deflectors and water diverters are used to limit these losses.
{{anchor |Plume}}
*'''Plume''' — The stream of saturated exhaust air leaving the cooling tower. The plume is visible when water vapor it contains condenses in contact with cooler ambient air, like the saturated air in one's breath fogs on a cold day. Under certain conditions, a cooling tower plume may present fogging or icing hazards to its surroundings. Note that the water evaporated in the cooling process is "pure" water, in contrast to the very small percentage of drift droplets or water blown out of the air inlets.
{{anchor |Draw-off|Blow-down}}
*'''Draw-off''' or '''Blow-down''' — The portion of the circulating water flow that is removed (usually discharged to a drain) in order to maintain the amount of [[Total Dissolved Solids]] (TDS) and other impurities at an acceptably low level.  Higher TDS concentration in solution may result from greater cooling tower efficiency. However the higher the TDS concentration, the greater the risk of scale, biological growth and corrosion. The amount of blow-down is primarily designated by measuring by the [[electrical conductivity]] of the circulating water. Biological growth, scaling and corrosion can be prevented by chemicals (respectively, biocide, sulfuric acid, corrosion inhibitor). On the other hand, the only practical way to decrease the electrical conductivity is by increasing the amount of blow-down discharge and subsequently increasing the amount of clean make-up water.
{{anchor |Zero bleed for cooling towers|Zero}}
* '''Zero bleed for cooling towers''', also called '''zero blow-down for cooling towers''', is a process for significantly reducing the need for bleeding [[water]] with residual [[solid]]s from the system by enabling the water to hold more solids in [[solution]].&lt;ref name=WilliamHClark1997 &gt;{{citation | author=William H Clark | year=1997 | title=Retrofitting for energy conservation | publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn=978-0-07-011920-8  | page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=InstituteofIndustrialEngineers1981-1982 &gt;{{citation | author=Institute of Industrial Engineers 1981–  | year=1982 | title=Proceedings, Volume 1982 | publisher=Institute of Industrial Engineers/American Institute of Industrial Engineers  | page=101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathie1998 &gt;{{citation | last=Mathie | first=Alton J. | year=1998 | title=Chemical treatment for cooling water | publisher=Fairmont Press | isbn=978-0-88173-253-5  | page=86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor |Make-up}}
*'''Make-up''' — The water that must be added to the circulating water system in order to compensate for water losses such as evaporation, drift loss, blow-out, blow-down, etc.
{{anchor |Noise}}
*'''Noise''' — Sound energy emitted by a cooling tower and heard (recorded) at a given distance and direction. The sound is generated by the impact of falling water, by the movement of air by fans, the fan blades moving in the structure, vibration of the structure, and the motors, gearboxes or drive belts.
{{anchor |Approach}}
*'''Approach''' — The approach is the difference in temperature between the cooled-water temperature and the entering-air [[Wet-bulb temperature|wet bulb temperature]] (twb). Since the cooling towers are based on the principles of evaporative cooling, the maximum cooling tower efficiency depends on the wet bulb temperature of the air.  The wet-bulb temperature is a type of temperature measurement that reflects the physical properties of a system with a mixture of a gas and a vapor, usually air and water vapor
{{anchor |Range}}
*'''Range''' — The range is the temperature difference between the warm water inlet and cooled water exit.
{{anchor |Fill}}
*'''Fill''' — Inside the tower, fills are added to increase contact surface as well as contact time between air and water, to provide better heat transfer. The efficiency of the tower depends on the selection and amount of fill. There are two types of fills that may be used:
**'''Film type fill''' (causes water to spread into a thin film)
**'''Splash type fill''' (breaks up falling stream of water and interrupts its vertical progress)
{{anchor |Full-Flow Filtration|Full-Flow}}
*'''Full-Flow Filtration''' — Full-flow filtration continuously strains particulates out of the entire system flow. For example, in a 100-ton system, the flow rate would be roughly 300 gal/min. A filter would be selected to accommodate the entire 300 gal/min flow rate. In this case, the filter typically is installed after the cooling tower on the discharge side of the pump. While this is the ideal method of filtration, for higher flow systems it may be cost-prohibitive.
{{anchor |Side-Stream Filtration|Side-Stream}}
*'''Side-Stream Filtration''' — Side-stream filtration, although popular and effective, does not provide complete protection. With side-stream filtration, a portion of the water is filtered continuously. This method works on the principle that continuous particle removal will keep the system clean. Manufacturers typically package side-stream filters on a skid, complete with a pump and controls. For high flow systems, this method is cost-effective. Properly sizing a side-stream filtration system is critical to obtain satisfactory filter performance, but there is some debate over how to properly size the side-stream system. Many engineers size the system to continuously filter the cooling tower basin water at a rate equivalent to 10% of the total circulation flow rate. For example, if the total flow of a system is 1,200 gal/min (a 400-ton system), a 120 gal/min side-stream system is specified.
{{anchor |Cycle of concentration|Cycle}}
*'''Cycle of concentration''' — Maximum allowed multiplier for the amount of miscellaneous substances in circulating water compared to the amount of those substances in make-up water.
{{anchor |Treated timber|Treated}}
*'''Treated timber''' — A structural material for cooling towers which was largely abandoned about 10 years ago.{{When|date=March 2012}}  It is still used occasionally due to its low initial costs, in spite of its short life expectancy. The life of treated timber varies a lot, depending on the operating conditions of the tower, such as frequency of shutdowns, treatment of the circulating water, etc. Under proper working conditions, the estimated life of treated timber structural members is about 10 years.
{{anchor |Leaching}}
*'''Leaching''' — The loss of wood preservative chemicals by the washing action of the water flowing through a wood structure cooling tower.
{{anchor |Pultruded FRP|Pultruded}}
*'''Pultruded FRP''' — A common structural material for smaller cooling towers, [[fibre-reinforced plastic]] (FRP) is known for its high corrosion-resistance capabilities. Pultruded FRP is produced using [[pultrusion]] technology, and has become the most common structural material for small cooling towers. It offers lower costs and requires less maintenance compared to reinforced concrete, which is still in use for large structures.

==Fog production==
[[File:Clouds, natural and otherwise - geograph.org.uk - 778331.jpg|thumb|Fog clouds produced by [[Eggborough power station|Eggborough Power Plant]] (UK)]]

Under certain ambient conditions, plumes of water vapor (fog) can be seen rising out of the discharge from a cooling tower, and can be mistaken as smoke from a fire.  If the outdoor air is at or near saturation, and the tower adds more water to the air, saturated air with liquid water droplets can be discharged, which is seen as fog.  This phenomenon typically occurs on cool, humid days, but is rare in many climates. Fog and clouds associated with cooling towers can be described as '''homogenitus''', as with other clouds of man-made origin, such as [[contrail]]s and [[ship track]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=Scott|title=Cloud Atlas leaps into 21st century with 12 new cloud types|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/cloud-atlas-leaps-into-21st-century-with-12-new-cloud-types/80685/|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=The Weather Network|agency=Pelmorex Media|date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon can be prevented by decreasing the relative humidity of the saturated discharge air. For that purpose, in hybrid towers, saturated discharge air is mixed with heated low relative humidity air. Some air enters the tower above drift eliminator level, passing through heat exchangers. The relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower. The discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible.

==Salt emission pollution==
When wet cooling towers with seawater make-up are installed in various industries located in or near coastal areas, the drift of fine droplets emitted from the cooling towers contain nearly 6% sodium chloride which deposits on the nearby land areas. This deposition of sodium salts on the nearby agriculture/vegetative lands can convert them into [[Soil salinity control|sodic saline]] or [[Alkali soils|sodic alkaline soils]] depending on the nature of the soil and enhance the [[Sodium adsorption ratio|sodicity]] of ground and surface water. The salt deposition problem from such cooling towers aggravates where national pollution control standards are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions from wet cooling towers using seawater make-up.&lt;ref name="wet cooling"&gt;[http://www.ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=2ED8CFA7-1 Wet Cooling Tower Guidance For Particulate Matter, Environment Canada], Retrieved on 2013-01-29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Respirable suspended particle|Respirable suspended particulate matter]], of less than 10 [[micrometre|micrometers]] (µm) in size, can be present in the drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10&amp;nbsp;µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10&amp;nbsp;µm, referred to as PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm, (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000&amp;nbsp;ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000&amp;nbsp;ppm).&lt;ref name="wet cooling" /&gt;

==Use as a flue-gas stack==
[[File:Chimney included in cooling tower.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Flue gas stack inside a natural draft wet cooling tower]]
[[File:Power station Duisburg Walsum.JPG|thumb|Flue gas stack connection into a natural draft wet cooling tower]]
[[File:Песочин ТЭЦ5 Градирни VizuIMG 2181.JPG|thumb|Large [[hyperboloid]] cooling towers made of structural steel for a power plant in Kharkov (Ukraine)]]
At some modern power stations equipped with [[flue-gas desulfurization|flue gas purification]], such as the [[Großkrotzenburg Power Station]] and the [[Rostock Power Station]], the cooling tower is also used as a [[flue-gas stack]] (industrial chimney), thus saving the cost of a separate chimney structure. At plants without flue gas purification, problems with corrosion may occur, due to reactions of raw flue gas with water to form [[acid]]s.

Sometimes, natural draft cooling towers are constructed with structural steel in place of concrete (RCC) when the construction time of natural draft cooling tower is exceeding the construction time of the rest of the plant or the local soil is of poor strength to bear the heavy weight of RCC cooling towers or cement prices are higher at a site to opt for cheaper natural draft cooling towers made of structural steel.

==Operation in freezing weather==
Some cooling towers (such as smaller building air conditioning systems) are shut down seasonally, drained, and winterized to prevent freeze damage.

During the winter, other sites continuously operate cooling towers with {{convert|4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} water leaving the tower.  Basin heaters, tower draindown, and other freeze protection methods are often employed in cold climates. Operational cooling towers with malfunctions can freeze during very cold weather. Typically, freezing starts at the corners of a cooling tower with a reduced or absent heat load. Severe freezing conditions can create growing volumes of ice, resulting in increased structural loads which can cause structural damage or collapse.

To prevent freezing, the following procedures are used:
* The use of water modulating by-pass systems is not recommended during freezing weather. In such situations, the control flexibility of variable speed motors, two-speed motors, and/or two-speed motors multi-cell towers should be considered a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spxcooling.com/library/detail/cooling-tower-fundamentals SPX Cooling Technologies MARLEY, Cooling Tower Fundamentals Page 73 (75 of 119) Column 2, Last Paragraph]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Do not operate the tower unattended.  Remote sensors and alarms may be installed to monitor tower conditions.
* Do not operate the tower without a heat load.  Basin heaters may be used to keep the water in the tower pan at an above-freezing temperature. Heat trace ("heating tape") is a resistive heating element that is installed along water pipes to prevent freezing in cold climates.
* Maintain design water flow rate over the tower fill.
* Manipulate or reduce airflow to maintain water temperature above freezing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://spxcooling.com/pdf/H-003B.pdf |title= SPX Cooling Technologies: Operating Cooling Towers in Freezing Weather |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927151339/http://spxcooling.com/pdf/H-003B.pdf |archivedate= 27 September 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.45&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire hazard==
Cooling towers constructed in whole or in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation. Such fires can become very intense, due to the high [[surface-volume ratio]] of the towers, and fires can be further intensified by natural convection or fan-assisted draft.  The resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure. For this reason, some [[model building code|code]]s and standards&lt;ref&gt;[[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA). NFPA 214, [http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=214 ''Standard on Water-Cooling Towers''].&lt;/ref&gt; recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic [[fire sprinkler system]]. Fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation (such as for maintenance or construction), and even while the tower is in operation, especially those of the induced-draft type, because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA 214, [http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=214 ''Standard on Water-Cooling Towers.''] Section A1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural stability==
Being very large structures, cooling towers are susceptible to wind damage, and several spectacular failures have occurred in the past. At [[Ferrybridge power station]] on 1 November 1965, the station was the site of a major [[structural failure]], when three of the cooling towers collapsed owing to vibrations in {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} winds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Although the structures had been built to withstand higher wind speeds, the shape of the cooling towers caused westerly winds to be funnelled into the towers themselves, creating a [[vortex]]. Three out of the original eight cooling towers were destroyed, and the remaining five were severely damaged. The towers were later rebuilt and all eight cooling towers were strengthened to tolerate adverse weather conditions. Building codes were changed to include improved structural support, and [[wind tunnel]] tests were introduced to check tower structures and configuration.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Within the study of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] [[many-body problem]] in [[physics]], the '''DMRG analysis of the Heisenberg model''' is an important theoretical example applying techniques of the [[density matrix renormalization group]] (DMRG) to the [[heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg model]] of a chain of spins.  This article presents the "infinite" DMRG algorithm for the &lt;math&gt;S=1&lt;/math&gt; antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, but the recipe can be applied for every translationally invariant one-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]].

DMRG  is a [[renormalization group|renormalization-group]] technique because it offers an efficient truncation of the [[Hilbert space]] of one-dimensional quantum systems.

==The algorithm==

===The Starting Point===
To simulate an infinite chain, starting with four sites. The first is the ''block site'', the last the ''universe-block site''  and the remaining are the ''added sites'', the right one is added to the universe-block site and the other to the block site.

The Hilbert space for the single site is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; with the base &lt;math&gt;\{|S,S_z\rangle\}\equiv\{|1,1\rangle,|1,0\rangle,|1,-1\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;. With this base the [[spin (physics)|spin]] operators are   &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_z&lt;/math&gt; for the single site. For every block, the two blocks and the two sites, there is its own Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_b&lt;/math&gt;, its base &lt;math&gt;\{|w_i\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;i:1\dots \dim(\mathfrak{H}_b)&lt;/math&gt;)and its own operators &lt;math&gt;O_b:\mathfrak{H}_b\rightarrow\mathfrak{H}_b&lt;/math&gt;:
  
*block: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{|u_i\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H_B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{x_B}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{y_B}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{z_B}&lt;/math&gt; 
*left-site: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_l&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{|t_i\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{x_l}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{y_l}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{z_l}&lt;/math&gt; 
*right-site: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{|s_i\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{x_r}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{y_r}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{z_r}&lt;/math&gt; 
*universe: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{|r_i\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H_U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{x_U}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{y_U}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{z_U}&lt;/math&gt; 
At the starting point all four Hilbert spaces are equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, all spin operators are equivalent to &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_B=H_U=0&lt;/math&gt;. This is always (at every iterations) true only for left and right sites.

===Step 1: Form the Hamiltonian matrix for the Superblock===
The ingredients are the four block operators and the four universe-block operators, which at the first iteration are &lt;math&gt;3\times3&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], the three left-site spin operators and the three right-site spin operators, which are always &lt;math&gt;3\times3&lt;/math&gt; matrices. The [[hamiltonian system|Hamiltonian]] matrix of the ''superblock''  (the chain), which at the first iteration has only four sites, is formed by these operators. In the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic S=1 model the Hamiltonian is:

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{H}_{SB}=-J\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle}\mathbf{S}_{x_i}\mathbf{S}_{x_j}+\mathbf{S}_{y_i}\mathbf{S}_{y_j}+\mathbf{S}_{z_i}\mathbf{S}_{z_j}
&lt;/math&gt;

These operators live in the superblock state space: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_{SB}=\mathfrak{H}_B\otimes\mathfrak{H}_l\otimes\mathfrak{H}_r\otimes\mathfrak{H}_U&lt;/math&gt;, the base is &lt;math&gt;\{|f\rangle=|u\rangle\otimes|t\rangle\otimes|s\rangle\otimes|r\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;. For example: (convention):

&lt;math&gt;
|1000\dots0\rangle\equiv|f_1\rangle=|u_1,t_1,s_1,r_1\rangle\equiv|100,100,100,100\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
|0100\dots0\rangle\equiv|f_2\rangle=|u_1,t_1,s_1,r_2\rangle\equiv|100,100,100,010\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

The Hamiltonian in the ''DMRG form'' is  (we set &lt;math&gt;J=-1&lt;/math&gt;):

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{H}_{SB}=\mathbf{H}_B+\mathbf{H}_U+\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle}\mathbf{S}_{x_i}\mathbf{S}_{x_j}+\mathbf{S}_{y_i}\mathbf{S}_{y_j}+\mathbf{S}_{z_i}\mathbf{S}_{z_j}
&lt;/math&gt;

The operators are &lt;math&gt;(d*3*3*d)\times(d*3*3*d)&lt;/math&gt; matrices, &lt;math&gt;d=\dim(\mathfrak{H}_B)\equiv\dim(\mathfrak{H}_U)&lt;/math&gt;, for example:

&lt;math&gt;
\langle f|\mathbf{H}_B|f'\rangle\equiv\langle u,t,s,r|H_B\otimes\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{I}|u',t',s',r'\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{S}_{x_B}\mathbf{S}_{x_l}=S_{x_B}\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{I}S_{x_l}\otimes\mathbb{I}\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{I}\mathbb{I}=S_{x_B}\otimes S_{x_l}\otimes\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{I}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Step 2: Diagonalize the superblock Hamiltonian===
At this point you must choose the [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenstate]] of the Hamiltonian for which some [[observable]]s is calculated, this is the ''target state'' . At the beginning you can choose the [[stationary state|ground state]] and use some advanced algorithm to find it, one of these is described in:
  
*''The Iterative Calculation of a Few of the Lowest Eigenvalues and Corresponding [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|Eigenvectors]] of Large Real-[[symmetric matrix|Symmetric Matrices]]'', [[Ernest R. Davidson]]; Journal of Computational Physics 17, 87-94 (1975) 
This step is the most time-consuming part of the algorithm.

If &lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle=\sum\Psi_{i,j,k,w}|u_i,t_j,s_k,r_w\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the target state, [[Expected value|expectation value]] of various operators can be measured at this point using &lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

===Step 3: Reduce density matrix===
Form the reduced density matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; for the first two block system, the block and the left-site. By definition it is the &lt;math&gt;(d*3)\times(d*3)&lt;/math&gt; matrix:
&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{i,j;i',j'}\equiv\sum_{k,w}\Psi_{i,j,k,w}\Psi_{i',j',k,w}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[Matrix diagonalization|Diagonalize]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and form the &lt;math&gt;m\times (d*3)&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, which rows are the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; eigenvectors associated with the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; largest eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;e_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is formed by the most significant eigenstates of the reduced density matrix. You choose &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; looking to the parameter &lt;math&gt;P_m\equiv\sum_{\alpha=1}^m e_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;1-P_m\cong 0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Step 4: New block and universe-block operators===
Form the &lt;math&gt;(d*3)\times(d*3)&lt;/math&gt; matrix representation of operators for the system composite of the block and left-site, and for the system composite of right-site and universe-block, for example:

&lt;math&gt;
H_{B-l}=H_B\otimes\mathbb{I}+S_{x_B}\otimes S_{x_l}+S_{y_B}\otimes S_{y_l}+S_{z_B}\otimes S_{z_l}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
S_{x_{B-l}}=\mathbb{I}\otimes S_{x_l}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
H_{r-U}=\mathbb{I}\otimes H_U+S_{x_r}\otimes S_{x_U}+S_{y_r}\otimes S_{y_U}+S_{z_r}\otimes S_{z_U}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
S_{x_{r-U}}=S_{x_r}\otimes\mathbb{I}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, form the &lt;math&gt;m\times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix representations of the new block and universe-block operators, form a new block by changing basis with the transformation &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, for example:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
&amp;H_B=TH_{B-l}T^\dagger

&amp;S_{x_B}=TS_{x_{B-l}}T^\dagger

\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
At this point the iteration is ended and the algorithm goes back to step 1.
The algorithm stops successfully when the observable converges to some value.

'''Drought tolerance''' is the ability to which a [[plant]] maintains its biomass production during [[arid]] or [[drought]] conditions. Some plants are naturally adapted to dry conditions and are called ''[[Xerophyte|xerophytes]],'' surviving with protection mechanisms such as [[desiccation tolerance]], [[detoxification]], or repair of [[xylem]] embolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tardieu|first=François|last2=Simonneau|first2=Thierry|last3=Muller|first3=Bertrand|date=2018-04-29|title=The Physiological Basis of Drought Tolerance in Crop Plants: A Scenario-Dependent Probabilistic Approach|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|language=en|volume=69|issue=1|pages=733–759|doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plants, specifically some crop varieties like corn, wheat, and rice, have become more tolerant to drought via [[Plant breeding|conventional breeding methods.]] More recently, methods of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineering]] drought tolerant plants have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Honghong|last2=Xiong|first2=Lizhong|date=2014-04-29|title=Genetic Engineering and Breeding of Drought-Resistant Crops|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-040000?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|language=en|volume=65|issue=1|pages=715–741|doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-040000|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms behind drought tolerance are complex and involve many pathways which allows plants to respond to specific sets of conditions at any given time. Some of these interactions include [[stomatal conductance]], [[carotenoid]] degradation and [[anthocyanin]] accumulation, the intervention of [[Osmoprotectant|osmoprotectants]] (such as [[sucrose]], [[glycine]], and [[proline]]), [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]]-scavenging enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varshney|first=Rajeev K|last2=Tuberosa|first2=Roberto|last3=Tardieu|first3=Francois|date=2018-06-08|title=Progress in understanding drought tolerance: from alleles to cropping systems|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5991209/|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=69|issue=13|pages=3175–3179|doi=10.1093/jxb/ery187|issn=0022-0957|pmc=5991209|pmid=29878257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular control of drought tolerance is also very complex and is influenced other factors such as environment and the [[Plant development|developmental stage]] of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/32/default.asp|title=Biotechnology for the Development of Drought Tolerant Crops - Pocket K {{!}} ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This control consists mainly of transcriptional factors, such as dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB), [[abscisic acid]] (ABA)- responsive element-binding factor (AREB), and NAM (no apical meristem). 


== Physiology of drought tolerance ==
Plants can be subjected to slowly developing water shortages (ie, taking days, weeks, or months), or they may face short-term deficits of water) (ie, hours to days). In these situations, plants adapt by responding accordingly, minimizing water loss and maximizing water uptake. Plants are more susceptible to drought stress during the reproductive stages of growth, flowering and seed development. Therefore, the combination of short-term plus long-term responses allow for plants to produce a few viable seeds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tardieu|first=François|last2=Simonneau|first2=Thierry|last3=Muller|first3=Bertrand|date=2018-04-29|title=The Physiological Basis of Drought Tolerance in Crop Plants: A Scenario-Dependent Probabilistic Approach|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|language=en|volume=69|issue=1|pages=733–759|doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of short-term and long-term physiological responses include:

=== Short-term responses ===

* In the leaf: root-signal recognition, stomatal closure, decreased carbon assimilation
* In the stem: inhibition of growth
* In the xylem: hydraulic changes, signal transport, assimilation of transport
* In the root: cell-drought signalling, osmotic adjustment

=== Long-term responses ===

* In the above-ground portion of the plant: inhibition of shoot growth, reduced transpiration area, grain abortion, senescence, metabolic acclimation, osmotic adjustment
* In the below-ground portion of the plant: turgor maintenance, sustained root growth, increased root/shoot, increased absorption area

&lt;br /&gt;
==Adaptations to dry conditions==
{{main|Xerophyte}}
Drought tolerant plants typically make use of either [[C4 carbon fixation]] or [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM) to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]] during [[photosynthesis]]. Both are improvements over the more common but more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]] pathway in that they are more energy efficient. CAM is particularly good for arid conditions because [[carbon dioxide]] can be taken up at night, allowing the [[stoma]]ta to stay closed during the heat of the day and thus reducing water loss.&lt;ref name=botany_online&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e24/24b.htm Botany online: Photosynthesis - C3, C4 and CAM. Regulation of The Activity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717231237/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e24/24b.htm |date=July 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many adaptations for dry conditions are structural, including the following:
*Adaptations of the [[stoma]]ta to reduce water loss, such as reduced numbers or waxy surfaces.
*Water storage in [[succulent plant|succulent]] above-ground parts or water-filled [[tuber]]s.
*Adaptations in the [[root]] system to increase [[water absorption]].
*[[Trichome]]s (small hairs) on the [[leaf|leaves]] to absorb atmospheric water.

==Importance for agriculture==
Arid conditions can lower the [[crop yield|yield]] of many [[crops]]. [[Plant breeding]] programs for improved yield during drought conditions have great economic importance, and these programs may be broad in scope. For example, one study on [[soybean]]s currently being conducted by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] is scheduled to span several years, with research taking place across that country, and has among its goals the identification of specific mechanism by which soybeans resist [[wilting]] and of the specific [[gene]]s for drought tolerance.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/projects.htm?accn_no=409278 ARS Project: Drought Stress Tolerance for the Midwest and South; Soybean Variety Improvement (Continuation) (409278)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in horticulture==
In landscapes in arid or drought-prone regions, drought tolerance is an important consideration in plant selection. [[Xeriscaping]] is an approach to landscaping first developed in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], a region with hot, dry summers. The use of drought tolerant plants is essential to a successful xeriscape, which ideally requires no supplemental [[irrigation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3049">'''Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems''' ('''DDDAS''') is a new paradigm whereby the computation and instrumentation aspects of an application system are dynamically integrated in a feed-back control loop, in the sense that instrumentation data can be dynamically incorporated into the executing model of the application, and in reverse the executing model can control the instrumentation.  Such approaches have been shown that can enable more accurate and faster modeling and analysis of the characteristics and behaviors of a system and can exploit data in intelligent ways to convert them to new capabilities, including decision support systems with the accuracy of full scale modeling, efficient data collection, management, and data mining. The DDDAS concept - and the term - was proposed by [[Frederica Darema]] for the [https://www.nsf.gov/cise/cns/darema/dd_das/index_wkshp.jsp National Science Foundation (NSF) workshop in March 2000].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11269">'''Ecological forecasting''' uses knowledge of physics, ecology and physiology to predict how ecological [[Population|populations]], [[Community (ecology)|communities]], or [[ecosystem]]s will change in the future in response to environmental factors such as [[climate change]]. The ultimate goal of the approach is to provide people such as resource managers and designers of [[marine reserve]]s with information that they can then use to respond, in advance, to future changes,&lt;ref name="Clark et al. 2001"&gt;Clark et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[adaptation to global warming]].

One of the most important environmental factors for organisms today is [[global warming]].  Most physiological processes are affected by [[temperature]], and so even small changes in [[weather]] and [[climate]] can lead to large changes in the growth, reproduction and survival of animals and plants.  The [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]]&lt;ref&gt;

is that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human activity caused most of the warming observed since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial era]]. These changes are in turn affecting human and natural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;CCSP 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One major challenge is to predict where, when and with what magnitude changes are likely to occur so that we can mitigate or at least prepare for them.&lt;ref name="Clark et al. 2001"/&gt; Ecological forecasting applies existing knowledge of how animals and plants interact with their physical environment&lt;ref name="Kearney 2006"&gt;Kearney 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to ask how changes in  environmental factors might result in changes to the ecosystems as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wethey and Woodin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Ecological forecasting varies in spatial and temporal extent, as well as in what is being forecast (presence, abundance, diversity, production, etc.).

* Population models may be used to generate short-term abundance forecasts using knowledge of [[population dynamics]] and recent environmental conditions. These models are used especially in [[Population dynamics of fisheries|fisheries]] and [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|disease]] forecasting. 
* [[Environmental niche modelling|Species distribution models]] (SDMs) may be used to forecast [[species distribution]] (presence or abundance) over longer ecological time scales using information about past and projected environmental conditions across the landscape.
** Correlative SDMs, also known as climate envelope models, rely on statistical correlations between existing species distributions (range boundaries) and environmental variables to outline a range (envelope) of environmental conditions within which a species can exist.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;Pearson and Dawson 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elith|first=Jane|last2=Leathwick|first2=John R.|date=2009|title=Species Distribution Models: Ecological Explanation and Prediction Across Space and Time|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=677–697|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159|issn=1543-592X}}&lt;/ref&gt; New range boundaries can then be forecast using future levels of environmental factors such as [[temperature]], [[rainfall]], and [[salinity]] from climate model projections. These methods are good for examining large numbers of species, but are likely not a good means of predicting effects at fine scales.
** Mechanistic SDMs use information about a species' physiological tolerances and constraints, as well as models of organismal body temperature and other biophysical properties, to define the range of environmental conditions within which a species can exist. These tolerances are mapped onto current and projected environmental conditions in the landscape to outline current and forecasted ranges for the species.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to "climate envelope" approaches, mechanistic SDMs model the fundamental niche directly, and are therefore much more exact.&lt;ref name="Kearney 2006" /&gt;  However, the approach requires more information is also usually more time consuming.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;
*Other types of models may be used to forecast (or hindcast) biodiversity over evolutionary time scales. Palaeobiology modeling uses fossil and phylogenetic evidence of biodiversity in the past to project the trajectory of biodiversity in the future. Simple plots can be constructed and then adjusted based on the varying quality of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sahney, S.|author2=Benton, M.J.|author3=Ferry, P.A.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2010|title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=4|pages=544–547|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024|pmc=2936204|pmid=20106856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forecasting examples==

===Biodiversity===
Using fossil evidence, studies have shown that vertebrate biodiversity has grown exponentially through Earth's history and that biodiversity is entwined with the diversity of Earth's habitats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">The '''Escuela Superior Latinoamericana de Informática''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Latin American Superior School of Informatics", ESLAI) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] undergraduate school of [[computer science]] established in 1986. Classes were held in a former countryhouse at the Pereyra Iraola Park in [[Buenos Aires Province]], at approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km from [[Buenos Aires]].

The school had Argentine mathematician [[Manuel Sadosky]] among its main founders. In spite of its short life, it had a considerable impact on informatics teaching and research in Argentina and [[South America]]. ESLAI courses were attended by students from several Spanish-speaking countries in South America such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. All students had a full scholarship and the admission process was passed by about 15% of applicants. 

The school established cooperation programs with a number of foreign universities in the [[Americas]] as well as in [[Europe]]. Those agreements sponsored important visitors to the school, such as [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]], [[Jean-Raymond Abrial]], Ugo Montanari, [[Carlo Ghezzi]] and Giorgio Ausiello, and enabled its students to attend graduate school at foreign universities.

The school had a remarkable European influence and was oriented towards theoretical aspects of computer science, such as [[typed lambda calculus]], [[formal verification]], and Martin-Löf's [[intuitionistic type theory]].

Unfortunately, the school was never able to develop a relationship with local companies, which in an emergent economy like Argentina's is essential to be involved with more practical problems. Without financial support, ESLAI had to close down in September 1990 during the [[president of Argentina|presidency]] of [[Carlos Menem]].

'''Evolution of cells''' refers to the evolutionary origin and subsequent evolutionary development of [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Cells first emerged at least 3.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Origin1"&gt;Schopf, JW, Kudryavtsev, AB, Czaja, AD, and Tripathi, AB. (2007).

==The first cells==
{{Life timeline}}{{main|Abiogenesis|Earliest known life forms}}
The origin of cells was the most important step in the evolutionary theory of life on Earth. The birth of the cell marked the passage from pre-biotic chemistry to partitioned units resembling modern cells. The final transition to living entities that fulfill all the definitions of modern cells depended on the ability to evolve effectively by natural selection. This transition has been called the [[Darwinian transition]].

If life is viewed from the point of view of [[DNA replication|replicator]] molecules, cells satisfy two fundamental conditions: protection from the outside environment and confinement of biochemical activity. The former condition is needed to keep complex molecules stable in a varying and sometimes aggressive environment; the latter is fundamental for the evolution of [[biocomplexity]]. If the freely floating molecules that code for [[enzyme]]s are not enclosed in cells, the enzymes will automatically benefit the neighbouring replicator molecules. The consequences of diffusion in non-partitioned life forms might be viewed as "[[parasitism]] by default." Therefore, the [[natural selection|selection pressure]] on replicator molecules will be lower, as the 'lucky' molecule that produces the better enzyme has no definitive advantage over its close neighbors. If the molecule is enclosed in a cell membrane, then the enzymes coded will be available only to the replicator molecule itself. That molecule will uniquely benefit from the enzymes it codes for, giving it a better chance to multiply.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Partitioning may have begun from cell-like spheroids formed by [[proteinoid]]s, which are observed by heating [[amino acid]]s with [[phosphoric acid]] as a catalyst. They bear much of the basic features provided by cell membranes. Proteinoid-based protocells enclosing RNA molecules could have been the first cellular life forms on Earth.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Another possibility is that the shores of the ancient coastal waters may have served as a mammoth laboratory, aiding in the countless experiments necessary to bring about the first cell. Waves breaking on the shore create a delicate foam composed of bubbles. Shallow coastal waters also tend to be warmer, further concentrating the molecules through [[evaporation]]. While bubbles made mostly of water tend to burst quickly, oily bubbles are much more stable, lending more time to the particular bubble to perform these crucial experiments. The [[phospholipid]] is a good example of a common oily compound prevalent in the prebiotic seas.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Phospholipids are composed of a [[hydrophilic]] head on one end, and a [[hydrophobic]] tail on the other. They possess an important characteristic for the construction of cell membranes; they can come together to form a [[Lipid bilayer|bilayer]] membrane. A lipid monolayer bubble can only contain oil, and is not conducive to harbouring water-soluble organic molecules, but a lipid bilayer bubble [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/P/Phospholipids.html] can contain water, and was a likely precursor to the modern cell membrane.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} If a protein came along that increased the integrity of its parent bubble, then that bubble had an advantage.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Primitive reproduction may have occurred when the bubbles burst, releasing the results of the experiment into the surrounding medium. Once enough of the right compounds were released into the medium, the development of the first [[prokaryotes]], [[eukaryotes]], and multi-cellular organisms could be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;This theory is expanded upon in ''The Cell: Evolution of the First Organism'' by Joseph Panno&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Community metabolism==
The common ancestor of the now existing cellular lineages (eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea) may have been a community of organisms that readily exchanged components and genes. It would have contained:
* [[Autotroph]]s that produced organic compounds from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, either photosynthetically or by inorganic chemical reactions;
* [[Heterotroph]]s that obtained organics by leakage from other organisms
* [[Saprotrophs]] that absorbed nutrients from decaying organisms
* [[Phagotrophs]] that were sufficiently complex to envelop and digest particulate nutrients, including other organisms.

The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a [[symbiosis|symbiotic community]] of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts are remnants of ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]], respectively, where at least part of the rest of the cell may have been derived from an ancestral [[archaea]]n prokaryote cell. This concept is often termed the [[endosymbiotic theory]]. There is still debate about whether organelles like the [[hydrogenosome]] predated the origin of [[mitochondria]], or ''vice versa'': see the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] for the origin of eukaryotic cells.

How the current lineages of microbes evolved from this postulated community is currently unsolved but subject to intense research by biologists, stimulated by the great flow of new discoveries in [[genomics|genome science]].&lt;ref name="Kurland CG 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1121674 | last1 = Kurland | first1 = CG | last2 = Collins | year = 2006 | first2 = LJ | last3 = Penny | first3 = D | title = Genomics and the irreducible nature of eukaryote cells | url = | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5776| pages = 1011–4 | pmid = 16709776 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1011K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic code and the RNA world==
Modern evidence suggests that early cellular evolution occurred in a biological realm radically distinct from modern biology. It is thought that in this ancient realm, the current genetic role of DNA was largely filled by RNA, and catalysis also was largely mediated by RNA (that is, by [[ribozyme]] counterparts of enzymes). This concept is known as the [[RNA world hypothesis]].

According to this hypothesis, the ancient RNA world transitioned into the modern cellular world via the evolution of protein synthesis, followed by replacement of many cellular ribozyme catalysts by protein-based enzymes. Proteins are much more flexible in catalysis than RNA due to the existence of diverse amino acid side chains with distinct chemical characteristics. The RNA record in existing cells appears to preserve some 'molecular fossils' from this RNA world. These RNA fossils include the ribosome itself (in which RNA catalyses peptide-bond formation), the modern ribozyme catalyst [[RNase P]], and tRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid9419221"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/PL00006275 |vauthors=Poole AM, Jeffares DC, Penny D |title=The path from the RNA world |journal=J Mol Evol |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |year=1998 |pmid=9419221|bibcode=1998JMolE..46....1P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9419222"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/PL00006280 |vauthors=Jeffares DC, Poole AM, Penny D |title=Relics from the RNA world |journal=J Mol Evol |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=18–36 |year=1998 |pmid=9419222|bibcode=1998JMolE..46...18J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15217990"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10409230490460765 |author=Orgel LE |title=Prebiotic chemistry and the origin of the RNA world |journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=99–123 |year= 2004|pmid=15217990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2476811"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.86.18.7054 |author=Benner SA, Ellington AD, Tauer A |title=Modern metabolism as a palimpsest of the RNA world |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=86 |issue=18 |pages=7054–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2476811 |pmc=297992|bibcode = 1989PNAS...86.7054B |last2=Ellington |last3=Tauer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearly universal [[genetic code]] preserves some evidence for the RNA world. For instance, recent studies of transfer RNAs, the enzymes that charge them with amino acids (the first step in protein synthesis) and the way these components recognise and exploit the genetic code, have been used to suggest that the universal genetic code emerged before the evolution of the modern amino acid activation method for protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="pmid9419221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9419222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17110438"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608762103 |author=Hohn MJ, Park HS, O'Donoghue P, Schnitzbauer M, Söll D |title=Emergence of the universal genetic code imprinted in an RNA record |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=103 |issue=48 |pages=18095–100 |year=2006 |pmid=17110438 |pmc=1838712|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10318095H |last2=Park |last3=O'Donoghue |last4=Schnitzbauer |last5=Soll }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14665676"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/MMBR.67.4.550-573.2003 |vauthors=O'Donoghue P, Luthey-Schulten Z |title=On the Evolution of Structure in Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=550–73 |year=2003 |pmid=14665676 |pmc=309052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gesteland, RF ''et al.'' eds.(2006) The RNA World: The Nature of Modern RNA Suggests a Prebiotic RNA (2006) (Cold Spring Harbor Lab Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY,).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical patterns==
Although the evolutionary origins of the major lineages of modern cells are disputed, the primary distinctions between the three major lineages of cellular life (called domains) are firmly established.

In each of these three domains, [[DNA replication]], [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]], and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] all display distinctive features. There are three versions of ribosomal RNAs, and generally three versions of each ribosomal protein, one for each domain of life. These three versions of the protein synthesis apparatus are called the ''canonical patterns'', and the existence of these canonical patterns provides the basis for a definition of the three domains - ''[[Bacteria]]'', ''[[Archaea]]'', and [[Eukaryote|''Eukarya'' (or ''Eukaryota'')]] - of currently existing cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80284-6 | last1 = Olsen | first1 = GJ | last2 = Woese | first2 = CR | last3 = Ibba | first3 = M. | last4 = Soll | first4 = D. | title = Archaeal genomics: an overview | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 7 | pages = 991–4 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9215619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using genomics to infer early lines of evolution==
Instead of relying a single gene such as the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene to reconstruct early evolution, or a few genes, scientific effort has shifted to analyzing complete genome sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Daubin |first1= V |last2= Moran |first2= NA |last3= Ochman |first3= H |title= Phylogenetics and the cohesion of bacterial genomes |journal= Science |volume= 301 |issue= 5634 |pages= 829–32 |year= 2003 |pmid= 12907801 |doi= 10.1126/science.1086568|bibcode = 2003Sci...301..829D }}

Evolutionary trees based only on SSU rRNA alone do not capture the events of early eukaryote evolution accurately, and the progenitors of the first nucleated cells are still uncertain. For instance, analysis of the complete genome of the eukaryote yeast shows that many of its genes are more closely related to bacterial genes than they are to archaea, and it is now clear that archaea were not the simple progenitors of the eukaryotes, in contradiction to earlier findings based on SSU rRNA and limited samples of other genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esser | first1 = C | last2 = Ahmadinejad | first2 = N | last3 = Wiegand | first3 = C | last4 = Rotte | first4 = C | last5 = Sebastiani | first5 = F | last6 = Gelius-Dietrich | first6 = G | last7 = Henze | first7 = K | last8 = Kretschmann | first8 = E | last9 = Richly | first9 = E | last10 = Leister | first10 = D | last11 = Bryant | first11 = D | last12 = Steel | first12 = M.

One hypothesis is that the first nucleated cell arose from two distinctly different ancient prokaryotic (non-nucleated) species that had formed a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with one another to carry out different aspects of metabolism. One partner of this symbiosis is proposed to be a bacterial cell, and the other an archaeal cell. It is postulated that this symbiotic partnership progressed via the cellular fusion of the partners to generate a [[chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] or hybrid cell with a membrane bound internal structure that was the forerunner of the nucleus. The next stage in this scheme was transfer of both partner genomes into the nucleus and their fusion with one another. Several variations of this hypothesis for the origin of nucleated cells have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh160 | last1 = Esser | first1 = C | last2 = Ahmadinejad | year = 2004 | first2 = N | last3 = Wiegand | first3 = C | last4 = Rotte | first4 = C | last5 = Sebastiani | first5 = F | last6 = Gelius-Dietrich | first6 = G | last7 = Henze | first7 = K | last8 = Kretschmann | first8 = E | last9 = Richly | first9 = E | last10 = Leister | first10 = D | last11 = Bryant | first11 = D | last12 = Steel | first12 = M.

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The First Cell arose in the previously pre-biotic world with the coming together of several entities that gave a single vesicle the unique chance to carry out three essential and quite different life processes. These were: (a) to copy informational macromolecules, (b) to carry out specific catalytic functions, and (c) to couple energy from the environment into usable chemical forms. These would foster subsequent cellular evolution and metabolism. Each of these three essential processes probably originated and was lost many times prior to The First Cell, but only when these three occurred together was life jump-started and Darwinian evolution of organisms began." (Koch and Silver, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = AL | last2 = Silver | first2 = S | title = The first cell | journal = Advances in microbial physiology | volume = 50 | pages = 227–59 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16221582 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2911(05)50006-7 | series = Advances in Microbial Physiology | isbn = 9780120277506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The evolution of modern cells is arguably the most challenging and important problem the field of Biology has ever faced. In Darwin's day the problem could hardly be imagined. For much of the 20th century it was intractable. In any case, the problem lay buried in the catch-all rubric "origin of life"---where, because it is a biological not a (bio)chemical problem, it was effectively ignored. Scientific interest in cellular evolution started to pick up once the universal phylogenetic tree, the framework within which the problem had to be addressed, was determined . But it was not until microbial genomics arrived on the scene that biologists could actually do much about the problem of cellular evolution."

[[File:BadElster Schandfleck4549.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bad Elster]], [[Saxony]], [[Germany]] in April 2008. Wettiner Hof Hotel is awaiting renovation- locally it is known as the Schandfleck (the Eyesore).]]
An '''eyesore''' is something that is largely considered to look unpleasant or ugly. Its technical usage is as an alternative perspective to the notion of [[landmark]]. Common examples include [[dilapidation|dilapidated]] [[buildings]], [[graffiti]], [[litter]], [[pollution|polluted areas]], and excessive commercial [[signage]] such as [[billboards]]. Some eyesores may be a matter of opinion such as controversial [[modern architecture]] (see also [[spite house]]), [[transmission tower]]s or [[wind turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jun/25/uk.renewableenergy|title=Homeowners get green light for 'eyesore' wind turbines|author=Nick Mathiason|date=June 25, 2006|publisher=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6763067.stm|title=Eyesore or gem: Gateshead car park |publisher=BBC|date= 18 June 2007 | first=Building | last=Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural eyesores include [[feces]], [[mud]] and [[weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BL4Xrx-IFowC|page=255|title=Professional Planting Design|author=Scott C. Scarfone | isbn=978-0-471-76139-6 | year=2007 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on property values==
In the USA, the [[National Association of Realtors]] says an eyesore can shave about 10% off the value of a nearby listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dealing with an eyesore next door |url=http://realestate.msn.com/Selling/Article_mw.aspx?cp-documentid=5249535 |author=Rachel Koning Beals |accessdate=2008-03-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312214811/http://realestate.msn.com/Selling/Article_mw.aspx?cp-documentid=5249535 |archivedate=2008-03-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remediation==

Clean-up programmes to improve or remove eyesores are often started by local bodies or even national governments. These are frequently called ''Operation Eyesore''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 9, 1972|title=British Start 'Operation Eyesore' Cleanup}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High-profile international events such as the [[Olympic Games]] usually trigger such activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=New York Times|title=Russians Paint and Fuss As Olympic Games Near Putting Best Face on Things A Gleaming Soviet Capital Emigrate or Face Arrest|date=June 28, 1980|author=Craig R. Whitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others contend that it is best to nip such problems in the bud by addressing them while they are small, since signs of neglect encourage [[anti-social behaviour]] such as [[vandalism]] and [[fly-tipping]]. This strategy is known as ''[[Fixing Broken Windows|fixing broken windows]]''.

==Controversy==

Whether some constructions are eyesores is a matter of opinion which may change over time. [[Landmark]]s are often called eyesores.

===Examples of divided opinion===
[[File:Federation Square (SBS Building).jpg|thumb|right|[[Federation Square]] has divided opinion in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=Fed/&gt;]]
* [[Eiffel Tower]] – Upon its construction, Parisians wanted it torn down as an eyesore. Nowadays it is one of the world's top landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|

* [[One Rincon Hill]] – Situated just south of [[San Francisco]]'s [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]], this high-rise condominium surrounded by shorter buildings has generated some mixed reviews.
* [[Lloyd's building]] – Situated in the [[City of London]], this building was described as an [[oil refinery]] when it was opened in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.inlondonguide.co.uk/london-buildings/city/81-lloyds-building-insurance.html|title=The Lloyd's Building|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for having most of its facilities, stairways and [[Air Conditioning|AC]] on the outside. Some people still say this, although the building has become more popular and liked in the recent years.
* [[Tour Montparnasse]] - lone skyscraper in the [[Montparnasse]] area of [[Paris]], [[France]]. Its appearance mars the Paris urban landscape, and construction of skyscrapers have been banned in the city two years after its completion. A 2008 poll of editors on [[Virtualtourist]] voted the building the second ugliest building in the world. It is sometimes said that the view from the top is the most beautiful in Paris, because it is the only place from which the tower itself cannot be seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5803">The '''Gateway cloning System''', invented and commercialized by [[Invitrogen]] since the late 1990s, is a molecular biology method that enables researchers to efficiently transfer DNA-fragments between [[plasmid]]s using a proprietary set of recombination sequences, the "Gateway att" sites, and two proprietary enzyme mixes, called "LR Clonase", and "BP Clonase". Gateway Cloning Technique allows transfer of DNA fragments between different cloning vectors while maintaining the [[reading frame]]. Using Gateway, one can clone [[subcloning|subclone]] DNA segments for functional analysis. The system requires the initial insertion of a DNA fragment into a plasmid with two flanking recombination sequences called “att L 1” and “att L 2”, to develop a “Gateway Entry clone” (special Invitrogen nomenclature).

Large archives of Gateway Entry clones, containing the vast majority of human, mouse and rat ORFs ([[open reading frame]]s) have been cloned from human [[complementary DNA|cDNA]] libraries or chemically synthesized to support the research community using [[NIH]] (National Institutes of Health) funding (e.g., Mammalian Gene Collection, http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/). The availability of these gene cassettes in a standard Gateway cloning plasmid helps researchers quickly transfer these cassettes into plasmids that facilitate the analysis of gene function. Gateway cloning does take more time for initial set-up, and is more expensive than traditional restriction enzyme and ligase-based cloning methods, but it saves time, and offers simpler and highly efficient cloning for down-stream applications.

The technology has been widely adopted by the life science research community especially for applications that require the transfer of thousands of DNA fragments into one type of plasmid (e.g., one containing a CMV promoter for protein expression in mammalian cells), or for the transfer of one DNA fragment into many different types of plasmids (e.g., for bacterial, insect and mammalian protein expression).

== Basic Steps ==
The first step in Gateway cloning is the preparation of a Gateway Entry clone. Entry clones are often made in two steps:

1) “Gateway attB1, and attB2” sequences are added to the 5’, and 3’ end of a gene fragment, respectively, using gene specific PCR primers and [[PCR]]-amplification;

2) the PCR amplification products are then mixed with special [[plasmids]] called Gateway “Donor vectors” (Invitrogen nomenclature) and the proprietary “BP Clonase” enzyme mix. The enzyme mix catalyzes the recombination and insertion of the att-B-sequence-containing PCR product into the att P recombination sites in the Gateway Donor vector. Once the cassette is part of the target plasmid, it is called an "Entry clone" in the Gateway nomenclature, and recombination sequences are referred to as the Gateway “att L” type.

The gene cassette in the Gateway Entry clone can then be simply and efficiently transferred into any Gateway Destination vector (Invitrogen nomenclature for any Gateway plasmid that contains Gateway “att R” recombination sequences and elements such as promoters and epitope tags, but not [[open reading frame|ORF]]s) using the proprietary enzyme mix, “LR Clonase”. Thousands of Gateway Destination plasmids have been made and are freely shared amongst researchers across the world. Gateway Destination vectors are similar to classical expression vectors containing multiple cloning sites, before the insertion of a gene of interest, using restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Gateway Destination vectors are commercially available from Invitrogen, EMD ([[Merck KGaA|Novagen]]) and Covalys.

Since Gateway cloning uses patented recombination sequences, and proprietary enzyme mixes available only from Invitrogen, the technology does not allow researchers to switch vendors and contributes to the [[Vendor lock-in|lock-in effect]] of all such patented procedures.

To summarize the different steps involved in Gateway cloning:
* Gateway BP reaction: PCR-product with flanking att B sites (this step can also use other methods of DNA isolation, such as restriction-digestion) + Donor vector containing att P sites + BP clonase =&gt; Gateway Entry clone, containing att L sites, flanking gene of interest
* Gateway LR reaction: Entry clone containing att L sites + Destination vector containing att R sites, and promoters and tags + LR clonase =&gt; Expression clone containing att B sites, flanking gene of interest, ready for gene expression.

In [[coding theory]], '''Hamming(7,4)''' is a [[linear code|linear error-correcting code]] that encodes four [[bit]]s of data into seven bits by adding three [[parity bit]]s. It is a member of a larger family of  [[Hamming code]]s, but the term ''Hamming code'' often refers to this specific code that [[Richard W. Hamming]] introduced in 1950. At the time, Hamming worked at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] and was frustrated with the error-prone [[punched card]] reader, which is why he started working on error-correcting codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biobio.loc.edu/chu/web/Courses/Cosi460/hamming_codes.htm | title = History of Hamming Codes | accessdate = 2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hamming code adds three additional check bits to every four data bits of the message. Hamming's (7,4) [[algorithm]] can correct any single-bit error, or detect all single-bit and two-bit errors. In other words, the minimal [[Hamming distance]] between any two correct codewords is 3, and received words can be correctly decoded if they are at a distance of at most one from the codeword that was transmitted by the sender. This means that for transmission medium situations where [[error burst|burst errors]] do not occur, Hamming's (7,4) code is effective (as the medium would have to be extremely noisy for two out of seven bits to be flipped).

In [[quantum information]], the Hamming (7,4) is used as the base for the [[Steane code]], a type of [[CSS code]] used for [[quantum error correction]]. 

== Goal ==
The goal of the Hamming codes is to create a set of [[parity bit]]s that overlap such that a single-bit error (the bit is logically flipped in value) in a data bit ''or'' a parity bit can be detected ''and'' corrected. While multiple overlaps can be created, the general method is presented in [[Hamming code#Hamming codes|Hamming codes]].

This table describes which parity bits cover which transmitted bits in the encoded word. For example, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provides an even parity for bits 2, 3, 6, and 7. It also details which transmitted bit is covered by which parity bit by reading the column. For example, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is covered by ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but not ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; This table will have a striking resemblance to the parity-check matrix ('''H''') in the next section.

Furthermore, if the parity columns in the above table were removed

! !! &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;d_3&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;d_4&lt;/math&gt;

then resemblance to rows 1, 2, and 4 of the code generator matrix ('''G''') below will also be evident.

So, by picking the parity bit coverage correctly, all errors with a Hamming distance of 1 can be detected and corrected, which is the point of using a Hamming code.

== Hamming matrices ==
Hamming codes can be computed in [[linear algebra]] terms through [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] because Hamming codes are [[linear code]]s. For the purposes of Hamming codes, two '''Hamming matrices''' can be defined: the '''code [[generator matrix]]''' '''G''' and the '''[[parity-check matrix]]''' '''H''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} := \begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \mathbf{H} := \begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Hamming(7,4) as bits.svg|thumb|300px|Bit position of the data and parity bits]]
As mentioned above, rows 1, 2, and 4 of '''G''' should look familiar as they map the data bits to their parity bits:
* ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; covers ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; covers ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; covers ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
The remaining rows (3, 5, 6, 7) map the data to their position in encoded form and there is only 1 in that row so it is an identical copy. In fact, these four rows are [[linearly independent]] and form the [[identity matrix]] (by design, not coincidence).

Also as mentioned above, the three rows of '''H''' should be familiar. These rows are used to compute the '''syndrome vector''' at the receiving end and if the syndrome vector is the [[null vector (vector space)|null vector]] (all zeros) then the received word is error-free; if non-zero then the value indicates which bit has been flipped.

The four data bits &amp;mdash; assembled as a vector '''p''' &amp;mdash; is pre-multiplied by '''G''' (i.e., '''Gp''') and taken [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 2 to yield the encoded value that is transmitted. The original 4 data bits are converted to seven bits (hence the name "Hamming(7,4)") with three parity bits added to ensure even parity using the above data bit coverages. The first table above shows the mapping between each data and parity bit into its final bit position (1 through 7) but this can also be presented in a [[Venn diagram]]. The first diagram in this article shows three circles (one for each parity bit) and encloses data bits that each parity bit covers. The second diagram (shown to the right) is identical but, instead, the bit positions are marked.

For the remainder of this section, the following 4 bits (shown as a column vector) will be used as a running example:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\ d_2 \\ d_3 \\ d_4 \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Channel coding ==
[[Image:Hamming(7,4) example 1011.svg|thumb|300px|Mapping in the example '''x'''. The parity of the red, green, and blue circles are even.]]

Suppose we want to transmit this data (&lt;code&gt;1011&lt;/code&gt;) over a [[signal noise|noisy]] [[channel (communications)|communications channel]]. Specifically, a [[binary symmetric channel]] meaning that error corruption does not favor either zero or one (it is symmetric in causing errors). Furthermore, all source vectors are assumed to be equiprobable. We take the product of '''G''' and '''p''', with entries modulo 2, to determine the transmitted codeword '''x''':

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{G} \mathbf{p} =
\begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This means that &lt;code&gt;0110011&lt;/code&gt; would be transmitted instead of transmitting &lt;code&gt;1011&lt;/code&gt;.

Programmers concerned about multiplication should observe that each row of the result is the least significant bit of the [[Hamming weight|Population Count]] of set bits resulting from the row and column being [[Bitwise AND]]ed together rather than multiplied.

In the adjacent diagram, the seven bits of the encoded word are inserted into their respective locations; from inspection it is clear that the parity of the red, green, and blue circles are even:
* red circle has two 1's
* green circle has two 1's
* blue circle has four 1's

What will be shown shortly is that if, during transmission, a bit is flipped then the parity of two or all three circles will be incorrect and the errored bit can be determined (even if one of the parity bits) by knowing that the parity of all three of these circles should be even.

== Parity check ==
If no error occurs during transmission, then the received codeword '''r''' is identical to the transmitted codeword '''x''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

The receiver multiplies '''H''' and '''r''' to obtain the '''syndrome''' vector '''z''', which indicates whether an error has occurred, and if so, for which codeword bit.  Performing this multiplication (again, entries modulo 2):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{r} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the syndrome '''z''' is the [[null vector (vector space)|null vector]], the receiver can conclude that no error has occurred.  This conclusion is based on the observation that when the data vector is multiplied by '''G''', a change of basis occurs into a vector subspace that is the [[kernel (matrix)|kernel]] of '''H'''.  As long as nothing happens during transmission, '''r''' will remain in the kernel of '''H''' and the multiplication will yield the null vector.

== Error correction ==
Otherwise, suppose a ''single'' bit error has occurred.  Mathematically, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}  = \mathbf{x} +\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;

modulo 2, where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i_{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[unit vector]], that is, a zero vector with a 1 in the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt;, counting from 1.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the above expression signifies a single bit error in the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; place.

Now, if we multiply this vector by '''H''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Hr} = \mathbf{H} \left( \mathbf{x}+\mathbf{e}_i \right) = \mathbf{Hx} + \mathbf{He}_i&lt;/math&gt;

Since '''x''' is the transmitted data, it is without error, and as a result, the product of '''H''' and '''x''' is zero. Thus

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Hx} + \mathbf{He}_i = \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{He}_i = \mathbf{He}_i&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the product of '''H''' with the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; standard basis vector picks out that column of '''H''', we know the error occurs in the place where this column of  '''H''' occurs.

For example, suppose we have introduced a bit error on bit #5

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{x}+\mathbf{e}_5 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Hamming(7,4) example 1011 bit 5 error.svg|thumb|300px|A bit error on bit 5 causes bad parity in the red and green circles]]
The diagram to the right shows the bit error (shown in blue text) and the bad parity created (shown in red text) in the red and green circles. The bit error can be detected by computing the parity of the red, green, and blue circles. If a bad parity is detected then the data bit that overlaps ''only'' the bad parity circles is the bit with the error. In the above example, the red and green circles have bad parity so the bit corresponding to the intersection of red and green but not blue indicates the errored bit.

Now,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{Hr} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ \end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} =  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which corresponds to the fifth column of '''H'''. Furthermore, the general algorithm used (''see [[Hamming code#General algorithm]]'') was intentional in its construction so that the syndrome of 101 corresponds to the binary value of 5, which indicates the fifth bit was corrupted. Thus, an error has been detected in bit 5, and can be corrected (simply flip or negate its value):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}_{\text{corrected}} =  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \overline{1} \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This corrected received value indeed, now, matches the transmitted value '''x''' from above.

== Decoding ==
Once the received vector has been determined to be error-free or corrected if an error occurred (assuming only zero or one bit errors are possible) then the received data needs to be decoded back into the original four bits.

First, define a matrix '''R''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Then the received value, '''p&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''', is equal to '''Rr'''. Using the running example from above

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p_r} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

== Multiple bit errors ==
[[Image:Hamming(7,4) example 1011 bits 4 &amp; 5 error.svg|thumb|300px|A bit error on bit 4 &amp; 5 are introduced (shown in blue text) with a bad parity only in the green circle (shown in red text)]]

It is not difficult to show that only single bit errors can be corrected using this scheme. Alternatively, Hamming codes can be used to detect single and double bit errors, by merely noting that the product of '''H''' is nonzero whenever errors have occurred. In the adjacent diagram, bits 4 and 5 were flipped. This yields only one circle (green) with an invalid parity but the errors are not recoverable.

However, the Hamming (7,4) and similar Hamming codes cannot distinguish between single-bit errors and two-bit errors. That is, two-bit errors appear the same as one-bit errors. If error correction is performed on a two-bit error the result will be incorrect.

Similarly, Hamming codes cannot detect or recover from an arbitrary three-bit error; Consider the diagram: if the bit in the green circle (colored red) were 1, the parity checking would return the null vector, indicating that there is no error in the codeword.

{{clear}}

== All codewords ==
Since the source is only 4 bits then there are only 16 possible transmitted words. Included is the eight-bit value if an extra parity bit is used (''see [[Hamming code#.5B7.2C4.5D Hamming code with an additional parity bit|Hamming(7,4) code with an additional parity bit]]''). (The data bits are shown in blue; the parity bits are shown in red; and the extra parity bit shown in green.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2115">'''Heterotrophic nutrition''' is the mode of nutrition in which organisms depend upon other organisms to survive. 
All animals and non green plants are heterotrophic.

Heterotrophic organisms have to acquire and take in all the organic substances they need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/22/m022p101.pdf Heterotrophic nutrition and control of bacterial density]&lt;/ref&gt;

All heterotrophs (except blood and gut [[parasite]]s) have to convert solid food into soluble compounds capable of being absorbed (digestion).Then the soluble products of digestion for the organism are being broken down for the release of energy (respiration). All heterotrophs depend on [[Autotroph|autotrophs]] for their nutrition. Heterotrophic plants have only four types.

The four main types of heterotrophic nutrition are: 
#[[Holozoic nutrition]]: the word holozoic is made from two words- holo= whole and zoikos= animals and literally means animals which eat their food whole. Complex food is taken into a specialist digestive system and broken down into small pieces to be absorbed. This consists of 5 stages, [[ingestion]], [[digestion]], [[Absorption (small intestine)|absorption]], [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] and [[egestion]]. E.g.: human 
#[[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprobiontic]]/[[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytic]] nutrition: Organisms feed on dead organic remains of other organisms. E.g.: decomposers
#[[Parasitism|Parasitic nutrition]]: Organisms obtain food from other living organisms (the host), with the host receiving no benefit from the parasite.When a parasite is present inside the body of the host, it is known as an endoparasite. These parasites suck and feed on the blood of the host.  E.g.: tapeworms
#[[Symbiosis|Symbiotic nutrition]]:Two organisms live in close association to benefit each other or one of the two benefits the other whilst it itself suffers neither loss but nor does it gain.  E.g.: fungi and algae, rizobium and leguminous plants roots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">The '''Hindmarsh–Rose model''' of [[neuron]]al activity is aimed to study the [[Action potential|spiking]]-bursting behavior of the [[membrane potential]] observed in experiments made with a single neuron. The relevant variable is the membrane potential, ''x''(''t''), which is written in [[dimensionless unit]]s. There are two more variables, ''y''(''t'') and ''z''(''t''), which take into account the transport of ions across the membrane through the [[ion channel]]s. The transport of [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] ions is made through fast ion channels and its rate is measured by ''y''(''t''), which is called the spiking variable. The transport of other ions is made through slow channels, and is taken into account through ''z''(''t''), which is called the bursting variable. Then, the Hindmarsh–Rose model has the mathematical form of a system of three nonlinear [[ordinary differential equation]]s on the dimensionless dynamical variables ''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''), and ''z''(''t''). They read:

[[Image:Simulation of hrose neuron.png|thumb|right|400px|Simulation of Hindmarsh–Rose neuron showing typical neuronal [[bursting]].]] 

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{d x}{d t} &amp;= y+\phi(x)-z+I, \\
\frac{d y}{d t} &amp;= \psi(x)-y, \\
\frac{d z}{d t} &amp;= r[s(x-x_R)-z],
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\phi(x) &amp;= -a x^3+b x^2, \\
\psi(x) &amp;= c-d x^2. 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The model has eight parameters: ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''r'', ''s'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''I''. It is common to fix some of them and let the others be control parameters. Usually the parameter ''I'', which means the current that enters the neuron, is taken as a control parameter. Other control parameters used often in the literature are ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', or ''r'', the first four modeling the working of the fast ion channels and the last one the slow ion channels, respectively. Frequently, the parameters held fixed are ''s'' = 4 and ''x&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -8/5. When ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are fixed the values given are ''a'' = 1, ''b'' = 3, ''c'' = 1, and ''d'' = 5. The parameter ''r'' is something of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''I'' ranges between −10 and 10.

The third state equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{d z}{d t} &amp;= r[s(x-x_R)-z],\\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
allows a great variety of dynamic behaviors of the membrane potential, described by variable x, including unpredictable behavior, which is referred to as [[chaos theory|chaotic dynamics]]. This makes the Hindmarsh–Rose model relatively simple and provides a good qualitative description of the many different patterns that are observed empirically.

The '''Hunza diet''' consists of a series of selective food and drink intake practiced by the [[Hunza people]] of northern [[Pakistan]] that is argued by some to be unique and have long lasting effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undergroundhealthreporter.com/hunza-diet-health-weight-loss/|title=You Are What You Eat…Hunza Diet Provides Longevity and Happiness - Underground Health Reporter|first=Danica|last=Collins|website=undergroundhealthreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcvitamins.com/diets/hunza-diet.htm|title=The Hunza Diet|website=mcvitamins.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet mostly consists of raw food including nuts, fruits and seeds added with yogurt. The cooked meal, [[Dal|daal]] included with [[chappati]], is included for dinner. It has also been advocated for being inexpensive and mostly self-producible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/01/12-diets-in-12-months-the-hunza-diet/|title=12 Diets In 12 Months: The Hunza Diet|first=Rae|last=Johnston|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
The late Irish Dr Macarrison is believed to have traveled to this area during the days of the [[British Raj]] and tested this diet on rats in England. The results are claimed to have given the rats longer lasting lives.&lt;ref name="Luhrs1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Luhrs|title=The Simple Living Guide: A Sourcebook for Less Stressful, More Joyful Living|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WMbySartXcC&amp;pg=PA273|year=1997|publisher=Broadway Books|isbn=978-0-553-06796-5|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book about the Hunza, Jay Hoffman argued that by the ratio to cats, dogs and horses, humans should live up to 120 to 150 years and argues the Hunza diet to be the key to this longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Hunza: Secrets of the World's Healthiest and Oldest Living People|author=Jay M.

==Opponents==
While the Hunza bread is agreed to be cost-effective, it is also argued to be low in calories. It is prepared by adding two cups of flour, one cup of wheat flour, one quarter cup of wheat germ, one pack of active dry yeast, one quarter pack of light or dark brown sugar, one teaspoon of organic honey, one teaspoon of salt in addition to one quarter teaspoon of ground ginger as well as half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Three quarters of optional dried fruit must be added followed by one and a half cup of water. Two tablespoons of butter are also recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dietbites.com/article1095.html|title=Hunza Bread, Diet Recipe|website=www.dietbites.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ISO/IEC 15288''' is a [[systems engineering]] standard covering processes and lifecycle stages. Initial planning for the ISO/IEC 15288:2002(E) standard started in 1994 when the need for a common systems engineering process framework was recognized. The previously accepted standard MIL STD 499A (1974) was cancelled after a memo from SECDEF prohibited the use of most [[United States Military Standard]]s without a waiver. The first edition was issued on 1 November 2002. [[Stuart Arnold]] was the editor and [[Harold Lawson]] was the architect of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.org/?attach_external_tab&amp;217&amp;3&amp;50&amp;50&amp;784&amp;530&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;IE Systems Engineering – Guide for ISO/IEC 15288 (System Life Cycle Processes)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 this standard was adopted as IEEE 15288. ISO/IEC 15288 has been updated 1 February 2008 as well as on 15 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63711 ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO/IEC 15288 is managed by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7|ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7]], which is the ISO committee responsible for developing ISO standards in the area of Software and Systems Engineering. ISO/IEC 15288 is part of the SC 7 Integrated set of Standards, and other standards in this domain include:
* ISO/IEC TR 15504 which addresses capability
* ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288 which address lifecycle and
* ISO 9001 &amp; ISO 9000-3 which address quality

==History==
* ISO/IEC 15288:2015
* Revises: ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (harmonized with ISO/IEC 12207:2008)
* Revises: ISO/IEC 15288:2002 (first edition)

==Processes==
The standard defines processes divided into four categories:
* Technical
* Project
* Agreement, and
* Enterprise

Each process is defined by a purpose, outcomes, and activities. ISO 15288 comprises 25 processes which have 123 outcomes derived from 403 activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.se/old/images/Roedler%20Abstract%20ISO%20IEC%2015288.pdf What is ISO/IEC 15288 and Why Should I Care?]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Clause 6.4.1 - Stakeholder Requirements Definition Process
# Clause 6.4.2 - Requirements Analysis Process
# Clause 6.4.3 - Architectural Design Process
# Clause 6.4.4 - Implementation Process

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53474">'''Information technology risk''', '''IT risk''', '''IT-related risk''', or '''Cyber Risk''' is any [[risk]] related to [[information technology]]. While information has long been appreciated as a valuable and important asset, the rise of the [[knowledge economy]] and the [[Digital Revolution]] has led to organizations becoming increasingly dependent on information, information processing and especially IT.  Various events or incidents that compromise IT in some way can therefore cause adverse impacts on the organization's business processes or mission, ranging from inconsequential to catastrophic in scale.

Assessing the probability of likelihood of various types of event/incident with their predicted impacts or consequences should they occur is a common way to assess and measure IT risks.&lt;ref&gt;"Risk is a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure(s)" (OHSAS 18001:2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternative methods of measuring IT risk typically involve assessing other contributory factors such as the threats, vulnerabilities, exposures, and asset values&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://threatsketch.com/3-types-cyber-security-assessments/|title=3 Types Of Cybersecurity Assessments - Threat Sketch|date=2016-05-16|work=Threat Sketch|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/study/security-assessment-types/|title=Information Security Assessment Types|work=danielmiessler.com|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Definitions==

===ISO===
'''IT risk''': ''the potential that a given [[threat (computer)|threat]] will exploit [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] of an [[asset (computing)|asset]] or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization. It is measured in terms of a combination of the probability of occurrence of an event and its consequence.''&lt;ref name=ISO27005&gt;ISO/IEC, "Information technology -- Security techniques-Information security risk management" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Committee on National Security Systems ===
The [[Committee on National Security Systems]] of [[United States|United States of America]] defined '''risk''' in different documents:
* From CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009&gt;[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] dated 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the basic and more technical focused definition:
*: ''Risk - Possibility that a particular threat will adversely impact an IS by exploiting a particular vulnerability.''
*[[National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Advisory Memoranda|National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction]] (NSTISSI) No. 1000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://niatec.info/GetFile.aspx?pid=567 National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP) by National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; introduces a probability aspect, quite similar to NIST SP 800-30 one:
*:''Risk - A combination of the likelihood that a threat will occur, the likelihood that a threat occurrence will result in an adverse impact, and the severity of the resulting impact''

[[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] defines risk in the IT field as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niatec.info/Glossary.aspx?term=4253&amp;alpha=R|title=Glossary of Terms|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The loss potential that exists as the result of threat-vulnerability pairs. Reducing either the threat or the vulnerability reduces the risk.
# The uncertainty of loss expressed in terms of probability of such loss.
# The probability that a hostile entity will successfully exploit a particular telecommunications or COMSEC system for intelligence purposes; its factors are threat and vulnerability.
# A combination of the likelihood that a threat shall occur, the likelihood that a threat occurrence shall result in an adverse impact, and the severity of the resulting adverse impact.
# the probability that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability of the system.

===NIST===
Many [[NIST]] publications define '''risk''' in IT context in different publications: FISMApedia&lt;ref&gt;[http://fismapedia.org/index.php a wiki project] devoted to [[FISMA]]&lt;/ref&gt; term&lt;ref&gt;[http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk FISMApedia Risk term]&lt;/ref&gt; provide a list. Between them:
* According to [[NIST]] SP 800-30:&lt;ref name=SP80030&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
*: ''Risk is a function of the likelihood of a given threat-source’s exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event on the organization.''
* From NIST FIPS 200&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips200/FIPS-200-final-march.pdf FIPS Publication 200 Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
*: Risk - The level of impact on organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat occurring.

[[NIST]] SP 800-30&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt; defines:
;IT-related risk:
:''The net mission impact considering:''
:# ''the probability that a particular threat-source will exercise (accidentally trigger or intentionally exploit) a particular information system vulnerability and''
:# ''the resulting impact if this should occur. IT-related risks arise from legal liability or mission loss due to:''
:## ''Unauthorized (malicious or accidental) disclosure, modification, or destruction of information''
:## ''Unintentional errors and omissions''
:## ''IT disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters''
:## ''Failure to exercise due care and diligence in the implementation and operation of the IT system.''

=== Risk management insight ===
IT risk is the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss.&lt;ref name="riskmanagementinsight.com"&gt;[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf FAIR: Factor Analysis for Information Risks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf |date=2014-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISACA ===
[[ISACA]] published the [[Risk IT]] Framework in order to provides an end-to-end, comprehensive view of all risks related to the use of IT. There,&lt;ref name=riskit&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK] {{ISBN|978-1-60420-111-6}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; IT risk is defined as:
:''The business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of IT within an enterprise''
According to [[Risk IT]],&lt;ref name=riskit/&gt; IT risk has a broader meaning: it encompasses not just only the negative [[impact (security)|impact]] of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit\value enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact

== Measuring IT risk ==
:''You can't effectively and consistently manage what you can't measure, and you can't measure what you haven't defined.''&lt;ref name="riskmanagementinsight.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy {{ISBN|1-931624-77-1}} Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring IT risk (or cyber risk) can occur at many levels. At a business level the risks are managed categorically. Front line IT departments and [[Network operations center|NOC]]'s tend to measure more discreet, individual risks. Managing the nexus between them is a key role for modern [[Chief information security officer|CISO]]'s.

When measuring risk of any kind, selecting the correct equation for a given threat, asset, and available data is an important step. Doing so is subject unto itself, but there are common components of risk equations that are helpful to understand. &lt;blockquote&gt;There are four fundamental forces involved in risk management, which also apply to cybersecurity. They are assets, impact, threats, and likelihood. You have internal knowledge of and a fair amount of control over ''assets'', which are tangible and intangible things that have value. You also have some control over ''impact'', which refers to loss of, or damage to, an asset. However, ''threats'' that represent adversaries and their methods of attack are external to your control. ''Likelihood'' is the wild card in the bunch. Likelihoods determine if and when a threat will materialize, succeed, and do damage. While never fully under your control, likelihoods can be shaped and influenced to manage the risk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mathematically, the forces can be represented in a formula such as: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Risk = p(Asset, Threat) \times d(Asset, Threat)
&lt;/math&gt; where p() is the likelihood that a Threat will materialize/succeed against an Asset, and d() is the likelihood of various levels of damage that may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zu44DwAAQBAJ|title=Cybersecurity: A Business Solution|last=Arnold|first=Rob|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-0692944158|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;The field of IT risk management has spawned a number of terms and techniques which are unique to the industry. Some industry terms have yet to be reconciled. For example, the term ''vulnerability'' is often used interchangeably with likelihood of occurrence, which can be problematic.  Oft encountered IT risk management terms and techniques include:
&lt;!---- to be moved to specific articles ---------&gt;
;Information security event
:''An identified occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of information security policy or failure of safeguards, or a previously unknown situation that may be security relevant.''&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
:''Occurrence of a particular set of circumstances''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/glossary#G11|title=Glossary|author=|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''The event can be certain or uncertain.''
:* ''The event can be a single occurrence or a series of occurrences. :(ISO/IEC Guide 73)''

:''Outcome of an event [G.11]''
:* ''There can be more than one consequence from one event.''
:* ''Consequences can range from positive to negative.''
:* ''Consequences can be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively (ISO/IEC Guide 73)''

The risk '''R''' is the product of the likelihood '''L''' of a security incident occurring times the [[impact (security)|impact]] '''I''' that will be incurred to the organization due to the incident, that is:&lt;ref name=OWASP/&gt;
:'''R''' = '''L''' × '''I'''

The likelihood of a security incident occurrence is a function of the likelihood that a threat appears and the likelihood that the threat can successfully exploit the relevant system vulnerabilities.

The consequence of the occurrence of a security incident are a function of likely impact that the incident will have on the organization as a result of the harm the organization assets will sustain. Harm is related to the value of the assets to the organization; the same asset can have different values to different organizations.

So R can be function of four [[risk factor (computing)|factors]]:
* A = Value of the [[asset (computing)|assets]]
* T = the likelihood of the [[Threat (computer)|threat]]
* V = the nature of [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] i.e. the likelihood that can be exploited (proportional to the potential benefit for the attacker and inversely proportional to the cost of exploitation)
* I = the likely [[impact (security)|impact]], the extent of the harm

If numerical values (money for impact and probabilities for the other factors), the risk can be expressed in monetary terms and compared to the cost of countermeasures and the residual risk after applying the security control. It is not always practical to express this values, so in the first step of risk evaluation, risk are graded dimensionless in three or five steps scales.

[[OWASP]] proposes a practical risk measurement guideline&lt;ref name=OWASP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology|title=OWASP Risk Rating Methodology|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on:
* Estimation of Likelihood as a mean between different factors in a 0 to 9 scale:
** [[Threat agent]] factors
*** Skill level: How technically skilled is this group of threat agents? No technical skills (1), some technical skills (3), advanced computer user (4), network and programming skills (6), security penetration skills (9)
*** Motive: How motivated is this group of threat agents to find and exploit this vulnerability? Low or no reward (1), possible reward (4), high reward (9)
*** Opportunity: What resources and opportunity are required for this group of threat agents to find and exploit this vulnerability? full access or expensive resources required (0), special access or resources required (4), some access or resources required (7), no access or resources required (9)
*** Size: How large is this group of threat agents? Developers (2), system administrators (2), intranet users (4), partners (5), authenticated users (6), anonymous Internet users (9)
** [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability]] Factors: the next set of factors are related to the vulnerability involved. The goal here is to estimate the likelihood of the particular vulnerability involved being discovered and exploited. Assume the threat agent selected above.
*** Ease of discovery: How easy is it for this group of threat agents to discover this vulnerability? Practically impossible (1), difficult (3), easy (7), automated tools available (9)
*** Ease of [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]]: How easy is it for this group of threat agents to actually exploit this vulnerability? Theoretical (1), difficult (3), easy (5), automated tools available (9)
*** Awareness: How well known is this vulnerability to this group of threat agents? Unknown (1), hidden (4), obvious (6), public knowledge (9)
*** Intrusion detection: How likely is an exploit to be detected? Active detection in application (1), logged and reviewed (3), logged without review (8), not logged (9)
* Estimation of Impact as a mean between different factors in a 0 to 9 scale
** Technical Impact Factors; technical impact can be broken down into factors aligned with the traditional security areas of concern: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability. The goal is to estimate the magnitude of the impact on the system if the vulnerability were to be exploited.
*** Loss of [[confidentiality]]: How much data could be disclosed and how sensitive is it? Minimal non-sensitive data disclosed (2), minimal critical data disclosed (6), extensive non-sensitive data disclosed (6), extensive critical data disclosed (7), all data disclosed (9)
*** Loss of [[integrity]]: How much data could be corrupted and how damaged is it? Minimal slightly corrupt data (1), minimal seriously corrupt data (3), extensive slightly corrupt data (5), extensive seriously corrupt data (7), all data totally corrupt (9)
*** Loss of [[availability]] How much service could be lost and how vital is it? Minimal secondary services interrupted (1), minimal primary services interrupted (5), extensive secondary services interrupted (5), extensive primary services interrupted (7), all services completely lost (9)
*** Loss of accountability: Are the threat agents' actions traceable to an individual? Fully traceable (1), possibly traceable (7), completely anonymous (9)
** Business Impact Factors: The business impact stems from the technical impact, but requires a deep understanding of what is important to the company running the application. In general, you should be aiming to support your risks with business impact, particularly if your audience is executive level. The business risk is what justifies investment in fixing security problems.
*** Financial damage: How much financial damage will result from an exploit? Less than the cost to fix the vulnerability (1), minor effect on annual profit (3), significant effect on annual profit (7), bankruptcy (9)
*** Reputation damage: Would an exploit result in reputation damage that would harm the business? Minimal damage (1), Loss of major accounts (4), loss of goodwill (5), brand damage (9)
*** Non-compliance: How much exposure does non-compliance introduce? Minor violation (2), clear violation (5), high-profile violation (7)
*** [[Privacy]] violation: How much personally identifiable information could be disclosed? One individual (3), hundreds of people (5), thousands of people (7), millions of people (9)
** If the business impact is calculated accurately use it in the following otherwise use the Technical impact
* Rate likelihood and impact in a LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH scale assuming that less than 3 is LOW, 3 to less than 6 is MEDIUM, and 6 to 9 is HIGH.
* Calculate the risk using the following table

The [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]] encourages organizations to manage IT risk as part the ''Identify'' (ID) function:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework|title=Cybersecurity Framework|last=Keller|first=Nicole|date=2013-11-12|work=NIST|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://threatsketch.com/free-nist-cybersecurity-framework-tools-and-resources/|title=A 10 Minute Guide to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework|last=Arnold|first=Rob|date=|website=Threat Sketch|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risk Assessment (ID.RA)''': The organization understands the cybersecurity risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals.
* ID.RA-1: Asset vulnerabilities are identified and documented 
* ID.RA-2: Cyber threat intelligence and vulnerability information is received from information sharing forums and source 
* ID.RA-3: Threats, both internal and external, are identified and documented 
* ID.RA-4: Potential business impacts and likelihoods are identified 
* ID.RA-5: Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihoods, and impacts are used to determine risk 
* ID.RA-6: Risk responses are identified and prioritized 
'''Risk Management Strategy (ID.RM)''': The organization’s priorities, constraints, risk tolerances, and assumptions are established and used to support operational risk decisions. 
* ID.RM-1: Risk management processes are established, managed, and agreed to by organizational stakeholders 
* ID.RM-2: Organizational risk tolerance is determined and clearly expressed 
* ID.RM-3: The organization’s determination of risk tolerance is informed by its role in critical infrastructure and sector specific risk analysis

=== OECD ===
[[OECD]] issued the following:
* [http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,2340,en_2649_34255_1815186_1_1_1_1,00.html Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Recommendation of the Council concerning guidelines governing the protection of privacy and trans-border flows of personal data] (23 September 1980)
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110516085505/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/22/15582260.pdf OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security] (25 July 2002). Topic: General information security. Scope: Non binding guidelines to any OECD entities (governments, businesses, other organisations and individual users who develop, own, provide, manage, service, and use information systems and networks). The OECD Guidelines state the basic principles underpinning risk management and information security practices. While no part of the text is binding as such, non-compliance with any of the principles is indicative of a serious breach of RM/RA good practices that can potentially incur liability.

=== European Union ===
The [[European Union]] issued the following, divided by topic:
* [[Privacy]]
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R0045:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 45/2001] on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data provide an internal regulation which is a practical application of the principles of the Privacy Directive described below. Furthermore, article 35 of the Regulation requires the Community institutions and bodies to take similar precautions with regard to their telecommunications infrastructure, and to properly inform the users of any specific risks of security breaches.
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:NOT Directive 95/46/EC] on the protection of individuals with regard to the [[Data Protection Directive|processing of personal data]] and on the free movement of such data require that any personal data processing activity undergoes a prior risk analysis in order to determine the privacy implications of the activity, and to determine the appropriate legal, technical and organisation measures to protect such activities;is effectively protected by such measures, which must be state of the art keeping into account the sensitivity and privacy implications of the activity (including when a third party is charged with the processing task) is notified to a national data protection authority, including the measures taken to ensure the security of the activity. Furthermore, article 25 and following of the Directive requires Member States to ban the transfer of personal data to non-Member States, unless such countries have provided adequate legal protection for such personal data, or barring certain other exceptions.
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001D0497:EN:NOT Commission Decision 2001/497/EC of 15 June 2001] on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries, under Directive 95/46/EC; and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004D0915:EN:NOT Commission Decision 2004/915/EC] of 27 December 2004 amending Decision 2001/497/EC as regards the introduction of an alternative set of standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries. Topic: Export of personal data to third countries, specifically non-E.U. countries which have not been recognised as having a data protection level that is adequate (i.e. equivalent to that of the E.U.). Both Commission Decisions provide a set of voluntary model clauses which can be used to export personal data from a data controller (who is subject to E.U. data protection rules) to a data processor outside the E.U. who is not subject to these rules or to a similar set of adequate rules.
** [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] (see below [[#USA|USA]] and [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] )
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:NOT Directive 2002/58/EC] of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector
* [[National Security]]
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0024:EN:NOT Directive 2006/24/EC] of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC (‘Data Retention Directive’). Topic: Requirement for the providers of public electronic telecommunications service providers to retain certain information for the purposes of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0114:EN:NOT Council Directive 2008/114/EC] of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection. Topic: Identification and protection of European Critical Infrastructures. Scope: Applicable to Member States and to the operators of European Critical Infrastructure (defined by the draft directive as ‘critical infrastructures the disruption or destruction of which would significantly affect two or more Member States, or a single Member State if the critical infrastructure is located in another Member State. This includes effects resulting from cross-sector dependencies on other types of infrastructure’). Requires Member States to identify critical infrastructures on their territories, and to designate them as ECIs. Following this designation, the owners/operators of ECIs are required to create Operator Security Plans (OSPs), which should establish relevant security solutions for their protection
* Civil and Penal law
** [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005F0222:EN:NOT Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA] of 24 February 2005 on attacks against information systems. Topic: General decision aiming to harmonise national provisions in the field of cyber crime, encompassing material criminal law (i.e. definitions of specific crimes), procedural criminal law (including investigative measures and international cooperation) and liability issues. Scope: Requires Member States to implement the provisions of the Framework Decision in their national legal frameworks. Framework decision is relevant to RM/RA because it contains the conditions under which legal liability can be imposed on legal entities for conduct of certain natural persons of authority within the legal entity. Thus, the Framework decision requires that the conduct of such figures within an organisation is adequately monitored, also because the Decision states that a legal entity can be held liable for acts of omission in this regard.

=== Council of Europe ===
* [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/185.htm Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, Budapest, 23.XI.2001], European Treaty Series-No. 185. Topic: General treaty aiming to harmonise national provisions in the field of cyber crime, encompassing material criminal law (i.e. definitions of specific crimes), procedural criminal law (including investigative measures and international cooperation), liability issues and data retention. Apart from the definitions of a series of criminal offences in articles 2 to 10, the Convention is relevant to RM/RA because it states the conditions under which legal liability can be imposed on legal entities for conduct of certain natural persons of authority within the legal entity. Thus, the Convention requires that the conduct of such figures within an organisation is adequately monitored, also because the Convention states that a legal entity can be held liable for acts of omission in this regard.

=== USA ===
United States issued the following, divided by topic:
* Civil and Penal law
** [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/ Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with regard to electronic discovery]. Topic: U.S. Federal rules with regard to the production of electronic documents in civil proceedings. The discovery rules allow a party in civil proceedings to demand that the opposing party produce all relevant documentation (to be defined by the requesting party) in its possession, so as to allow the parties and the court to correctly assess the matter. Through the e-discovery amendment, which entered into force on 1 December 2006, such information may now include electronic information. This implies that any party being brought before a U.S. court in civil proceedings can be asked to produce such documents, which includes finalised reports, working documents, internal memos and e-mails with regard to a specific subject, which may or may not be specifically delineated. Any party whose activities imply a risk of being involved in such proceedings must therefore take adequate precautions for the management of such information, including the secure storage. Specifically: The party must be capable of initiating a ‘litigation hold’, a technical/organisational measure which must ensure that no relevant information can be modified any longer in any way. Storage policies must be responsible: while deletion of specific information of course remains allowed when this is a part of general information management policies (‘routine, good-faith operation of the information system’, Rule 37 (f)), the wilful destruction of potentially relevant information can be punished by extremely high fines (in one specific case of 1.6 billion US$). Thus, in practice, any businesses who risk civil litigation before U.S. courts must implement adequate information management policies, and must implement the necessary measures to initiate a litigation hold.
* [[Privacy]]
** [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA)
** [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title III]]
** [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) From an RM/RA perspective, the Act is particularly known for its provisions with regard to Administrative Simplification (Title II of HIPAA). This title required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to draft specific rule sets, each of which would provide specific standards which would improve the efficiency of the health care system and prevent abuse. As a result, the HHS has adopted five principal rules: the Privacy Rule, the Transactions and Code Sets Rule, the Unique Identifiers Rule, the Enforcement Rule, and the Security Rule. The latter, published in the Federal Register on 20 February 2003 (see: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/Downloads/securityfinalrule.pdf), is specifically relevant, as it specifies a series of administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information. These aspects have been further outlined in a set of Security Standards on Administrative, Physical, Organisational and Technical Safeguards, all of which have been published, along with a guidance document on the basics of HIPAA risk management and risk assessment &lt;http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EducationMaterials/04_SecurityMaterials.asp&gt;. European or other countries health care service providers will generally not be affected by HIPAA obligations if they are not active on the U.S. market. However, since their data processing activities are subject to similar obligations under general European law (including the Privacy Directive), and since the underlying trends of modernisation and evolution towards electronic health files are the same, the HHS safeguards can be useful as an initial yardstick for measuring RM/RA strategies put in place by European health care service providers, specifically with regard to the processing of electronic health information. HIPAA security standards include the following:
*** Administrative safeguards:
**** Security Management Process
**** Assigned Security Responsibility
**** Workforce Security
**** Information Access Management
**** Security Awareness and Training
**** Security Incident Procedures
**** Contingency Plan
**** Evaluation
**** Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements
*** Physical safeguards
**** Facility Access Controls
**** Workstation Use
**** Workstation Security
**** Device and Media Controls
*** Technical safeguards
**** Access Control
**** Audit Controls
**** Integrity
**** Person or Entity Authentication
**** Transmission Security
*** Organisational requirements
**** Business Associate Contracts &amp; Other Arrangements
**** Requirements for Group Health Plans
** [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] issued by the US Department of Commerce on July 21, 2000 Export of personal data from a data controller who is subject to E.U. privacy regulations to a U.S. based destination; before personal data may be exported from an entity subject to E.U. privacy regulations to a destination subject to U.S. law, the European entity must ensure that the receiving entity provides adequate safeguards to protect such data against a number of mishaps. One way of complying with this obligation is to require the receiving entity to join the Safe Harbor, by requiring that the entity self-certifies its compliance with the so-called Safe Harbor Principles. If this road is chosen, the data controller exporting the data must verify that the U.S. destination is indeed on the Safe Harbor list (see [http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list safe harbor list])

=== Short description of standards ===
The list is chiefly based on:&lt;ref name="ENISALAW"/&gt;

==== ISO ====
* [[ISO/IEC 13335]]-1:2004 - Information technology—Security techniques—Management of information and communications technology security—Part 1: Concepts and models for information and communications technology security management http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=39066. Standard containing generally accepted descriptions of concepts and models for information and communications technology security management. The standard is a commonly used code of practice, and serves as a resource for the implementation of security management practices and as a yardstick for auditing such practices. (See also http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/secpubs/otherpubs/reviso-faq.pdf)
* [[ISO/IEC TR 15443]]-1:2005 – Information technology—Security techniques—A framework for IT security assurance reference:http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=39733 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Security assurance – the Technical Report (TR) contains generally accepted guidelines which can be used to determine an appropriate assurance method for assessing a security service, product or environmental factor
* ISO/IEC 15816:2002 - Information technology—Security techniques—Security information objects for access control reference:http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29139 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Security management – Access control. The standard allows security professionals to rely on a specific set of syntactic definitions and explanations with regard to SIOs, thus avoiding duplication or divergence in other standardisation efforts.
* ISO/IEC TR 15947:2002 - Information technology—Security techniques—IT intrusion detection framework reference:http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29580 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Security management – Intrusion detection in IT systems. The standard allows security professionals to rely on a specific set of concepts and methodologies for describing and assessing security risks with regard to potential intrusions in IT systems. It does not contain any RM/RA obligations as such, but it is rather a tool for facilitating RM/RA activities in the affected field.
* [[ISO/IEC 15408]]-1/2/3:2005 - Information technology — Security techniques — Evaluation criteria for IT security — Part 1: Introduction and general model (15408-1) Part 2: Security functional requirements (15408-2) Part 3: Security assurance requirements (15408-3) reference: http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm Topic: Standard containing a common set of requirements for the security functions of IT products and systems and for assurance measures applied to them during a security evaluation. Scope: Publicly available ISO standard, which can be voluntarily implemented. The text is a resource for the evaluation of the security of IT products and systems, and can thus be used as a tool for RM/RA. The standard is commonly used as a resource for the evaluation of the security of IT products and systems; including (if not specifically) for procurement decisions with regard to such products. The standard can thus be used as an RM/RA tool to determine the security of an IT product or system during its design, manufacturing or marketing, or before procuring it.
* [[ISO/IEC 17799]]:2005 - Information technology—Security techniques—Code of practice for information security management. reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=39612&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=40&amp;ICS3= (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Standard containing generally accepted guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving information security management in an organization, including business continuity management. The standard is a commonly used code of practice, and serves as a resource for the implementation of information security management practices and as a yardstick for auditing such practices. (See also [[ISO/IEC 17799]])
* ISO/IEC TR 15446:2004 – Information technology—Security techniques—Guide for the production of Protection Profiles and Security Targets. reference: http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm Topic: Technical Report (TR) containing guidelines for the construction of Protection Profiles (PPs) and Security Targets (STs) that are intended to be compliant with ISO/IEC 15408 (the "Common Criteria"). The standard is predominantly used as a tool for security professionals to develop PPs and STs, but can also be used to assess the validity of the same (by using the TR as a yardstick to determine if its standards have been obeyed). Thus, it is a (nonbinding) normative tool for the creation and assessment of RM/RA practices.
* [[ISO/IEC 27000-series|ISO/IEC 18028]]:2006 - Information technology—Security techniques—IT network security reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=40008 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Five part standard (ISO/IEC 18028-1 to 18028-5) containing generally accepted guidelines on the security aspects of the management, operation and use of information technology networks. The standard is considered an extension of the guidelines provided in ISO/IEC 13335 and ISO/IEC 17799 focusing specifically on network security risks. The standard is a commonly used code of practice, and serves as a resource for the implementation of security management practices and as a yardstick for auditing such practices.
* [[ISO/IEC 27001]]:2005 - Information technology—Security techniques—Information security management systems—Requirements reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=42103 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Standard containing generally accepted guidelines for the implementation of an Information Security Management System within any given organisation. Scope: Not publicly available ISO standard, which can be voluntarily implemented. While not legally binding, the text contains direct guidelines for the creation of sound information security practices The standard is a very commonly used code of practice, and serves as a resource for the implementation of information security management systems and as a yardstick for auditing such systems and/or the surrounding practices. Its application in practice is often combined with related standards, such as BS 7799-3:2006 which provides additional guidance to support the requirements given in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 &lt;http://www.bsiglobal.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030125022&amp;recid=2491&gt;
* [[ISO/IEC 27001:2013]], the updated standard for information security management systems.
* ISO/IEC TR 18044:2004 – Information technology—Security techniques—Information security incident management reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=35396 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Technical Report (TR) containing generally accepted guidelines and general principles for information security incident management in an organization.Scope: Not publicly available ISO TR, which can be voluntarily used.While not legally binding, the text contains direct guidelines for incident management. The standard is a high level resource introducing basic concepts and considerations in the field of incident response. As such, it is mostly useful as a catalyst to awareness raising initiatives in this regard.
* ISO/IEC 18045:2005 - Information technology—Security techniques—Methodology for IT security evaluation reference: http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm Topic: Standard containing auditing guidelines for assessment of compliance with ISO/IEC 15408 (Information technology—Security techniques—Evaluation criteria for IT security) Scope Publicly available ISO standard, to be followed when evaluating compliance with ISO/IEC 15408 (Information technology—Security techniques—Evaluation criteria for IT security). The standard is a ‘companion document’, which is thus primarily of used for security professionals involved in evaluating compliance with ISO/IEC 15408 (Information technology—Security techniques—Evaluation criteria for IT security). Since it describes minimum actions to be performed by such auditors, compliance with ISO/IEC 15408 is impossible if ISO/IEC 18045 has been disregarded.
* ISO/TR 13569:2005 - Financial services—Information security guidelines reference: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=37245 (Note: this is a reference to the ISO page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Standard containing guidelines for the implementation and assessment of information security policies in financial services institutions. The standard is a commonly referenced guideline, and serves as a resource for the implementation of information security management programmes in institutions of the financial sector, and as a yardstick for auditing such programmes. (See also http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/secpubs/otherpubs/reviso-faq.pdf)
* ISO/IEC 21827:2008 - Information technology—Security techniques—Systems Security Engineering—Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM): ISO/IEC 21827:2008 specifies the Systems Security Engineering - Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM), which describes the essential characteristics of an organization's security engineering process that must exist to ensure good security engineering. ISO/IEC 21827:2008 does not prescribe a particular process or sequence, but captures practices generally observed in industry. The model is a standard metric for security engineering practices.

==== BSI ====
* [[BS 25999]]-1:2006 - Business continuity management Part 1: Code of practice Note: this is only part one of BS 25999, which was published in November 2006. Part two (which should contain more specific criteria with a view of possible accreditation) is yet to appear. reference: http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030157563. Topic: Standard containing a business continuity code of practice. The standard is intended as a code of practice for business continuity management, and will be extended by a second part that should permit accreditation for adherence with the standard. Given its relative newness, the potential impact of the standard is difficult to assess, although it could be very influential to RM/RA practices, given the general lack of universally applicable standards in this regard and the increasing attention to business continuity and contingency planning in regulatory initiatives. Application of this standard can be complemented by other norms, in particular PAS 77:2006 - IT Service Continuity Management Code of Practice &lt;http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030141858&gt;.The TR allows security professionals to determine a suitable methodology for assessing a security service, product or environmental factor (a deliverable). Following this TR, it can be determined which level of security assurance a deliverable is intended to meet, and if this threshold is actually met by the deliverable.
* [[BS 7799]]-3:2006 - Information security management systems—Guidelines for information security risk management reference: http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030125022&amp;recid=2491 (Note: this is a reference to the BSI page where the standard can be acquired. However, the standard is not free of charge, and its provisions are not publicly available. For this reason, specific provisions cannot be quoted). Topic: Standard containing general guidelines for information security risk management.Scope: Not publicly available BSI standard, which can be voluntarily implemented. While not legally binding, the text contains direct guidelines for the creation of sound information security practices. The standard is mostly intended as a guiding complementary document to the application of the aforementioned ISO 27001:2005, and is therefore typically applied in conjunction with this standard in risk assessment practices

The '''International Film Music Critics Association''' ('''IFMCA''') is a professional association for [[music journalism|online, print and radio journalists]] who specialize in writing about [[film score|original film and television music]].

==History and purpose==
The IFMCA was founded in the late 1990s as the '''Film Music Critics Jury''' by film music journalist [[Mikael Carlsson]] (now the owner of film music record label [[MovieScore Media]]), and after period of inactivity was re-launched in 2003 under its new title.

Its membership includes 65 journalists from 16 different countries who write for such high-profile film and soundtrack-related publications and websites as [[Film Score Monthly]], [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]], [[SoundtrackNet]], [[Music from the Movies]] and [[UnderScores]], as well as more mainstream publications such as [[Ain't It Cool News]], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and the [[Irish Times]]. Members of the IFMCA have also been involved in writing [[liner notes]] for major film music record labels such as [[Film Score Monthly]], [[Varèse Sarabande]], [[Intrada Records]], La-La Land Records and [[Music Box Records]].

The aim of the group is to promote original film music and the work of film music composers as legitimate artists worthy of recognition from the mainstream film and music media, and to publicize the work of its members in pursuing this aim. To this end, the group maintains a website documenting its activities; operates a central online review interface which provides links to articles, reviews and interviews written by its members; organizes an annual awards event, the IFMCA Awards, celebrating music for films written during the preceding year; and is involved in organizing major international film music festivals, such as those in [[Tenerife International Film Music Festival|Tenerife]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Home |url=http://www.fimucite.com/f4/en/ |title=Tenerife International Film Music Festival |publisher=Fimucite.com |accessdate=11 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002151/http://www.fimucite.com/f4/en/# |archive-date=11 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Úbeda]] in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://festival.bsospirit.com/en/index.php ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kraków]] in Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmp.org.pl/ |title=Festiwal Muzyki Polskiej |publisher=Fmp.org.pl |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Soundtrack Academy|World Soundtrack Awards]] in [[Ghent]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poland |url=http://filmmusiccritics.org/members/ |title=IFMCA: the International Film Music Critics Association » Members |publisher=Filmmusiccritics.org |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IFMCA Awards==
The organization is responsible for the annual International Film Music Critics Association Awards, the only awards given to composers by active film music journalists, and which are seen by many as a valuable precursor to the [[Academy Awards]] in the absence of a guild for composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incontention.com/2010/01/29/international-film-music-critics-nominees/ |title=International Film Music Critics nominees |publisher=Incontention.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been called the "Oscars of film music",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=704788 |title=Araujo, premio IFMCA a la banda sonora de videojuegos por "Lords of Shadow" |publisher=Abc.es |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been featured in major daily newspapers in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/Sinfonias/videojuego/elpepurtv/20110308elpepirtv_1/Tes |title=Sinfonías en el videojuego: Premio internacional para Óscar Araujo por una banda sonora |publisher=Elpais.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundoportugues.org/content/1/8810/nuno-malo-eleito-compositor-revelacao-ano-nos-estados-unidos/ |title=Nuno Malo eleito o compositor revelação do ano nos Estados Unidos |publisher=Mundoportugues.org |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are recognized by major performing rights organizations such as [[ASCAP]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2011/02/Faces_Places/FilmTV/IFMCA_Awards.aspx |title=ASCAP Composers Score at the IFMCA Awards |publisher=Ascap.com |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores|SGAE]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgae.es/el-compositor-catalan-oscar-araujo-gana-el-premio-a-la-mejor-banda-sonora-2010-para-videojuego-de-la-international-film-music-critics-association/ |title=SGAE: El compositor catalán Óscar Araujo gana el Premio a la Mejor Banda Sonora 2010 para Videojuego de la International Film Music Critics Association |publisher=Sgae.es |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently have been seen by the video games industry as an important step forward in legitimizing game music as a mainstream creative art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/02/12/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-soundtrack-nominated-for-2-ifmca/ |title=Castlevania: Lords of Shadow soundtrack nominated for 2 IFMCA awards |publisher=Joystiq.com |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limit load''' is the maximum load that a structure can safely carry. It's the load at which the structure is in a state of incipient [[plastic deformation|plastic]] collapse. As the load on the structure increases, the displacements increases linearly in the elastic range until the load attains the yield value. Beyond this, the load-displacement response becomes non-linear and the plastic or irreversible part of the displacement increases steadily with the applied load. [[Plasticity (physics)|Plasticity]] spreads throughout the solid and at the limit load, the plastic zone becomes very large and the displacements become unbounded and the component is said to have collapsed.

Any load above the limit load will lead to the formation of [[plastic hinge]] in the structure. [[Engineer]]s use limit states to define and check a structure's performance.

'''Bounding Theorems of Plastic-Limit Load Analysis''':
These theorems provide a way to calculate limit loads without having to solve the [[boundary value problem]] in [[continuum mechanics]]. [[Finite element]] analysis provides an alternative way to estimate limit loads. They are:
*  The Upper Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem&lt;ref name="Bower"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bower|first1=Allan F.|title=Analytical techniques and solutions for plastic solids|url=http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter6_2/Chapter6_2.htm|website=Applied Mechanics of Solids|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Lower Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem&lt;ref name="Bower" /&gt;
* The Lower Bound Shakedown Theorem&lt;ref name="Bower" /&gt;
* The Upper Bound Shakedown Theorem&lt;ref name="Bower" /&gt;

The Upper Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem states that an upper bound to the collapse loads can be obtained by postulating a [[collapse mechanism]] and computing the ratio of its [[plastic dissipation]] to the work done by the applied loads.

[[Lizards]] are a diverse group of [[reptiles]]—there are nearly 4500 different lizard species, excluding snakes.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, JP and LJ Vitt "Tuataras and Lizards." Herpetology: An Introductory Biology of Amphibians and Reptiles. 3rd ed. Burlington: Elsevier, 2009. 513-49. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, and also vary widely in many aspects of their behavior, such as how they reproduce and forage for food.&lt;ref&gt;Pough, FH, RM Andrews, JE Cadle, ML Crump, AH Savitzky, and KD Wells. Herpetology. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this extraordinary diversity in physical and behavioral characteristics, lizards have evolved many interesting ways to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, JP and LJ Vitt "Communication and Social Behavior." Herpetology: An Introductory Biology of Amphibians and Reptiles. 3rd ed. Burlington: Elsevier, 2009. 239-70. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Lizards rely on many different sensory systems, including the [[visual]], [[olfactory]], and [[auditory system|auditory]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Fleishman, L J, M Bowman, D Saunders, WE Miller, MJ Rury, and ER Loew (1997). The visual ecology of Puerto Rican anoline lizards: habitat light and spectral.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, M "Nasal Chemical Senses in Reptiles: Structure and Function." Biology of the Reptilia: Hormones, Brain, and Behavior. Ed. D Crews. Vol. 18. Chicago and London: U of Chicago, 1992. 423–525. Print. Physiology E.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manley, GA (2011). Lizard auditory papillae: An evolutionary kaleidoscope. Hearing research, 273(1), 59–64.&lt;/ref&gt; As these sensory systems have become more sophisticated, lizards have developed different modes of communication that incorporate these sensory systems, including visual, chemical, tactile, and vocal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, JP and LJ Vitt "Tuataras and Lizards." Herpetology: An Introductory Biology of Amphibians and Reptiles. 3rd ed. Burlington: Elsevier, 2009. 513-49. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Different modes of communication are well suited for different lizard habitats—for example, some function well in wet habitats, while others are suitable only in habitats with low precipitation. Most modes are associates with particular physical and behavioral traits that allow lizards to use them, such as well-developed vision. Different lizard species have unique communication needs, and they have evolved fascinating solutions that are well suited to each species to accommodate these needs.

==What is communication, and how do lizards use it?==
The process of "communication" refers to the transfer of information between individuals &lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, JW, and SL Vehrencamp. Principles of Animal Communication. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, S. "Behavioral Ecology: How Should I Communicate." Biological Science. 4th ed. San Francisco, CA: Benjamin Cummings, 2011. 1027-031. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Animal Communication]] for additional discussion). One individual (the signaler) sends information to another individual (the receiver), and the receiver modifies its behavior in response to the information it received. It is important to note that most animals are not communicating vocally, as many humans do. Just because they aren't speaking sentences, however, does not mean information is not being transferred.

Consider for a moment how humans communicate using body language. Even without speaking, we can gain a lot of information about another person simply by observing that person's posture, behavior, and physical appearance. After we assess these various characteristics, we decide how to interact with the person we observed. For instance, we might choose to avoid a person who adopts an aggressive stance and has a flushed face characteristic of someone who is angry or upset. Alternatively, a different set of postures and behaviors can indicate that a person is friendly and welcoming, and we might choose to approach that person after assessing those characteristics.

Similar to this scenario of body language in humans, lizards and other animals gain information about the individuals around them by paying attention to various characteristics exhibited by those individuals. Lizards use many different physical and behavioral traits to communicate, and these traits vary depending on the mode of communication the lizard is using.

==When do lizards communicate?==
Just like humans and many other animals, lizards need to be able to communicate in a variety of different scenarios. Lizards need to be able to communicate with members of their own species. This type of communication, called intraspecific communication, includes communication associated with finding appropriate mates (called courtship) and competing for resources such as food or habitat. Lizards may consider subtle variation in traits shared by members of the same species when choosing mates, which sometimes results in particular individuals mating more than others. This phenomenon is associated with sexual selection, and is not discussed here (but see [[Sexual selection in lizards]]).

In many cases, lizards are also communicating with members of different species, which is called interspecific communication. Some lizards compete with other lizard species for access to resources, and need ways to communicate with one another in the process. Some lizards use interspecific communication during predator-prey interactions. The lizard ''Anolis cristatellus'', for example, exhibits predator deterrence communication—''A. cristatellus'' perform a behavior that communicates information about the lizard's physiological condition to potential predators.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, M. (1999). Honest signaling during prey–predator interactions in the lizard Anolis cristatellus. Animal Behaviour, 58(3), 521–526.&lt;/ref&gt; Lizards that are in better condition (and may be more likely to outrun the predator) perform this behavior more frequently, and may communicate to the predator that they will be difficult to catch. Thus, the predator may choose to avoid lizards in good condition that are likely to outrun them and choose instead to pursue individuals that do not seem to be in good condition. In this case of interspecific communication, the lizard is communicating information about itself to the predator, and the predator modifies its behavior in response.

==Modes of lizard communication==
Lizards have many different communication needs, and have evolved several modes of communication to accommodate these needs.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, GW (1977). Display and communications in reptiles: an historical perspective. American zoologist, 17(1), 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt; These modes include [[visual]], [[chemical]], [[Touch|tactile]], and [[vocal]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, JP and LJ Vitt "Communication and Social Behavior." Herpetology: An Introductory Biology of Amphibians and Reptiles. 3rd ed. Burlington: Elsevier, 2009. 239-70. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical and visual communication modes are widespread among lizards, while the tactile and vibrational modes seem to occur in just a handful of lizard species. Some species use a combination of several communication modes, while others seem to rely entirely on one. Visual communication is the most well studied mode of lizard communication, but modern scientific techniques are making it easier to study the other modes. Thus, we may find that lizards traditionally thought to rely on one mode of communication may also be using another mode.

===Visual communication===
Many lizards use visual communication. Lizards that use visual communication gather information by observing various physical and behavioral characteristics of other lizards, somewhat like humans communicating using body language. Lizards that use visual communication often have highly developed visual systems—most can see different colors, and some even see UV light.&lt;ref&gt;Fleishman, LJ, ER Loew, and M Leal. "Ultraviolet vision in lizards." (1993): 397-397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, MJ, DM Stuart-Fox, D O'Connor, D Firth, NC Bennett, and SP Blomberg (2006). Ultraviolet signals ultra-aggression in a lizard. Animal Behaviour, 72(2), 353–363.&lt;/ref&gt; Many different physical and behavioral traits are used by lizards in visual communication, most of which are obviously designed to draw the visual attention of other lizards.

What sorts of traits draw visual attention? Lizards that use visual communication often possess specialized structures used for communication. These structures often incorporate vibrant colors and striking patterns accompanied by wacky behaviors intended to display these traits, all intended to draw attention during communication. In many cases, these structures are hidden from view except when in use for communication—colors that draw the attention of other lizards may also draw the attention of unwanted audiences, such as predators or competitors. Thus, these colors may be located on a flap of skin that is only visible when the lizard extends it, or on a surface of the body like the belly that is not exposed unless the lizard intends to. Both of these are common in lizards. Many species of ''[[Anolis]]'' lizards have [[dewlaps]],&lt;ref&gt;Losos, JB  (2009). Lizards in an evolutionary tree: ecology and adaptive radiation of anoles. University  of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; vibrantly colored throat fans that they extend during behavioral interactions like attracting mates and dueling with competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, KE, LJ Harmon, and JB Losos. "Evolution of Anolis lizard dewlap diversity." PLoS One 2.3 (2007): e274.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anolis'' lizards tend to be fairly well camouflaged apart from the vibrant dewlap color, and often go unnoticed until they extend their dewlaps. Many ''Sceloporous'' lizard species also have hidden colors.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper Jr, WE and N Burns (1987). Social significance of ventrolateral coloration in the fence lizard,'' Sceloporus undulatus''. Animal Behaviour,35(2), 526–532.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''Sceloporous'' develop vibrant blue and black coloration on their bellies during the breeding season. This color is not visible to other lizards unless the lizard engages in a behavior called dorsal ventral flattening, in which the lizard flattens its body to expose the colorful parts of its belly during behavioral interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, EP (1994). Structural complexity in a lizard communication system: the Sceloporus graciosus" push-up" display. Copeia, 944–955.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because lizards that use visual communication rely on being able to see other lizards, visual communication is common among species that live at relatively high population densities and frequently come into close contact. Visual communication is well suited for use in many different habitats and can be modified by lizards to accommodate changing habitat conditions [e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;Ord, TJ, RA Peters, B Clucas, and JA Stamps  (2007). Lizards speed up visual displays in noisy motion habitats. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 274(1613), 1057–1062.&lt;/ref&gt;], so long as individuals come into contact frequently enough.

===Chemical communication===
Another mode of communication used by many lizards is chemical communication.&lt;ref&gt;Houck, LD (2009). Pheromone communication in amphibians and reptiles.Annual Review of Physiology, 71, 161–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Lizards that use chemical communication produce chemicals that they deposit in the environment, such as [[pheromones]]. These chemicals elicit changes in the behavior, and sometimes in the physiology, of individuals that encounter them.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, RT "Reptilian Pheromones." Biology of the Reptilia: Hormones, Brain, and Behavior. Ed. C Gans and D Crews. Vol. 18. Chicago and London: U of Chicago, 1992. 114–228. Print. Physiology E.&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals contain unique combinations of chemical compound "ingredients," and different combinations of ingredients can provide information about the individual that produced the chemical.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, BG, and TM Jones (2007). The role of chemical communication in mate choice. Biological Reviews, 82(2), 265–289.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, chemical composition differs considerably between species, which allows lizards to tell whether a lizard that deposited the chemical was a member of the same or a different species.&lt;ref&gt;Houck, LD (2009). Pheromone communication in amphibians and reptiles.Annual Review of Physiology, 71, 161–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more interesting, in some lizard species (such as the Iberian rock-lizards, ''Lacerta monticola''), their chemical secretions differ based on the individual that produced them.&lt;ref&gt;Aragón, P, P López, and J Martín (2001). Chemosensory discrimination of familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics by lizards: implications of field spatial relationships between males. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 50(2), 128–133.&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals are different enough that lizards detecting the chemicals can determine whether the individual that produced the chemical is familiar or not,&lt;ref&gt;Aragón, P, P López, and J Martín (2001). Chemosensory discrimination of familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics by lizards: implications of field spatial relationships between males. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 50(2), 128–133.&lt;/ref&gt; much like a human knows whether they've met a person before based on unique facial characteristics!

Lizards that use chemical communication have highly developed olfactory systems, which essentially give these lizards a very well developed sense of "smell" and enable them to detect chemicals in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, M "Nasal Chemical Senses in Reptiles: Structure and Function." Biology of the Reptilia: Hormones, Brain, and Behavior. Ed. D Crews. Vol. 18. Chicago and London: U of Chicago, 1992. 423–525. Print. Physiology E.&lt;/ref&gt; Several physical and behavioral characteristics are common among lizards that use chemical communication. Lizards that produce these chemicals often have femoral glands or [[femoral pores]] on their back legs.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, CJ (1966). Femoral glands in lizards: a review. Herpetologica, 199–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals are produced inside the lizard and are then released these via these pores. Lizards that use chemical communication are often observed to drag their back legs or lower half of their body against a surface they are walking across. By doing this, they are spreading their chemical secretions across an area, much like you might have seen a dog "marking" its territory. Another behavior common among lizards that use chemical communication is tongue flicking. Similar to what we see snakes doing, lizards that use chemical communication stick out their tongues and "taste" the chemicals present in the air and on various surfaces, such as rocks or logs that another lizard might have been sitting on. These chemicals can also be deposited in feces &lt;ref&gt;López, P, P Aragón, and J Martin (1998). Iberian rock lizards (Lacerta monticola cyreni) assess conspecific information using composite signals from faecal pellets. Ethology, 104(10), 809–820.&lt;/ref&gt;—lizards have been observed to defecate systematically throughout the area that they live in, suggesting that they may be placing chemicals in particular areas, such as marking the boundaries of a territory.&lt;ref&gt;López, P, P Aragón, and J Martin (1998). Iberian rock lizards (''Lacerta monticola cyreni'') assess conspecific information using composite signals from faecal pellets. Ethology, 104(10), 809–820.&lt;/ref&gt;

One unique aspect of chemical communication that differentiates it from other modes is that lizards do not need to come into direct contact in order to communicate using chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, RT, and MR Parker (2010). Social behavior and pheromonal communication in reptiles. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 196(10), 729–749.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a chemical has been released onto a surface, it can be used in communication until it is washed away or otherwise removed. Lizards may come into contact with chemicals that were placed there by a lizard hours or even days before, depending on how long the chemical lasts in the environment. Thus, lizards that live at relatively low population densities or do not come into close contact very often can use chemical communication. Because lizards that use chemical communication rely on these chemicals remaining in the environment for some amount of time, chemical communication is usually better suited for use in dry environments. In a wet environment, there is a high chance that precipitation might wash away the chemical.

Recent advances in our ability to detect and measure the compounds present in these chemicals have dramatically increased our understanding of lizard chemical communication. We are finding that many lizards thought to rely on other modes of communication also use chemical communication. As we continue to analyze the composition of these chemicals, we find that they can convey a wealth of information about the individual that produced them, and can function in many different communication contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Carazo, P, E Font, and E Desfilis (2007). Chemosensory assessment of rival competitive ability and scent-mark function in a lizard, Podarcis hispanica. Animal Behaviour, 74(4), 895–902.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Labra, A. (2006). Chemoreception and the assessment of fighting abilities in the lizard Liolaemus monticola. Ethology, 112(10), 993–999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martín, J, and P López. (2007). Scent may signal fighting ability in male Iberian rock lizards. Biology Letters, 3(2), 125–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tactile communication===
Some lizards use tactile communication. The term tactile means touch, and lizards that use tactile communication either use direct or indirect "touch" as a form of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, GW (1977). Display and communications in reptiles: an historical perspective. American zoologist, 17(1), 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Some species come into direct contact with one another, such as nudging, licking, biting, or bumping another lizard. This type of direct contact may be associated with courtship (i.e., attracting a mate), or with aggression—in many lizards, fights can escalate to direct physical contact, such as biting and bumping into one another. Species that engage in these physical conflicts often rely on other forms of communication (such as visual or chemical), and resort only to physical contact when other methods of deterring potential rivals have failed. In the case of courtship, some lizards such as the male Komodo dragon, ''Varanus komodoensis'', lick females to determine whether they are sexually receptive.&lt;ref&gt;Ciofi, C (1999). The Komodo dragon. Scientific American, 280(3), 84–91.&lt;/ref&gt; While this is direct touch, it also incorporates chemical communication, as the male is detecting different chemicals present on the female's body in addition to directly touching her.

There are also forms of tactile communication that do not involve direct touch, including vibrational communication.&lt;ref&gt;Markl, H (1983). Vibrational communication. In Neuroethology and behavioral physiology (pp.&amp;nbsp;332–353). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; Some chameleon species communicate with one another by vibrating the substrate that they are standing on, such as a tree branch or leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, KE , RB Cocroft, and LJ Fleishman. (1999). Possible communication by substrate vibration in a chameleon. Copeia, 225–228.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that use vibrational communication exhibit unique adaptations in morphology (i.e., body form) that enable them to detect vibration and use it in communication. These include unique adaptations in ear and jaw morphology that give the animal direct contact with the surface they are standing on, and enable them to detect subtle vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, PS (2001). Vibration and animal communication: a review. American Zoologist, 41(5), 1135–1142.&lt;/ref&gt; Lizards that live on substrates that can be easily moved (such as thin tree branches or leaves) are probably more likely to use vibrational communication than lizards that live on substrates that do not transmit vibrations as easily, such as the ground or thick tree trunks.

===Vocal communication===
Finally, a few lizards communicate using vocalizations. This mode of communication is primarily limited to nocturnal geckos, many of which produce vocalizations during behavioral interactions such as male competition.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, JP and LJ Vitt "Communication and Social Behavior." Herpetology: An Introductory Biology of Amphibians and Reptiles. 3rd ed. Burlington: Elsevier, 2009. 239-70. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankenberg, E (1982). Vocal behavior of the mediterranean house gecko, Hemidactylus turcicus. Copeia, 770–775.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbitts, TJ, Whiting, MJ, &amp; Stuart-Fox, D. M. (2007). Shouting the odds: vocalization signals status in a lizard. Behavioral ecology and sociobiology,61(8), 1169–1176.&lt;/ref&gt; Other lizards can produce vocalizations, but most have not been observed to do so in the wild. For instance, some lizards vocalize when handled,&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, JP and LJ Vitt "Communication and Social Behavior." Herpetology: An Introductory Biology of Amphibians and Reptiles. 3rd ed. Burlington: Elsevier, 2009. 239-70. Print&lt;/ref&gt; but have not been heard doing so undisturbed in the wild. It is possible that these vocalizations are used for communication, but observations of this behavior in natural populations would be needed to make this assertion. 
	 Lizards that use vocal communication need to produce vocalizations and need an appropriate auditory system to process the sounds. Vocal communication would be well suited for lizards that live in habitats that make it hard to see other individuals. Vocal communication may also be particularly well suited for lizards that behave at night. Vocal communication would be useful in these settings because it can be used to communicate without needing to come into contact with other lizards, or being able to see them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2602">'''Movement Concept''' is a modern system of learning and teaching with traditional roots which imparts inner and outer movement in the broadest sense.

==Background==
Movement Concept was created by [[Ingo Taleb Rashid]] and derives its fundamental principles from dance and theatre methods from East and West  (e.g. [[Butoh]], [[Noh]], [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislawski Method]]), martial arts (e.g. Ninpo, [[Capoeira]]) and the ancient
tradition of [[Sufism]], the spiritual principles of which are transferred into modern body work.
The idea behind Movement Concept is to tap a person’s full potential, to use exhaustively the
diversity of the body’s capacity for movement and expression, to make these accessible and use them for stage work and, at the same time, increases our awareness of it.
An essential part of the system is “play”, in which two people apply the acquired technique and abilities in free improvisation inside a protective circle of participants.

==Three-year Ongoing Curricular Training==
Movement Concept is intended as a practical educational training system combining bodywork, performing arts and spirituality. It is meant for all people who want to deal more deeply with these topics – regardless of age, experience or previous
knowledge. It is also suitable as advanced training for performers in the areas of dance, directing and choreography.
The Movement Concept curriculum spans three years (approx. 30 days of training each year).
Before entering into training, a personal conversation with the educational director is required.
The training concludes with a written assignment and a demonstration lesson.
After successful completion of the curriculum, participants receive a diploma that certifies the qualification
to teach Movement Concept under supervision of El Haddawi.

==Some Topics==
*Magic of the Body
*Dance, Improvisation and Choreography
*The Triangle of Intention
*The Dancing Warrior
*Living Anatomy, Health and Prevention of Injuries
*A Practical Introduction to the History of Dance
*Spirituality in Dance
*Stage-fright and Presence
*The Art of Flying and Falling
*Beyond the Masks – the Versatile Actor

'''Nelson Mandela University''' (formerly Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, NMMU, formerly the University of Port Elizabeth (UPE)) is a South African university with its main administration in the coastal city of [[Port Elizabeth]]. Nelson Mandela University was founded through a merger of three institutions in January 2005, but its history dates back to 1882, with the foundation of the Port Elizabeth Art School. The University draws international students from all over the world. There are over 3,000 international students, including students from the United States, France, China, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and many African countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Nelson Mandela University is a comprehensive university offering professional and [[vocational]] training. The University has seven campuses – six in [[Port Elizabeth, South Africa|Port Elizabeth]] and one in [[George, Western Cape|George]]. The main campus of the university is South Campus.

A number of courses include workplace experience as part of the curriculum at Nelson Mandela University. English is the university's medium of instruction.

==History and formation==
{{Main article|University of Port Elizabeth|Vista University}}
Plans for the then NMMU where first revealed in 2002, by then [[Minister of Education (South Africa)|Minister of Education]], [[Kader Asmal]]. The proposal was a part of larger plan to restructure higher education in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/shake-up-in-south-africa-gets-green-light/169757.article|title=Shake-up in South Africa gets green light|date=14 June 2002|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first step in the merger came with the incorporation of Vista PE by UPE on January 2, 2004 followed by the merger of PE Technikon and UPE on January 1, 2005.

NMMU was formed in 2005 through the merger of the Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the [[University of Port Elizabeth]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 2004, prior to the merger, UPE had taken control of the [[Port Elizabeth]] Campus of [[Vista University]]. PE Technikon had a satellite campus in [[George, Western Cape|George]], which was also merged. The first Chancellor of the university was Chief Justice Pius Langa and Justice Ronnie Pillay was the first Chairperson of Council. Dr Rolf Stumpf was the first Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive Officer of the university, who was then succeeded by Professor Derrick Swartz on January 1, 2008.

The name of the University was formally changed from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University to Nelson Mandela University on 20 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/education/2017-07-10-nelson-mandela-metropolitan-university-to-rebrand-itself/|title=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University to rebrand itself|date=10 July 2017|publisher=Business Day|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PE Technikon logo.svg|right|thumb|150px|PE Technikon logo]]

===PE Technikon===
PE Technikon had its roots in the Port Elizabeth Art School, which was founded in 1882 and was the oldest art school in South Africa, and was situated in Russell Road, Central. It was later renamed the College for Advanced Technical Education (CATE). The college moved to University Way in Summerstrand in 1974, and became PE technikon in 1979.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The Port Elizabeth Teachers' Training College was located in 2nd Avenue, Summerstrand. It was taken over by PE Technikon in 1994, and became known as the College Campus.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

[[Saasveld Forestry College]] was founded as the Tokai School for Forest Apprentices in 1912 in [[Cape Town]]. The school was an offshoot of the [[South African College Schools]]. In 1932, it moved to its current location, between [[George, Western Cape|George]] and [[Knysna]]. The campus was taken over by PE Technikon from the Department of Agriculture in 1985.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

The Algoa College of Education was situated in Struandale, approximately {{convert|25|km|mi}} away from Summerstrand. It became part of the PE Technikon in 2001, and was known as the Algoa Campus.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 2001, the George Campus was added to by purchasing Hurteria Building in the city centre.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

At the time of the merger, PE Technikon had more than 10 000 students. The institution's last Chancellor was former Speaker of Parliament Dr Frene Ginwala, the last Vice-Chancellor Prof Hennie Snyman and the last Chair of Council being Mr Clive Stanton.

===University of Port Elizabeth (UPE)===
UPE was the country's first dual-medium (English and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]) residential university. 
It came into being on January 31, with the adoption by Parliament of Act 1 of 1964. The first academic year commenced on March 1, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/university-port-elizabeth-founded|title=The University of Port Elizabeth is founded|date=|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially situated in a series of buildings on Bird Street, in the historic Central district, UPE moved to a modern, purpose-built campus – incorporating residences, a sports complex and the towering Main Building – in Summerstrand in 1974. The campus was officially opened in August 1975 and the final move from Bird Street came in 1979 with the opening of the science blocks at Summerstrand. The University retained some of its Bird Street buildings and these became the centre of community outreach activities.

Built on 830 ha of land donated by the then Port Elizabeth City Council, the campus was declared a nature reserve in 1983.

At the time of the merger, UPE had more than 9 000 contact students and almost 5 000 distance education students. The last Chancellor was Dr Brigalia Bam, the last Vice-Chancellor Prof Nthabiseng Ogude and the last Chair of Council Mr Trevor Jennings.

===Vista University (Vista PE)===
Vista was founded on 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/Articles/TarkArticle.aspx?ID=236618|title=News Worth Knowing|date=|publisher=Business Day|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Port Elizabeth campus was built in 1982. Subsequently, seven decentralized contact tuition campuses were established, centred on township areas where the need for accessible and affordable higher education was most urgent. In 1982 the Port Elizabeth campus consisted of a small, prefabricated building patched between the national road to Uitenhage and the edge of Zwide township. Its location opened up access to higher education for many students from socially and financially disadvantaged backgrounds.

The campus had its first academic year in 1983 and in 1991 a permanent brick structure was completed. Later additions such as the Conference Hall and Arena provided accessible facilities for the surrounding community for large events. With seating for 5 000, the Arena is the Eastern Cape’s largest indoor venue.

Initially focused on the upgrading of teachers through its Education Faculty, in its subsequent growth Vista far surpassed the narrow field of expertise cut out for it, producing graduates in business, law, science and the humanities.

At the time of the merger, Vista PE had approximately 2 000 students and was led by Acting Campus Principal Prof Miemie Struwig.
with its first academic year in 1983. It was taken over by UPE.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Governance and administration==

The Vice-Chancellor is responsible for the day-to-day running of the university. Deputy Vice-Chancellors for Research and Engagement, Teaching and Learning, Institutional Support as well as the Registrar, acting as the Secretary to the University's Council, assist the Vice-Chancellor in his duties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4326">In [[computability theory]] a '''numbering''' is the assignment of [[natural number]]s to a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of objects such as functions, [[rational number]]s, [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, or words in some [[language]]. A numbering can be used to transfer the idea of computability and related concepts, which are originally defined on the natural numbers using [[computable function]]s, to these different types of objects.

Common examples of numberings include [[Gödel numbering]]s in [[first-order logic]] and [[admissible numbering]]s of the set of partial computable functions.

== Definition and examples ==
A '''numbering''' of a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[surjective function|surjective]] [[partial function]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to ''S'' (Ershov 1999:477). The value of a numbering &amp;nu; at a number ''i'' (if defined) is often written &amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; instead of the usual &lt;math&gt;\nu(i) \!&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of numberings include:
* The set of all finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a numbering &amp;gamma;, defined so that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and so that, for each finite nonempty set &lt;math&gt;A = \{a_0, \ldots, a_k\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma(n_A) = A&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n_A = \sum_{i \leq k} 2^{a_i}&lt;/math&gt; (Ershov 1999:477).  This numbering is a bijection. 
* A fixed Gödel numbering &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; of the computable partial functions can be used to define a numbering ''W'' of the [[recursively enumerable set]]s, by letting by ''W''(''i'') be the domain of &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This numbering will be surjective (like all numberings) but not injective: there will be distinct numbers that map to the same recursively enumerable set under ''W''.

== Types of numberings ==

A numbering is '''total''' if it is a total function. If the [[domain (function)|domain]] of a partial numbering is [[recursively enumerable]] then there always exists an equivalent total numbering (equivalence of numberings is defined below).

A numbering &amp;eta; is '''decidable''' if the set &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) : \eta(x) = \eta(y)\}&lt;/math&gt; is a decidable set.

A numbering &amp;eta; is '''single-valued''' if &amp;eta;(''x'') = &amp;eta;(''y'') if and only if ''x''=''y''; in other words if &amp;eta; is an injective function. A single-valued numbering of the set of partial computable functions is called a [[Friedberg numbering]].

== Comparison of numberings ==

There is a [[partial ordering]] on the set of all numberings. Let &lt;math&gt;\nu_1: \subseteq \mathbb{N} \to S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_2: \subseteq \mathbb{N} \to S_2&lt;/math&gt; be two numberings. Then &lt;math&gt;\nu_1&lt;/math&gt; is '''reducible''' to &lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \le \nu_2&lt;/math&gt;, 
if 
:&lt;math&gt;\exists f \in \mathbf{P}^{(1)} \, \forall i \in \mathrm{Domain}(\nu_1) : \nu_1(i) = \nu_2 \circ f(i).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \le \nu_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \ge \nu_2&lt;/math&gt; then  &lt;math&gt;\nu_1&lt;/math&gt; is '''equivalent''' to &lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt;; this is written &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \equiv \nu_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Computable numberings ==

When the objects of the set ''S'' are sufficiently "constructive", it is common to look at numberings that can be effectively decoded (Ershov 1999:486). For example, if ''S'' consists of recursively enumerable sets, the numbering &amp;eta; is '''computable''' if the set of pairs (''x'',''y'') where ''y''&amp;isin;&amp;eta;(''x'') is recursively enumerable.  Similarly, a numbering ''g'' of partial functions is computable if the relation ''R''(''x'',''y'',''z'') = "[''g''(''x'')](''y'') = ''z''" is partial recursive (Ershov 1999:487).

A computable numbering is called '''principal''' if every computable numbering of the same set is reducible to it. Both the set of all r.e. subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and the set of all partial computable functions have principle numberings (Ershov 1999:487). A principle numbering of the set of partial recursive functions is known as an [[admissible numbering]] in the literature.

'''Observational learning''' is [[learning]] that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of [[Social learning theory|social learning]] which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need [[reinforcement]] to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a [[parent]], [[sibling]], [[friend]], or [[teacher]] with surroundings. Particularly in childhood, a model is someone of authority or higher status in an environment. In animals, observational learning is often based on classical conditioning, in which an instinctive behavior is elicited by observing the behavior of another (e.g. mobbing in birds), but other processes may be involved as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. "Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior", 2010 (2nd ed.) New York:Oxford,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human observational learning==
Many behaviors that a learner observes, remembers, and imitates are actions that models display and display modeling, even though the model may not intentionally try to instill a particular behavior. A child may learn to swear, smack, smoke, and deem other inappropriate behavior acceptable through poor modeling. Bandura claims that children continually learn desirable and undesirable behavior through observational learning. Observational learning suggests that an individual's environment, [[cognition]], and behavior all incorporate and ultimately determine how the individual functions and models.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1971) "Psychological Modelling".New York: Lieber-Antherton&lt;/ref&gt;

Through observational learning, individual behaviors can spread across a culture through a process called ''[[diffusion]] chain''. This basically occurs when an individual first learns a behavior by observing another individual and that individual serves as a model through whom other individuals learn the behavior, and so on.&lt;ref name="Schacter D.L et al. 2011 295"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter, Gilbert, &amp; Wegner|first=D. L., D.T., &amp; D. M.|title=Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|pages=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture]] plays a role in whether observational learning is the dominant learning style in a person or [[community]].  Some cultures expect children to actively participate in their communities and are therefore exposed to different trades and roles on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Garton 2007 195–216"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garton|first=A. F.|title=Learning through collaboration: Is there a multicultural perspective?|year=2007|publisher=AIP|pages=195–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exposure allows children to observe and learn the different skills and practices that are valued in their communities.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Claire|title=Hughes, Claire. (2011) Social Understanding and Social Lives|year=2011|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, Ny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Bandura]], who is  known for the classic [[Bobo doll experiment]], identified this basic form of learning in 1961. The importance of observational learning lies in helping individuals, especially children, acquire new responses by observing others' behavior.[[File:Bobo doll 1.png|thumb|[[Bobo doll experiment|Bobo doll]]]] Albert Bandura states that people’s behavior could be determined by their environment.  Observational learning occurs through observing negative and positive behaviors. Bandura believes in [[reciprocal determinism]] in which the environment can influence people’s behavior and vice versa. For instance, the Bobo doll experiment shows that model, in a determined environment, affects children’s behavior. In this experiment Bandura demonstrates that one group of children placed in an aggressive environment would act the same way, while the control group and the other group of children placed in a passive role model environment hardly shows any type of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Human Behavior is learned Through Modeling|url=http://credoreference.com/content/entry/dkpsycbook/most_human_behavior_is_learned_through_modeling_albert_bandura_1925/0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In communities where children's primary mode of learning is through observation, the [[Child Integration|children]] are rarely separated from adult activities. This incorporation into the adult world at an early age allows children to use observational learning skills in multiple spheres of life. This learning through observation requires keen attentive abilities. Culturally, they learn that their participation and contributions are valued in their communities. This teaches children that it is their duty, as members of the community, to observe others' contributions so they gradually become involved and participate further in the community.&lt;ref name="Fleer 2003 64–79"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleer|first=M.|title=Early Childhood Education as an Evolving 'Community of Practice' or as Lived 'Social Reproduction': researching the 'taken-for-granted'|journal=Contemporary Issues in Early Childhood|year=2003|volume=4|issue=1|pages=64–79|doi=10.2304/ciec.2003.4.1.7|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/hf/konstrukt/didaktik/communities/viewpdf.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.486.6531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
[[File:Skiing lesson at Flumserberg.jpg|thumbnail|right]]
Bandura's [[social cognitive theory|social cognitive learning theory]] states that there are four stages involved in observational learning:&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, Albert. "Observational Learning." Learning and Memory. Ed. John H. Byrne. 2nd ed. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2004. 482-484. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 6 Oct. 2014. Document URL http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3407100173&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=06f2484b425a0c9f9606dff1b2a86c18&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Attention''': Observers cannot learn unless they pay attention to what's happening around them. This process is influenced by characteristics of the model, such as how much one likes or identifies with the model, and by characteristics of the observer, such as the observer's expectations or level of emotional arousal.
# '''Retention'''/'''Memory:''' Observers must not only recognize the observed behavior but also remember it at some later time. This process depends on the observer's ability to code or structure the information in an easily remembered form or to mentally or physically rehearse the model's actions. 
# '''Initiation'''/'''Motor''': Observers must be physically and/intellectually capable of producing the act. In many cases the observer possesses the necessary responses. But sometimes, reproducing the model's actions may involve skills the observer has not yet acquired. It is one thing to carefully watch a circus juggler, but it is quite another to go home and repeat those acts. 
# '''Motivation''': The observer must have motivation to recreate the observed behavior.

Bandura clearly distinguishes between learning and performance. Unless motivated, a person does not produce learned behavior. This motivation can come from external reinforcement, such as the experimenter's promise of reward in some of Bandura's studies, or the bribe of a parent. Or it can come from vicarious reinforcement, based on the observation that models are rewarded. High-status models can affect performance through motivation. For example, girls aged 11 to 14 performed better on a motor performance task when they thought it was demonstrated by a high-status cheerleader than by a low-status model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = Maureen R. | last2 = Ebbeck | first2 = Vicki | last3 = Rose | first3 = Debra J. | year = 1992 | title = "Show and tell" in the gymnasium revisited: Developmental differences in modeling and verbal rehearsal effects on motor skill learning and performance | url = | journal = Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 292–301 | doi=10.1080/02701367.1992.10608745| pmid = 1513960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have even added a step between attention and retention involving encoding a behavior.

Observational learning leads to a change in an individual's behavior along three dimensions:
# An individual thinks about a situation in a different way and may have incentive to react to it.
# The change is a result of a person's direct experiences as opposed to being in-born.
# For the most part, the change an individual has made is permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Maureen et al. (1998). Observational Learning and the Fearful Child: Influence of Peer Models on Swimming Skill Performance and Psychological Responses. 380-394&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on behavior==
[[File:Learning djembe.jpg|thumbnail|Learning to play Djembe.]]
According to Bandura's social cognitive learning theory, observational learning can affect behavior in many ways, with both positive and negative consequences. It can teach completely new behaviors, for one. It can also increase or decrease the frequency of behaviors that have previously been learned. Observational learning can even encourage behaviors that were previously forbidden (for example, the violent behavior towards the Bobo doll that children imitated in Albert Bandura's study). Observational learning can also influence behaviors that are similar to, but not identical to, the ones being modeled. For example, seeing a model excel at playing the piano may motivate an observer to play the saxophone.

===Age difference===
[[Albert Bandura]] stressed that developing children learn from different social models, meaning that no two children are exposed to exactly the same modeling influence. From [[infancy]] to [[adolescence]], they are exposed to various social models. A 2013 study found that a toddlers' previous social familiarity with a model was not always necessary for learning and that they were also able to learn from observing a stranger demonstrating or modeling a new action to another stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shimpi | first1 = Priya M. | last2 = Akhtar | first2 = Nameera | last3 = Moore | first3 = Chris | year = 2013 | title = Toddlers' Imitative Learning in Interactive and Observational Contexts: The Role of Age and Familiarity of the Model | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096513001318 | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 116 | issue = 2| pages = 309–23 | doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2013.06.008| pmid = 23896415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once believed that babies could not imitate actions until the latter half of the first year. However a number of studies now report that infants as young as seven days can imitate simple facial expressions. By the latter half of their first year, 9-month-old babies can imitate actions hours after they first see them. As they continue to develop, toddlers around age two can acquire important personal and [[social skills]] by imitating a social model.

[[Imitation|Deferred imitation]] is an important developmental milestone in a two-year-old, in which children not only construct symbolic representations, but can also remember information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = A | year = 1988 | title = Infants imitation after 1-week delay: Long -Term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 470–476 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.4.470 | pmid=25147404 | pmc=4137879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike toddlers, children of [[elementary school]] age are less likely to rely on imagination to represent an experience. Instead, they can verbally describe the model's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1989). Social Cognitive Theory. In R. Vasta (ED.), Annals of child Development: Vol. 6. Theories of child development: Revised formulation and current issue (pp.1-60). Greenwich, CT : JAI Press&lt;/ref&gt; Since this form of learning does not need reinforcement, it is more likely to occur regularly.

As age increases, age-related observational learning motor skills may decrease in athletes and golfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Law | first1 = Barbi | last2 = Hall | first2 = Craig | year = 2009 | title = The Relationships Among Skill Level, Age, and Golfers' Observational Learning Use | url = | journal = Sport Psychologist | volume = 23 | issue = 1| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger and skilled golfers have higher observational learning compared to older golfers and less skilled golfers.

===Observational causal learning===
Humans use observational Moleen causal learning to watch other people’s actions and use the information gained to find out how something works and how we can do it ourselves.

A study of 25-month-old infants found that they can learn causal relations from observing human interventions. They also learn by observing normal actions not created by intentional human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = A. N. | last2 = Waismeyer | first2 = A. | last3 = Gopnik | first3 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Learning about causes from people: Observational causal learning in 24-month-old infants | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 5| pages = 1215–1228 | doi = 10.1037/a0027440 | pmid=22369335 | pmc=3649070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with imitation===
Observational learning is presumed to have occurred when an organism copies an improbable action or action outcome that it has observed and the matching behavior cannot be explained by an alternative mechanism. Psychologists have been particularly interested in the form of observational learning known as imitation and in how to distinguish imitation from other processes. To successfully make this distinction, one must separate the degree to which behavioral similarity results from (a) [[Genetic predisposition|predisposed behavior]], (b) increased motivation resulting from the presence of another animal, (c) attention drawn to a place or object, (d) learning about the way the environment works, as distinguished from what we think of as (e) imitation (the copying of the demonstrated behavior).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zentall | first1 = Thomas R | year = 2012 | title = Perspectives On Observational Learning In Animals | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 126 | issue = 2| pages = 114–128 | doi=10.1037/a0025381| pmid = 21895354 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.401.6916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observational learning differs from [[imitative learning]] in that it does not require a duplication of the behavior exhibited by the model. For example, the learner may observe an unwanted behavior and the subsequent consequences, and thus learn to refrain from that behavior. For example, Riopelle (1960) found that monkeys did better with observational learning if they saw the "tutor" monkey make a mistake before making the right choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riopelle | first1 = A.J. | year = 1960 | title = Observational learning of a position habit by monkeys | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 5| pages = 426–428 | doi=10.1037/h0046480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heyes (1993) distinguished imitation and non-imitative social learning in the following way: imitation occurs when animals learn about behavior from observing conspecifics, whereas non-imitative social learning occurs when animals learn about the environment from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyes | first1 = C. M. | year = 1993 | title = Imitation, culture and cognition | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 46 | issue = 5| pages = 999–1010 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all imitation and learning through observing is the same, and they often differ in the degree to which they take on an active or passive form. [[John Dewey]] describes an important distinction between two different forms of imitation: imitation as an end in itself and imitation with a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=John|title=Democracy and Education|date=1916|publisher=Macmillan Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imitation as an end is more akin to mimicry, in which a person copies another's act to repeat that action again. This kind of imitation is often observed in animals. Imitation with a purpose utilizes the imitative act as a means to accomplish something more significant. Whereas the more passive form of imitation as an end has been documented in some European American communities, the other kind of more active, purposeful imitation has been documented in other communities around the world.

Observation may take on a more active form in children's learning in multiple [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]]. [[Ethnographic]] [[anthropological]] studies in Yucatec Mayan and Quechua Peruvian communities provide evidence that the home or community-centered economic systems of these cultures allow children to witness first-hand, activities that are meaningful to their own livelihoods and the overall well-being of the community.&lt;ref name="Alta Mira Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaskins|first1=Paradise|title=The Anthropology of Learning in Childhood|publisher=Alta Mira Press|pages=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have the opportunity to observe activities that are relevant within the context of that community, which gives them a reason to sharpen their attention to the practical knowledge they are exposed to. This does not mean that they have to observe the activities even though they are present. The children often make an active decision to stay in attendance while a community activity is taking place to observe and learn.&lt;ref name="Alta Mira Press"/&gt; This decision underscores the significance of this learning style in many indigenous American communities. It goes far beyond learning mundane tasks through rote imitation; it is central to children's gradual transformation into informed members of their communities' unique practices. There was also a study, done with children, that concluded that Imitated behavior can be recalled and used in another situation or the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaughlin | first1 = L. J. | last2 = Brinley | first2 = J. F. | year = 1973 | title = Age and observational learning of a multiple-classification task | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 9–15 | doi = 10.1037/h0035069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apprenticeship===
[[Apprenticeship]] can involve both observational learning and modelling. Apprentices gain their skills in part through working with masters in their profession and through observing and evaluating the work of their fellow apprentices.Examples include renaissance inventor/painter Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, before succeeding in their profession they were apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groenendijk | first1 = Talita | last2 = Janssen | first2 = Tanja | last3 = Rijlaarsdam | first3 = Gert | last4 = Huub Van | first4 = Den Bergh | year = 2013 | title = Learning to Be Creative.

===Learning without imitation===
[[Michael Tomasello]] described various ways of observational learning without the process of imitation in animals&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. (1999). The cultural origins of human cognition. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. 248 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[ethology]]):
Exposure- Individuals learn about their environment with a close proximity to other individuals that have more experience. For example, a young dolphin learning the location of a plethora of fish by staying near its mother.

* [[Stimulus (psychology)|Stimulus]] enhancement – Individuals become interested in an object from watching others interact with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spence | first1 = K. W. | year = 1937 | title = Experimental studies of learning and higher mental processes in infra-human primates | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 806–850 | doi=10.1037/h0061498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased interest in an object may result in object manipulation, which facilitates new object-related behaviors by trial-and-error learning. For example, a young killer whale might become interested in playing with a sea lion pup after watching other whales toss the sea lion pup around. After playing with the pup, the killer whale may develop foraging behaviors appropriate to such prey. In this case, the killer whale did not learn to prey on sea lions by observing other whales do so, but rather the killer whale became intrigued after observing other whales play with the pup. After the killer whale became interested, then its interactions with the sea lion resulted in behaviors that provoked future foraging efforts.
* Goal [[emulation (observational learning)|emulation]] – Individuals are enticed by the end result of an observed behavior and attempt the same outcome but with a different method. For example, Haggerty (1909) devised an experiment in which a monkey climbed up the side of a cage, stuck its arm into a wooden chute, and pulled a rope in the chute to release food. Another monkey was provided an opportunity to obtain the food after watching a monkey go through this process on four separate occasions. The monkey performed a different method and finally succeeded after trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haggerty | first1 = M. E. | year = 1909 | title = Imitation in monkeys | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 337–455 | doi=10.1002/cne.920190402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer model influences===
Observational learning is very beneficial when there are positive, reinforcing peer models involved. Although individuals go through four different stages for observational learning: attention; retention ; production; and motivation, this does not simply mean that when an individual's attention is captured that it automatically sets the process in that exact order. One of the most important ongoing stages for observational learning, especially among children, is motivation and [[Reinforcement|positive reinforcement]]{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}.

Performance is enhanced when children are positively instructed on how they can improve a situation and where children actively participate alongside a more skilled person. Examples of this are scaffolding and guided participation. Scaffolding refers to an expert responding contingently to a novice so the novice gradually increases their understanding of a problem. Guided participation refers to an expert actively engaging in a situation with a novice so the novice participates with or observes the adult to understand how to resolve a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, David et al. (2010). Developmental Psychology, Childhood and Adolescence. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural variation==

[[Cultural diversity|Cultural variation]] can be seen by the extent of information learned or absorbed by children in non-Western cultures through learning by observation. Cultural variation is not restricted only to ethnicity and nationality, but rather, extends to the specific practices within communities. In learning by observation, children use observation to learn without verbal requests for further information, or without direct instruction. For example, children from Mexican heritage families tend to learn and make better use of information observed during classroom demonstration than children of European heritage.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=M.|title=Culture and early childhood learning|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/pages/pdf/cole-hakkarainen-bredikyteangxp.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mejia-Arauz 2005 282–291"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mejia-Arauz|first=R.|author2=Rogoff, B. |author3=Paradise, R. |title=Cultural variation in children's observation during a demonstration|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|year=2005|volume=29|issue=4|pages=282–291|doi=10.1177/01650250544000062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of European heritage experience the type of learning that separates them from their family and community activities. They instead participate in lessons and other exercises in special settings such as school.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Barbara. "Cultural Variation in Children's Attention and Learning." N.p.: n.p., n.d. N. pag. PsycINFO. Web.
&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural backgrounds differ from each other in which children display certain characteristics in regards to learning an activity. Another example is seen in the immersion of children in some [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous communities of the Americas]] into the adult world and the effects it has on observational learning and the ability to complete multiple tasks simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Fleer 2003 64–79"/&gt; This might be due to children in these communities having the opportunity to see a task being completed by their elders or peers and then trying to emulate the task. In doing so they learn to value observation and the skill-building it affords them  because of the value it holds within their community.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2011"/&gt; This type of observation is not passive, but reflects the child's intent to participate or learn within a community.&lt;ref name="Garton 2007 195–216"/&gt;

Observational learning can be seen taking place in many domains of Indigenous communities. The classroom setting is one significant example, and it functions differently for Indigenous communities compared to what is commonly present in Western schooling. The emphasis of keen observation in favor of supporting participation in ongoing activities strives to aid children to learn the important tools and ways of their community.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; Engaging in shared endeavors – with both the experienced and inexperienced – allows for the experienced to understand what the inexperienced need in order to grow in regards to the assessment of observational learning.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; The involvement of the inexperienced, or the children in this matter, can either be furthered by the children’s learning or advancing into the activity performed by the assessment of observational learning.&lt;ref name="Mejia-Arauz 2005 282–291"/&gt; Indigenous communities rely on observational learning as a way for their children to be a part of ongoing activities in the community (Tharp, 2006).

Although learning in the Indigenous American communities is not always the central focus when participating in an activity,&lt;ref name="Mejia-Arauz 2005 282–291"/&gt; studies have shown that attention in intentional observation differs from accidental observation. Intentional participation is “keen observation and listening in anticipation of, or in the process of engaging in endeavors”. This means that when they have the intention of participating in an event, their attention is more focused on the details, compared to when they are accidentally observing.

Observational learning can be an active process in many Indigenous American communities. The learner must take initiative to attend to activities going on around them. Children in these communities also take initiative to contribute their knowledge in ways that will benefit their community. For example, in many Indigenous American cultures, children perform household chores without being instructed to do so by adults. Instead, they observe a need for their contributions, understand their role in their community, and take initiative to accomplish the tasks they have observed others doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Coppens, A., Alcala, L., Mejia-Arauz, R., Rogoff, B.|title=Children's Initiative in Family Household Work in Mexico|journal=Human Development|date=2014|doi=10.1159/000356768|volume=57|issue=2–3|pages=116–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learner's intrinsic motivations play an important role in the child's understanding and construction of meaning in these educational experiences. The independence and responsibility associated with observational learning in many Indigenous American communities are significant reasons why this method of learning involves more than just watching and imitating. A learner must be actively engaged with their demonstrations and experiences in order to fully comprehend and apply the knowledge they obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open attention as a cultural tool for observational learning |url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=Kellogg Institute for International Studies University of Notre Dame|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous communities of the Americas===

[[File:Poblado-maya-1.jpg|thumb|Mayan villagers]]
Children from [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous heritage communities]] of the Americas often [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|learn through observation]], a strategy that can carry over into adulthood. The heightened value towards observation allows children to [[Attention#Cultural variation|multi-task and actively engage in simultaneous activities]]. The exposure to an uncensored adult lifestyle allows children to [[Informal learning#American indigenous perspective|observe and learn]] the skills and practices that are valued in their communities.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2011"/&gt; Children observe elders, parents, and siblings complete tasks and learn to participate in them. They are seen as contributors and learn to observe multiple tasks being completed at once and can learn to complete a task, while still engaging with other community members without being distracted.

Indigenous communities provide more [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|opportunities]] to incorporate [[Child Integration|children]] in everyday life.&lt;ref name="Barbara Rogoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|author2=Paradise, R. |author3=Arauz, R. |author4=Correa-Chavez, M. |title=Firsthand learning through intent participation|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2003|volume=54|pages=175–203|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118 |pmid=12499516|hdl=10400.12/5953}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in some [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] communities where children are given full access to community events, which allows observational learning to occur more often.&lt;ref name="Barbara Rogoff"/&gt; Other children in [[Mazahua people|Mazahua, Mexico]] are known to intensely observe ongoing activities.&lt;ref name="Barbara Rogoff"/&gt; In native northern Canadian and indigenous Mayan communities, children often learn as third-party observers from [[Storytelling|stories]] and conversations by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|last2=Paradise|first2=Ruth|last3=Correa-Chavez|first3=M|last4=Arauz|first4=R|title=Firsthand Learning through Intent Participation|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2003|volume=54|pages=175–203|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118|pmid=12499516|hdl=10400.12/5953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most young Mayan children are carried on their mother's back, allowing them to observe their mother's work and see the world as their mother sees it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Modiano,|first1=Nancy|title=Indian education in the Chiapas Highlands|date=1973|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|isbn=978-0030842375|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, children in Indigenous American communities assume the majority of the responsibility for their learning.

Children aged 6 to 8 in an indigenous heritage community in [[Guadalajara|Guadalajara, Mexico]] participated in hard work, such as cooking or running errands, to benefit the whole family, while those in the city of Guadalajara rarely did so. These children participated more in adult regulated activities and had little time to play, while those from the indigenous-heritage community had more time to play and initiate in their own after-school activities and had a higher sense of belonging to their community.&lt;ref&gt;Children's Initiative in Contributions to Family Work in Indigenous-Heritage and Cosmopolitan Communities in Mexico. (2014). 57(2-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within certain indigenous communities people do not typically seek out explanation beyond basic observation. This is because they are competent in learning through astute observation.  In a Guatemalan footloom factory amateur adult weavers observed skilled weavers over the course of weeks without questioning or being given explanations; the amateur weaver moved at their own pace and began when they felt confident.&lt;ref name="Barbara Rogoff"/&gt; The framework of learning how to weave through observation can serve as a model that groups within a society use as a reference to guide their actions in particular domains of life.&lt;ref name="J.

When an animal is given a task to complete, they are almost always more successful after observing another animal doing the same task before them. Experiments have been conducted on several different species with the same effect: animals can learn behaviors from peers. However, there is a need to distinguish the propagation of behavior and the stability of behavior. Research has shown that social learning can spread a behavior, but there are more factors regarding how a behavior carries across generations of an [[animal culture]].&lt;ref name="Frith, Chris D. 2012"&gt;Frith, Chris D., and Uta Frith. "Mechanisms Of Social Cognition." ''Annual Review Of Psychology'' 2012; 63.: 287-313&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning in fish===
Experiments with [[ninespine stickleback]]s showed that individuals will use social learning to locate food.&lt;ref name="Frith, Chris D. 2012"/&gt;

===Social learning in pigeons===
[[File:Columba livia in Japan.JPG|thumb|Pigeon]]A study in 1996 at the University of Kentucky used a foraging device to test social learning in pigeons. A pigeon could access the food reward by either pecking at a treadle or stepping on it. Significant correspondence was found between the methods of how the observers accessed their food and the methods the initial model used in accessing the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zentall | first1 = T.

M. | year = 1996 | title = True imitative learning in  pigeons | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 343–346 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00386.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquiring foraging niches===
Studies have been conducted at the University of Oslo and University of Saskatchewan regarding the possibility of social learning in birds, delineating the difference between cultural and genetic acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/366/1567/969.full.pdf|title = Social learning in birds and its role in shaping a foraging niche|date = 2011|access-date = Jan 18, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = Slagsvold|first = Tore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong evidence already exists for mate choice, bird song, predator recognition, and foraging.

Researchers cross-fostered eggs between nests of blue tits and great tits and observed the resulting behavior through audio-visual recording. Tits raised in the foster family learned their foster family's foraging sites early. This shift—from the sites the tits would among their own kind and the sites they learned from the foster parents—lasted for life. What young birds learn from foster parents, they eventually transmitted to their own offspring. This suggests cultural transmissions of foraging behavior over generations in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slagsvold | first1 = T. | last2 = Wiebe | first2 = K. L. | year = 2011 | title = Social learning in birds and its role in shaping  a foraging niche | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 366 | issue = 1567| pages = 969–977 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2010.0343 | pmid=21357219 | pmc=3049099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social learning in crows===
The University of Washington studied this phenomenon with crows, acknowledging the evolutionary tradeoff between acquiring costly information firsthand and learning that information socially with less cost to the individual but at the risk of inaccuracy. The experimenters exposed wild crows to a unique “dangerous face” mask as they trapped, banded, and released 7-15 birds at five different study places around Seattle, WA. An immediate scolding response to the mask after trapping by previously captured crows illustrates that the individual crow learned the danger of that mask. There was a scolding from crows that were captured that had not been captured initially. That response indicates conditioning from the mob of birds that assembled during the capture.

Horizontal social learning (learning from peers) is consistent with the lone crows that recognized the dangerous face without ever being captured. Children of captured crow parents were conditioned to scold the dangerous mask, which demonstrates vertical social learning (learning from parents). The crows that were captured directly had the most precise discrimination between dangerous and neutral masks than the crows that learned from the experience of their peers. The ability of crows to learn doubled the frequency of scolding, which spread at least 1.2&amp;nbsp;km from where the experiment started to over a 5-year period at one site.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, H. N., Marzluff, J. M., &amp; Pecoraro, S. (2012). Social learning spreads knowledge about dangerous humans among american crows. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propagation of animal culture===

Researchers at the Département d’Etudes Cognitives, Institut Jean Nicod, Ecole Normale Supérieure acknowledged a difficulty with research in social learning. To count acquired behavior as cultural, two conditions need must be met: the behavior must spread in a social group, and that behavior must be stable across generations. Research has provided evidence that imitation may play a role in the propagation of a behavior, but these researchers believe the fidelity of this evidence is not sufficient to prove stability of animal culture.

Other factors like ecological availability, reward-based factors, content-based factors, and source-based factors might explain the stability of animal culture in a wild rather than just imitation. As an example of ecological availability, chimps may learn how to fish for ants with a stick from their peers, but that behavior is also influenced by the particular type of ants as well as the condition.  A behavior may be learned socially, but the fact that it was learned socially does not necessarily mean it will last. The fact that the behavior is rewarding has a role in cultural stability as well. The ability for socially-learned behaviors to stabilize across generations is also mitigated by the complexity of the behavior. Different individuals of a species, like crows, vary in their ability to use a complex tool. Finally, a behavior’s stability in animal culture depends on the context in which they learn a behavior. If a behavior has already been adopted by a majority, then the behavior is more likely to carry across generations out of a need for conforming.

Animals are able to acquire behaviors from social learning, but whether or not that behavior carries across generations requires more investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Claidiere | first1 = N. | last2 = Sperber | first2 = D. | year = 2010 | title = Imitation explains the propagation, not the  stability of animal culture | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 277 | issue = 1681| pages = 651–659 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.1615 | pmid = 19889707 | pmc = 2842690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hummingbird experiment===
Experiments with hummingbirds provided one example of apparent observational learning in a non-human organism. Hummingbirds were divided into two groups. Birds in one group were exposed to the feeding of a knowledgeable "tutor" bird; hummingbirds in the other group did not have this exposure. In subsequent tests the birds that had seen a tutor were more efficient feeders than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altshuler | first1 = D. | last2 = Nunn | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Obeservational learning in hummingbirds | url = | journal = The Auk | volume = 118 | issue = 3| pages = 795–799 | doi=10.2307/4089948| jstor = 4089948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottlenose dolphin===
Herman (2002) suggested that [[bottlenose dolphins]] produce goal-emulated behaviors rather than imitative ones. A dolphin that watches a model place a ball in a basket might place the ball in the basket when asked to mimic the behavior, but it may do so in a different manner seen.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, L. M. (2002). Vocal, social, and self-imitation by bottlenosed dolphins. In K. Dautenhahn &amp; C. Nehaniv (Eds.), Imitation in animals and artifacts (pp. 63–108). Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhesus monkey===
Kinnaman (1902) reported that one [[rhesus monkey]] learned to pull a plug from a box with its teeth to obtain food after watching another monkey succeed at this task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kinnaman | first1 = A. J. | year = 1902 | title = Mental life of two Macacus rhesus monkeys in captivity | url = | journal = The American Journal of Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 173–218 | doi=10.2307/1412738| jstor = 1412738 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredman (2012) also performed an experiment on observational behavior. In experiment 1, human-raised monkeys observed a familiar human model open a foraging box using a tool in one of two alternate ways: levering or poking. In experiment 2, mother-raised monkeys viewed similar techniques demonstrated by monkey models. A control group in each population saw no model. In both experiments, independent coders detected which technique experimental subjects had seen, thus confirming social learning. Further analyses examined copying at three levels of resolution.

The human-raised monkeys exhibited the greatest learning with the specific tool use technique they saw. Only monkeys who saw the levering model used the lever technique, by contrast with controls and those who witnessed poking. Mother-reared monkeys instead typically ignored the tool and exhibited fidelity at a lower level, tending only to re-create whichever result the model had achieved by either levering or poking.

Nevertheless, this level of social learning was associated with significantly greater levels of success in monkeys witnessing a model than in controls, an effect absent in the human-reared population. Results in both populations are consistent with a process of canalization of the repertoire in the direction of the approach witnessed, producing a narrower, socially shaped behavioral profile than among controls who saw no model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredman | first1 = Tamar | last2 = Whiten | first2 = Andrew | year = 2008 | title = Observational Learning from Tool using Models by Human-Reared and Mother-Reared Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus Apella) | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 295–309 | doi=10.1007/s10071-007-0117-0| pmid = 17968602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light box experiment===
Pinkham and Jaswal (2011) did an experiment to see if a child would learn how to turn on a light box by watching a parent. They found that children who saw a parent use their head to turn on the light box tended to do the task in that manner, while children who had not seen the parent used their hands instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinkham | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Jaswal | first2 = V.K. | year = 2011 | title = Watch and learn?

===Swimming skill performance===
When adequate practice and appropriate feedback follow demonstrations, increased skill performance and learning occurs. Lewis (1974) did a study&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Maureen et al. (1998). Observational Learning and the Fearful Child: Influence of Peer Models n Swimming Skill Performance and Psychological Responses. 380–394&lt;/ref&gt; of children who had a fear of swimming and observed how modelling and going over swimming practices affected their overall performance. The experiment spanned nine days, and included many steps. The children were first assessed on their anxiety and swimming skills. Then they were placed into one of three conditional groups and exposed to these conditions over a few days.

At the end of each day, all children participated in a group lesson. The first group was a control group where the children watched a short cartoon video unrelated to swimming. The second group was a peer mastery group, which watched a short video of similar-aged children who had very good task performances and high confidence. Lastly, the third group was a peer coping group, whose subjects watched a video of similar-aged children who progressed from low task performances and low confidence statements to high task performances and high confidence statements.

The day following the exposures to each condition, the children were reassessed. Finally, the children were also assessed a few days later for a follow up assessment. Upon reassessment, it was shown that the two model groups who watched videos of children similar in age had successful rates on the skills assessed because they perceived the models as informational and motivational.

==Neuroscience==
Recent research in neuroscience has implicated [[mirror neuron]]s as a neurophysiological basis for observational learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lago-Rodríguez | first1 = A. | last2 = Cheeran | first2 = B. | last3 = Koch | first3 = G. | last4 = Hortobagy | first4 = T. | last5 = Fernandez-del-Olmo | first5 = M. | year = 2014 | title = The role of mirror neurons in observational motor learning: an integrative review | url = | journal = European Journal of Human Movement | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 82–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specialized visuomotor neurons fire [[action potential]]s when an individual performs a motor task and also fire when an individual passively observes another individual performing the same motor task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Fogassi | first2 = L. | year = 2014 | title = The mirror mechanism: recent findings and perspectives | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 369 | issue = 1644| page = 20130420 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0420 | pmid=24778385 | pmc=4006191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In observational [[motor learning]], the process begins with a visual presentation of another individual performing a motor task, this acts as a model. The learner then needs to transform the observed visual information into internal motor commands that will allow them to perform the motor task, this is known as visuomotor transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeannerod | first1 = M. | last2 = Arbib | first2 = M.

In [[computer aided engineering]] (CAE) a '''preprocessor''' is a [[computer program|program]] which provides a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) to define physical properties. 
This data is used by the subsequent [[computer simulation]].

Steps that are followed in Pre-Processing

1&gt; The geometry (physical bounds) of the problem is defined

2&gt; The volume occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (meshing)

3&gt; The physical modeling is defined - Eg. equations of motion + enthalpy + radiation + species conservation

4&gt; Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behavior and properties at the boundaries of the problem. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.

5&gt; The simulation is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady state or transient

6&gt; Finally a post-processor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resting solution

'''Psychopathology''' is the scientific study of [[mental disorder]]s, including efforts to understand their genetic, [[biological]], [[psychological]], and social [[Causality|causes]]; develop classification schemes ([[nosology]]) which can improve treatment planning and treatment outcomes; understand the course of psychiatric illnesses across all stages of [[developmental psychopathology|development]]; more fully understand the manifestations of mental disorders;{{efn|For example, schizophrenia usually causes [[amotivation]], which, along with other symptoms and functional limitations, contributes to some patients becoming homeless, which in turn renders them more vulnerable to physical and sexual assault and other crimes. Amotivation is a ''symptom'', whereas ''homelessness ''and ''victimization ''are '''manifestations '''(consequences) of the mental illness.}} and investigate potentially effective [[Therapy|treatments]].{{efn|To provide a richer understanding of what is meant by ''psychopathology'', particularly the [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomonelogy]] (internal experience) of those afflicted with a mental disorder, consider the word's [[etymology]]. ''Psychopathology'' is derived from three roots: (1) ''psyche'' (noun), from [[Ancient Greek]] ψυχή (''psukhē'', "soul, breath, mind, life-breath, spirit"). (2) ''pathos'' (noun), from Ancient Greek πάθος, which is from πάσχω (''paskhō'', "I feel, suffer"), and in this context means a condition or state in which the individual experiences pain, loss, anguish, hurt, and woe. (3) ''-ology'' (suffix), from Ancient Greek -λογία ''-logia'', ''the study of'' (see [[pathology]]).

Thus, ''psychopathology'' is the scientific study of [[abnormal psychology]], i.e., abnormal perceptions, thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and behavior that lead to distress, pain and misery, even to the point that an afflicted person feels as if their very "life-breath" (soul) is being damaged or sucked out.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/153923|title=Oxford English Dictionary|last=|first=|work=OED Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=|edition=3rd|location=Oxford, England, UK|pages=|quote='''psychopathology''', ''n.'' - 1. The study of pathological mental and behavioural processes ...; 2.  Abnormal psychology; an abnormal psychological process or state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least conceptually,{{efn|The prepositional phrase, "At least conceptually" refers to the fact that the two disciplines--pathology and psychopathology--have largely developed independent of each other.}} psychopathology is a subset of [[pathology]], which is the "... scientific study of the nature of disease and its causes, processes, development, and consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/pathology|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|last=|first=|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=|edition=6th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early explanations for mental illnesses were influenced by religious belief and [[superstition]]. Psychological conditions that are now classified as mental disorders were initially attributed to possessions by evil spirits, demons, and the devil. This idea was widely accepted up until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Individuals who suffered from these so-called "possessions" were tortured as treatment.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Doctors used this technique in hoping to bring their patients back to sanity. Those who failed to return to sanity after torture were executed.&lt;ref name="AllPsych"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heffner|first1=Christopher | name-list-format = vanc |title=Chapter 9: Section 1: Psychopathology|url=http://allpsych.com/psychology101/psychopathology/#.VOUVvvnF-VJ|website=AllPsych.com|publisher=AllPsych|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}

The Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] was one of the first to reject the idea that mental disorders were caused by possession of demons or the devil. He firmly believed the symptoms of mental disorders were due to diseases originating in the brain. Hippocrates suspected that these states of insanity were due to imbalances of fluids in the body. He identified these fluids to be four in particular: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamshar|first1=Mercedes | name-list-format = vanc |title=The History of Psychopathology|url=https://suite.io/mercedes-hamshar/43nd21f|website=Suite|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, not far from Hippocrates, the philosopher [[Plato]] would come to argue the mind, body, and spirit worked as a unit. Any imbalance brought to these compositions of the individual could bring distress or lack of harmony within the individual. This philosophical idea would remain in perspective{{vague|date=May 2016}} until the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="AllPsych"/&gt;

In the eighteenth century's Romantic Movement, the idea that healthy parent-child relationships provided sanity became a prominent idea. Philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] introduced the notion that trauma in childhood could have negative implications later in adulthood.&lt;ref name="AllPsych"/&gt;

In the nineteenth century, greatly influenced by Rousseau's ideas and philosophy, Austrian psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] would bring about psychotherapy and become the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Talking therapy would originate from his ideas on the individual's experiences and the natural human efforts to make sense of the world and life.&lt;ref name="AllPsych"/&gt;

The scientific discipline of psychopathology was founded by [[Karl Jaspers]] in 1913. It was referred to as "static understanding" and its purpose was to graphically recreate the "mental phenomenon" experienced by the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marlet JJ | title = Development of cranial hyperostosis. A radiological approach to a process | journal = Radiologia Clinica Et Biologica | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 473–82 | date = 2015 | pmc = 4421897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of psychopathology is interdisciplinary, with contributions coming from clinical, social, and developmental psychology, as well as neuropsychology and other psychology subdisciplines; psychiatry; neuroscience generally; criminology; social work; sociology; epidemiology; statistics; and more.&lt;ref name="A TEXT BOOK OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shah|first1=Syed Ahmad |last2=Mushtaq|first2=Shahnawaz |last3=Naseer|first3=Miss Naureen |last4=Ahmad|first4=Aijaz |last5=Sharma|first5=Gargi|last6=Kovur|first6=Harpreet | name-list-format = vanc | title = A text book of psycholopathology |date=2017|publisher=RED'SHINE Publication.

How do scientists (and people in general) distinguish between ''unusual or odd behavior'' on one hand, and a ''mental disorder'' on the other?  One strategy is to assess a person along four dimensions: ''deviance, distress, dysfunction. and danger'', known collectively as the Four D's.

===The four Ds===
A description of the four Ds when defining abnormality:

#'''[[Deviance (sociology)|Deviance]]''': this term describes the idea that specific thoughts, behaviours and emotions are considered deviant when they are unacceptable or not common in society. Clinicians must, however, remember that minority groups are not always deemed deviant just because they may not have anything in common with other groups. Therefore, we define an individual's actions as deviant or abnormal when their behaviour is deemed unacceptable by the culture they belong to. However, many disorders have a relation between patterns of deviance and therefore need to be evaluated in a differential diagnostic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Davis T | title=Conceptualizing Psychiatric Disorders Using "Four D’s" of Diagnoses|journal=The Internet Journal of Psychiatry|date=2009|volume=1|issue=1|page=1|url=https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/5049|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Distress (medicine)|Distress]]''': this term accounts for negative feelings by the individual with the disorder. They may feel deeply troubled and affected by their illness. Behaviors and feelings that cause distress to the individual or to others around him or her are considered abnormal, if the condition is upsetting to the person experiencing it. Distress is related to dysfunction by being a useful asset in accurately perceiving dysfunction in an individual’s life. These two are not always related because an individual can be highly dysfunctional and at the same time experiencing minimal stress. One should know the important characteristic of distress is not involved with dysfunction, but rather the limit to which an individual is stressed by an issue.&lt;ref name="print.ispub.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=T|title=Conceptualizing Psychiatric Disorders Using "Four D’s" of Diagnoses|journal=The Internet Journal of Psychiatry|date=2009|volume=1|issue=1|page=2|url=https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/5049|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Abnormality (behavior)|Dysfunction]]''': this term involves maladaptive behaviour that impairs the individual's ability to perform normal daily functions, such as getting ready for work in the morning, or driving a car. This maladaptive behaviour has to be a problem large enough to be considered a diagnosis. It's highly noted to look for dysfunction across an individual's life experience because there is a chance the dysfunction may appear in clear observable view and in places where it is less likely to appear.&lt;ref name="print.ispub.com" /&gt; Such maladaptive behaviours prevent the individual from living a normal, healthy lifestyle. However, dysfunctional behaviour is not always caused by a disorder; it may be voluntary, such as engaging in a hunger strike.
#'''[[Violence|Danger]]''': this term involves dangerous or violent behaviour directed at the individual, or others in the environment. The two important characteristics of danger is, danger to self and danger to others. When diagnosing, there is a large vulnerability of danger in which there is some danger in each diagnosis and within these diagnoses there is a continuum of severity.&lt;ref name="print.ispub.com" /&gt; An example of dangerous behaviour that may suggest a psychological disorder is engaging in suicidal activity. Behaviors and feelings that are potentially harmful to an individual or the individuals around them are seen as abnormal.

===The p factor===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Instead of conceptualizing psychopathology as consisting of several discrete categories of mental disorders, groups of psychological and psychiatric scientists have proposed a "general psychopathology" construct, named the p-factor, because of its conceptual similarity with the [[Cognitive Abilities Test|g factor of general intelligence]]. Although researchers initially conceived a tripartite (three factor) explanation for psychopathology generally, subsequent study provided more evidence for a unitary, factor that is sequentially comorbid, recurrent/chronic, and exists on a continuum of severity and chronicity. Thus, the p factor is a dimensional, as opposed to a categorical, construct.&lt;ref name="Caspi2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caspi A, Houts RM, Belsky DW, Goldman-Mellor SJ, Harrington H, Israel S, Meier MH, Ramrakha S, Shalev I, Poulton R, Moffitt TE | display-authors = 6 | title = The p Factor: One General Psychopathology Factor in the Structure of Psychiatric Disorders? | journal = Clinical Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–137 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 25360393 | pmc = 4209412 | doi = 10.1177/2167702613497473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher scores on the p factor dimension have been found to be correlated with higher levels of functional impairment, greater incidence of problems in developmental history, and more diminished early-life brain function. In addition, those with higher levels of the p factor are more likely to have inherited a [[genetic predisposition]] to mental illness. The existence of the p factor may explain why it has been "... challenging to find causes, consequences, biomarkers, and treatments with specificity to individual mental disorders."&lt;ref name=Caspi2014 /&gt;

The p factor has been likened to the [[Cognitive Abilities Test|g factor of general intelligence]], which is also a dimensional system by which overall cognitive ability can be defined. As psychopathology has typically been studied and implemented as a categorical system, like the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] system developed for clinicians, the dimensional system of the p factor provides an alternative conceptualization of mental disorders that might improve our understanding of psychopathology in general; lead to more precise diagnoses; and facilitate more effective treatment approaches.
 
[[Benjamin Lahey]] and colleagues first proposed a general psychopathology factor in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lahey BB, Applegate B, Hakes JK, Zald DH, Hariri AR, Rathouz PJ | title = Is there a general factor of prevalent psychopathology during adulthood? | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 971–7 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22845652 | pmc = 4134439 | doi = 10.1037/a0028355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As mental symptoms==
The term ''psychopathology'' may also be used to denote behaviors or experiences which are indicative of mental illness, even if they do not constitute a formal diagnosis. For example, the presence of a [[hallucination]] may be considered as a psychopathological sign, even if there are not enough symptoms present to fulfill the criteria for one of the disorders listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]].

In a more general sense, any behaviour or experience which causes impairment, distress or [[disability]], particularly if it is thought to arise from a functional breakdown in either the [[cognitive]] or [[neurocognitive]] systems in the brain, may be classified as psychopathology. It remains unclear how strong the distinction between maladaptive traits and mental disorders actually is,&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Ormel J | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2883–2906 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27523506 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291716001653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ormel2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Ormel J, Laceulle OM, Jeronimus BF |year=2014|title= Why Personality and Psychopathology Are Correlated: A Developmental Perspective Is a First Step but More Is Needed|journal= European Journal of Personality|volume=28|issue=4|pages=396–98|doi=10.1002/per.1971|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.1971/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''e.g.'' [[neuroticism]] is often described as the personal level of minor psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref name="Ormel2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ormel J, Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Bos EH, Hankin B, Rosmalen JG, Oldehinkel AJ | title = Neuroticism and common mental disorders: meaning and utility of a complex relationship | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 686–697 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23702592 | pmc = 4382368 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2013.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''==
{{Main|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders}}
The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) is an guideline for the diagnosis and understanding of mental disorders. It serves as reference for a range of professionals in medicine and mental health in the United States particularly. These professionals include psychologists, counselors, physicians, social workers, psychiatric nurses and nurse practitioners, marriage and family therapists, and more.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|title=DSM|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/dsm|website=American Psychiatric Association|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mental disorders classified within the DSM include:
* '''[[Major depressive disorder]]''' is a [[mood disorder]] defined by symptoms of loss of motivation, decreased mood, lack of energy and thoughts of suicide.
* '''[[Bipolar disorder]]s''' are mood disorders characterized by depressive and manic episodes of varying lengths and degrees.
* '''[[Dysthymia]]''' is a mood disorder similar to depression. Characterized by a persistent low mood, dysthymia is a less debilitating form of depression with no break in ordinary functioning.
* '''[[Schizophrenia]]''' is characterized by altered perception of reality, including delusional thoughts, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behaviour. Most cases arise in patients in their late teens or early adulthood, but can also appear later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Schizophrenia|url=http://www.helpguide.org/articles/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-signs-types-and-causes.htm|website=Helpguide.org|publisher=HelpGuide.org|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Borderline personality disorder]]''' occurs in early adulthood for most patients; specific symptoms include patterns of unstable and intense relationships, chronic feelings of emptiness, emotional instability, paranoid thoughts, intense episodes of anger, and suicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/borderline-personality-disorder-symptoms/|website=PsychCentral|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bulimia nervosa]]''' "binge and purge", an eating disorder specified as reoccurring episodes of uncontrollable binge eating followed by a need to vomit, take laxatives, or exercise excessively. Usually begins occurring at adolescence but most individuals do not seek help until later in life when it can be harder to change their eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulimia Nervosa Symptoms|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/bulimia-bulimia-nervosa-symptoms/|website=PsychCentral|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Phobias]]''' Found in people of all ages. Characterized by an abnormal response to fear or danger. Persons diagnosed with Phobias suffer from feelings of terror and  uncontrollable fear, exaggerated reactions to danger that in reality is not life-threatening, and is usually accompanied by physical reactions related to extreme fear: panic, rapid heartbeat, and/or shortened breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phobias|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/phobias|website=American Psychiatric Association|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pyromania]]''' this disorder is indicated by fascination, curiosity, or attraction to purposely setting things on fire. Pyromaniacs find pleasure and/or relief by watching things burn. Can occur due to delusional thinking, impaired judgement due to other mental disorders, or simply as aggressive behavior to express anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pyromania Symptoms|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/pyromania-symptoms/|website=PsychCentral.com|publisher=PsychCentral|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM/RDoc debate==

Some scholars have argued that field should switch from the DSM categorical approach of mental disorders to the [[Research Domain Criteria]] (RDoC) dimensional approach of mental disorders, although the consensus at present is to retain DSM for treatment, insurance, and related purposes, while emphasizing RDoC conceptualizations for planning and funding psychiatric research.&lt;ref name="pmid24135697"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casey BJ, Craddock N, Cuthbert BN, Hyman SE, Lee FS, Ressler KJ | title = DSM-5 and RDoC: progress in psychiatry research? | journal = Nature Reviews.

'''Radical evil''' ({{lang-de|das radikal Böse}}) is a phrase used by German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone]]'' (1793), one representing the Christian term, radix malorum.

There Kant writes:

{{quote|The depravity of human nature, then, is not so much to be called badness, if this word is taken in its strict sense, namely, as a disposition (subjective principle of maxims) to adopt the bad, as bad, into one’s maxims as a spring (for that is devilish); but rather perversity of heart, which, on account of the result, is also called a bad heart. This may co-exist with a Will [“Wille”] good in general, and arises from the frailty of human nature, which is not strong enough to follow its adopted principles, combined with its impurity in not distinguishing the springs (even of well-intentioned actions) from one another by moral rule. So that ultimately it looks at best only to the conformity of its actions with the law, not to their derivation from it, that is, to the law itself as the only spring. Now although this does not always give rise to wrong actions and a propensity thereto, that is, to vice, yet the habit of regarding the absence of vice as a conformity of the mind to the law of duty (as virtue) must itself be designated a radical perversity of the human heart (since in this case the spring in the maxims is not regarded at all, but only the obedience to the letter of the law).

The '''SUNY-ESF Ranger School''' (formerly the '''New York State Ranger School'''), on the east branch of the [[Oswegatchie River]] near [[Wanakena, New York]], offers [[Associate degree#United States|A.A.S.]] degrees in forest and natural resources management. Established in 1912, the school is affiliated with the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry]] (SUNY-ESF). The Ranger School commemorated its centennial in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=1854 "Ranger School Celebrates Its 100th," SUNY-ESF, August 6, 2012.] Accessed: August 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The Ranger School is situated in the northwestern part of the [[Adirondack Park]], on the east branch of the scenic Oswegatchie River, which flows into [[Cranberry Lake]]. The campus is about {{convert|65|mi|km}} from [[Watertown, New York]] and {{convert|35|mi|km}} from [[Tupper Lake (village), New York|Tupper Lake]].

==History==
The New York State Ranger School was founded in 1912, under the administration of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University]], to train [[forest ranger]]s and other personnel for the still-young Adirondack Park.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Eugene S. Whitmore, the Ranger School's first graduate, completed his studies the same year that school was founded, in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;SUNY-ESF. 2008. ''Alumni Directory. 100th Anniversary Edition''. Syracuse, NY, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3000 students have completed their degrees at the Ranger School since it opened.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Ranger School celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2012-13.&lt;ref name=wdt&gt;[http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120512/NEWS05/705129917 Ellen, Martha. 2012.

* In 1923, Governor [[Al Smith|Alfred E. Smith]], later to become President of the Board of Trustees of the New York State College of Forestry, signed an appropriation bill for the construction of the Ranger School's new building; the structure was dedicated in 1928. 
* The [[International Paper Company]] added to the school's properties with a gift of {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, in 1929.&lt;ref name=rez /&gt;

==Today==
Today, the Ranger School is a unit of the SUNY-ESF. Michael Bridgen, Professor of Forest and Natural Resources Management, is director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/rangerschool/directory/ "Ranger School Directory,"] SUNY-ESF Ranger School. Accessed: July 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After "spending a year at a college of their choice,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; students spend an academic year or summer at the residential school, studying [[forestry|forest technology]], [[surveying]], or environmental and [[natural resource management|natural resources conservation]], earning an [[Associate of Applied Science]] (A.A.S.) degree upon completion. Students can continue their studies at the main ESF campus, in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], to earn a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

In addition to classrooms, offices, dormitory and kitchen facilities, the school's properties also include the {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}}, [[James F. Dubuar Memorial Forest]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/rangerschool/ SUNY-ESF: SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry - The Ranger School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Materials, at the University of Manchester''' is a school of [[Materials science|Materials Science]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. The school is one of the largest departments in Europe that has a material science focus.{{fact|date=August 2016}} This is reflected by an annual research income of around £7m,{{fact|date=August 2016}} 60 academic staff, and a population of 150 research students and 60 [[postdoctoral research]] staff. 

==Teaching==
The School offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in all aspects of materials including materials engineering, biomaterials, corrosion protection, technical textiles, fashion and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419043134/http://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk/|archivedate=2016-04-19|url=http://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk|website=materials.manchester.ac.uk|publisher=University of Manchester|location=Manchester|title=School of Materials, University of Manchester|author=Anon|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In the 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] both the Material Science and Corrosion and Protection centre gained the highest rating, 5*. The School of Materials has also been ranked first for research power in the UK.

The school is unusual in that the Materials Science departments at [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST)]] and the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] were already joint before the merger of those two institutions in 2004.  The School also incorporates the Textiles, Paper Science and Corrosion &amp; Protection departments which were formerly part of UMIST.

==Senior staff==
{{As of|2016}} the head of school is Professor William Sampson.&lt;ref name=sampson&gt;{{cite web|first=Williams|last=Sampson|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012000055/http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/william.sampson/|title=Professor William Sampson (BSc (Hons), PhD, FIMMM)|publisher=University of Manchester|location=Manchester|website=manchester.ac.uk|archivedate=2015-10-12|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/william.sampson/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 to 2015 the head of School was Professor [[Paul O'Brien (chemist)|Paul O'Brien]] FRS.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;{{Who's Who | surname = O’BRIEN |othernames = Prof. Paul | id = U59835 | volume = 2013 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other senior academic staff include [[Philip J. Withers]] FRS, the [[Regius Professor]] of Materials.

==Buildings==
The Manchester Materials Science centre was one of the main buildings of the school until its demolition in 2016. {{As of|2016}} the centre will be replaced with the Manchester Engineering Campus Development (MECD).

'''Science [[education]]''' is the field concerned with sharing science content and [[Process (science)|process]] with individuals not traditionally considered part of the scientific community. The learners may be children, college students, or adults within the general public; the field of science education includes work in science content, science process (the [[scientific method]]), some [[social science]], and some teaching [[pedagogy]]. The standards for science education provide expectations for the development of understanding for students through the entire course of their [[K–12 (education)|K-12 education]] and beyond. The traditional subjects included in the standards are [[Physical science|physical]], [[Life science|life]], [[Earth science|earth]], [[space science|space]], and [[human science]]s.

==Historical background==
The first person credited with being employed as a Science teacher in a British [[public school (privately funded)|public school]] was [[William Sharp (homeopath)|William Sharp]] who left the job at [[Rugby School]] in 1850 after establishing Science to the curriculum. Sharp is said to have established a model for Science to be taught throughout the British Public Schools.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Bernard Leary, ‘Sharp, William (1805–1896)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25223, Retrieved 22 May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step came when the British Academy for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) published a report in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Layton, D. |chapter=The schooling of science in England, 1854–1939 |editor1-first=R.M. |editor1-last=MacLeod |editor2-first=P.D.B. |editor2-last=Collins |title=The parliament of science |publisher=Science Reviews |location=Northwood, England |year=1981 |isbn=0905927664 |pages=188–210 |oclc=8172024}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAAS promoted teaching of "pure science" and training of the "scientific habit of mind." The progressive education movement of the time supported the ideology of mental training through the sciences. BAAS emphasized separately pre-professional training in secondary science education. In this way, future BAAS members could be prepared.

The initial development of science teaching was slowed by the lack of qualified teachers. One key development was the founding of the first London School Board in 1870, which discussed the school curriculum; another was the initiation of courses to supply the country with trained science teachers. In both cases the influence of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was critical (see especially [[Thomas Henry Huxley#Educational influence|Thomas Henry Huxley educational influence]]). [[John Tyndall]] was also influential in the teaching of physical science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bibby, Cyril |title=T.H. Huxley: scientist, humanist and educator |publisher=Watts |location=London |year=1959 |oclc=747400567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, science education was a scatter of subjects prior to its standardization in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Del Giorno, B.J. |title=The impact of changing scientific knowledge on science education in the United States since 1850 |journal=Science Education |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=191–5 |date=April 1969 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730530304 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730530304/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a science curriculum in the US emerged gradually after extended debate between two ideologies, citizen science and pre-professional training. As a result of a conference of 30 leading secondary and college educators in Florida, the National Education Association appointed a Committee of Ten in 1892 which had authority to organize future meetings and appoint subject matter committees of the major subjects taught in U.S. secondary schools. The committee was composed of ten educators (all men) and was chaired by Charles Eliot of Harvard University. The Committee of Ten met, and appointed nine conferences committees (Latin, Greek, English, Other Modern Languages, Mathematics, History, Civil Government and Political Economy, and three in science). The three conference committees appointed for science were: physics, astronomy, and chemistry (1); natural history (2); and geography (3). Each committee, appointed by the Committee of Ten, was composed of ten leading specialists from colleges and normal schools, and secondary schools.  Each committee met in a different location in the U.S. The three science committees met for three days in the Chicago area. Committee reports were submitted to the Committee of Ten, which met for four days in New York, to create a comprehensive report.&lt;ref name="nea"&gt;National Education Association (1894). Report of the Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies With The Reports of the Conferences Arranged by The Committee. New York: The American Book Company [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=1WYWAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=report+of+the+committee+of+ten+on+secondary+school+studies&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UtOEeTn35f&amp;sig=iJfll5ftJ4TPNu3uHl_cB12-Jv8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPR1,M1 Read the Book Online]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, the NEA published the results of work of these conference committees.&lt;ref name="nea"/&gt;

According to the Committee of Ten, the goal of high school was to prepare all students to do well in life, contributing to their well-being and the good of society. Another goal was to prepare some students to succeed in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weidner, L |title=The N.E.A. Committee of Ten  |url=http://www3.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/neacom10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This committee supported the citizen science approach focused on mental training and withheld performance in science studies from consideration for college entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurd, P.D. |title=Closing the educational gaps between science, technology, and society |journal=Theory into Practice |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=251–9 |year=1991 |doi=10.1080/00405849109543509 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00405849109543509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAAS encouraged their longer standing model in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jenkins, E. |chapter=History of science education |editor1-first=T. |editor1-last=Husén |editor2-first=T.N. |editor2-last=Postlethwaite |title=International encyclopedia of education |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=Oxford |year=1985 |isbn=0080281192 |pages=4453–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US adopted a curriculum was characterized as follows:&lt;ref name="nea"/&gt;

* Elementary science should focus on simple natural phenomena (nature study) by means of experiments carried out "in-the-field."
* Secondary science should focus on laboratory work and the committee's prepared lists of specific experiments
* Teaching of facts and principles
* College preparation

The format of shared mental training and pre-professional training consistently dominated the curriculum from its inception to now. However, the movement to incorporate a humanistic approach, such as inclusion of the arts [[STEAM_fields|(S.T.E.A.M.)]], [[science, technology, society and environment education]] is growing and being implemented more broadly in the late 20th century (Aikenhead, 1994).  Reports by the American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), including Project 2061, and by the National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment detail goals for science education that link classroom science to practical applications and societal implications.

== Fields of Science Education ==
{{See also|Branches of science}}Science is a universal subject that spans the branch of knowledge that examines the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/science|title=science {{!}} Definition of science in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science education is most commonly broken down into the following three fields: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.

=== Physics Education ===
[[File:Free body diagram.png|thumb|Demonstrates a free body]]
{{See also|Physics education}}Physics education is characterized by the study of science that deals with matter and energy, and their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/physics|title=Definition of PHYSICS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physics First]], a program endorsed by the American Association of [[Physics]] Teachers, is a curriculum in which 9th grade students take an introductory physics course. The purpose is to enrich students' understanding of physics, and allow for more detail to be taught in subsequent high school biology and chemistry classes. It also aims to increase the number of students who go on to take 12th grade physics or AP Physics, which are generally elective courses in American high schools.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;

Physics education in high schools in the United States has suffered the last twenty years because many states now only require three sciences, which can be satisfied by earth/physical science, chemistry, and biology. The fact that many students do not take physics in high school makes it more difficult for those students to take scientific courses in college.

At the university/college level, using [[appropriate technology]]-related projects to spark non-physics majors’ interest in learning physics has been shown to be successful.&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt; This is a potential opportunity to forge the connection between physics and social benefit.

=== Chemistry Education ===
{{See also|Chemistry education}}Chemistry education is characterized by the study of science that deals with the composition, structure, and properties of substances and the transformations that they undergo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chemistry|title=Definition of CHEMISTRY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Festival of Science in Samara.jpg|thumb|Children mix different chemicals in test tubes as part of a science education program.]]

Chemistry is the study of chemicals and the elements and their effects and attributes. Students in chemistry learn [[The periodic table of the elements|the periodic table.]] The branch of science education known as "chemistry must be taught in a relevant context in order to promote full understanding of current sustainability issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jegstad|first=Kirsti Marie|last2=Sinnes|first2=Astrid Tonette|date=2015-03-04|title=Chemistry Teaching for the Future: A model for secondary chemistry education for sustainable development|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2014.1003988|journal=International Journal of Science Education|volume=37|issue=4|pages=655–683|doi=10.1080/09500693.2014.1003988|issn=0950-0693}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this source states chemistry is a very important subject in school as it teaches students to understand issues in the world. As children are interested by the world around them [[chemistry]] teachers can attract interest in turn educating the students further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azmat|first=R.|title=Manufacturing of High Quality Teachers for Chemistry Education at Higher Secondary Level in Current Era|url=http://chempublishers.com/Journals/pjchm/vol_3/I_3/3_3_Paper_8.pdf|journal=Pakistan Journal of Chemistry|volume=3|issue=3|pages=140–141|doi=10.15228/2013.v03.i03.p08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of chemistry is a very practical based subject meaning most of class time is spent working or completing experiments.

=== Biology Education ===
Biology education is characterized by the study of structure, function, heredity, and evolution of all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/advising/career-and-major-exploration/major-to-career/biology-education|title=Major to Career: Biology Education|website=www.byui.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biology itself is the study of living organisms, through different fields including morphology, physiology, anatomy, behavior, origin, and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/biology|title=the definition of biology|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Depending on the country and education level, there are many approaches to teaching biology. In the United States, there is a growing emphasis on the ability to investigate and analyze biology related questions over an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csun.edu/science/ref/curriculum/reforms/nses/|title=National Science Education Standards|website=www.csun.edu|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
While the public image of science education may be one of simply learning facts [[by rote]], science education in recent history also generally concentrates on the teaching of science [[concept]]s and addressing [[Scientific misconceptions|misconception]]s that learners may hold regarding science concepts or other content. Science education has been strongly influenced by constructivist thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith S. |last=Taber |title=Progressing Science Education: Constructing the Scientific Research Programme Into the Contingent Nature of Learning Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96tslSL3UfwC |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constructivism in science education]] has been informed by an extensive research programme into student thinking and learning in science, and in particular exploring how teachers can facilitate conceptual change towards canonical scientific thinking. Constructivism emphasises the active role of the learner, and the significance of current knowledge and understanding in mediating learning, and the importance of teaching that provides an optimal level of guidance to learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taber, K.S. |chapter=Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction |chapterurl=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html |editor=J. Hassaskhah |title=Educational Theory |publisher=Nova |year=2011 |isbn=9781613245804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The guided-discovery approach to science education ===
Along with [[John Dewey]], [[Jerome Bruner]], and many [[Discovery learning|others,]] [[Arthur Koestler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Act of Creation|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1964|isbn=|location=London|pages=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a critique of contemporary science education and proposes its replacement with the guided-discovery approach: &lt;blockquote&gt;To derive pleasure from the art of discovery, as from the other arts, the consumer—in this case the student—must be made to re-live, to some extent, the creative process. In other words, he must be induced, with proper aid and guidance, to make some of the fundamental discoveries of science by himself, to experience in his own mind some of those flashes of insight which have lightened its path. . . . The traditional method of confronting the student not with the problem but with the finished solution, means depriving him of all excitement, [shutting] off the creative impulse, [reducing] the adventure of mankind to a dusty heap of theorems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Specific hands-on illustrations of this approach are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/teaching_methods/guided_discovery/examples.html|title=Guided discovery problems: Examples (in: Teaching Methods: A Collection of Pedagogic Techniques and Example Activities)|last=Carleton University|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/SCIEX.htm|title=Science exercises and instructional materials: Teaching science as if minds mattered!|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The practice of science education has been increasingly informed by research into science teaching and learning.  Research in science education relies on a wide variety of methodologies, borrowed from many branches of science and engineering such as computer science, cognitive science, cognitive psychology and anthropology. Science education research aims to define or characterize what constitutes learning in science and how it is brought about.

[[John D. Bransford]], et al., summarized massive research into student thinking as having three key findings:

; Preconceptions : Prior ideas about how things work are remarkably tenacious and an educator must explicitly address a students' specific misconceptions if the student is to reconfigure his misconception in favour of another explanation. Therefore, it is essential that educators know how to learn about student preconceptions and make this a regular part of their planning.
; Knowledge Organization: In order to become truly literate in an area of science, students must, "(a) have a deep foundation of factual knowledge, (b) understand facts and ideas in the context of a conceptual framework, and (c) organize knowledge in ways that facilitate retrieval and application."[http://www.nap.edu/html/howpeople1/]
; Metacognition : Students will benefit from thinking about their thinking and their learning. They must be taught ways of evaluating their knowledge and what they don't know, evaluating their methods of thinking, and evaluating their conclusions. Some educators and others have practiced and advocated for discussions of [[pseudoscience]] as a way to understand what it is to think scientifically and to address the problems introduced by pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duncan |first1=Douglas |title=Teaching the Nature of Science using Pseudoscience |url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~dduncan/pseudoscience/ |website=Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy |publisher=University of Colorado Boulder |accessdate=18 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618183715/http://casa.colorado.edu/~dduncan/pseudoscience/ |archivedate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borgo |first1=Alejandro |title=Why Pseudscience Should Be Taught in College |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=9-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational technologies are being refined to meet the specific needs of science teachers.  One research study examining how cellphones are being used in post-secondary science teaching settings showed that mobile technologies can increase student engagement and motivation in the science classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tremblay|first=Eric|year=2010|title=Educating the Mobile Generation – using personal cell phones as audience response systems in post-secondary science teaching|url=http://editlib.org/p/32314|journal=Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching|volume=29|issue=2|pages=217–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a bibliography on [[Social constructivism|constructivist]]-oriented research on teaching and learning science in 2005, about 64 percent of studies documented are carried out in the domain of physics, 21 percent in the domain of biology, and 15 percent in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/|title=Bibliography—STCSE (Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education)|year=2006|publisher=Kiel:IPN—Leibniz Institute for Science Education|author=Duit, R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The major reason for this dominance of physics in the research on teaching and learning appears to be that understanding physics includes difficulties due to the particular nature of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Science Education|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8058-4713-0|page=599|chapter=Teaching Physics|author=Duit, R.; Niedderer, H.; Schecker, H.|editor1-first=Sandra K.|editor1-last=Abell|editor2-first=Norman G.|editor2-last=Lederman|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd31m3_RU3oC&amp;pg=PA599}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research on students' conceptions has shown that most pre-instructional (everyday) ideas that students bring to physics instruction are in stark contrast to the physics concepts and principles to be achieved – from kindergarten to the tertiary level.  Quite often students' ideas are incompatible with physics views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Science Teaching and Learning|publisher=Macmillan|year=1994|isbn=0028970055|location=New York|chapter=Research on alternative conceptions in science|author1=Wandersee, J.H.|author2=Mintzes, J.J.|author3=Novak, J.D.|editor=Gabel, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also holds true for students’ more general patterns of thinking and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1984|title=Students' patterns of thinking and reasoning|journal=Physics Teacher|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–26|doi=10.1119/1.2341444|author=Arons, A.}} pp. 89–93 {{DOI|10.1119/1.2341474}}; 576–581.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science education in different countries ==

=== Australia ===
As in England and Wales, science education in Australia is compulsory up until year 11, where students can choose to study one or more of the branches mentioned above. If they wish to no longer study science, they can choose none of the branches. The science stream is one course up until year 11, meaning students learn in all of the branches giving them a broad idea of what science is all about. [[Australian Curriculum|The National Curriculum Board of Australia]] (2009) stated that "The science curriculum will be organised around three interrelated strands: science understanding; science inquiry skills; and science as a human endeavour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acara.edu.au/verve/_resources/australian_curriculum_-_science.pdf|title=Shape of the Australian Curriculum: Science|last=National Curriculum Board|first=|date=2009|website=|publisher=ACARA|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528111727/http://www.acara.edu.au/verve/_resources/australian_curriculum_-_science.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strands give teachers and educators the framework of how they should be instructing their students.

A major problem that has befallen science education in Australia over the last decade is a falling interest in science. Fewer year 10 students are choosing to study science for year 11, which is problematic as these are the years where students form attitudes to pursue science careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Ghali|date=2011|title=Students' views of science: A comparison between tertiary and secondary school students|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Students%27+Views+of+Science%3A+A+Comparison+between+Tertiary+and+Secondary+School+Students&amp;rft.jtitle=Science+Educator&amp;rft.au=Ghali+Hassan&amp;rft.date=2011-10-01&amp;rft.pub=National+Science+Education+Leadership+Association&amp;rft.issn=1094-3277&amp;rft.volume=20&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=54&amp;rft.externalDocID=2674689111&amp;paramdict=en-AU|journal=Science Educator|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is not unique in Australia, but is happening in countries all over the world.

=== China ===
Educational quality in China suffers because a typical classroom contains 50 to 70 students. With over 200 million students, China has the largest educational system in the world.  However, only 20% percent of students complete the rigorous ten-year program of formal schooling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As in many other countries, the science curriculum includes sequenced courses in physics, chemistry, and biology.  Science education is given high priority and is driven by textbooks composed by committees of scientists and teachers.  Science education in China places great emphasis on memorization, and gives far less attention to problem solving, application of principles to novel situations, interpretations, and predictions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artofteachingscience.org/countries/china.html|title=Science Curriculum- A Global Perspective: China|last=Price|first=Ronald F.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Science education in England}}

In English and Welsh schools, science is a compulsory subject in the National Curriculum. All pupils from 5 to 16 years of age must study science. It is generally taught as a single subject science until sixth form, then splits into subject-specific [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]]). However, the government has since expressed its desire that those pupils who achieve well at the age of 14 should be offered the opportunity to study the three separate sciences from September 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7245529.stm|title='Poor lacking' choice of sciences|date=15 February 2008|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 February 2008|author=Kim Catcheside|work=BBC News website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland the subjects split into chemistry, physics and biology at the age of 13–15 for [[Education in Scotland|National 4/5s]] in these subjects, and there is also a combined science standard grade qualification which students can sit, provided their school offers it.

In September 2006 a new science program of study known as 21st Century Science was introduced as a [[GCSE]] option in UK schools, designed to "give all 14 to 16 year old's a worthwhile and inspiring experience of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyscience.org/ |title=Welcome to Twenty First Century Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=15 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101055026/http://www.21stcenturyscience.org/ |archive-date=1 January 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, Ofsted's survey of science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/maintaining-curiosity-survey-science-education-schools|title=Maintaining curiosity: a survey into science education in schools|date=21 November 2013|publisher=Ofsted|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in schools revealed that practical science teaching was not considered important enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/we-cannot-afford-to-get-science-education-wrong-20667|title=We cannot afford to get science education wrong|last=Holman|first=John|date=22 November 2013|publisher=The Conversation|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the majority of English schools, students have the opportunity to study a separate science program as part of their GCSEs, which results in them taking 6 papers at the end of Year 11; this usually fills one of their option 'blocks' and requires more science lessons than those who choose not to partake in separate science or are not invited. Other students who choose not to follow the compulsory additional science course, which results in them taking 4 papers resulting in 2 GCSEs, opposed to the 3 GCSEs given by taking separate science.

===United States===
In many U.S. states, [[K-12]] educators must adhere to rigid standards or [[Conceptual framework|frameworks]] of what content is to be taught to which age groups. This often leads teachers to rush to "cover" the material, without truly "teaching" it. In addition, the ''process'' of science, including such elements as the [[scientific method]] and [[critical thinking]], is often overlooked. This emphasis can produce students who pass [[Standardized test#United States|standardized tests]] without having developed complex problem solving skills. Although at the college level American science education tends to be less regulated, it is actually more rigorous, with teachers and professors fitting more content into the same time period.&lt;ref name="Glavin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k12academics.com/education-subjects/science-education/united-states#.VzpsDk-qqko|title=United States {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] of the [[U.S. National Academies]] produced the [[National Science Education Standards]], which is available online for free in multiple forms. Its focus on [[inquiry-based science]], based on the theory of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] rather than on [[direct instruction]] of facts and methods, remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Glavin" /&gt; Some research suggests that it is more effective as a model for teaching science. &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Standards call for more than 'science as process,' in which students learn such skills as observing, inferring, and experimenting. Inquiry is central to science learning. When engaging in inquiry, students describe objects and events, ask questions, construct explanations, test those explanations against current scientific knowledge, and communicate their ideas to others. They identify their assumptions, use critical and logical thinking, and consider alternative explanations. In this way, students actively develop their understanding of science by combining scientific knowledge with reasoning and thinking skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Research Council|first=National Academy of Sciences|title=National Science Education Standards|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4962&amp;page=2|work=Science Teaching Standards|publisher=National Academy Press|date=December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concern about science education and science standards has often been driven by worries that American students lag behind their peers in [[international rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mullis, I.V.S. |author2=Martin, M.O. |author3=Gonzalez, E.J. |author4=Chrostowski, S.J. |title=TIMSS 2003 International Mathematics Report: Findings from IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study at the Fourth and Eighth Grades |publisher=TIMSS &amp; PIRLS International Study Center |year=2004 |isbn=1-8899-3834-3 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED494650&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED494650}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example was the wave of [[education reforms]] implemented after the [[Soviet Union]] launched its [[Sputnik]] [[satellite]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rutherford, F.J. |title=Sputnik and Science Education |year=1997 |work=Reflecting on Sputnik: Linking the Past, Present, and Future of Educational Reform |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/sputnik/ruther1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most prominent of these reforms was led by the [[Physical Science Study Committee]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].  In recent years, business leaders such as Microsoft Chairman [[Bill Gates]] have called for more emphasis on science education, saying the United States risks losing its economic edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Citing "Critical Situation" in Science and Math, Business Groups Urge Approval of New National Agenda for Innovation |date=27 July 2005 |publisher=Business Roundtable |url=http://www.businessroundtable.org/newsroom/Document.aspx?qs=5876BF807822B0F1AD1448722FB51711FCF50C8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208164558/http://www.businessroundtable.org/newsroom/Document.aspx?qs=5876BF807822B0F1AD1448722FB51711FCF50C8 |archivedate=2007-12-08 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |author=Borland, J. |title=Gates: Get U.S. schools in order |date=2 May 2005 |work=CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Gates-Get-U.S.-schools-in-order/2100-1022_3-5692845.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Tapping America's Potential is an organization aimed at getting more students to graduate with science, technology, engineering and mathematics degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tapping America's Potential |url=http://www.tapcoalition.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion surveys, however, indicate most U.S. parents are complacent about science education and that their level of concern has actually declined in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicagenda.org/research/pdfs/rc0601.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614211608/http://www.publicagenda.org/research/pdfs/rc0601.pdf|date=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof Sreyashi Jhumki Basu &lt;ref&gt;[[Sreyashi Jhumki Basu]]&lt;/ref&gt; published extensively on the need for equity in Science Education in the United States.

Furthermore, in the recent National Curriculum Survey conducted by ACT, researchers uncovered a possible disconnect among science educators.  "Both middle school/junior high school teachers and post secondary science instructors rate(d) process/inquiry skills as more important than advanced science content topics; high school teachers rate them in exactly the opposite order."  Perhaps more communication among educators at the different grade levels in necessary to ensure common goals for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.act.org/research/policymakers/pdf/NationalCurriculumSurvey2009.pdf |title=National Research Leader in College and Workforce Readiness |publisher=ACT |date=2009 |accessdate=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 science education framework====

According to a report from the National Academy of Sciences, the fields of science, technology, and education hold a paramount place in the modern world, but there are not enough workers in the United States entering the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professions. In 2012 the National Academy of Sciences Committee on a Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards developed a guiding framework to standardize K-12 science education with the goal of organizing science education systematically across the K-12 years. Titled ''A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas'', the publication promotes standardizing K-12 science education in the United States. It emphasizes science educators to focus on a "limited number of disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting concepts, be designed so that students continually build on and revise their knowledge and abilities over multiple years, and support the integration of such knowledge and abilities with the practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design." &lt;ref&gt;[http://research.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/gradresearch.cc.lehigh.edu/files/documents/VPRO/Workshops/NRC%20Framework%20for%20K.12%20Science%20Education.pdf A Framework For K-12 Science Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report says that in the 21st century Americans need science education in order to engage in and "systematically investigate issues related to their personal and community priorities," as well as to reason scientifically and know how to apply science knowledge. The committee that designed this new framework sees this imperative as a matter of [[educational equity]] to the diverse set of schoolchildren. Getting more diverse students into [[STEM fields|STEM education]] is a matter of social justice as seen by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;A Framework For K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013 Next Generation Science Standards====

In 2013 a new standards for science education were released that update the national standards released in 1996. Developed by 26 state governments and national organizations of scientists and science teachers, the guidelines, called the [[Next Generation Science Standards]], are intended to "combat widespread scientific ignorance, to standardize teaching among states, and to raise the number of high school graduates who choose scientific and technical majors in college...." Included are guidelines for teaching students about topics such as climate change and evolution. An emphasis is teaching the scientific process so that students have a better understanding of the methods of science and can critically evaluate scientific evidence. Organizations that contributed to developing the standards include the [[National Science Teachers Association]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], and Achieve, a nonprofit organization that was also involved in developing math and English standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Gillis |title=New Guidelines Call for Broad Changes in Science Education |newspaper=New York Times |date=9 April 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/science/panel-calls-for-broad-changes-in-science-education.html |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Informal science education====

[[File:Students use microscope LPB Laos.jpg|thumb|Young students use a microscope for the first time, as they examine bacteria a "Discovery Day" organized by [[Big Brother Mouse]], a literacy and education project in Laos.]]
Informal science education is the science teaching and learning that occurs outside of the formal school curriculum in places such as museums, the media, and community-based programs. The [[National Science Teachers Association]] has created a position statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/informal.aspx |title=NSTA Position Statement: Informal Science Education |publisher=National Science Teachers Association |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Informal Science Education to define and encourage science learning in many contexts and throughout the lifespan. Research in informal science education is funded in the United States by the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5361 National Science Foundation funding for informal science education]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education]] (CAISE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE) |url=http://www.informalscience.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides resources for the informal science education community.

Examples of informal science education include science centers, [[science museums]], and new digital learning environments (''e.g.'' [[Global Challenge Award]]), many of which are members of the [[Association of Science and Technology Centers]] (ASTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Association of Science-Technology Centers |url=http://astc.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco and The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia are the oldest of this type of museum in the United States.  Media include TV programs such as ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'', ''Newton's Apple'', "[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]","[[Beakman's World]]", ''[[The Magic School Bus]]'', and ''[[Dragonfly TV]]''. Early examples of science education on American television included programs by [[Daniel Q. Posin]], such as "Dr. Posin's Universe", "The Universe Around Us", "On the Shoulders of Giants", and "Out of This World".  Examples of community-based programs are [[4-H]] Youth Development programs, [[Hands On Science Outreach, Inc.|Hands On Science Outreach]], NASA and After school Programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.nasa.gov/divisions/informal/overview/R_NASA_and_Afterschool_Programs.html |title=NASA and Afterschool Programs: Connecting to the Future |publisher=NASA |date=3 April 2006 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027023742/http://education.nasa.gov/divisions/informal/overview/R_NASA_and_Afterschool_Programs.html |archive-date=27 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Girls at the Center. Home education is encouraged through educational products such as the former (1940-1989) [[Things of Science]] subscription service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1hwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QKQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4985,4298460&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=Thing-of-the-Month Club will provide remarkable objects|last=Othman|first=Frederick C.|date=7 October 1947|work=[[San Jose Evening News]]|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the National Academies released ''Surrounded by Science: Learning Science in Informal Environments'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fenichel, M.; Schweingruber, H.A.; National Research Council |title=Surrounded by Science in Informal Environments |publisher=The National Academies Press |location=Washington DC |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-309-13674-7 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12614}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the National Research Council study, ''Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee on Learning Science in Informal Environments, National Research Council |title=Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits |publisher=The National Academies Press |location=Washington DC |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-309-11955-9 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12190}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Surrounded by Science'' is a resource book that shows how current research on learning science across informal science settings can guide the thinking, the work, and the discussions among informal science practitioners. This book makes valuable research accessible to those working in informal science: educators, museum professionals, university faculty, youth leaders, media specialists, publishers, broadcast journalists, and many others.

The '''Stockbridge School of Agriculture''' offers Associate of Science, Bachelor of Science, and graduate degrees as an academic unit of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] campus. It was founded as part of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now University of Massachusetts Amherst) in 1918. The following Associate of Science degrees are available at Stockbridge:

* [[Arboriculture]] and Community Forest Management
* [[Equine]] Management
* Sustainable Food &amp; Farming
* Sustainable [[Horticulture]] 
* [[Landscape]] Contracting
* [[Turfgrass]] Management

The following Bachelor of Science Degrees are available:

* Sustainable Food &amp; Farming
* Sustainable Horticulture
* Turfgrass Science &amp; Management
* Plant, Soil, &amp; Insect Sciences

The following graduate degrees are offered:

* M.S. and Ph.D. in Plant Biology
* M.S. and Ph.D. in Organismic &amp; Evolutionary Biology
* M.S. and Ph.D. in Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology
* M.S. in Soil Science

The school's main facility and school symbol is [[Stockbridge Hall]], named after [[Levi Stockbridge]], a founder of Massachusetts Agricultural College and its first professor of agriculture; however, its faculty occupies various building on the University of Massachusetts campus, including Agricultural Engineering, Bowditch, Clark, Fernald, French, Stockbridge, and West Experiment Station.  Research, education, and extension activities occur at the UMass Cold Spring Orchard Research &amp; Education Center, the Hadley Farm (Stockbridge Stables), the Joseph Troll Turf Research Center, the UMass Vegetable &amp; Agronomy Research Farm, and the CNS Greenhouses.

== Athletics ==
Stockbridge has two [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) teams: basketball and golf. As a two–year school, its students are not allowed by the NCAA to play on varsity teams. Stockbridge teams compete against small four-year schools, preparatory schools, and community colleges. Stockbridge students may try out for the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association equestrian team and Intercollegiate Dressage Association team. These teams compete throughout the year with other colleges in the Northeast. Students may also take advantage of many noncompetitive recreational opportunities or participate in the University of Massachusetts' intramural program, one of the largest in the East.

== Greek life ==
[[Alpha Tau Gamma]] is the social and academic fraternity of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture. Their Chapter House is located at 118 Sunset Avenue on several acres of land near the Southwest dormitories.
There has been at several time throughout the history of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture a sorority Sigma Sigma Alpha. They are currently not active on campus.

'''Stone box graves''' were a method of burial employed by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Mississippian culture]] in the American Midwest and Southeast. Their construction was especially common in the [[Cumberland River]] Basin around [[Nashville, Tennessee]]

==Construction==
A stone box grave is a coffin of stone slabs arranged in the rectangular shape into which a deceased individual was then placed. Common materials used for construction of the graves were [[limestone]] and [[shale]], both varieties of stone which naturally break into slab like shapes. The materials for the bottom of the graves often varies, with grave floors made of stone, pottery, shell, dirt, perishables, or some combination of those materials, while the tops are more slabs of stone. Grave goods were often interred with the deceased and included [[Mississippian culture pottery|mortuary pottery]], ceramic objects, stone implements such as [[Celt (tool)|celts]], axes, and arrowheads, figurines, bone beads, dice, and awls, and personal ornaments including marine [[shell gorget]]s and freshwater pearls. Regional variations existed, with some being larger and roomier than others, some being built with right angles and some angled inward at the feet.&lt;ref name=MOORE&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sitemason.com/files/cLPLJC/Volume3Issue2.pdf|editor=Michael C. Moore|journal=Tennessee Archaeology| volume=3 |number=2|date=Fall 2008|title=The Cumberland Stone-box burials of Middle Tennessee|first1= John T.|last1=Dowd|pages=163–180|publisher=Tennessee Council for Professional Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of the Middle Tennessee region tended to place bodies in an extended position, while in Eastern Tennessee a flexed position was more often favored.&lt;ref name=BRALY&gt;{{citation|url=http://web.utk.edu/~anthrop/research/TennesseeArchaeology/11_Middle_Mississippian_02062008.pdf|title=

The grave would be reopened and the bones of the previous occupant would be disarticulated and shoved to one end or side so the new occupant could be placed in the proper position. Instances of double burials have also been found, with two occupants interred simultaneously. This is thought to be a conjugal pairing as the occupants are usually of the opposite sex from one another.&lt;ref name=BRALY/&gt; This type of burial seems to have been reserved for adult members of these societies, with few known examples of child or subadult burials in this fashion. Burials for these individuals seems to take place under house floors or adjacent to houses.&lt;ref name=BRALY/&gt;

Stone box graves have been found at many different Mississippian sites from the [[American Bottom]]&lt;ref name=HINTERLANDS&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55h7hrf-ET0C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=mississippian+stone+box+burials&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VVFP6FwzBd&amp;sig=VkMsAT4GdMy-5CQCwgykxSFnFx8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fqNeTezyI4P88Abpy6mDDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mississippian%20stone%20box%20burials&amp;f=false|title=Cahokia and the Hinterlands: Middle Mississippian Cultures of the Midwest|editor1-first= Thomas E.|editor1-last=Emerson|editor2-first=R.

==In archaeology==
Since the beginning of archaeological investigations in the region in the late nineteenth century the graves have been used as a means for understanding the prehistoric inhabitants of the area, with many even calling the people of the Middle Tennessee area the "Stone Grave People". Joseph Jones, under the auspices of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], investigated the Middle Tennessee area and in his 1876 monograph he accurately describes the native remains (including the known Native American practice of [[artificial cranial deformation]]) and discussed the possible origins of the local populations and their connection to other peoples and regions such as the [[Natchez (people)|Natchez]] of the Lower Mississippi Valley. In the 1870s [[Frederick Ward Putnam]] of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] also excavated several large [[platform mound]]s with stone box graves in the vicinity of Nashville. In his 1877 report Putnam recorded burial placement and grave goods found during his excavations and speculated on the ancestry, culture, and age of the people who built the mounds. Putnam concluded that the people of the area were connected with groups from the central [[Mississippi River]] Valley. [[Gates P. Thruston]]s 1890 manuscript, which started as a piece on a stone box grave cemetery found in Nashville, was the first comprehensive analysis of artifacts for the state of Tennessee. Thruston's conclusions on the builders of the local mounds and box graves added to the nineteenth century myth of the "[[Mound builder (people)|Moundbuilders]]", as he concluded a "superior race" from the local Native Americans had built the structures. [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] with his ''Gopher of Philadelphia'' riverboat expedition of 1914-1915 continued the tradition of extensive archaeological research in the area and like his predecessors he was also enthralled by the stone box graves. He made maps of sites showing the different varieties of stone graves in Middle Tennessee, Upper Tennessee Valley and nearby Northern Alabama regions&lt;ref name=BRALY2&gt;{{citation|url= http://web.utk.edu/~anthrop/research/TennesseeArchaeology/02_History_of_Tennessee_Archaeology.pdf |title=Chapter 2: A History of Archaeology in Tennessee|first1=Bobby R.|last1=Braly|first2=Shannon| last2=Koerner| accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\sim_{st}\pi'&lt;/math&gt;, 

can be seen as a partitioning of path &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi'&lt;/math&gt; into blocks, so that states in the &lt;math&gt;k^{\mathrm{th}}&lt;/math&gt; block of one path are labeled (&lt;math&gt;L(\sdot)&lt;/math&gt;) the same as states in the &lt;math&gt;k^{\mathrm{th}}&lt;/math&gt; block of the other path. Corresponding blocks may have different lengths.

Formally, this can be expressed as two infinite paths &lt;math&gt;\pi=s_0, s_1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi'=r_0, r_1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; which are stuttering equivalent (&lt;math&gt;\pi \sim_{st} \pi'&lt;/math&gt;) if there are two infinite sequences of integers &lt;math&gt;0 = i_0 &lt; i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \ldots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 = j_0 &lt; j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that for every block &lt;math&gt;k \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;L(s_{i_k}) = L(s_{i_k+1}) = \ldots = L(s_{i_{k+1}-1}) = L(r_{j_k}) = L(r_{j_k+1}) = \ldots = L(r_{j_{k+1}-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

Stuttering equivalence is not the same as [[bisimulation]], since bisimulation cannot capture the semantics of the 'eventually' (or 'finally') operator found in [[Linear temporal logic|linear temporal]]/[[Computation tree logic|computation tree logic(branching time logic)]]([[modal logic]]). So-called ''branching bisimulation'' has to be used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A '''Tactical Engagement Simulation''' (TES) is a [[training]] system for using [[weapon]]s. [[Laser]] transmitters are used instead of bullets, larger rounds, or shorter-range guided weapons such as [[anti-tank missile]]s.  A laser transmitter is mounted on the weapon and aligned with the weapon's [[gun barrel|barrel]].  

[[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is often used as the stimulated medium and this produces a wavelength of 904 nanometres, in the near infrared band outside the sensitivity of the human eye which is from about 400 to 700 nm (0.4 to 0.7 micrometres).  

In modern TES systems the laser transmission is coded so that in a [[field exercise]], individual weapons can be identified by exercise control (EXCON) and appropriate calculations made of gravity drop, [[warhead]] damage radius and so forth.  

Weapons as small as [[hand gun]]s can be part of a TES system as can larger weapons including [[tanks]] and large calibre guns.  In field exercises, the laser transmitters can trigger cartridge-based [[Weapon effects simulation]] (WES) devices mounted on potential targets such as tanks and other vehicles.  WES systems include [[pyrotechnic]] flash/bang and smoke devices that add realism to a field exercise.  

All these events are recorded on the exercise computer.  After-Action Review (AAR) can include comprehensive analysis of weapon firing, accuracy and warhead effects on the targets.  Such techniques have taken much speculation out of the assessment of field exercises and have resulted in more realistic training than used to be available other than by using (dangerous) live firing.

[[File:Tc99minjektion.jpg|thumb|right|A technetium injection contained in a shielded syringe]]
'''Technetium-99m''' is a [[metastable]] [[nuclear isomer]] of [[technetium-99]] (itself an isotope of [[technetium]]), symbolized as &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc, that is used in tens of millions of medical diagnostic procedures annually, making it the most commonly used [[Radiopharmacology|medical radioisotope]].

Technetium-99m is used as a [[radioactive tracer]] and can be detected in the body by medical equipment ([[gamma camera]]s). It is well suited to the role, because it emits readily detectable [[gamma ray]]s with a [[photon energy]] of 140&amp;nbsp;[[kiloelectronvolt|keV]] (these 8.8&amp;nbsp;pm [[photon]]s are about the same wavelength as emitted by conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment) and its [[half-life]] for gamma emission is 6.0058 hours (meaning 93.7% of it decays to &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc in 24 hours). The relatively "short" physical [[half-life]] of the isotope and its [[biological half-life]] of 1 day (in terms of human activity and metabolism) allows for scanning procedures which collect data rapidly but keep total patient radiation exposure low. The same characteristics make the isotope suitable only for diagnostic but never therapeutic use.

Technetium-99m was discovered as a product of [[cyclotron]] bombardment of [[molybdenum]]. This procedure produced [[molybdenum-99]], a radionuclide with a longer half-life (2.75 days), which decays to Tc-99m. At present, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is used commercially as the easily transportable source of medically used Tc-99m. In turn, this Mo-99 is usually created commercially by fission of [[highly enriched uranium]] in aging research and material testing nuclear reactors in several countries.

==History==
===Discovery===
In 1938 [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] isolated for the first time the [[metastable isotope]] technetium-99m, after bombarding natural molybdenum with 8 MeV [[deuteron]]s in the {{convert|37|inch|adj=on}} [[cyclotron]] of [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence]]'s [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segrè|first=Emilio|last2=Seaborg|first2=Glenn T.|title=Nuclear Isomerism in Element 43|journal=Physical Review|date=1 November 1938|volume=54|issue=9|pages=772–772|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.54.772.2|bibcode = 1938PhRv...54..772S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Seaborg explained that:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffmann|Ghiorso|Seaborg|2000 |pp =15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|we discovered an isotope of great scientific interest, because it decayed by means of an isomeric transition with emission of a line spectrum of electrons coming from an almost completely internally converted gamma ray transition. [actually, only 12% of the decays are by internal conversion] (...) This was a form of radioactive decay which had never been observed before this time. Segrè and I were able to show that this radioactive isotope of the element with the atomic number 43 decayed with a half-life of 6.6&amp;nbsp;h [later updated to 6.0&amp;nbsp;h] and that it was the daughter of a 67-h [later updated to 66&amp;nbsp;h] molybdenum parent radioactivity. This chain of decay was later shown to have the mass number 99, and (...) the 6.6-h activity acquired the designation ‘technetium-99m.}}

Later in 1940, Emilio Segrè and [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] published the experimental results of the analysis of fission products of uranium-235, among which was present molybdenum-99, and detected the 6-h activity of element 43, later labelled as technetium-99m.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segrè|first=Emilio|author2=Wu, Chien-Shiung |title=Some Fission Products of Uranium|journal=Physical Review|year=1940|volume=57|issue=6|pages=552–552 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.57.552.3|bibcode = 1940PhRv...57..552S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical applications in the United States===
Tc-99m remained a scientific curiosity until the 1950s when [[Powell Richards]] realized the potential of technetium-99m as a medical radiotracer and promoted its use among the medical community. While Richards was in charge of the radioisotope production at the Hot Lab Division of the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], Walter Tucker and [[Margaret Greene]] were working on how to improve the separation process purity of the short-lived [[elution|eluted]] [[daughter product]] [[iodine-132]] from [[tellurium-132]], its 3.2-days parent, produced in the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/BGRR.asp|work=bnl.gov|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They detected a trace contaminant which proved to be Tc-99m, which was coming from Mo-99 and was following tellurium in the chemistry of the separation process for other fission products. Based on the similarities between the chemistry of the tellurium-iodine parent-daughter pair, Tucker and Greene developed the first [[technetium-99m generator]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Powell|title=Technetium-99m: The Early Days|year=1989|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|location=New York|url= http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/5612212-IkoOXK/5612212.pdf|volume=BNL-43197 CONF-8909193-1|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1= W.

The first US publication to report on medical scanning of Tc-99m appeared in August 1963.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbert|first1=R.|last2=Kulke|first2= W.|last3= Shepherd|first3= R.

After build-up of Tc-99m, they could visualize the liver using the 140 keV gamma ray emission.

===Worldwide expansion===
The production and medical use of Tc-99m rapidly expanded across the world in the 1960s, benefiting from the development and continuous improvements of the [[gamma camera]]s.

;Americas
Between 1963 and 1966, numerous scientific studies demonstrated the use of Tc-99m as [[radiotracer]] or diagnostic tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harper|first1=Pail V.|last2=Andros|first3= C. |last3=Lathop, K.|title=Preliminary observations on the use of six-hour Tc-99m as a tracer in biology and medicine|journal= Argonne Cancer Research Hospital |volume=18|pages=76–87|year= 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harper|first1=Paul.

Production and distribution of Tc-99m generators were transferred to private companies. ''"TechneKow-CS generator"'', the first commercial Tc-99m generator, was produced by Nuclear Consultants, Inc. (St. Louis, Missouri) and [[Union Carbide]] Nuclear Corporation (Tuxedo, New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=W. C. |editor1-last=Eckelman|editor2-first= B.

Union Carbide actively developed a process to produce and separate useful isotopes like Mo-99 from mixed [[fission products]] that resulted from the irradiation of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) targets in nuclear reactors developed from 1968 to 1972 at the Cintichem facility (formerly the Union Carbide Research Center built in the Sterling forest in Tuxedo, New York ({{coord|41|14|6.88|N|74|12|50.78|W |type:landmark_scale:10000_region:US |display=inline}})).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=3799883|title=Silver coated charcoal step|invent1=Hirofumi Arino|assign1= Union Carbide Corporation|gdate=March 26, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cintichem process originally used 93% highly enriched U-235 deposited as UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the inside of a cylindrical target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=3940318 |title=Preparation of a primary target for the production of fission products in a nuclear reactor|invent1=Hirofumi Arino|assign1= Union Carbide Corporation|gdate=February 24, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arino|first1=Hirofumi|last2=Kramer|first2= Henry H.|title=Fission product 99mTc generator|journal=The International Journal of Applied Radiation and Isotopes|date=May 1975|volume=26|issue=5|pages=301–303|doi=10.1016/0020-708X(75)90165-9|pmid=1184215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1970s, {{convert|200000|Ci|Bq|abbr=on}} of total fission product radiation were extracted weekly from 20-30 reactor bombarded HEU capsules, using the so-called "Cintichem [chemical isolation] process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decommissioning ALARA Programs Cintichem Decommissioning Experience|year=1994 |url=http://hps.ne.uiuc.edu/natcisoe/brookhaven/2057.pdf |first1=Joseph J.|last1=Adler |first2=Thomas |last2=LaGuardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research facility with its 1961 5-MW pool-type research reactor was later sold to Hoffman-LaRoche and became Cintichem Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botshon|first=Ann|title=Saving Sterling Forest the epic struggle to preserve New York's highlands|year=2007|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-0-7914-6939-2|pages=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSmJzn6Bl_0C&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=cintichem&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Cintichem, Inc. began the production/isolation of Mo-99 in its reactor, and became the single U.S. producer of Mo-99 during the 1980s. However, in 1989, Cintichem detected an underground leak of radioactive products that led to the reactor shutdown and decommissioning, putting an end to the commercial production of Mo-99 in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor =National Research Council of the National Academies|author=Committee on Medical Isotope Production Without Highly Enriched Uranium|title=Medical isotope production without highly enriched uranium|year=2009|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-13039-4|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of Mo-99 started in Canada in the early 1970s and was shifted to the NRU reactor in the mid 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|1997|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978 the reactor provided technetium-99m in large enough quantities that were processed by AECL's radiochemical division, which was privatized in 1988 as Nordion, now [[Nordion|MDS Nordion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Litt|2000|p=224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s a substitution for the aging NRU reactor for production of radioisotopes was planned. The [[Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice Experiment]] (MAPLE) was designed as a dedicated isotope-production facility. Initially, two identical MAPLE reactors were to be built at [[Chalk River Laboratories]], each capable of supplying 100% of the world's medical isotope demand. However, problems with the MAPLE 1 reactor, most notably a positive [[Nuclear chain reaction|power co-efficient of reactivity]], led to the cancellation of the project in 2008.

The first commercial Tc-99m generators were produced in [[Argentina]] in 1967, with Mo-99 produced in the [[National Atomic Energy Commission|CNEA]]'s [[RA-1 Enrico Fermi]] reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karpeles|first1=Alfredo|last2=Palcos|first2=María Cristina|title=Obtención de Generadores de Tc-99m|year=1970|volume=CNEA-267|url=http://www.cnea.gov.ar/cac/ci/CICACInformes/cicacInformeCNEA168.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Reactor RA - 1|url=http://www.cnea.gov.ar/xxi/reactores/RA1.asp|work=CNEA.gob.ar|accessdate=26 April 2012|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208023628/http://www.cnea.gov.ar/xxi/reactores/RA1.asp|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides its domestic market CNEA supplies Mo-99 to some South American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|National Research Council|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1963, Scheer and Maier-Borst were the first to introduce the use of Tc-99m for medical applications.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheer|first1=K.

In 1968, [[Philips#Spinouts|Philips-Duphar]] (later Mallinckrodt, today [[Covidien]]) marketed the first technetium-99m generator produced in Europe and distributed from Petten, the Netherlands.

===Shortage===
Global shortages of technetium-99m emerged in the late 2000s because two aging nuclear reactors ([[National Research Universal Reactor|NRU]] and [[Petten nuclear reactor|HFR]]) that provided about two-thirds of the world’s supply of molybdenum-99, which itself has a half-life of only 66 hours, were shut down repeatedly for extended maintenance periods.&lt;ref name="nyt09"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/science/24isotope.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title=Radioactive Drug for Tests Is in Short Supply |first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |date=July 23, 2009 |ref=harv |postscript=. }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Radiology/NuclearMedicine/18495|title=Looming Isotope Shortage Has Clinicians Worried|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=Feb 16, 2010|accessdate=Feb 25, 2010|work=[[MedPage Today]]|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruth|first=Thomas|title=Accelerating production of medical isotopes|journal=Nature|date=29 January 2009|volume=457|issue=7229|pages=536–537|doi=10.1038/457536a|pmid=19177112|bibcode = 2009Natur.457..536R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 the [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] announced the detection of a small leak of [[heavy water]] in the NRU reactor that remained out of service until completion of the repairs in August 2010.

[[Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group|NRG]] received in February 2009 a temporary license to operate HFR only when necessary for medical radioisotope production.

==Nuclear properties==
Technetium-99m is a metastable [[nuclear isomer]], as indicated by the "m" after its [[mass number]] 99. This means it is a [[decay product]] whose nucleus remains in an excited state that lasts much longer than is typical. The nucleus will eventually relax (i.e., de-excite) to its [[ground state]] through the emission of [[gamma ray]]s or [[internal conversion|internal conversion electron]]s. Both of these decay modes rearrange the [[nucleon]]s without [[nuclear transmutation|transmuting]] the technetium into another element.

Tc-99m decays mainly by gamma emission, slightly less than 88% of the time. (&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc → &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc + γ) About 98.6% of these gamma decays result in 140.5 keV gamma rays and the remaining 1.4% are to gammas of a slightly higher energy at 142.6 keV. These are the radiations that are picked up by a gamma camera when &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is used as a [[radioactive tracer]] for [[medical imaging]]. The remaining approximately 12% of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc decays are by means of [[internal conversion]], resulting in ejection of high speed internal conversion electrons in several sharp peaks (as is typical of electrons from this type of decay) also at about 140 keV (&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc → &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). These conversion electrons will [[ionizing radiation|ionize]] the surrounding matter like [[beta radiation]] electrons would do, contributing along with the 140.5 keV and 142.6 keV gammas to the total deposited [[radiation dose|dose]].

Pure gamma emission is the desirable [[decay mode]] for medical imaging because other particles deposit more energy in the patient body ([[radiation dose]]) than in the camera. Metastable isomeric transition is the only nuclear decay mode that approaches pure gamma emission.

Tc-99m's [[half-life]] of 6.0058 hours is considerably longer (by 14 orders of magnitude, at least) than most nuclear isomers, though not unique. This is still a short half-life relative to many other known modes of [[radioactive decay]] and it is in the middle of the range of half lives for [[radiopharmaceutical]]s used for [[medical imaging]].

After gamma emission or internal conversion, the resulting ground-state technetium-99 then decays with a half-life of 211,000 years to [[stable isotope|stable]] [[ruthenium-99]]. This process emits soft beta radiation without a gamma. Such low radioactivity from the daughter product(s) is a desirable feature for radiopharmaceuticals.

==Production==
===Production of Mo-99 in nuclear reactors===
;Neutron irradiation of U-235 targets
The [[daughter product|parent nuclide]] of Tc-99m, Mo-99, is mainly extracted for medical purposes from the [[fission product]]s created in neutron-irradiated U-235 targets, the majority of which is produced in five nuclear [[research reactor]]s around the world using [[Enriched uranium#Highly enriched uranium .28HEU.29|highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|National Research Council|2009|p=34}} [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12569&amp;page=34]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/47185/title/Desperately_Seeking_Moly | title = Desperately Seeking Moly | first = Janet | last = Raloff | year = 2009 | volume = 176 | issue = 7 | pages = 16–20 | journal = Science News | doi=10.1002/scin.5591760717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller amounts of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo are produced from [[Enriched uranium#Low-enriched uranium .28LEU.29|low-enriched uranium]] in at least three reactors.

===Technetium-99m generators===

Technetium-99m's short half-life of 6 hours makes storage impossible and would make transport very expensive. It is instead its parent nuclide &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo that is supplied to hospitals after its extraction from the neutron-irradiated uranium targets and its purification in dedicated processing facilities.{{#tag:ref|The Tc-99 formed by decay of Mo-99 and Tc-99m during the time of the processing is removed, together its isomer Tc-99m, at the end of the manufacturing process of the generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=P.

The generators, colloquially known as a moly cows, are devices designed to provide radiation shielding for transport and to minimize the extraction work done at the medical facility. A typical dose rate at 1 metre from Tc-99m generator is 20-50 [[μSv/h]] during transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Ken B.|title=Worker Exposures: How Much in the UK?|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull271/27104592527.pdf|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=IAEA Bulletin|date=Spring 1985|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905103646/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull271/27104592527.pdf|archivedate=5 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These generators' output declines with time and must be replaced weekly, since the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo is still only 66 hours.

Molybdenum-99 spontaneously decays to excited states of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc through [[beta decay]]. Over 87% of the decays lead to the 142 keV excited state of Tc-99m. A {{Subatomic particle|Beta-}} [[electron]] and a {{Subatomic particle|Electron antineutrino}} [[electron antineutrino]] are emitted in the process (&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo → &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc + {{Subatomic particle|Beta-}} + {{Subatomic particle|Electron antineutrino}}). The {{Subatomic particle|Beta-}} electrons are easily [[radiation shielding|shielded]] for transport, and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc generators are only minor radiation hazards, mostly due to secondary X-rays produced by the electrons (also known as ''[[Bremsstrahlung]]'').

At the hospital, the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc that forms through &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo decay is chemically extracted from the technetium-99m generator. Most commercial &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo/&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc generators use [[column chromatography]], in which &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo in the form of water-soluble molybdate, MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is [[adsorption|adsorbed]] onto acid alumina (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). When the &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo decays, it forms [[pertechnetate]] TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; [[elute]]s the soluble &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in a saline solution containing the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc as the dissolved [[sodium pertechnetate|sodium salt of the pertechnetate]]. One technetium-99m generator, holding only a few micrograms of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo, can potentially diagnose 10,000 patients{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} because it will be producing &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc strongly for over a week.

===Preparation===
{{See also|chelation}}
Technetium exits the generator in the form of the pertechnetate ion, TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[oxidation state]] of Tc in this compound is +7. This is directly suitable for medical applications only in [[bone scan]]s (it is taken up by osteoblasts) and some thyroid scans (it is taken up in place of iodine by normal thyroid tissues). In other types of scans relying on Tc-99m, a [[reducing agent]] is added to the pertechnetate solution to bring the oxidation state of the Tc down to +3 or +4. Secondly, a [[ligand]] is added to form a [[complex (chemistry)|coordination complex]]. The ligand is chosen to have an affinity for the specific organ to be targeted. For example, the [[exametazime]] complex of Tc in oxidation state +3 is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and flow through the vessels in the brain for cerebral blood flow imaging. Other ligands include [[sestamibi]] for myocardial perfusion imaging and mercapto acetyl triglycine for [[MAG3 scan]] to measure renal function.&lt;ref name=eck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eckelman|first=William C.|title=Unparalleled Contribution of Technetium-99m to Medicine Over 5 Decades|journal=JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging|year=2009|volume=2|issue=3|pages=364–368|doi=10.1016/j.jcmg.2008.12.013|url=http://imaging.onlinejacc.org/data/Journals/JCMG/22634/12013.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2012}} Historical perspective, full text&lt;/ref&gt;

Technetium-99m is used in 20 million diagnostic [[nuclear medicine|nuclear medical]] procedures every year. Approximately 85% of diagnostic imaging procedures in nuclear medicine use this isotope as [[radioactive tracer]]. Klaus Schwochau's book ''Technetium'' lists 31 [[radiopharmaceuticals]] based on &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc for imaging and functional studies of the [[brain]], [[myocardium]], [[thyroid]], [[lung]]s, [[liver]], [[gallbladder]], [[kidney]]s, [[skeleton]], [[blood]], and [[tumor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=414}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the procedure, the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is tagged (or bound to) a pharmaceutical that transports it to its required location. For example, when &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is chemically bound to [[exametazime]] (HMPAO), the drug is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and flow through the vessels in the brain for cerebral blood-flow imaging. This combination is also used for labeling white blood cells to visualize sites of infection. [[Technetium (99mTc) sestamibi|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc sestamibi]] is used for myocardial perfusion imaging, which shows how well the blood flows through the heart. Imaging to measure [[renal function]] is done by attaching &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc to mercaptoacetyl triglycine ([[MAG3]]); this procedure is known as a [[MAG3 scan]].

Technetium-99m can be readily detected in the body by medical equipment because it emits 140.5&amp;nbsp;[[kiloelectronvolt|keV]] [[gamma ray]]s (these are about the same wavelength as emitted by conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment), and its [[half-life]] for gamma emission is six hours (meaning 94% of it decays to &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc in 24 hours). The "short" physical [[half-life]] of the isotope and its [[biological half-life]] of 1 day (in terms of human activity and metabolism) allows for scanning procedures which collect data rapidly, but keep total patient radiation exposure low.

===Radiation side-effects===
Diagnostic treatment involving technetium-99m will result in radiation exposure to technicians, patients, and passers-by. Typical quantities of technetium administered for immunoscintigraphy tests, such as [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] tests, range from {{convert|400|to|1100|MBq|mCi|abbr=on}} ([[millicurie]] or mCi; and Mega-[[Becquerel]] or MBq) for adults.&lt;ref name=Cardialite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/019785s018lbl.pdf|title = Cardialite kit for the preparation of Technetium 99m Sestamibi for injection, Prescribing information, April 2008|accessdate = 2009-09-03|publisher = Food and Drug Administration|last=Squibb|first= B.-M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=3709|title=Neurolite (bicisate dihydrochloride)|accessdate=2009-11-11|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; These doses result in radiation exposures to the patient around 10&amp;nbsp;m[[Sievert|Sv]] (1000&amp;nbsp;[[mrem]]), the equivalent of about 500 [[chest X-ray]] exposures.&lt;ref name=Bedetti&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Am Coll Radiol|volume=5|issue=2|pages=126–31|year=2008|last1=Bedetti |first1=G. |last2=Pizzi |first2=C. |last3=Gavaruzzi |first3=G. |last4=Lugaresi |first4=F. |last5=Cicognani |first5=A. |last6=Picano |first6=E.|title=Suboptimal awareness of radiologic dose among patients undergoing cardiac stress scintigraphy|pmid=18242529|doi = 10.1016/j.jacr.2007.07.020|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of radiation exposure carries a 1 in 1000 lifetime risk of developing a solid cancer or leukemia in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Committee to Assess the Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, BEIR VII, National Research Council.

A spouse who stays constantly by the side of the patient through this time might receive one thousandth of patient's radiation dose this way.

The short half-life of the isotope allows for scanning procedures that collect data rapidly. The isotope is also of a very low energy level for a gamma emitter. Its ~140&amp;nbsp;keV of energy make it safer for use because of the substantially reduced [[Ionizing radiation|ionization]] compared with other gamma emitters. The energy of gammas from &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is about the same as the radiation from a commercial diagnostic X-ray machine, although the number of gammas emitted results in radiation doses more comparable to X-ray studies like [[computed tomography]].

Technetium-99m has several features that make it safer than other possible isotopes. Its gamma decay mode can be easily detected by a camera, allowing the use of smaller quantities. And because technetium-99m has a short half-life, its quick decay into the far less radioactive technetium-99 results in relatively low total radiation dose to the patient per unit of initial activity after administration, as compared to other radioisotopes. In the form administered in these medical tests (usually pertechnetate), technetium-99m and technetium-99 are eliminated from the body within a few days.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===3-D scanning technique: SPECT===
{{main|Single photon emission computed tomography}}
[[Single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) is a [[nuclear imaging|nuclear medicine imaging technique]] using gamma rays. It may be used with any gamma-emitting isotope, including Tc-99m. In the use of technetium-99m, the radioisotope is administered to the patient and the escaping gamma rays are incident upon a moving [[gamma camera]] which computes and processes the image. To acquire SPECT images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every three to six degrees. In most cases, a full 360° rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15–20 seconds are typical. This gives a total scan time of 15–20 minutes.

The technetium-99m radioisotope is used predominantly in bone and brain scans. For [[bone scan]]s, the pertechnetate ion is used directly, as it is taken up by osteoblasts attempting to heal a skeletal injury, or (in some cases) as a reaction of these cells to a tumor (either primary or metastatic) in the bone. In brain scanning, Tc-99m is attached to the chelating agent HMPAO to create [[Technetium (99mTc) exametazime|technetium (&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) exametazime]], an agent which localizes in the brain according to region blood flow, making it useful for the detection of stroke and dementing illnesses that decrease regional brain flow and metabolism.

Most recently, technetium-99m scintigraphy has been combined with CT coregistration technology to produce [[SPECT/CT]] scans. These employ the same radioligands and have the same uses as SPECT scanning, but are able to provide even finer 3-D localization of high-uptake tissues, in cases where finer resolution is needed. An example is the [[sestamibi parathyroid scan]] which is performed using the Tc-99m radioligand [[sestamibi]], and can be done in either SPECT or SPECT/CT machines.

===Bone scan===
The [[nuclear medicine]] technique commonly called the [[bone scan]] usually uses Tc-99m. It is not to be confused with the "bone density scan", [[DEXA]], which is a low-exposure X-ray test measuring bone density to look for osteoporosis and other diseases where bones lose mass without rebuilding activity. The nuclear medicine technique is sensitive to areas of unusual bone rebuilding activity, since the radiopharmaceutical is taken up by [[osteoblast]] cells which build bone. The technique therefore is sensitive to fractures and bone reaction to bone tumors, including metastases. For a bone scan, the patient is injected with a small amount of radioactive material, such as {{convert|700|-|1100|MBq|mCi|abbr=on}} of [[technetium (99mTc) medronic acid|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-medronic acid]] and then scanned with a [[gamma camera]]. Medronic acid is a [[phosphate]] derivative which can exchange places with bone phosphate in regions of active bone growth, so anchoring the radioisotope to that specific region. To view small lesions (less than {{convert|1|cm}}) especially in the spine, the [[SPECT]] imaging technique may be required, but currently in the United States, most insurance companies require separate authorization for SPECT imaging.

===Myocardial perfusion imaging===
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a form of functional cardiac imaging, used for the diagnosis of [[ischemic heart disease]]. The underlying principle is, under conditions of stress, diseased [[myocardium]] receives less blood flow than normal myocardium. MPI is one of several types of [[cardiac stress test]]. As a [[nuclear stress test]] the average radiation exposure is 9.4 mSV which compared to a typical 2 view Chest X-Ray (.1 mSV) is equivalent to 94 Chest X-Rays.&lt;ref name=xrayrisk.com&gt;http://www.xrayrisk.com/calculator/calculator-normal-studies.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Several radiopharmaceuticals and radionuclides may be used for this, each giving different information. In the myocardial perfusion scans using Tc-99m, the radiopharmaceuticals &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-[[tetrofosmin]] (Myoview, [[GE Healthcare]]) or &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-[[sestamibi]] (Cardiolite, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]) are used. Following this, myocardial stress is induced, either by exercise or pharmacologically with [[adenosine]], [[dobutamine]] or [[dipyridamole]](Persantine), which increase the heart rate or by [[regadenoson]](Lexiscan), a vasodilator. ([[Aminophylline]] can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole and regadenoson). Scanning may then be performed with a conventional gamma camera, or with SPECT/CT.

===Cardiac ventriculography===
In [[cardiac ventriculography]], a radionuclide, usually &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc, is injected, and the heart is imaged to evaluate the flow through it, to evaluate [[coronary artery disease]], [[valvular heart disease]], [[congenital heart disease]]s, [[cardiomyopathy]], and other [[cardiac disorder]]s.As a [[nuclear stress test]] the average radiation exposure is 9.4 mSV which compared to a typical 2 view Chest X-Ray (.1 mSV) is equivalent to 94 Chest X-Rays.&lt;ref name="xrayrisk.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=merck/&gt; It exposes patients to less radiation than to comparable [[chest X-ray]] studies.&lt;ref name=merck&gt;[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec07/ch070/ch070i.html Merck manuals &amp;gt; Radionuclide Imaging] Last full review/revision May 2009 by Michael J. Shea, MD. Content last modified May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional brain imaging===
Usually the gamma-emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO (hexamethylpropylene amine oxime, [[Technetium (99mTc) exametazime|exametazime]]). The similar &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-EC tracer may also be used. These molecules are preferentially distributed to regions of high brain blood flow, and act to assess brain metabolism regionally, in an attempt to diagnose and differentiate the different causal pathologies of [[dementia]]. When used with the 3-D [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] technique, they compete with brain [[Positron emission tomography|FDG-PET]] scans and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] brain scans as techniques to map the regional metabolic rate of brain tissue.

===Sentinel-node identification===
The radioactive properties of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc can be used to identify the predominant [[lymph nodes]] draining a cancer, such as [[breast cancer]] or [[malignant melanoma]]. This is usually performed at the time of [[biopsy]] or [[Segmental resection|resection]].&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-labelled [[isosulfan blue]] [[dye]] is injected intradermally around the intended biopsy site. The general location of the sentinel node is determined with the use of a handheld scanner with a gamma-sensor probe that detects the technetium-99m–labeled sulfur colloid that was previously injected around the biopsy site. An incision is then made over the area of highest radionuclide accumulation, and the sentinel node is identified within the incision by inspection; the isosulfan blue dye will usually stain any draining nodes blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1056/NEJMct1002967| issn = 0028-4793

===Immunoscintigraphy===
[[Immunoscintigraphy]] incorporates &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc into a [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]], an [[immune system]] [[protein]], capable of binding to [[cancer]] cells. A few hours after injection, medical equipment is used to detect the gamma rays emitted by the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc; higher concentrations indicate where the tumor is. This technique is particularly useful for detecting hard-to-find cancers, such as those affecting the [[intestine]]s. These modified antibodies are sold by the German company [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] (now part of [[Sanofi-Aventis]]) under the name "Scintium".&lt;ref name=blocks&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley |2001| pp =422–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood pool labeling===
When &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is combined with a [[tin]] compound, it binds to [[red blood cell]]s and can therefore be used to map [[circulatory system]] disorders. It is commonly used to detect gastrointestinal bleeding sites.

===Pyrophosphate for heart damage===
A [[pyrophosphate]] ion with &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc adheres to [[calcium]] deposits in damaged [[heart]] muscle, making it useful to gauge damage after a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Sulfur colloid for spleen scan===
The [[sulfur]] colloid of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is scavenged by the [[spleen]], making it possible to image the structure of the spleen.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{Harvnb|Rimshaw| 1968| pp= 689–693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meckel's diverticulum===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16773">Religious economy refers to religious persons and organizations interacting within a market framework of competing groups and ideologies.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; An economy makes it possible for religious suppliers to meet the demands of different religious [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref name="ncsociology.org"&gt;Wortham, Robert A. Religious Choices and Preferences: North Carolina's Baskin Robbins Effect? 2004. 27 Sep. 2007. [http://www.ncsociology.org/sociationtoday/v21/religion.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; By offering an array of religions and religious products, a competitive religious economy stimulates such activity in  a [[marketplace|market]]-type setting.&lt;ref name="ncsociology.org"/&gt;

The field applies [[rational choice theory]] to the [[theory of religion]] such that [[supply and demand]] are used to model the development and success of [[organized religion]]s.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stark |first= Rodney |authorlink= Rodney Stark |title= Sociology |edition= 10th |year= 2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth |isbn= 0-495-09344-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major proponents of the theory include [[William Sims Bainbridge]],  [[Roger Finke]], [[Laurence Iannaccone]], and [[Rodney Stark]].

==Major debates==
The idea of religious economy frames religion as a product and as those who practice or identify with any particular religion as a consumer. But when the idea of belief is brought into the equation, this definition expands, and [[ideology]] affects the "product" and who "consumes" it. When examining depictions of religious identity in a global world, it is easy to see how ideology affects religious economy.

[[Carl L. Bankston]] III refers to religions and religious groups as "…competing firms [that vie for] customers who make rational choices among available products…" (311). Using a liberal economic (see [[Economic liberalism]]) framework for analysis, Bankston is claiming that religions and religious groups’ popularity is dependent on the laws of supply and demand. As a marketplace, religious consumers are subject to things such as marketing, availability of product, resources, brand recognition, etc. But unlike some actual commodity such as a computer, these commodities speak to an individual’s beliefs. Bankston poses the idea that belief deals with ideology and extends beyond what one would typically define as a market good by stating "…belief is produced and resides in communicated thoughts, (and) the consumers of goods of faith can only become consumers by becoming producers, by participating in interactions of belief…" (322).

===Secularization and religious economy===
{{Main|Secularization}}
Prior to the emergence of the theory of religious economy some scholars of religion, such as Steve Bruce,&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Steve|title=Choice and Religion: A Critique of Rational Choice|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed that [[modernization]] would lead inevitably to the erosion of religiosity. These sociologists have predicted the disappearance of religion from [[Earth]], based on the decline in religious belief and observance in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="Young 1997"/&gt; According to the theory of religious economy, societies that restrict supply of religion, either through an imposed state religious monopoly or through state-sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in religiosity. Correspondingly, the more [[religion]]s a society has, the more likely the population is to be religious.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; This is refuted in the orthodox view by stating that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of belief, then they are less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing can be shared and reified in a community context. If nothing is shared, then nothing is shunned, and there is thus a loss in observance of modern liberal traditions.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"/&gt;

====Revival====
According to [[Rodney Stark]], revival is another aspect of religious change which coincides with [[secularization]].  Over time established religious groups will spawn smaller and less worldly subgroups of the faith.  This trend of revival provides a plausible explanation why religion never seems to fade away and to why previously prominent religious organizations have dissipated.  Revival produces a shift in which religious groups a population will follow and proves effective against the demise of religion.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Cults====
Unlike a sect which follows traditions from its parent religion, a cult presents completely new religious traditions.  Cult is simply another word for a new religion and all current religions at one point could have been considered cult movements.  The negative connotations on the word cult have led to hostility between these movements and their social environments. [[Rodney Stark]] defines the two reactions from [[secularization]] being revival and cult formation. As old faiths eventually weaken the rise of different religious sects and cults will prevail.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Strict regulations to enforce strong ties====
Strict Churches are prevalent in the US and around the world and while people still question and debate their ascent, their ties are characteristically defined as being strong within the group with few weak ties branching outside to other groups. Strict churches arise from strict doctrines and can be in many forms such as large churches, sects, or cults but are not limited to these. Churches are most often known for their “cosmopolitan networks, while sects tend to consist of intense local networks,”&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, 2007. ''Sociology''. Tenth Edition. Thomas Wadsworth. {{ISBN|0-495-09344-0}}./&lt;/ref&gt; while this may be true for “unstrict” doctrines this is not always the case for strict doctrines. Strong doctrines can arise from certain sects as various religions have done such as [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Islam]], certain denominations of [[Christianity]], or can include rather smaller cults or small sects. What all strong doctrines employ though, are formal controls to discourage [[Free rider problem|free riding]] within the group and to keep the church strong and together.&lt;ref&gt;Hechter, Michael. Principles of Group Solidarity. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06462-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These controls can vary from church to church but all serve the same purpose of keeping group solidarity.

As commonly seen strict churches employ various means of keeping their ties in their church strong while limiting excessive access to other groups such as dress code, eating habits, and rituals that prevent mixing with other groups. The implication of these, “strict demands ‘strengthen’ a church in three ways; they raise overall levels of commitment, they increase average rates of participation, and they enhance the net benefits of membership.”&lt;ref name="Iannaccone, Laurence R. 1211"&gt;Laurence R. Iannaccone, 1994. "Why Strict Churches Are Strong,"  ''American Journal of Sociology'', 99(5), pp. [http://religionomics.com/iannaccone/papers/Iannaccone%20-%20Strict%20Churches.pdf 1180-1211.]&lt;/ref&gt; Complying with these demands prevent the members of a church from free loading within the group and promote group solidarity. The strict rules that govern and regulate a church actually help and promote the strength of the ties within the group. Those who don’t comply with these strictures are screened out leaving only those who do comply and comply earnestly.”&lt;ref name="Iannaccone, Laurence R. 1211"/&gt; These strict doctrines and regulations serve to keep the church strong and together while screening out members that may actually harm the church unintentionally by being free loaders within the group.

===Church-sect theory===
&lt;!-- Not sure this section belongs in this article, as it seems off-topic. --&gt;
Originally proposed by [[H. Richard Niebuhr]] in his book ''The Social Sources of Denominationalism'', the theory discusses the difference between churches and [[sects]]. Niebuhr proposed that there is a cycle which [[sects]] and churches follow. Religions originate as [[sects]] designed to serve the needs of the deprived. If they flourish, they increasingly serve the interests of the middle and upper classes and are transformed into churches. Once the sects have become churches they become less effective in satisfying the needs of the lower class and the formation of a sect is re-created.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

In 1963 Benton Johnson revised the church-sect theory into its current state.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; Church and sect form opposite poles on an  axis representing the amount of "tension" between religious organizations and their social environments.  Tension, as defined by Benton Johnson, is "a manifestation of deviance." &lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; The tension is described to be between the groups members and the outside world.  Churches are described as religious bodies having low tension, whereas, [[sects]] have high tension.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Ideology====

Some social scientists have become increasingly uncomfortable with what they see as the intermingling of social scientific analysis and free-market ideology in rational choice theory.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Michael. Rationality and the Ideology of Disconnection. Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have likewise raised critical questions about the ideological use of neo-classical economic metaphors in rational choice theorizing about religion &lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2013). 'Ideology and the Market Metaphor in Rational Choice Theory of Religion: A Rhetorical Critique of “Religious Economies”'. Critical Sociology, vol 39, no. 4 [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3714/1/rational_choice_critique_author_final_version.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The ''theory of religious economy'' arises from the application of fundamental principles of economics to the analysis of religious organizations. Just as commercial economies consist of a market in which different firms compete, religious economies consist of a market (the aggregate demand for religion) and firms (different religious organizations) seeking to attract and hold clients.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; The theory of religious economy was developed to explain why and how religions change.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

==Market situation==
According to the theory, [[religious pluralism]] gives the population a wide variety of choices in religion and leads to a religious economy in which different [[religious organizations]] compete for followers, much the way businesses compete for consumers in a commercial [[economy]]. The Theory of Religious Economy takes into account a wide spectrum of issues (e.g., the differences between competitive religious markets and religious [[monopoly|monopolies]]), making this theory one of the most significant developments in the social scientific study of religion during the past thirty years.&lt;ref name="Young 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rational Choice Theory and Religion |year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-91192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory  focuses attention on religious suppliers and whether religious firms have the ability to increase the demand for religion.&lt;ref name="Young 1997"/&gt;

In a free market, or [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]] religious market, many religious organizations exist and seek to appeal to certain segments of the market. Organizations in a free market cannot rely on the state for resources so they must compete for participation of the religious consumer. Contest among religious firms results in the specialization of products so that consumers are able to distinguish different organization from others(Chesnut). Pluralistic religions operate on a personal scale, marketing more to individual demands as opposed to public. As the majority of the consumer market, organizations market more to women than men. Pluralism is only possible through lack of favoritism by the state.(Chesnut) A competitive and pluralistic religious economy has a positive effect on levels of participation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A [[microeconomic]] theory of the [[household production function]] and time allocation is associated with the work of [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago]] economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;• Gary S. Becker, 1965. “A Theory of the Allocation of Time,” ''Economic Journal'' 75 (299), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2228949 p. 493]-517.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • _____, 1973. "A Theory of Marriage: Part I." ''Journal of Political Economy'', 81(4), pp. [http://www.fep.up.pt/docentes/pcosme/micro-g102/beckerJPE1973.pdf 813-846.]&lt;/ref&gt; An influential approach dating from the 1970s adapts that theory to explain religious participation and a resulting formation of norms. It postulates stable preferences and [[rational choice]] constrained by limited [[human capital|human]] and [[social capital]] to explain behavior.&lt;ref&gt;• Corry Azzi and [[Ronald Ehrenberg]],  1975.

As in economics, the market situation can be described with concepts about monopoly, prohibition, and pluralism. Monopolies in religion are only made possible through state enforcement and often function on a public scale. When the government establishes a set religion and all other competition is drowned out then "believers are culturally connected but not necessarily spiritually"(Andrew Chesnut) to the religion enforced by the state. Since participation in a religious monopoly is not as important because the church does not have to rely on members for resources they are not forced to provide adequate or marketable "religious products"(Chesnut), due to lack of competition. The ability of a religious organization to monopolize a religious economy is entirely dependent on the extent to which the state governs the religious economy. A monopolized religious economy tends to have lower levels of participation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rational Choice Theory and Religion|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-91192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states may categorically ban religious observances, and attempt to sanction those who persist in displaying religious conviction. [[Disestablishmentarianism]] results from state withdrawal from an organization that was originally established under the state.

Religious markets are similar to other markets in that they are social creations. The exchanges that take place in a religious market are regulated by social factors. Elements of social interactions such as norms and morals influence the individual choices and preferences of the religious consumer. Therefore, elements of social interactions influence the types of religious goods offered to consumers in the marketplace and the changes in consumer demands over a span of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

According to [[W. Robertson Smith]], "The fear of the gods was a motive to enforce the laws of society which were also the laws of morality".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson Smith, W.: Religion of the Semites; with a new introduction by Robert A. Segal., New Brunswick, N.J. : Transaction Publishers, c2002.&lt;/ref&gt; People are taught that those who believe will gain rewards or avoid punishment in the afterlife, and non-believers will miss out on the rewards or receive punishment.

'''Translation''' is the communication of the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a [[source language (translation)|source-language]] text by means of an [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalent]] [[target language (translation)|target-language]] text.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Namit Bhatia, ed., 1992, pp. 1,051–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English language draws a [[terminology|terminological]] distinction (not all languages do) between ''translating'' (a written text) and ''interpreting'' (oral or sign-language communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of [[writing]] within a language community.

A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language [[word]]s, [[grammar]], or [[syntax]] into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such "spill-overs" have sometimes imported useful source-language [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s that have enriched target languages.  Translators, including early translators of [[sacred text]]s, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 1983, pp. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to [[machine translation|automate translation]] or to [[computer-assisted translation|mechanically aid the human translator]].&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Hutchins, ''Early Years in Machine Translation: Memoirs and Biographies of Pioneers'', Amsterdam, John Benjamins, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the rise of the [[Internet]] has fostered a [[world-wide market]] for [[translation services]] and has facilitated "[[language localization]]".&lt;ref&gt;M. Snell-Hornby, ''The Turns of Translation Studies: New Paradigms or Shifting Viewpoints?'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2006, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Rosetta Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|115px|left|[[Rosetta Stone]], a [[secular icon]] for the art of translation.&lt;ref&gt;"Rosetta Stone", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 5th ed., 1994, p. 2,361.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[English language|English]] word "translation" derives from the [[Latin]] word ''translatio'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vélez|first1=Fabio|title=Antes de Babel|pages=3–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from ''[[Wiktionary:trans#Latin|trans]]'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:fero#Latin|ferre]]'', "to carry" or "to bring" (''-latio'' in turn coming from ''latus'', the [[past participle]] of ''ferre'').  Thus ''translatio'' is "a carrying across" or "a bringing across":  in this case, of a text from one language to another.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germanic languages]] (except for modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and some [[Slavic languages]] have [[calque#Loan translation: translatio and traductio|calque]]d their words for the [[concept]] of "translation" on ''translatio''.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Romance languages]] and the remaining ''Slavic'' languages have derived their words for the concept of "translation" from an alternative Latin word, ''traductio'', itself derived from ''traducere'' ("to lead across" or "to bring across", from ''trans'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:duco#Latin|ducere]]'', "to lead" or "to bring").&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] term for "translation", {{lang|grc|μετάφρασις}} (''metaphrasis'', "a speaking across"), has supplied [[English language|English]] with "[[metaphrase]]" (a "[[literal translation|literal]]", or "word-for-word", translation)—as contrasted with "[[paraphrase]]" ("a saying in other words", from  {{lang|grc|παράφρασις}}, ''paraphrasis'').&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83" /&gt; "Metaphrase" corresponds, in one of the more recent terminologies, to "[[Translation#Equivalence|formal equivalence]]"; and "paraphrase", to "[[Translation#Equivalence|dynamic equivalence]]".&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, the concept of metaphrase—of "word-for-word translation"—is an [[Perfection|imperfect]] concept, because a given word in a given language often carries more than one meaning; and because a similar given meaning may often be represented in a given language by more than one word.  Nevertheless, "metaphrase" and "paraphrase" may be useful as ''ideal'' concepts that mark the extremes in the spectrum of possible approaches to translation.{{efn|"Ideal concepts" are useful as well in other fields, such as [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], which include the concepts of perfectly solid bodies, perfectly rigid bodies, perfectly plastic bodies, perfectly black bodies, perfect crystals, perfect fluids, and perfect gases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'' (first published in Polish in 1976 as ''O doskonałości''); English translation by [[Christopher Kasparek]] subsequently serialized in 1979–1981 in ''Dialectics and Humanism:  The Polish Philosophical Quarterly'', and reprinted in [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'', Warsaw University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theories==

===Western theory===
[[File:John Dryden by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|125px|[[John Dryden]]]]
Discussions of the theory and practice of translation reach back into [[ancient history|antiquity]] and show remarkable continuities. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] distinguished between ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation]]) and ''[[paraphrase]]''. This distinction was adopted by English [[poet]] and [[translator]] [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), who described translation as the judicious blending of these two modes of phrasing when selecting, in the target language, "counterparts," or [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]], for the expressions used in the source language:

{{blockquote|When [words] appear... literally graceful, it were an injury to the author that they should be changed. But since... what is beautiful in one [language] is often barbarous, nay sometimes nonsense, in another, it would be unreasonable to limit a translator to the narrow compass of his author's words: 'tis enough if he choose out some expression which does not vitiate the sense.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;}}

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Dryden cautioned, however, against the license of "imitation", i.e., of adapted translation: "When a painter copies from the life... he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments..."&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

This general formulation of the central concept of translation—[[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalence]]—is as adequate as any that has been proposed since [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]], who, in 1st-century-BCE [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], famously and literally cautioned against translating "word for word" ({{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}).&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

Despite occasional theoretical diversity, the actual ''practice'' of translation has hardly changed since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Except for some extreme [[metaphrase]]rs in the early [[Christian]] period and the [[Middle Ages]], and adapters in various periods (especially pre-Classical Rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]]—"[[literal translation|literal]]" where possible, [[paraphrase|paraphrastic]] where necessary—for the original [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and other crucial "values" (e.g., [[Style (fiction)|style]], [[verse form]], concordance with [[music]]al accompaniment or, in [[film]]s, with speech [[Manner of articulation|articulatory]] movements) as determined from context.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds 2.png|thumb|100px|[[Samuel Johnson]]]]
In general, translators have sought to preserve the [[Context (language use)|context]] itself by reproducing the original order of [[sememe]]s, and hence [[word order]]—when necessary, reinterpreting the actual [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, for example, by shifting from [[active voice|active]] to [[passive voice]], or ''vice versa''. The grammatical differences between "fixed-word-order" [[language]]s&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[analytic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]]) and "free-word-order" languages&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[synthetic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]]) have been no impediment in this regard.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  The particular [[syntax]] (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language. 
[[File:Martin Luther, 1529.jpg|thumb|left|110px|[[Martin Luther]]]]
When a target language has lacked [[terminology|terms]] that are found in a source language, translators have borrowed those terms, thereby enriching the target language. Thanks in great measure to the exchange of [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s between languages, and to their importation from other languages, there are few [[concept]]s that are "[[untranslatability|untranslatable]]" among the modern European languages.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  A greater problem, however, is translating terms relating to cultural concepts that have no equivalent in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of this are described in the article, [http://www.noproblem.no/translate.html "Translating the 17th of May into English and other horror stories"], retrieved 2010-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  For full comprehension, such situations require the provision of a [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]].

Generally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of [[metaphrase]] to [[paraphrase]] that may be used in translating among them. However, due to shifts in [[ecological niche]]s of words, a common [[etymology]] is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language. For example, the English ''actual'' should not be confused with the [[cognate]] French {{lang|fr|actuel}} ("present", "current"), the Polish {{lang|pl|aktualny}} ("present", "current," "topical", "timely", "feasible"),&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''aktuell'' ("topical", "presently of importance"), the Russian {{lang|ru|актуальный}} ("urgent", "topical") or the Dutch ''actueel'' ("current").

The translator's role as a bridge for "carrying across" values between cultures has been discussed at least since [[Terence]], the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an [[artist]].  The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as [[Cicero]]. [[John Dryden|Dryden]] observed that "Translation is a type of drawing after life..." Comparison of the translator with a [[musician]] or [[actor]] goes back at least to [[Samuel Johnson]]'s remark about [[Alexander Pope]] playing [[Homer]] on a [[flageolet]], while Homer himself used a [[bassoon]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;
[[File:Herder by Kügelgen.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Johann Gottfried Herder]]]]
If translation be an art, it is no easy one.  In the 13th century, [[Roger Bacon]] wrote that if a translation is to be true, the translator must know both [[language]]s, as well as the [[science]] that he is to translate; and finding that few translators did, he wanted to do away with translation and translators altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|125px|[[Ignacy Krasicki]]]]
The translator of the Bible into German, [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), is credited with being the first European to posit that one translates satisfactorily only toward his own language. L.G. Kelly states that since [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century, "it has been axiomatic" that one translates only toward his own language.&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Kelly, cited in Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding the demands on the translator is the fact that no [[dictionary]] or [[thesaurus]] can ever be a fully adequate guide in translating. The Scottish historian [[Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|Alexander Tytler]], in his ''Essay on the Principles of Translation'' (1790), emphasized that assiduous [[reading (activity)|reading]] is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including [[listening]] to the [[spoken language|''spoken'' language]], had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and [[grammar]]ian [[Onufry Kopczyński]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The translator's special role in society is described in a posthumous 1803 essay by "Poland's [[La Fontaine]]", the Roman Catholic [[Primate of Poland]], [[Poetry|poet]], [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]], [[Novelist|author]] of the first Polish novel, and translator from French and Greek, [[Ignacy Krasicki]]:

{{blockquote|[T]ranslation... is in fact an art both estimable and very difficult, and therefore is not the labor and portion of common minds; [it] should be [practiced] by those who are themselves capable of being actors, when they see greater use in translating the works of others than in their own works, and hold higher than their own glory the service that they render their country.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 87, from [[Ignacy Krasicki]], {{lang|pl|"O tłumaczeniu ksiąg"}} ("On Translating Books"), in {{lang|pl|Dzieła wierszem i prozą}} (Works in Verse and Prose), 1803, reprinted in [[Edward Balcerzan]], ed., {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other traditions===
Due to [[Western colonialism]] and cultural dominance in recent centuries, Western translation traditions have largely replaced other traditions. The Western traditions draw on both ancient and medieval traditions, and on more recent European innovations.

Though earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when dealing with their products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-Western or pre-Western environments. Also, though heavily influenced by Western traditions and practiced by translators taught in Western-style educational systems, Chinese and related translation traditions retain some theories and philosophies unique to the Chinese tradition.

==== Near East ====
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
Traditions of translating material among the languages of ancient [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Assyria]] ([[Syriac language]]), [[Anatolia]], and [[Israel]] ([[Hebrew language]]) go back several millennia.  There exist partial translations of the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (c. 2000 BCE) into [[Southwest Asia]]n languages of the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a [[bilingual]] document is the 1274 BCE [[Treaty of Kadesh]] between the [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Hittite Empire|Hittie empire]]s.

====Asia====
{{Further|Chinese translation theory}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] by [[Kumārajīva]]:  world's oldest known dated printed book (868 CE)]]

There is a separate tradition of translation in [[South Asia|South]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]] (primarily of texts from the [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] civilizations), connected especially with the rendering of religious, particularly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], texts and with the governance of the Chinese empire. Classical Indian translation is characterized by loose adaptation, rather than the closer translation more commonly found in Europe; and [[Chinese translation theory]] identifies various criteria and limitations in translation.

In the East Asian sphere of Chinese cultural influence, more important than translation ''per se'' has been the use and reading of Chinese texts, which also had substantial influence on the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, with substantial [[Sino-Xenic vocabularies|borrowings of Chinese vocabulary]] and writing system. Notable is the Japanese [[kanbun]], a system for [[Gloss (annotation)|glossing]] Chinese texts for Japanese speakers.

Though Indianized states in [[Southeast Asia]] often translated [[Sanskrit]] material into the local languages, the literate elites and scribes more commonly used Sanskrit as their primary language of culture and government.
[[File:VOA Perry Link.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Perry Link]]]]
Some special aspects of translating from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are illustrated in [[Perry Link]]'s discussion of translating the work of the [[Tang Dynasty]] poet [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (699–759 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry" (review of [[Eliot Weinberger]], with an afterword by [[Octavio Paz]], ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)'', New Directions; and [[Eliot Weinberger]], ''The Ghosts of Birds'', New Directions), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Some of the art of classical [[Chinese poetry]] [writes Link] must simply be set aside as [[untranslatability|untranslatable]].  The internal structure of [[Chinese characters]] has a beauty of its own, and the [[calligraphy]] in which classical poems were written is another important but untranslatable dimension.  Since Chinese characters do not vary in length, and because there are exactly five characters per line in a poem like [the one that [[Eliot Weinberger]] discusses in ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)''], another untranslatable feature is that the written result, hung on a wall, presents a rectangle.  Translators into languages whose word lengths vary can reproduce such an effect only at the risk of fatal awkwardness....

Another imponderable is how to imitate the 1-2, 1-2-3 [[rhythm]] in which five-[[syllable]] lines in classical Chinese poems normally are read.  Chinese characters are pronounced in one syllable apiece, so producing such rhythms in Chinese is not hard and the results are unobtrusive; but any imitation in a Western language is almost inevitably stilted and distracting.  Even less translatable are the patterns of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] arrangement in classical Chinese poetry.  Each syllable (character) belongs to one of two categories determined by the [[pitch contour]] in which it is read; in a classical Chinese poem the patterns of alternation of the two categories exhibit [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and mirroring.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once the [[untranslatability|untranslatables]] have been set aside, the problems for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two:  What does the translator think the poetic line says?  And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]?  Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate."  Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit [[dilemma]].  At the [[literal translation|literalist]] extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about the language of the original Chinese poem.  "The dissection, though," writes Link, "normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the [[scalpel]] of an [[anatomy]] instructor does to the life of a frog."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"/&gt;

Chinese characters, in avoiding [[grammar|grammatical]] specificity, offer advantages to poets (and, simultaneously, challenges to poetry translators) that are associated primarily with absences of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]].&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the norm in classical Chinese poetry, and common even in modern Chinese prose, to omit [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]]; the reader or listener infers a subject.  Some Western languages, however, ask by grammatical rule that subjects always be stated.  Most of the translators cited in Eliot Weinberger's ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]]'' supply a subject.  Weinberger points out, however, that when an "I" as a subject is inserted, a "controlling individual mind of the poet" enters and destroys the effect of the Chinese line.  Without a subject, he writes, "the experience becomes both universal and immediate to the reader."  Another approach to the subjectlessness is to use the target language's [[passive voice]]; but this again particularizes the experience too much.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

[[Noun]]s have no [[Grammatical number|number]] in Chinese.  "If," writes Link, "you want to talk in Chinese about one rose, you may, but then you use a "[[measure word]]" to say "one blossom-of roseness."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Chinese [[verb]]s are [[grammatical tense|tense]]-less:  there are several ways to specify when something happened or will happen, but [[verb tense]] is not one of them.  For poets, this creates the great advantage of [[ambiguity]].  According to Link, Weinberger's insight about subjectlessness—that it produces an effect "both universal and immediate"—applies to timelessness as well.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Link proposes a kind of uncertainty principle that may be applicable not only to translation from the Chinese language, but to all translation:

{{blockquote|Dilemmas about translation do not have definitive right answers (although there can be unambiguously wrong ones if misreadings of the original are involved).  Any translation (except machine translation, a different case) must pass through the mind of a translator, and that mind inevitably contains its own store of perceptions, memories, and values.

[[Eliot Weinberger|Weinberger]] [...] pushes this insight further when he writes that "every reading of every poem, regardless of language, is an act of translation:  translation into the reader's intellectual and emotional life."  Then he goes still further:  because a reader's mental life shifts over time, there is a sense in which "the same poem cannot be read twice."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;}}

====Islamic world====
Translation of material into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] expanded after the creation of [[Arabic script]] in the 5th century, and gained great importance with the rise of [[Islam]] and Islamic empires. Arab translation initially focused primarily on politics, rendering Persian, Greek, even Chinese and Indic diplomatic materials into Arabic. It later focused on translating classical Greek and Persian works, as well as some Chinese and Indian texts, into Arabic for scholarly study at major Islamic learning centers, such as the [[Madrasah of Al-Karaouine|Al-Karaouine]] ([[Fes]], [[Morocco]]), [[Al-Azhar Madrasah|Al-Azhar]] ([[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]), and the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]]. In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions.

Arabic translation efforts and techniques are important to Western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges.  Especially after the [[Renaissance]], Europeans began more intensive study of Arabic and Persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of Arab and oriental origins.  Arabic and, to a lesser degree, Persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized Western traditions, which in time would overtake the Islamic and oriental traditions.

In the 19th century, after the [[Middle East]]'s [[Islam]]ic clerics and copyists
{{blockquote|had conceded defeat in their centuries-old battle to contain the corrupting effects of the [[printing press]], [an] explosion in publishing... ensued.  Along with expanding secular education, printing transformed an overwhelmingly illiterate society into a partly literate one.

In the past, the [[sheikh]]s and the government had exercised a monopoly over knowledge.  Now an expanding elite benefitted from a stream of information on virtually anything that interested them.  Between 1880 and 1908... more than six hundred newspapers and periodicals were founded in Egypt alone.

The most prominent among them was ''al-Muqtataf''...  [It] was the popular expression of a '''translation movement''' that had begun earlier in the century with military and medical manuals and highlights from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] canon.  ([[Montesquieu]]'s ''Considerations on the Romans'' and [[Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' had been favorites.)&lt;ref name = debellaigue77&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950'', University of Chicago Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translator who contributed mightily to the advance of the Islamic Enlightenment was the Egyptian cleric Rifaa al-Tahtawi (1801–73), who had spent five years in Paris in the late 1820s, teaching religion to Muslim students.  After returning to Cairo with the encouragement of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1769–1849), the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] viceroy of Egypt, al–Tahtawi became head of the new school of languages and embarked on an intellectual revolution by initiating a program to translate some two thousand European and Turkish volumes, ranging from ancient texts on geography and geometry to [[Voltaire]]'s biography of [[Peter the Great]], along with the ''[[Marseillaise]]'' and the entire ''[[Code Napoléon]]''.  This was the biggest, most meaningful importation of foreign thought into Arabic since [[Abbasid]] times (750–1258).&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|In France al-Tahtawi had been struck by the way the [[French language|French]] language... was constantly renewing itself to fit modern ways of living.  Yet [[Arabic]] has its own sources of reinvention.  The root system that Arabic shares with other [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] tongues such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is capable of expanding the meanings of words using structured [[consonant]]al variations:  the word for airplane, for example, has the same root as the word for bird.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

[[File:Muhammad Abduh (trimmed).JPG|thumb|140px|[[Muhammad Abduh]]]]
The movement to translate English and European texts transformed the Arabic and [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman]] [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages, and new words, simplified [[syntax]], and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions.  Educated Arabs and Turks in the new professions and the modernized [[civil service]] expressed [[skepticism]], writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today....  No longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools, interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness.  It had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world."  One of the [[neologisms]] that, in a way, came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was ''"darwiniya"'', or "[[Darwinism]]".&lt;ref name = debellaigue77/&gt;

One of the most influential liberal Islamic thinkers of the time was [[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905), Egypt's senior judicial authority—its chief [[mufti]]—at the turn of the 20th century and an admirer of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] who in 1903 visited Darwin's exponent [[Herbert Spencer]] at his home in [[Brighton]].  Spencer's view of [[social organism|society as an organism]] with its own laws of evolution paralleled Abduh's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when Britain and France divided up the Middle East's countries, apart from Turkey, between them, pursuant to the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]]—in violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar Arab autonomy—there came an immediate reaction:  the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] emerged in Egypt, the [[House of Saud]] took over the [[Hijaz]], and regimes led by army officers came to power in [[Iran]] and Turkey.  "[B]oth illiberal currents of the modern Middle East," writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue|de Bellaigue]], "Islamism and militarism, received a major impetus from Western [[Imperialism|empire-builders]]."  As often happens in countries undergoing social crisis, the aspirations of the Muslim world's translators and modernizers, such as Muhammad Abduh, largely had to yield to retrograde currents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fidelity and transparency&lt;!--linked from 'Friedrich Schleiermacher'--&gt;==
[[File:John Dryden by John Michael Wright, 1668 (detail), National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|right|175px|[[John Dryden|Dryden]]]]
[[Fidelity]] (or "faithfulness") and felicity&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]]), dual ideals in translation, are often (though not always) at odds. A 17th-century French critic coined the phrase "{{lang|fr|les belles infidèles}}" to suggest that translations, like women, can be either faithful or beautiful, but not both.{{efn|French philosopher and writer [[Gilles Ménage]] (1613-92) commented on translations by humanist Perrot Nicolas d'Ablancourt (1606-64):  "They remind me of a woman whom I greatly loved in [[Tours]], who was beautiful but unfaithful."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Amparo Hurtado Albir, ''La notion de fidélité en traduction'' (The Idea of Fidelity in Translation), Paris, Didier Érudition, 1990, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Fidelity]] is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the [[source text]], without distortion.[[Transparency (linguistic)|Transparency]] is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language, and conforms to its grammar, syntax and idiom. [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700) wrote in his preface to the translation anthology ''Sylvae'':
{{blockquote|Where I have taken away some of [the original authors'] Expressions, and cut them shorter, it may possibly be on this consideration, that what was beautiful in the Greek or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English; and where I have enlarg'd them, I desire the false Criticks would not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc'd from him; or at least, if both those considerations should fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if he were living, and an Englishman, they are such as he wou'd probably have written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dryden|first1=John|title=Preface to Sylvae|url=http://www.bartleby.com/204/180.html|website=Bartelby.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translation that meets the criterion of fidelity (faithfulness) is said to be "faithful"; a translation that meets the criterion of transparency, "[[idiomatic]]".  Depending on the given translation, the two qualities may not be mutually exclusive.  The criteria for judging the [[fidelity]] of a translation vary according to the subject, type and use of the text, its literary qualities, its social or historical context, etc.  The criteria for judging the [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] of a translation appear more straightforward: an unidiomatic translation "sounds wrong"; and, in the extreme case of [[literal translation|word-for-word translations]] generated by many [[machine translation|machine-translation]] systems, often results in patent nonsense.
[[File:Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]]]  
Nevertheless, in certain contexts a translator may consciously seek to produce a [[literal translation]]. Translators of [[literary]], [[religious]], or [[historic]] texts often adhere as closely as possible to the source text, stretching the limits of the target language to produce an unidiomatic text.  Also, a translator may adopt expressions from the source language in order to provide "local color".
[[File:Lawrence Venuti.jpeg|thumb|90px|[[Lawrence Venuti|Venuti]]]]
While current Western translation practice is dominated by the dual concepts of "fidelity" and "transparency", this has not always been the case.  There have been periods, especially in pre-Classical Rome and in the 18th century, when many translators stepped beyond the bounds of translation proper into the realm of ''[[adaptation]]''.  [[Adapted translation]] retains currency in some non-Western traditions. The [[India]]n epic, the ''[[Ramayana]]'', appears in many versions in the various [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], and the stories are different in each.  Similar examples are to be found in [[medieval Christianity|medieval Christian]] literature, which adjusted the text to local customs and mores.

Many non-transparent-translation theories draw on concepts from [[German Romanticism]], the most obvious influence being the German theologian and philosopher [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]. In his seminal lecture "On the Different Methods of Translation" (1813) he distinguished between translation methods that move "the writer toward [the reader]", i.e., [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], and those that move the "reader toward [the author]", i.e., an extreme [[fidelity]] to the foreignness of the [[source text]]. Schleiermacher favored the latter approach; he was motivated, however, not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign, as by a nationalist desire to oppose France's cultural domination and to promote [[German literature]].

In recent decades, prominent advocates of such "non-transparent" translation have included the French scholar [[Antoine Berman]], who identified twelve deforming tendencies inherent in most prose translations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoine Berman]], ''L'épreuve de l'étranger'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American theorist [[Lawrence Venuti]], who has called on translators to apply "foreignizing" rather than domesticating translation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Venuti]], "Call to Action", in ''The Translator's Invisibility'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalence===
{{main|Dynamic and formal equivalence}}
The question of [[fidelity]] vs. [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] has also been formulated in terms of, respectively, "''formal'' equivalence" and "''dynamic'' [or ''functional''] equivalence" – expressions associated with the translator [[Eugene Nida]] and originally coined to describe ways of translating the ''[[Bible]]''; but the two approaches are applicable to any translation.  "Formal equivalence" corresponds to "[[metaphrase]]", and "dynamic equivalence" to "[[paraphrase]]".  "Formal equivalence" (sought via [[literal translation|"literal" translation]]) attempts to render the text literally, or "word for word" (the latter expression being itself a word-for-word rendering of the [[classical Latin]] {{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}) – if necessary, at the expense of features natural to the target language.  By contrast, "dynamic equivalence" (or "''functional'' equivalence") conveys the essential thoughts expressed in a source text—if necessary, at the expense of [[literal translation|literality]], original [[sememe]] and [[word order]], the source text's active vs. passive [[voice (grammar)|voice]], etc. 
 
There is, however, no sharp boundary between formal and functional equivalence. On the contrary, they represent a spectrum of translation approaches. Each is used at various times and in various contexts by the same translator, and at various points within the same text – sometimes simultaneously. Competent translation entails the judicious blending of formal and functional [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 83-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common pitfalls in translation, especially when practiced by inexperienced translators, involve false equivalents such as "[[false friend]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog-english.jrlanguage.com/overcome-5-challenges-of-english-to-spanish-translation/|title=How to Overcome These 5 Challenges of English to Spanish Translation|date=23 June 2017|publisher=Jr Language|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[false cognate]]s.

===Back-translation===
A "back-translation" is a translation of a translated text back into the language of the original text, made without reference to the original text. 
Comparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation, much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation.  But the results of such reverse-translation operations, while useful as approximate checks, are not always precisely reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |title=Back Translation: Same questions – different continent |journal=Communicate |issue=Winter 2004 |page=5 |last=Crystal |first=Scott |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520035802/http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because [[linguistic]] symbols ([[word]]s) are often [[ambiguous]], whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal.  In the context of [[machine translation]], a back-translation is also called a "round-trip translation."  When translations are produced of material used in medical [[clinical trial]]s, such as [[informed consent|informed-consent forms]], a back-translation is often required by the [[Ethics Committee (European Union)|ethics committee]] or [[institutional review board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |title=Back Translation for Quality Control of Informed Consent Forms |journal=Journal of Clinical Research Best Practices |format=PDF |accessdate=1 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505141653/http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mark Twain, Brady-Handy photo portrait, Feb 7, 1871, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Mark Twain]], back-translator]]
[[Mark Twain]] provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a French translation of his [[short story]], "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]".  He published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his English-language original, the French translation, and a "Private History of the 'Jumping Frog' Story". The latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that Twain stated had appeared, unattributed to Twain, in a Professor Sidgwick's ''Greek Prose Composition'' (p.&amp;nbsp;116) under the title, "The Athenian and the Frog"; the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] precursor to Twain's "Jumping Frog" story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ld_3LPm8FKkC&amp;dq=french+The+Jumping+Frog&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4trjrMcmq3&amp;sig=P23kCS1s9qiu-1hdnJSzWWKvIJc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA66,M1 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County|The Jumping Frog]]: In English, Then in French, and Then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil'', illustrated by F. Strothman, New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, MCMIII [1903&amp;#93;].&lt;/ref&gt;

When a document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|The Saragossa Manuscript]]'' by the Polish aristocrat [[Jan Potocki]] (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by [[Edmund Chojecki]] in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost. French-language versions of the complete ''Saragossa Manuscript'' have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki's Polish version.&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', pp. 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many works by the influential [[classical antiquity|Classical]] physician [[Galen]] survive only in medieval [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation. Some survive only in [[Renaissance Latin]] translations from the Arabic, thus at a second remove from the original. To better understand Galen, scholars have attempted back-translation of such works in order to reconstruct the original [[ancient Greek|Greek]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

When historians suspect that a document is actually a translation from another language, back-translation into that hypothetical original language can provide supporting evidence by showing that such characteristics as [[idiom]]s, [[pun]]s, peculiar [[grammar|grammatical]] structures, etc., are in fact derived from the original language.  For example, the known text of the ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' folk tales is in [[High German]] but contains puns that work only when back-translated to [[Low German]].  This seems clear evidence that these tales (or at least large portions of them) were originally written in Low German and translated into High German by an over-metaphrastic translator.

Supporters of [[Aramaic primacy]]—of the view that the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]] or its sources were originally written in the [[Aramaic language]]—seek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of the New Testament make much better sense when back-translated to [[Aramaic]]: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek.  Due to similar indications, it is believed that the 2nd century Gnostic [[Gospel of Judas]], which survives only in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], was originally written in [[Greek language|Greek]].

[[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), the dominant English-language literary figure of his age, illustrates, in his use of back-translation, translators' influence on the evolution of languages and literary styles.  Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in [[preposition]]s because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/data/B_HIST_EU.html Gilman, E.

Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language.

== Translators ==
Competent translators show the following attributes:
*a ''very good'' knowledge of the language, written and spoken, ''from which'' they are translating (the [[Source language (translation)|source language]]);
*an ''excellent'' command of the language ''into which'' they are translating (the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]);
*familiarity with the subject matter of the text being translated;
*a profound understanding of the [[etymological]] and [[idiomatic]] correlates between the two languages, including [[Register (sociolinguistics)|sociolinguistic register]] when appropriate; and
*a finely tuned sense of when to ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation|"translate literally]]") and when to ''[[paraphrase]]'', so as to assure true rather than spurious ''[[Translation#Equivalence|equivalents]]'' between the source- and target-language texts.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXI, nos. 2–3 (1986), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

A competent translator is not only [[bilingual]] but [[bicultural]].  A [[language]] is not merely a collection of [[word]]s and of rules of [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] for generating [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, but also a vast interconnecting system of [[connotation]]s and [[culture|cultural]] references whose mastery, writes [[linguist]] [[Mario Pei]], "comes close to being a lifetime job."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Pei]], ''The Story of Language'', p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator—after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures—may require a minimum of ten years' experience.  Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"/&gt;

The translator's role in relation to a text has been compared to that of an artist, e.g., a musician or actor, who interprets a work of art.  Translation, like other human activities,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], "Can We Ever Master King Lear?", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

IX.&lt;/ref&gt; advised his niece and [[Polish language|Polish]] translator [[Aniela Zagórska]]:  "[D]on't trouble to be too scrupulous...  I may tell you (in French) that in my opinion ''il vaut mieux interpréter que traduire'' [it is better to interpret than to translate]....  ''Il s'agit donc de trouver les équivalents.  Et là, ma chère, je vous prie laissez vous guider plutôt par votre tempérament que par une conscience sévère....'' [It is, then, a question of finding the equivalent expressions.  And there, my dear, I beg you to let yourself be guided more by your temperament than by a strict conscience....]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad advised another translator that the prime requisite for a good translation is that it be "idiomatic".  "For in the [[idiom]] is the ''clearness'' of a language and the language's force and its picturesqueness—by which last I mean the picture-producing power of arranged words."&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad thought [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]'s English translation of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''À la recherche du temps perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''—or, in Scott Moncrieff's rendering, ''Remembrance of Things Past'') to be preferable to the French original.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaiser, "A Hero of Translation" (a review of Jean Findlay, ''Chasing Lost Time:  The Life of [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]:  Soldier, Spy, and Translator''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[Translation#Poetry|Poetry]]", below, for a similar observation concerning the occasional superiority of the translation over the original.}}

The necessity of making [[choice]]s, and therefore of interpretation, in translating{{efn|[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]] writes that "translation always involves interpretation, and [requires] every translator... to think as deeply as humanly possible about each verbal, poetic, and interpretative [[choice]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]], "A Doggish Translation" (review of ''The Poems of [[Hesiod]]:  Theogony, Works and Days, and The Shield of Herakles'', translated from the Greek by [[Barry B. Powell]], [[University of California Press]], 2017, 184 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 1 (18 January 2018), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (and in other fields of human endeavor) stems from the [[ambiguity]] that subjectively pervades the [[universe]].  Part of the ambiguity, for a translator, involves the structure of human [[language]]. [[Psychology|Psychologist]] and [[neural science|neural scientist]] [[Gary Marcus]] notes that "virtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways.  Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of linguistic ambiguity is the "pronoun disambiguation problem" ("PDP"):  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such disambiguation is not infallible by a human, either.

Ambiguity is a concern to both translators and, as the writings of poet and literary critic [[William Empson]] have demonstrated, to [[literary criticism|literary critics]].  Ambiguity may be desirable, indeed essential, in [[poetry]] and [[diplomacy]]; it can be more problematic in ordinary [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bromwich]], "In Praise of Ambiguity" (a review of [[Michael Wood (academic)|Michael Wood]], ''On Empson'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''), vol. LXIV, no. 16 (26 October 2017), pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A translator is faced with two contradictory tasks:  when translating, he must strive for [[omniscience]]; when reviewing his translation, he must assume (the naive reader's) [[ignorance]]. 

A translator may render only parts of the original text, provided he indicates that this is what he is doing.  But a translator should not assume the role of [[Censorship|censor]] and surreptitiously delete or [[bowdlerize]] passages merely to please a political or moral interest.&lt;ref name="Billiani, Francesca 2001"&gt;Billiani, Francesca (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Translating has served as a school of writing for many an author, much as the copying of masterworks of [[painting]] has schooled many a novice painter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anka Muhlstein]], "Painters and Writers:  When Something New Happens", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 1 (January 19, 2017), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  A translator who can competently render an author's thoughts into the translator's own language, should certainly be able to adequately render, in his own language, any thoughts of his own.  Translating (like [[analytic philosophy]]) compels precise analysis of [[language|language element]]s and of their usage.  In 1946 the poet [[Ezra Pound]], then at [[St. Elizabeth's Hospital]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], advised a visitor, the 18-year-old beginning poet [[W.S. Merwin]]:  "The work of translation is the best teacher you'll ever have."&lt;ref&gt;''[[W.S. Merwin: To Plant a Tree]]'':  one-hour documentary shown on [[PBS]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Elsewhere Merwin recalls Pound saying:  "[A]t your age you don't have anything to write about.  You may think you do, but you don't.  So get to work translating.  The [[Occitan language|Provençal]] is the real source...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S. Merlin'', edited by [[Michael Wiegers]], Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Merwin, translator-poet who took Pound's advice to heart, writes of translation as an "impossible, unfinishable" art.&lt;ref&gt;Merwin's introduction to his 2013 ''Selected Translations'', quoted by [[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S. Merlin'', edited by [[Michael Wiegers]], Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translators, including monks who spread [[Buddhist]] texts in [[East Asia]], and the early modern European translators of the [[Bible]], in the course of their work have shaped the very [[language]]s into which they have translated. They have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between [[culture]]s; and along with ideas, they have imported from the source languages, into their own languages, [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s of [[grammar|grammatical structures]], [[idiom]]s, and [[vocabulary]].

===Interpreting===

{{Main|Interpreting}}
[[Interpreting]], or "interpretation," is the facilitation of [[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]] [[communication]], either simultaneously or consecutively, between two, or among three or more, speakers who are not speaking, or signing, the same language.  The term "interpreting," rather than "interpretation," is preferentially used for this activity by [[English language|Anglophone]] translators, to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word "[[wikt:interpret|interpretation]]."  Unlike English, many languages do not employ two separate words to denote the activities of [[writing|written]] and live-communication ([[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]]) translators.{{efn|For example, in [[Polish language|Polish]], a "translation" is "{{lang|pl|przekład}}" or "{{lang|pl|tłumaczenie}}." Both "translator" and "interpreter" are "{{lang|pl|tłumacz}}." For a time in the 18th century, however, for "translator," some writers used a word, "{{lang|pl|przekładowca}}," that is no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Balcerzan]], {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), 1977, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Even English does not always make the distinction, frequently using "translating" as a synonym for "interpreting."

Interpreters have sometimes played crucial roles in [[History of the world|history]].  A prime example is [[La Malinche]], also known as ''Malintzin'', ''Malinalli'' and ''Doña Marina'', an early-16th-century [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] woman from the Mexican [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]].  As a child she had been sold or given to [[Maya peoples|Maya]] slave-traders from Xicalango, and thus had become bilingual. Subsequently, given along with other women to the invading Spaniards, she became instrumental in the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of [[Mexico]], acting as interpreter, adviser, intermediary and lover to [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortes and the Fall of Old Mexico'', New York, Simon and Schuster, 1993, pp. 171-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly three centuries later, in the [[United States]], a comparable role as interpreter was played for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804–6 by [[Sacagawea]]. As a child, the [[Lemhi Shoshone]] woman had been kidnapped by [[Hidatsa]] Indians and thus had become bilingual.  Sacagawea facilitated the expedition's traverse of the [[North American continent]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sacagawea", ''[[The Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, volume 24, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sworn translation===
[[Translating for legal equivalence|Sworn translation]], also called "certified translation," aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages. It is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations. Some countries recognize declared competence. Others require the translator to be an official state appointee. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, translators must be accredited by certain translation institutes or associations in order to be able to carry out certified translations.

===Telephone===
Many commercial services exist that will interpret spoken language via telephone.  There is also at least one custom-built mobile device that does the same thing. The device connects users to human interpreters who can translate between English and 180 other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/06/27/186525030/translation-please-hand-held-device-bridges-language-gap |title=Translation, Please: Hand-Held Device Bridges Language Gap |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations. In view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations, human translation remains the most reliable, most accurate form of translation available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/15582327?story_id=15582327&amp;source=hptextfeature | work=The Economist | title=The many voices of the web | date=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent emergence of translation [[crowdsourcing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Graham |first=Paul |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/04/mechanical-turkish-ackuna |title=How Ackuna wants to fix language translation by crowdsourcing it &amp;#124; Wired UK |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517232045/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/04/mechanical-turkish-ackuna |archive-date=2012-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.benzinga.com/press-releases/11/02/p843476/translation-services-usas-crowdsourcing-translator-ackuna-com-raises-th |title=Translation Services USA's Crowdsourcing Translator, Ackuna.com, Raises the Bar for More Accurate Machine Translations |publisher=Benzinga |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Translation memory|translation-memory]] techniques, and [[internet]] applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/346412 |title=Translation Cloud Application for Facebook Releases Version 2.0 |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation agencies have been able to provide on-demand human-translation services to [[Small and medium businesses|business]]es, individuals, and enterprises.

Babel Fish]], web-based human translation has been gaining popularity by providing relatively fast, accurate translation of business communications, legal documents, medical records, and [[software localization]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://venturebeat.com/2010/03/26/speaklike-offers-human-powered-translation-for-blogs/ |title = Speaklike offers human-powered translation for blogs |website =  VentureBeat |last= Boutin|first = Paul|date = 26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based human translation also appeals to private website users and bloggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/11/AR2010011100701.html | work=The Washington Post | title=MyGengo Is Mechanical Turk For Translations | first=Serkan | last=Toto | date=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contents of websites are translatable but urls of websites are not translatable into other languages.

===Computer assist===
{{Main|Computer-assisted translation}}
Computer-assisted translation (CAT), also called "computer-aided translation," "machine-aided human translation" (MAHT) and "interactive translation," is a form of translation wherein a human translator creates a [[target text]] with the assistance of a computer program. The machine supports a human translator.

Computer-assisted translation can include standard [[dictionary]] and grammar software. The term, however, normally refers to a range of specialized programs available to the translator, including [[translation memory|translation-memory]], [[terminology|terminology-management]], [[concordancer|concordance]], and alignment programs.

These tools speed up and facilitate human translation, but they do not provide translation.  The latter is a function of tools known broadly as machine translation.

==Machine translation==
{{Main|Machine translation}}
Machine translation (MT) is a process whereby a computer program analyzes a [[source text]] and, in principle, produces a target text without human intervention. In reality, however, machine translation typically does involve human intervention, in the form of pre-editing and [[post-editing]].&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;See the [https://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/ annually performed NIST tests since 2001] and [[Bilingual Evaluation Understudy]]&lt;/ref&gt;  With proper [[terminology|terminology work]], with preparation of the [[source text]] for machine translation (pre-editing), and with reworking of the machine translation by a human translator (post-editing), commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results, especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a [[translation memory|translation-memory]] or [[Globalization Management System|globalization-management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Unedited machine translation is publicly available through tools on the [[Internet]] such as [[Google Translate]], [[Babel Fish (website)|Babel Fish]], [[Babylon translator|Babylon]], and [[StarDict]]. These produce rough translations that, under favorable circumstances, "give the gist" of the source text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/why-translation-services-are-more-beneficial-than-machined-translation-programs|title=Why Professional Translators Are More Beneficial Than Google Translate|last=Choquette|first=Brandon|date=January 2016|journal=Interpreter and Translators, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the Internet, translation software can help non-native-speaking individuals understand web pages published in other languages. Whole-page-translation tools are of limited utility, however, since they offer only a limited potential understanding of the original author's intent and context; translated pages tend to be more erroneously humorous and confusing than enlightening.

Interactive translations with [[Pop-up ad|pop-up windows]] are becoming more popular. These tools show one or more possible equivalents for each word or phrase. Human operators merely need to select the likeliest equivalent as the mouse glides over the foreign-language text. Possible equivalents can be grouped by pronunciation.  Also, companies such as [[Ectaco]] produce pocket devices that provide machine translations.
[[File:Claude Piron.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Claude Piron]]]]
Relying exclusively on unedited machine translation, however, ignores the fact that communication in [[natural language|human language]] is [[wikt:context|context]]-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.{{efn|J.M. Cohen observes: "Scientific translation is the aim of an age that would reduce all activities to [[Technology|techniques]]. It is impossible however to imagine a literary-translation machine less complex than the human brain itself, with all its knowledge, reading, and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Claude Piron]] writes that machine translation, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] in the [[source text]], which the [[grammatical]] and [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] exigencies of the target language require to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Piron]], ''Le défi des langues'' (The Language Challenge), Paris, L'Harmattan, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing necessary in order to provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be [[garbage in garbage out|meaningless]].&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;

The weaknesses of pure [[machine translation]], unaided by human expertise, are [[Logology (science of science)#Artificial intelligence|those of artificial intelligence itself]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish [[artificial intelligence]] from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Translator Mark Polizzotti holds that machine translation, by [[Google Translate]] and the like, is unlikely to threaten human translators anytime soon, because machines will never grasp nuance and [[connotation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Wilson, Emily]], "The Pleasures of Translation" (review of Mark Polizzotti, ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', MIT Press, 2018, 182 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 9 (24 May 2018), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary translation==
Translation of [[literature|literary works]] ([[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[theatre|plays]], [[poetry|poems]], etc.) is considered a literary pursuit in its own right. Notable in [[Canadian literature]] ''specifically'' as translators are figures such as [[Sheila Fischman]], [[Robert Dickson (writer)|Robert Dickson]], and [[Linda Gaboriau]]; and the Canadian [[Governor General's Awards]] annually present prizes for the best English-to-French and French-to-English literary translations.

Other writers, among many who have made a name for themselves as literary translators, include [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Robert Stiller]], [[Lydia Davis]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Achy Obejas]], and [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].

In the 2010s a substantial gender imbalance was noted in literary translation into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/dispatches/article/where-are-the-women-in-translation|title=Where Are the Women in Translation?|last=Anderson|first=Alison|date=May 14, 2013|website=Words Without Borders|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with far more male writers being translated than women writers. In 2014 Meytal Radzinski launched the ''Women in Translation'' campaign to address this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://literarytranslators.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/women-in-translation-an-interview-witth-meytal-radzinski/|title=Women in Translation: An Interview with Meytal Radzinski|date=25 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/tags-bookseller/meytal-radzinski|title=Meytal Radzinski - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblibio.blogspot.com/2018/07/exclusion-is-choice-bias-in-best-of.html|title=Biblibio: Exclusion is a choice - Bias in "Best of" lists|first=Meytal|last=Radzinski|date=3 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first important translation in the West was that of the [[Septuagint]], a collection of [[Jew]]ish Scriptures translated into early [[Koine Greek]] in [[Alexandria]] between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE. The dispersed [[Jew]]s had forgotten their ancestral language and needed Greek versions (translations) of their Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], [[Latin]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the western learned world. The 9th-century [[Alfred the Great]], king of [[Wessex]] in [[England]], was far ahead of his time in commissioning [[vernacular]] [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] translations of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' and [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]''. Meanwhile, the [[Christian Church]] frowned on even partial adaptations of [[St. Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate Bible|Vulgate]]'' of c. 384 CE,&lt;ref&gt;J.M Cohen, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the standard [[Latin]] ''[[Bible]]''.

In [[Asia]], the spread of [[Buddhism]] led to large-scale ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years. The [[Tangut Empire]] was especially efficient in such efforts; exploiting the then newly invented [[block printing]], and with the full support of the government (contemporary sources describe the Emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort, alongside sages of various nationalities), the Tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the [[China|Chinese]] centuries to render.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The [[Arabs]] undertook large-scale efforts at translation.  Having conquered the Greek world, they made [[Arabic]] versions of its philosophical and scientific works.  During the [[Middle Ages]], translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Cohen13"&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a ''Schola Traductorum'' (School of Translation) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].  There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions.  Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European [[Scholasticism]], and thus European science and culture.
[[File:Chaucer Hoccleve.png|thumb|170px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]]]
The broad historic trends in Western translation practice may be illustrated on the example of translation into the [[English language]].

The first fine translations into English were made in the 14th century by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who adapted from the [[Italian language|Italian]] of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in his own ''[[Knight's Tale]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''; began a translation of the [[French-language]] ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''; and completed a translation of [[Boethius]] from the [[Latin]]. Chaucer founded an English [[poetry|poetic]] tradition on ''[[Literary adaptation|adaptations]]'' and translations from those earlier-established [[literary language]]s.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The first great English translation was the ''[[Wycliffe Bible]]'' (c. 1382), which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped English [[prose]]. Only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte Darthur]]''—an adaptation of [[Arthurian romance]]s so free that it can, in fact, hardly be called a true translation. The first great [[Tudor period|Tudor]] translations are, accordingly, the ''[[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale New Testament]]'' (1525), which influenced the ''[[Authorized Version]]'' (1611), and [[Lord Berners]]' version of [[Jean Froissart]]'s ''Chronicles'' (1523–25).&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Marsilio Ficino at the Duomo Firence 2.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Marsilio Ficino]]]]
Meanwhile, in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], a new period in the history of translation had opened in [[Florence]] with the arrival, at the court of [[Cosimo de' Medici]], of the [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Georgius Gemistus Pletho]] shortly before the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the Turks (1453). A Latin translation of [[Plato]]'s works was undertaken by [[Marsilio Ficino]]. This and [[Erasmus]]' Latin edition of the ''[[New Testament]]'' led to a new attitude to translation. For the first time, readers demanded rigor of rendering, as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

Non-scholarly literature, however, continued to rely on ''adaptation''. [[France]]'s ''[[Pléiade]]'', [[England]]'s [[Tudor period|Tudor]] poets, and the [[Elizabethan]] translators adapted themes by [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Petrarch]] and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created by the rise of a [[middle class]] and the development of [[printing]], with works such as the original authors ''would have written'', had they been writing in England in that day.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The [[Elizabethan]] period of translation saw considerable progress beyond mere [[paraphrase]] toward an ideal of [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] equivalence, but even to the end of this period, which actually reached to the middle of the 17th century, there was no concern for [[Words|verbal]] [[accuracy]].&lt;ref name=Cohen14&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 17th century, the poet [[John Dryden]] sought to make [[Virgil]] speak "in words such as he would probably have written if he were living and an Englishman". As great as Dryden's poem is, however, one is reading Dryden, and not experiencing the Roman poet's concision. Similarly, [[Homer]] arguably suffers from [[Alexander Pope]]'s endeavor to reduce the Greek poet's "wild paradise" to order. Both works live on as worthy ''English'' epics, more than as a point of access to the Latin or Greek.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Edward FitzGerald.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]]]
Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they hardly knew, or—as in the case of [[James Macpherson]]'s "translations" of [[Ossian]]—from texts that were actually of the "translator's" own composition.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Benjamin Jowett - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Benjamin Jowett]]]]
The 19th century brought new standards of accuracy and style. In regard to accuracy, observes J.M. Cohen, the policy became "the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text", except for any [[bawdy]] passages and the addition of copious explanatory [[footnote]]s.{{efn|For instance, Henry Benedict Mackey's translation of [[St. Francis de Sales]]'s "[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/desales/love.html Treatise on the Love of God]" consistently omits the saint's analogies comparing God to a nursing mother, references to Bible stories such as the rape of Tamar, and so forth.}} In regard to style, the [[Victorians]]' aim, achieved through far-reaching [[metaphrase]] (literality) or ''pseudo''-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a ''foreign'' classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'' of [[Omar Khayyam]] (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

In advance of the 20th century, a new pattern was set in 1871 by [[Benjamin Jowett]], who translated [[Plato]] into simple, straightforward language. Jowett's example was not followed, however, until well into the new century, when accuracy rather than style became the principal criterion.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

===Modern translation===
As a language evolves, texts in an earlier version of the language—original texts, or old translations—may become difficult for modern readers to understand. Such a text may therefore be translated into more modern language, producing a "modern translation" (e.g., a "modern English translation" or "modernized translation").

Such modern rendering is applied either to literature from classical languages such as [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], notably to the [[Bible]] (see "[[Modern English Bible translations]]"), or to literature from an earlier stage of the same language, as with the works of [[William Shakespeare]] (which are largely understandable by a modern audience, though with some difficulty) or with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s Middle English ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' (which is understandable to most modern readers only through heavy dependence on footnotes).

Modern translation is applicable to any language with a long literary history.  For example, in Japanese the 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is generally read in modern translation  (see "[[The Tale of Genji#Modern readership|''Genji:'' modern readership]]").

Modern translation often involves literary scholarship and textual revision, as there is frequently not one single canonical text. This is particularly noteworthy in the case of the Bible and Shakespeare, where modern scholarship can result in substantive textual changes.

Modern translation meets with opposition from some traditionalists.  In English, some readers prefer the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible to modern translations, and Shakespeare in the original of c. 1600 to modern translations.

An opposite process involves translating modern literature into classical languages, for the purpose of [[extensive reading]] (for examples, see "[[List of Latin translations of modern literature]]").

===Poetry===
[[File:Hofstadter2002B.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]]]]
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|65px|[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]]]]
[[File:Vladimir Nabokov 1973.jpg|thumb|55px|[[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]]]
Views on the possibility of satisfactorily translating poetry show a broad spectrum, depending largely on the degree of latitude to be granted the translator in regard to a poem's formal features (rhythm, rhyme, verse form, etc.).  [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his 1997 book, ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', argued that a good translation of a poem must convey as much as possible not only of its literal meaning but also of its form and structure (meter, rhyme or alliteration scheme, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;A discussion of Hofstadter's otherwise latitudinarian views on translation is found in Tony Dokoupil, "[http://www.newsweek.com/id/195684 Translation: Pardon My French: You Suck at This]," ''[[Newsweek]]'', May 18, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russia]]n-born [[linguist]] and [[semiotician]] [[Roman Jakobson]], however, had in his 1959 paper "[[On Linguistic Aspects of Translation]]", declared that "poetry by definition [is] untranslatable".  [[Vladimir Nabokov]], another Russian-born author, took a view similar to Jakobson's.  He considered rhymed, metrical, versed poetry to be in principle untranslatable and therefore rendered his 1964 English translation of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s [[Eugene Onegin#Into English|''Eugene Onegin'' in prose]].

Hofstadter, in ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', criticized Nabokov's attitude toward verse translation.  In 1999 Hofstadter published his own translation of ''Eugene Onegin'', in verse form.

Gregory Hays, in the course of discussing [[ancient Rome|Roman]] adapted translations of [[ancient Greek literature]], makes approving reference to some views on the translating of poetry expressed by [[David Bellos]], an accomplished French-to-English translator.  Hays writes:
{{blockquote|Among the ''idées reçues'' [received ideas] skewered by David Bellos is the old saw that "poetry is what gets lost in translation."  The saying is often attributed to [[Robert Frost]], but as Bellos notes, the attribution is as dubious as the idea itself.  A translation is an assemblage of words, and as such it can contain as much or as little poetry as any other such assemblage.  The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] even have a word (''chōyaku'', roughly "hypertranslation") to designate a version that deliberately improves on the original.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hays, "Found in Translation" (review of [[Denis Feeney]], ''Beyond Greek:  The Beginnings of Latin Literature'', Harvard University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Book titles ===

Book-title translations can be either descriptive or symbolic. Descriptive book titles, for example [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[Le Petit Prince]]''  (The Little Prince), are meant to be informative, and can name the protagonist, and indicate the theme of the book.  An example of a symbolic book title is [[Stieg Larsson]]'s  ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', whose original Swedish title is ''Män som hatar kvinnor''  (Men Who Hate Women).  Such symbolic book titles usually indicate the theme, issues, or atmosphere of the work.

When translators are working with long book titles, the translated titles are often shorter and indicate the theme of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plays ===

The translation of plays poses many problems such as the added element of actors, speech duration, translation literalness, and the relationship between the arts of drama and acting. Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Carlson, "Problems in Play Translation", ''Educational Theatre Journal'' 16, no. 1 (1964), pp. 55-58. {{doi|10.2307/3204378}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Play translators must also take into account several other aspects: the final performance, varying theatrical and acting traditions, characters' speaking styles, modern theatrical discourse, and even the acoustics of the auditorium, i.e., whether certain words will have the same effect on the new audience as they had on the original audience.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, pp. 129-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiences in Shakespeare's time were more accustomed than modern playgoers to actors having longer stage time.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Carlson, "Problems in Play Translation", ''Educational Theatre Journal'' 16, no. 1 (1964), pp. 55-58. {{doi|10.2307/3204378}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern translators tend to simplify the sentence structures of earlier dramas, which included compound sentences with intricate hierarchies of subordinate clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loren Kruger, "Keywords and Contexts: Translating Theatre Theory", ''Theatre Journal'' 59, no. 3 (2007), pp. 355-58. {{jstor|25070054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese literature ===
In translating Chinese literature, translators struggle to find true fidelity in translating into the [[target language (translation)|target language]]. In ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Barnstone argues that poetry "can't be made to sing through a mathematics that doesn't factor in the creativity of the translator".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Stewart, ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Washington, Copper Canyon Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable piece of work translated into English is the ''[[Wen Xuan]]'', an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature. Translating this work requires a high knowledge of the [[genre]]s presented in the book, such as poetic forms, various prose types including memorials, letters, proclamations, praise poems, edicts, and historical, philosophical and political disquisitions, threnodies and laments for the dead, and examination essays. Thus the literary translator must be familiar with the writings, lives, and thought of a large number of its 130 authors, making the ''Wen Xuan'' one of the most difficult literary works to translate.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Eoyang and Lin Yao-fu, ''Translating Chinese Literature'', Indiana University Press, 1995, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation generally, much as with [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|conception of mathematics]], requires, to varying extents, more information than appears in the page of text being translated.

===Sung texts===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Catherine Winkworth.PNG|thumb|left|100px|[[Catherine Winkworth]]]] --&gt;
Translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called "singing translation"—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most [[vocal music]], at least in the Western tradition, is set to [[Verse (popular music)|verse]], especially verse in regular patterns with [[rhyme]]. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of [[prose]] and [[free verse]] has also been practiced in some [[art music]], though [[popular music]] tends to remain conservative in its retention of [[stanza]]ic forms with or without [[refrain]]s.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church [[hymn]]s, such as the German [[chorale]]s translated into English by [[Catherine Winkworth]].{{efn|For another example of poetry translation, including translation of sung texts, see [http://vagalecs.narod.ru/ Rhymes from Russia].}}

Translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry, because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator.  There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line.

Other considerations in writing a singing translation include repetition of words and phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on high notes, and rhythmic features of the vocal line that may be more natural to the original language than to the target language. A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a [[contrafactum]].

Translations of sung texts—whether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a language not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or [[surtitles]] projected during [[opera]] performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing.

===Religious texts===
{{Further|Bible translations|Quran translations}}

[[File:Domenico Ghirlandaio - St Jerome in his study.jpg|thumb|left|135px|[[Jerome]], [[patron saint]] of translators and [[encyclopedia|encyclopedists]]]]
An important role in history has been played by translation of religious texts. Such translations may be influenced by tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey. For example, [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s who translated the [[India]]n [[sutra]]s into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] occasionally adjusted their translations to better reflect [[China]]'s distinct [[culture]], emphasizing notions such as [[filial piety]].

One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the rendering of the [[Old Testament]] into [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 3rd century BCE. The translation is known as the "[[Septuagint]]", a name that refers to the supposedly seventy translators (seventy-two, in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the [[Bible]] at [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. According to legend, each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and,  according to legend, all seventy versions proved identical. The ''Septuagint'' became the [[source text]] for later translations into many languages, including [[Latin]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

Still considered one of the greatest translators in history, for having rendered the ''[[Bible]]'' into [[Latin]], is [[Jerome]] (347–420 C.E.), the [[patron saint]] of translators. For centuries the [[Roman Catholic Church]] used his translation (known as the [[Vulgate]]), though even this translation stirred controversy.  By contrast with Jerome's contemporary, [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 C.E.), who endorsed precise translation, Jerome believed in adaptation, and sometimes invention, in order to more effectively bring across the meaning.  Jerome's colorful Vulgate translation of the Bible includes some crucial instances of "overdetermination".  For example, [[Isaiah]]'s prophecy announcing that the Savior will be born of a virgin, uses the word '''almah'', which is also used to describe the dancing girls at [[Solomon]]'s court, and simply means young and nubile.  Jerome, writes [[Marina Warner]], translates it as ''virgo'', "adding divine authority to the virulent cult of [[sex]]ual disgust that shaped Christian moral theology (the [Moslem] ''[[Quran]]'', free from this linguistic trap, does not connect [[Maryam (name)|Mariam]]/[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s miraculous nature with moral horror of sex)."  The [[apple]] that [[Eve]] offered to [[Adam]], according to Mark Polizzotti, could equally well have been an [[apricot]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], or [[banana]]; but Jerome liked the [[pun]] ''malus/malum'' (apple/evil}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pope Francis]] has suggested that the phrase "lead us not into temptation", in the [[Lord's Prayer]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] (the first Gospel, written c. 80–90 C.E.) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (the third Gospel, written c. 80–110 C.E.), should more properly be translated, "do not let us fall into temptation", commenting that God does not lead people into temptation—[[Satan]] does.{{efn|MJC Warren, Lecturer in Biblical and Religious Studies, [[University of Sheffield]], points out (more explicitly than Charles McNamara) that Luke gives a shorter version of [[Jesus]]'s Lord's Prayer, leaving off the request that God "deliver us from evil"; that (as Charles McNamara also says) accurate translation is not the question here; and that the Bible records a number of incidents when God commands evil actions, such as that [[Abraham]] kill his only son, [[Isaac]] (whose execution is canceled at the last moment).&lt;ref&gt;MJC Warren, "‘Lead us not into temptation’: why Pope Francis is wrong about the Lord’s Prayer", ''[[The Conversation]]'', December 8, 2017 [https://theconversation.com/lead-us-not-into-temptation-why-pope-francis-is-wrong-about-the-lords-prayer-88886]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Some important early Christian authors interpreted the Bible's Greek text and [[Jerome]]'s [[Latin Vulgate]] similarly to Pope Francis.  A.J.B. Higgins&lt;ref&gt;A.J.B. Higgins, "'Lead Us Not into Temptation':  Some Latin Variants", ''[[Journal of Theological Studies]]'', 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1943 showed that among the earliest Christian authors, the understanding and even the text of this devotional verse underwent considerable changes.  These ancient writers suggest that, even if the Greek and Latin texts are left unmodified, something like "do not let us fall" could be an acceptable English rendering.  Higgins cited [[Tertullian]], the earliest of the Latin [[Church Fathers]] (c. 155–c. 240 C.E., "do not allow us to be led") and [[Cyprian]] (c. 200–258 C.E., "do not allow us to be led into temptation").  A later author, [[Ambrose]] (C. 340–397 C.E.), followed Cyprian's interpretation.  [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), familiar with Jerome's Latin Vulgate rendering, observed that "many people... say it this way:  'and do not allow us to be led into temptation.'"&lt;ref&gt;Charles McNamara, "Lead Us Not into Temptation?  Francis Is Not the First to Question a Key Phrase of the Lord's Prayer", ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', January 1, 2018.  [https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/lead-us-not-temptation]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 863 C.E. the brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s "Apostles to the Slavs", began translating parts of the [[Bible]] into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, using the [[Glagolitic script]] that they had devised, based on the [[Greek alphabet]].

The periods preceding and contemporary with the [[Protestant Reformation]] saw translations of the [[Bible]] into [[vernacular]] (local) European languages—a development that contributed to [[Western Christianity]]'s split into [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] over disparities between Catholic and Protestant renderings of crucial words and passages (and due to a Protestant-perceived need to reform the Roman Catholic Church).  Lasting effects on the religions, cultures, and languages of their respective countries were exerted by such [[Bible]] translations as [[Martin Luther]]'s into [[German language|German]] (the [[New Testament]], 1522), [[Jakub Wujek]]'s into [[Polish language|Polish]] (1599, as revised by the [[Jesuits]]), and [[William Tyndale]]'s (New Testament, 1526 and revisions) and the ''[[King James Version]]'' into [[English language|English]] (1611). 
[[File:Moses (Michaelangelo - San Pietro in Vincoli - Rome).jpg|thumb|left|140px|right|Mistranslation: [[Michelangelo]]'s horned [[Moses]]]]
Efforts to translate the Bible into English had their [[martyr]]s. [[William Tyndale]] (c. 1494–1536) was convicted of [[heresy]] at [[Antwerp]], was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Farris |first=Michael |title=From Tyndale to Madison |year=2007 |page=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, [[John Wycliffe]] (c. mid-1320s – 1384) had managed to die a natural death, but 30 years later the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 declared him a heretic and decreed that his works and earthly remains should be burned; the order, confirmed by [[Pope Martin V]], was carried out in 1428, and Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the [[River Swift]].  Debate and religious [[schism]] over different translations of religious texts continue, as demonstrated by, for example, the [[King James Only movement]].

A famous ''mistranslation'' of a [[Biblical]] text is the rendering of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|קֶרֶן|rtl=yes}} (''keren''), which has several meanings, as "horn" in a context where it more plausibly means "beam of light":  as a result, for centuries artists, including sculptor [[Michelangelo]], have rendered [[Moses|Moses the Lawgiver]] with horns growing from his forehead.
[[File:Chinese quran.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Chinese language|Chinese]] translation, verses 33–34 of ''Quran'''s [[Ya Sin|''surah'' (chapter) 36]]]]
Such fallibility of the translation process has contributed to the [[Islamic]] world's ambivalence about translating the ''[[Quran]]'' (also spelled ''Koran'') from the original [[Arabic]], as received by the prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Allah]] (God) through the angel [[Gabriel]] incrementally between 609 and 632 C.E., the year of Muhammad's death.  During prayers, the ''Quran'', as the miraculous and inimitable word of Allah, is recited only in Arabic.  However, as of 1936, it had been translated into at least 102 languages.&lt;ref name = fatani&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first =Afnan|last = Fatani|title =Translation and the Qur'an|editor-link =Oliver Leaman|editor-first = Oliver| editor-last = Leaman|encyclopedia=The Qur'an:  An Encyclopaedia|publisher = Routledge|date = 2006|pages = 657–669|isbn = 978-0415775298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental difficulty in translating the ''Quran'' accurately stems from the fact that an Arabic word, like a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word, may have a [[Polysemy|range of meanings]], depending on [[Context (language use)|context]].  This is said to be a linguistic feature, particularly of all [[Semitic languages]], that adds to the usual similar difficulties encountered in translating between any two languages.&lt;ref name = fatani/&gt;  There is always an element of human judgment—of interpretation—involved in understanding and translating a text.  Muslims regard any translation of the ''Quran'' as but one possible interpretation of the [[Classical Arabic|Quranic (Classical) Arabic]] text, and not as a full equivalent of that divinely communicated original.  Hence such a translation is often called an "interpretation" rather than a translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], ''Islam in the World'', Granta, 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|978-1-86207-906-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To complicate matters further, as with other languages, the meanings and usages of some expressions have changed ''over time'', between the Classical Arabic of the ''Quran'', and modern Arabic.  Thus a modern Arabic speaker may misinterpret the meaning of a word or passage in the ''Quran''.  Moreover, the interpretation of a Quranic passage will also depend on the historic context of Muhammad's life and of his early community.  Properly researching that context requires a detailed knowledge of ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[Prophetic biography|sirah]]'', which are themselves vast and complex texts.  Hence, analogously to the translating of [[Translation#Chinese literature|Chinese literature]], an attempt at an accurate translation of the ''Quran'' requires a knowledge not only of the Arabic language and of the [[Target language (translation)|target language]], including their respective evolutions, but also a deep understanding of the two [[culture]]s involved.

== Technical translation ==
{{main|Technical translation}}
[[Technical translation]] renders documents such as manuals, instruction sheets, internal memos, minutes, financial reports, and other documents for a limited audience (who are directly affected by the document) and whose useful life is often limited.  Thus, a user guide for a particular model of refrigerator is useful only for the owner of the refrigerator, and will remain useful only as long as that refrigerator model is in use.  Similarly, software documentation generally pertains to a particular software, whose applications are used only by a certain class of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jody|year=2006 |title=Technical Translation: Usability Strategies for Translating Technical Documentation |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">In [[manufacturing]], an '''undercut''' is a special type of recessed surface. In [[turning]], it refers to a recess in a diameter. In [[machining]], it refers to a recess in a corner. In [[molding (process)|molding]], it refers to a feature that cannot be molded using only a single pull mold. In [[printed circuit board]], construction it refers to the portion of the copper that is [[etching (microfabrication)|etched]] away under the [[photoresist]]. In [[welding]], it refers to undesired melting and removal of metal near the weld bead. 

==Turning==
[[File:Undercut turning.png|thumb|400px|An example of a turned part with and without an undercut]]

On turned parts an undercut is also known as a ''neck'' or "relief groove". They are often used at the end of the threaded portion of a shaft or [[screw]] to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as ''thread relief'' in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least {{convert|0.015|in|mm|abbr=on}} smaller than the [[minor diameter]] of the thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Thread relief and chamfers | url = http://www.pmpa.org/technology/design/threadrelief.htm | work = PMPA's Designer's Guide | publisher = Precision Machined Products Association | accessdate = 2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread.  Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter.  They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on [[technical drawing]]s by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2004|p=194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molding==
[[File:Ondersnijding.gif|thumb|left|A simple example of molding an external undercut]]
Undercut - Any indentation or protrusion in a shape that will prevent its withdrawal from a one-piece mold.

Undercuts on molded parts are features that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an [[injection molding machine]]. They are categorized into ''internal'' and ''external'' undercuts, where external undercuts are on the exterior of the part and interior undercuts are on the inside of the part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a ''[[side action]]'' or ''side pull''.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt; This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berins|Society of the Plastics Industry|1991|pp=325–326}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosato|Plastics Institute of America|Schott|Rosato|2001|pp=1405–1406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the size of the undercut is small enough and the material is flexible enough a side action is not always required. In these cases the undercut is stripped or snapped out of the mold. When this is done usually a stripping plate or ring is used instead of [[stripper pin]]s so that the part is not damaged. This technique can be used on internal and external undercuts.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Milling==
[[File:Undercut machining.png|thumb|400px|An example of a machining undercut]]

In milling the corners may be undercut to remove the radius that is usually left by the [[milling cutter]]. Examples of this use are linear bearings for square shafts (i.e. [[rack and pinion|racks]]) and machined hexalobular sockets.

{{clear}}

==Etching==
[[File:Etch anisotropy.png|thumb|left|upright|{{ordered list |An isotropic etchant that creates an undercut |An anisotropic etchant leaves no undercut}}]]
{{See also|Etching (microfabrication)}}

Undercuts from etching are somewhat different than the undercuts explained above, because it is a side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the [[Chemical milling|etchant]] was applied too long. The second is due to an [[isotropic]] etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an [[anisotropic]] etchant is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=897}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

==Welding==
[[File:Welding undercut.svg|thumb]]

Undercutting is when the weld reduces the cross-sectional thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces the strength of the weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression along the length of the weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough [[filler metal]] along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because it will create greater [[temperature gradient]]s between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an electrode angle, a dampened electrode, excessive arc length, and slow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rampaul|2003|pp=211–212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FieldWindbreaks.JPG|right|thumb|Aerial view of field windbreaks in [[North Dakota]]]]
[[Image:Svappavaara 1965a.jpg|right|thumb|One of the original buildings at [[Svappavaara]], designed by [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], which forms a long windbreak]]

A '''windbreak''' (shelterbelt) is a [[planting]] usually made up of one or more rows of [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s planted in such a manner as to provide shelter from the [[wind]] and to protect soil from [[erosion]]. They are commonly planted in [[hedge]]rows around the edges of fields on [[farm]]s. If designed properly, windbreaks around a home can reduce the cost of heating and cooling and save [[energy]]. Windbreaks are also planted to help keep [[snow]] from drifting onto roadways or yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windbreaks|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/nac/practices/windbreaks.shtml|website=National Agroforestry Center|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers sometimes use windbreaks to keep snow drifts on farm land that will provide water when the snow melts in the spring. Other benefits include contributing to a [[microclimate]] around [[crop]]s (with slightly less [[drying]] and chilling at night), providing [[habitat]] for wildlife&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blue-berry.pl/index.php/blog/role-of-trees-in-agriculture|title=Role of trees in agriculture|last=User|first=Super|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and, in some regions, providing [[wood]] if the trees are harvested.

Windbreaks and [[intercropping]] can be combined in a farming practice referred to as [[alleycropping]]. Fields are planted in rows of different crops surrounded by rows of trees. These trees provide fruit, wood, or protect the crops from the wind. Alley cropping has been particularly successful in India, Africa, and Brazil, where coffee growers have combined farming and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Withgott &amp; Brennan 2008, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

A further use for a shelterbelt is to screen a farm from a main road or motorway. This improves the farm landscape by reducing the visual incursion of the motorway, [[Noise mitigation|mitigating noise]] from the traffic and providing a safe barrier between farm animals and the road.

The term "windbreak" is also used to describe an article of clothing worn to prevent wind chill; this term is favored by Europeans whereas Americans tend to use the term "[[windbreaker]]".

Fences called "windbreaks" are also used. Normally made from [[cotton]], [[nylon]], [[canvas]], and recycled sails, windbreaks tend to have three or more panels held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the panel.  The poles are then hammered into the ground and a windbreak is formed. Windbreaks or "wind fences" are used to reduce wind speeds over erodible areas such as open fields, industrial stockpiles, and dusty industrial operations. As erosion is proportional to wind speed cubed, a reduction of wind speed of 1/2 (for example) will reduce erosion by over 80%.

In essence, when the wind encounters a porous obstacle such as a windbreak or shelterbelt, air pressure increases (loosely speaking, air ''piles up'') on the windward side and (conversely) air pressure decreases on the leeward side. As a result, the airstream approaching the barrier is retarded, and a proportion of it is displaced up and over the barrier, resulting in a ''jet'' of higher wind speed aloft. The remainder of the impinging airstream, having been retarded in its approach, now circulates through the barrier to its downstream edge, pushed along by the decrease in pressure across the shelterbelt's width; emerging on the downwind side, that airstream is now further retarded by an adverse pressure gradient, because in the lee of the barrier, with increasing downwind distance air pressure ''recovers'' again to the ambient level. The result is that minimum wind speed occurs not at or within the windbreak, nor at its downwind edge, but further downwind - nominally, at a distance of about 3 to 5 times the windbreak height ''H''. Beyond that point wind speed recovers, aided by downward momentum transport from the overlying, faster-moving stream. From the perspective of the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations]] these effects can be understood as resulting from the loss of momentum caused by the drag of leaves and branches and would be represented by the body force ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (a distributed momentum sink).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1985; Journal of Wind Engineering &amp; Industrial Aerodynamics, Vol. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is the mean (average) wind speed reduced in the lee of the shelter, the wind is also less gusty, for turbulent wind fluctuations are also damped. As a result, turbulent vertical mixing is weaker in the lee of the barrier than it is upwind, and interesting secondary microclimatic effects result. For instance, by day sensible heat rising from the ground due to the absorption of sunlight (see ''surface energy budget'') is mixed upward less efficiently in the lee of a windbreak, with the result that air temperature near ground is somewhat higher in the lee than on the windward side. Of course this effect is attenuated with increasing downwind distance and indeed, beyond about 8''H'' downstream a zone may exist that is actually ''cooler'' than upwind.&lt;ref&gt;Argete &amp; Wilson, 1989, Agricultural &amp; Forest Meteorology, Vol 48&lt;/ref&gt;
