'''''Afropop Worldwide''''' is a [[Radio programming|radio program]] that presents the musics of [[Africa]] and the [[African diaspora]]. The program is produced by Sean Barlow for World Music Productions in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is hosted by the veteran Cameroonian broadcaster [[Georges Collinet]], who previously attained renown for his work with [[Voice Of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pri.org/people/georges-collinet |title=Georges Collinet |author= |year=2015 |publisher=Public Radio International |work=Pri.org |accessdate=August 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Afropop Worldwide'' launched in 1988 as ''Afropop'', a weekly [[Public broadcasting|public radio]] series, in response to widespread interest in international [[pop music]]. The first of its kind, it later expanded to include the music and cultures of the entire [[African diaspora]]. The program is distributed by [[Public Radio International]] (PRI) to over a hundred radio stations in the United States. It is also heard in Europe and Africa. 

In 2014, the program was awarded an institutional [[Peabody Award]] for "its pioneering role in the '[[world music]]' movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/institutional-award-afropop-worldwide |title=Institutional Award: Afropop Worldwide |author= |year=2015 |publisher=George Foster Peabody Awards |work=Peabodyawards.com |accessdate=August 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The producers have explained the show's mission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our vision is to increase the profile of African and African Diaspora music worldwide, and to see that benefits go back to artists, music industry professionals, and the countries that produce the music. The Afropop database is central to our strategy as it harnesses the power of what we have done, and allows us to integrate past work with new research to support new projects. We are working in partnership with Calabash Music to help musicians from Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America leapfrog over the barriers of the conventional music business and take advantage of the emerging digital marketplace for global music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/wp/about/ |title=About Afropop Worldwide |author= |year=2011 |publisher=World Music Productions |work=Afropop.org |accessdate=August 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The participation of '''Albania in the Turkvision Song Contest''' first began in [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]], at the second edition of the [[Turkvision Song Contest]] in 2014. [[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar]] (RTSH) have been responsible for the selection process of their participants, since their debut in 2014. Xhoi Bejko was the first representative for Albania at the [[Turkvision Song Contest 2014]] with the song "Hava ve Ates", which failed to qualify from the semifinals, finishing in nineteenth place and achieving one-hundred and fifty-four points. Albania continued to participate in the contest, and sent Xhoi Bejko and Visar Rexhepi as their representatives in the [[Turkvision Song Contest 2015]], with the song "Adi Hasret", which finished in eighth place, receiving the same total of points as in their previous participation.

==Origins of the contest==
Turkvision is an annual song contest which was created by [[TÜRKSOY]] in cooperation with the Turkish music channel [[TMB TV]]. Based on the similar format of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], Turkvision focuses primarily on participating [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] countries and regions. The participating countries and regions have to take part in the Semi Final. A juror from each nation awards between 1 and 10 points for every entry, except their own. An amount of 12 to 15 nations qualify for the Grand Final where the jury determines the winner. TÜRKSOY has stated that televoting is going to be introduced in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Turkvision, How is the Format of Turkvision Song Contest |url=http://www.turkvision.info/What-is-Turkvision,-How-is-the-Format-of-Turkvision-Song-Contest-1-h.htm |publisher=turkvision.info |accessdate=22 April 2017 |date=15 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308012519/http://turkvision.info/what-is-turkvision%2C-how-is-the-format-of-turkvision-song-contest-1-h.htm |archivedate=8 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in which the winning country proceeds to host the following year's event, hosting of the Turkvision Song Contest takes place in the country or region that is also hosting the [[Culture and Arts Capital of the Turkic World|Turkish Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Will Turkvision Be Held, In Which Country Is Turkvision |url=http://www.turkvision.info/Where-Will-Turkvision-Be-Held,-In-Which-Country-Is-Turkvision-4-h.htm |publisher=turkvision.info |accessdate=22 April 2017 |date=15 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311020026/http://turkvision.info/where-will-turkvision-be-held%2C-in-which-country-is-turkvision-4-h.htm |archivedate=11 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Turkvision Song Contest 2014===
On 25 September 2014 it was confirmed that Albania would make their official debut at the 2014 Song Contest to be held in [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]].&lt;ref name=TSC2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Patrick|title=Albania: Turkvision artist presented|url=http://eurovoix.com/2014/10/25/albania-turkvizyon-artist-presented/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=26 October 2014|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period of time it appeared that Albania had withdrawn from the contest, the official website Turkvizyon.tv removed all mention of Albania from their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Albania: Withdraw From Turkvizyon 2014?|url=http://eurovoix.com/2014/11/11/albania-withdraw-from-turkvizyon-2014/|website=Eurovoix.com|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2014 it was confirmed by Xhoi that she was still participating and that she would be singing "Zjarr Dhe Ajer", the song was later partially translated into Turkish for the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Albania: Still Participating In Turkvizyon?|url=http://eurovoix.com/2014/11/12/albania-still-participating-in-turkvizyon/|website=Eurovoix.com|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finished in nineteenth place, achieving a score of 154 points, and therefore failed to qualify for the grand final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fidan|first1=Mustafa|title=Turkvizyon 2014: 15 entries qualified for the final|url=http://eurovoix.com/2014/11/20/turkvizyon-2014-15-entries-qualified-for-the-final/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkvision Song Contest 2015===

'''''Atlantis Evolution''''' is a fantasy adventure [[computer game]] developed by French studio [[Atlantis Interactive Entertainment]] and published by [[The Adventure Company]] (a division of [[DreamCatcher Interactive]] until 2011), and released in 2004. It is the fourth in the Atlantis series by [[Cryo Interactive|Cryo]], and the first one made by [[Atlantis Interactive Entertainment]], founded by former Cryo developers. Unlike the second and the third game in the series, the game revolves entirely around Atlantis. It was followed by [[The Secrets of Atlantis: The Sacred Legacy]] in 2006.

==Story==
Near the beginning of the 20th century a 25-year-old journalist named Curtis Hewitt returns home from Patagonia. On his journey, he encounters a storm, which brings him to the world of Atlantis. Here he meets the native people and embarks on a quest to free them from their tyrannical gods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlantisevolution.com/ Atlantis Evolution&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{Unsourced-section|date=February 2018}}
When Cryo closed down in 2002 the ''Atlantis'' series was thought to be finished. However, The Adventure Company (Dreamcatcher) bought the [[intellectual property]] and developed ''Atlantis Evolution''.

==Transformers: Generation 1==

Barricade first featured in 1990 as part of a Decepticon [[race track]] patrol team, his vehicle mode being a [[Formula One]] [[racing car]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The Future| last=Brereton | first=Erin | year=2006 | publisher=Triumph Books| ISBN=1-57243-983-1 | page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barricade learned how to take care of himself while running with Cybertron's most vicious racing gangs, and he brings that same brutal edge to his position as leader of the Race Track Patrol. His troops know that the slightest mistake will result in a merciless dressing down in front of the others, and they strive to meet his exacting standards. His hard-nosed, abusive leadership style does not do much for morale, but he figures it's for their own good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seibertron.com/database/character.php?view=&amp;char_id=323 Barricade (Decepticon Micromaster Race Track Patrol, Transformers G1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dreamwave Productions===
Barricade is the commander of the team and pushes the other members. His only fictional appearance is in the Dreamwave comics Micromaster series.

Originally named "Runner", Barricade was created as part of a cross-factional experiment in which new Micromasters were allowed to function as neutrals, and to choose their own affiliations. Barricade quickly saw the potential rewards of joining the Decepticons, and earned the new moniker "Barricade" in recognition of his blockade-running taction.

===IDW Publishing===
Barricade was among the Micromasters who appeared in ''[[Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]]: Hardhead'' who attacked [[Nightbeat (Transformers)|Nightbeat]] and [[Hardhead (Transformers)|Hardhead]] on the planet [[Gorlam Prime]].

A second Barricade was made in the [[Transformers Energon]] series as the leader of the team that formed the body of [[Combaticons|Bruticus Maximus]] (Bruticus in Japan), his vehicle being a missile truck.

===Animated series===
The animated series does not refer to any of the components by name - in it, only the central body is intelligent, and the limbs are drones. The five robots transform only from vehicle mode into combined mode, never into their individual robot forms (apart from one out-of-continuity episode).

Bruticus Maximus was one of four combining Transformers sealed away in stasis beneath the surface of [[Cybertron (modern universe)|Cybertron]] to guard a hidden reservoir of Super [[Energon cube|Energon]]. [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]], guided by [[Unicron]], set out to search for it, and destroyed one of the immobile robots in his rage (strangely enough, a second [[Aerialbots|Superion Maximus]]), only for the reservoir to then reveal itself. As the guardians awakened, Megatron immersed himself in the Super Energon to upgrade himself into [[Galvatron]], and Bruticus Maximus and [[Constructicons|Constructicon Maximus]] immediately swore fealty to Galvatron as the one who had awoken them. However, their "brother," [[Aerialbots|Superion Maximus]], refused, recognising Galvatron's evil and siding with the Autobots.

Bruticus Maximus added plenty of firepower to the Decepticons' side, and he and Constructicon Maximus had several clashes with the "traitorous" Superion Maximus, until the time for their final battle came, set against the backdrop of the struggle to stop the Unicron-possessed Galvatron out in space. Constructicon Maximus was deactivated by Superion Maximus, who then had his limbs destroyed by Bruticus Maximus, but transferred Constructicon Maximus's limbs to himself and used them to defeat Bruticus, along with a little help from the ghost of the "brother" Megatron had destroyed.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Although the ''Transformers: Energon'' comic book series by Dreamwave Productions was canceled before Barricade could appear in them, the Energon "More Than Meets The Eye" guide book was under development at the time. Pencil art by [[Guido Guidi]] was released later showing the art that would have been used with Barricade's profile.

===Toys===
*'''''Energon'' Deluxe Barricade''' (2005)
:In the U.S. Barricade was sold by himself, but in Japan he was only available as part of the gift set with the other members of his team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffbee.com/reviews/eonslaught.php Cliffbee.com: Transformer Toy Reviews: Superlink Onslaught&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
:In 2006 Barricade was repackaged for the ''Transformers: Universe'' line. This packaging removed all references to his ability to combine with the other members of his team, as the other members of his team were not released in the Universe line.
:This toy measures 13 centimeters long in vehicle mode, while a real Astros II MLRS measures 700 centimeters, making this a 1:54 scale toy. With the robot toy standing 14 centimeters tall, the real world robot would stand about 756 centimeters (24.8 feet) tall

In the 2007 [[Transformers (film)|live-action movie]], Barricade is a [[Decepticon]] scout who transforms into a [[Saleen S281|Saleen S281E]] [[police car]], making him similar in appearance to the ''Generation 1'' [[Autobot]] [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], who was actually in the first draft of the movie treatment before the writers thought that a Decepticon police car would be a better idea. He appears to be the rival of Bumblebee, standing at nearly the same height. He is a hunter/scout of the Decepticons, choosing his vehicle mode to easily hide among the humans as a symbol of authority. His persona appears to be that of the cliché "bad cop", as he fiercely interrogates [[Witwicky family#Samuel James Witwicky|Sam Witwicky]] once he locates him. He mainly elongates his arms to reveal spinning spikes known as the blade wheels in his hands and uses them as close-combat striking weapons. He also has a long chain with a wheel on the end that reveals a set of cybertanium blades which form a large blade wheel. In Dark of the Moon, he wields what looks to be a 50&amp;nbsp;mm chain gun. When in vehicle mode, he can simulate the appearance of a human driver, the same holographic model (referred to as "Mustache Man" on-set and in the credits) that "pilots" [[Blackout (Transformers)#Transformers|Blackout]] and [[Starscream]].

In leaked versions of the script, this character was originally codenamed [[Brawl (Transformers)#Transformers (film)|Brawl]] - he even appeared with his name on some of the concept art. The name was later changed to Barricade when the official list of Transformers appearing in the movie was released; the name Brawl would go to another Decepticon. His rear quarter reads "''To punish and enslave...''" a parody of the classic police slogan "''To Protect and Serve''". The front quarter police logos have the Decepticon symbol on them and the writing "Pacis Quod Alcedonia", Latin for "Still, Halcyon Days of Peace", and "Incorporated since June 1865".

The official guide to the ''Transformers'' video game says he's 16 feet tall. The ''Transformers U.K.'' magazine states he is 16 feet 3&amp;nbsp;inches tall, weighs 2.2 tons and has a maximum speed of 500&amp;nbsp;mph. An early interview with Michael Bay states that he is 18 feet tall. The deluxe toy suggests he is 19 feet tall at the shoulders.

The 2005 Saleen Mustang that turned into Barricade movie car was sold in 2009 at for $30,000 USD ($36,000 USD after premium) in [[Los Angeles Center Studios]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/08/17/transformers-barricade-saleen-mustang-sold-at-auction-for-36/ Transformers "Barricade" Saleen Mustang sold at auction for $36,000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icollector.com/2005-Saleen-Mustang-Barricade-from-Transformers_i8582907 818 2005 Saleen Mustang - "Barricade" from Transformers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Barricade's new vehicle mode used in [[Transformers: The Last Knight]] was based on 2016 Ford Mustang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.boldride.com/2016/06/2017-transformers-barricade-ford-mustang-photos-specs/106157/ |title=Barricade Returns to ‘Transformers 5′ as a New Ford Mustang |access-date=2016-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620131001/http://news.boldride.com/2016/06/2017-transformers-barricade-ford-mustang-photos-specs/106157/ |archive-date=2016-06-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barricade features a new form with an arm-mounted rotary-gun and a pair of knuckledusters with "Punish" and "Enslave" written on them, as a throwback to his original vehicle mode.

===Movie plot===
Barricade is one of the major antagonists and a central Decepticon in the first film. He is the very first Transformer to speak English. He first appears picking up Frenzy after he collected information from Air Force One, and began hunting down Sam Witwicky to interrogate him about his great-great-grandfather's glasses (that have the location to the [[AllSpark#Transformers|Allspark]]). After locating him, he threatened Sam, only for him to escape with his crush, [[Mikaela Banes]] in Bumblebee's [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|Camaro]] vehicle-mode, and Barricade chased them. After the chase, Bumblebee transformed into his robot mode, and on arriving, Barricade attacked the Autobot. He then released Frenzy, to go after Sam and Mikaela while he battled Bumblebee. However, Barricade was not able to beat Bumblebee, winding up badly wounded. Eventually, he recovered from his wounds (as shown by the brief scene showing him as the first Decepticon responding to Starscream's call), and appeared later on during the highway chase scene, where Sam recognized him as "''the same cop''". Barricade disappeared in the middle of the highway chase scene. In the comic book and novelization, he is killed shortly after Optimus Prime's motorway battle with [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)#Transformers|Bonecrusher]] while attacking Prime from behind.

Although Barricade does not appear in the 2009 sequel film ''Revenge of the Fallen'', he did have toys in the film's toy line and appeared in the associated prequel novel and comic series.

Barricade returned in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' in an extended cameo, when the Decepticons occupy Chicago. His disappearance and absence from the previous film is still unexplained. Barricade and several other Decepticons led by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] and [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] captured the Autobots. When the Decepticons decided to execute the Autobots at the insistence of Dylan Gould, Barricade shoved Que (Wheeljack) forward, and a Decepticon Protoform mortally wounded the Autobot before Barricade finished him off. Before Soundwave could kill Bumblebee, Wheelie and Brains caused Decepticon fighters to crash down from a Decepticon battle-cruiser, causing a distraction and allowed Bumblebee and the other three captive Autobots to break free. Later, Barricade was seen working alongside Shockwave as his second-in-command. He is seen slapping around a few Decepticon Protoforms, apparently blaming them for Soundwave's death. Que was then avenged, when Barricade was then blinded by sniper shots to his eyes. He stumbled around in pain for a moment before being crippled by a Boomstick placed on his leg. Barricade collapsed to the ground, dropping his gun as he did. He then tried to crawl to safety but gets wounded as the humans shot him in the head and took out his fellow Decepticons.

Barricade returned in ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]'', having survived and being kept under surveillance for years since the battle of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;http://michaelbay.com/2016/06/10/to-punish-and-enslave/&lt;/ref&gt; Barricade is first seen spying on a war torn area of [[Chicago]], discovering Cade Yeager who gained the talisman, in turn meaning Quintessa and Cybertron were approaching to the Earth. Barricade reported this back to Megatron, who demanded they find the talisman, and Barricade suggested they make a deal with the TRF. Barricade, along with the other Decepticons hunted down the Autobots, but Barricade was incapacitated by Grimlock and forced to retreat. Barricade later appeared in London, pursuing Bumblebee, Yeager and Viviane until Bumblebee blasted him, and collided with a truck. Barricade later joined with Megatron and Nitro Zeus at [[Stonehenge]] when they began helping Quintessa draining power from Earth/[[Unicron]]. Barricade fought back against the British military, but was not seen again presumed he is finally killed.

Barricade returns in spin-off ''Bumblebee: The Movie''.

===Books===
Barricade first appears in the prequel novel ''[[Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday]]'', serving as pilot of the ''Nemesis''. Here he is a vocal critic of Starscream's command, but is willing to tolerate his leadership if it means finding [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers|Megatron]]. He opposes Blackout's decision to attack the Autobots against Starscream's orders, but refuses to intervene when Blackout challenges Starscream, claiming that the outcome is obvious.

The ''Transformers'' novelization provides a scene that did not make the final cut of the film, where Barricade dies. From the novelization: ''"There followed a flurry of furious action that ended only when Optimus flipped the machine clinging to him against a steel-and-cement freeway pillar. The impact cracked and bent the column. It did worse to Barricade, who lay twisted and unmoving.''"

In the children's book "Transformers Prime Time" by [[Michael Teitelbaum]] it is stated that Barricade is defeated by Optimus Prime.

Barricade appears among the Decepticons loyal to Starscream in the book ''[[Transformers: The Veiled Threat]]'' by [[Alan Dean Foster]]. He appears in Rome as part of a trap set by Starscream to kill Optimus Prime. Optimus questioned him as to why he was serving Starscream and he said because Megatron was dead. Thanks to assistance from the human N.E.S.T. members, Barricade was distracted long enough for Optimus to free himself from the trap and buried Barricade. In the next morning, the subway workers found a tunnel dug where Barricade had freed himself and escaped.

===IDW Publishing===
Barricade appeared in the ''Transformers: Defiance'' comic series by [[IDW Publishing]]. In issue #3 Megatron learns that Optimus has broken into his room he sends Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, Jazz, Prowl and Smokescreen to arrest Optimus for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but when the group is traveling to Megatron's location they are ambushed by Barricade, Brawl, Crankcase, Frenzy, Starscream, Skywarp and Thundercracker who have orders to kill them. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion.

Barricade also appears in [[IDW Publishing]]'s [[Transformers: Movie Prequel|prequel comic]], where he, Starscream and Blackout smash up the Mars Beagle probe. In issue #4 he travels to Earth, gaining his police car alternate mode and destroying the original car, leaving no witnesses alive. The three Decepticons, detecting emissions similar to that of the Allspark, then stumble into Sector 7's trap for [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)#Transformers|Bumblebee]], wiping out their military backup. Sector Seven labels Barricade as NBE-3. While the Decepticons discover nothing from Blackout's scan of Sector 7's computers, Barricade proposes that they tail Bumblebee to see if he can lead them to the Allspark. With the plan approved, Barricade pretends to lose Bumblebee in chase, while the other two Decepticons tail him from the air.

Barricade's death was depicted in the comic adaptation of the 2007 film. This was later retconned into Barricade being injured, but he recovers.

He also appears in the official movie sequel comic called "''[[Transformers Movie Sequel: The Reign of Starscream|The Reign of Starscream]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fromthetip.blogspot.com/2008/04/rain-of-starscream-part-deux.html From the Tip: Rain of Starscream Part Deux&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In that story it is revealed that Barricade was forced into a bridge column by Ironhide during the battle on the highway, but had survived, heavily damaged. Starscream orders him to continue spying on the Autobots once he is repaired enough to function.

In ''[[Transformers: Alliance]]'' a month after the battle at Mission City Epps and Lennox contact Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Ironhide about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to a naval yard, but they are spied on by Barricade, who transmits the information to Starscream.

Barricade appears in ''Transformers: Tales of the Fallen'' #1 where he kidnaps Sam in order to flush out Bumblebee and learn where the Allspark fragment is. Bumblebee saves Sam and fights Barricade, but Barricade escapes.

In ''Transformers: Rising Storm'' #2, Barricade is seen as part of Club Starscream, under Starscream's command.

===Titan Magazines===

Note: Information in ''italics'' occur in the alternate storyline where Megatron won the battle for the Allspark.

Barricade appears in issue #7 of the Transformers Titan Magazine in a story called "Starscream's Militia". Set shortly after the battle of Mission City, Barricade is seemingly brought to life by Starscream using the sparks of Allspark mutations. He is immediately killed again by the Autobots. It is unknown how this fits in with the official re-written continuity where Barricade never died.

''Barricade attacks Cincinnati in issue #23 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called "Revolution Part 1."''

===Video games===
Barricade appears as a playable character in the Decepticon campaign, playable on the second and fourth levels. He first had to destroy all Autobot drones then rescue Frenzy from Sector 7 agents to learn information about the Allspark. After learning that a human named Sam Witwicky had a pair of spectacles with a Decepticon code printed on it telling them with the Allspark and Megatron's location. Then he encountered Bumblebee who was protecting Sam and the spectacles so they fought and Barricade killed Bumblebee and took the glasses. He later appeared in Mission City where Megatron told him to find Sam. When he finds Sam, he was being protected by Jazz, so Jazz and Barricade fought and Barricade killed Jazz. He appeared one last time in a cut scene at the end where Megatron is the ruler of Earth and ordered Barricade and the other Decepticons to exterminate the remainder of the human race.

Barricade also appears twice in the Autobot campaign as a boss (being fought against in both battles by Bumblebee). He first attacked Sam to retrieve the glasses, only for Bumblebee to fight and wound him. He appeared again on the last mission of the fourth level, this time seeking the Allspark, but this time Bumblebee killed him. He would swing his arm unstoppably (like Longarm) and could only be stopped by throwing an object at him.

In the ''[[Transformers: Decepticons]]'' DS game, Barricade often works closely with Create-A-Bot and Blackout. He is played as or assisted in many missions, but he was eventually killed, along with Blackout, by the traitorous Starscream. In the Autobots version he was a boss twice (first with Bumblebee, second with Optimus having to protect Bumblebee) but dies by the Optimus-Bumblebee duo.

Barricade is also playable in the ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Decepticons]]'' DS game.

Barricade is among the characters who appear in the ''TRANSFORMERS CVBERVERSE Battle Builder Game''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/en_US/play/details.cfm?R=E4651B16-5056-900B-1074-AA6D591357D5:en_US {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104063715/http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/en_US/play/details.cfm?R=E4651B16-5056-900B-1074-AA6D591357D5%3Aen_US |date=2013-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bazoo''''' is a [[freemium]] [[Mobile game|mobile]] [[strategy video game|strategy]] video game developed and published by the French studio IsCool Entertainment. The game combines a traditional puzzle gameplay and worldwide real-time [[player versus player]] fights. The game was released globally on April 10, 2017.

==Gameplay==

Bazoo has the basis of a puzzle game, where a player have to combin blocks to destroy them, plus an objective of filling the oponnent board before having its own board full of blocks.
Four combinations exist: dogs and bones, rabbits and carrots, squirrels and nuts, koalas and eucalyptus. As soon as a block is destroyed, it immediately go on the oponnent board, making his game even more difficult. 
To make harder attacks, players can do combos, which are successions of blocks destruction (a dog eats a bone, which makes a rabbit eat a carrot, etc.). Best players can do X6 or X7 combos, which are called "Epic combos".

The main specificity of the game is its "no pay-to-win" and total equity system. Players receive the same blocks, in the same order, so that both opponents have the same chance to win.

''Bazoo'' is divided in three modes: classic ladders (local and world leaderboards), leagues (9 leagues with a promotion and relegation system) and tournaments, where players can create their own private tournament and reward the winners.

The character each player owns is a monkey, which can be customized through paid skins. Even if the monkey doesn't affect the game, it represents the identity of each player, who can use thousand of possible combinations to get his/her unique avatar.

==Release==
The game was [[Soft launch|soft-launched]] worldwide for Android platforms on October, 2016. Android and iOS received a global release on April 10, 2017.

''Bazoo'' was immediately featured in "New games we love" section of the most worldwide [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] as well as the "Top New Apps" section of the worldwide Google Play Store.

==Reception==
''Bazoo'' was positively received by mobile game specialists and players. Pocket Gamer compared it to "''intense and frenzied battles commonly found amongst movies and manga''" &lt;ref&gt;Pocket Gamer staff (April 13, 2017).[http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/BAZOO+-+Mobile+eSport/news.asp?c=73659 "Fast paced, combo-chaining madness awaits in BAZOO, available now on mobile"]. ''[[Pocket Gamer]]''. Retrieved April 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas it received more than 3500 five-stars reviews on the Google Play Store.

"'''Bend Her'''" is the thirteenth episode&lt;!-- Please do not change. Production order, not airing order, is used here. --&gt; in the [[Futurama (season 4)|fourth season]] of the American [[animated]] [[television series]] ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on July 20, 2003. In the episode, [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] changes into a female robot and adopts the name Coilette.

==Plot==
While attending the Earth 3004 [[Olympic Games]] with the crew to see [[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]] compete in the [[limbo (dance)|limbo]] event, [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] feels he should compete as well. However, feeling emasculated by the large male Olympic bending robots, he decides to pose as a [[fembot]] in order to compete. Competing as Coilette, he easily beats the female competitors, winning five gold medals. However, the medalists are called in for gender testing prior to the awards ceremony. Desperate, Bender has [[Professor Farnsworth]] give him a [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change]], turning him into an authentic fembot.

Coilette is invited to go on a late night talk show. Also appearing on the show is robot actor [[Calculon]], who falls for Coilette instantly. The two start dating, which Coilette confides to the crew she is doing for the fame and valuable gifts Calculon sends her. Calculon proposes to Coilette. She accepts, scheming to get half his money with a divorce settlement.

However, moved by Calculon's deep professions of love, Coilette finds that though she doesn't want to be his wife, she also does not want to hurt him with a divorce, and even openly weeps while telling the crew this. Professor Farnsworth concludes that Coilette's new emotionalism is due to her new female [[hormone]]s taking over. [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] offers to help Coilette out under the condition that she reverse her sex change. She reasons that though there is no way for Coilette to get out of her predicament without hurting Calculon, a soap opera parting will hurt him least. At the wedding, Coilette, Leela, [[Doctor Zoidberg|Zoidberg]] and [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] stage an elaborate scene that fakes Coilette's death. As promised, Bender returns to his male persona, and claims to have not been changed at all by the experience. However, under his breath he bids Calculon a emotional goodbye.

==Production==
The opening scene at the Olympics was changed following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Several brief shots of various country representatives, including countries related to the terrorist attacks, were removed because the writing team did not want viewers to think that the episode was referencing the attacks. Similar minor changes were made to some other episodes in season four.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite video | people=Moore Rich|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Bend Her"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode was considered somewhat easier to animate than others because there were fewer spaceship scenes.&lt;ref name="Rowe"&gt;{{cite video | people=Rowe, Michael|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Bend Her"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
*The title of the episode is a reference to the 1959 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''. It is also a reference to Bender's name and the act of "gender bending".

Cohen]] claims the episode title is a "[[triple entendre|triple joke]]".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X.|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Bend Her"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
[[Video]] '''black level''' is defined as the level of brightness at the darkest (black) part of a visual image or the level of [[brightness]] at which no light is emitted from a screen, resulting in a pure black screen.

Video displays generally need to be calibrated so that the displayed black is true to the black information in the [[video]] signal. If the black level is not correctly adjusted, visual information in a video signal could be displayed as black, or black information could be displayed as above black information (gray). 

The voltage of the black level varies across different television standards. [[PAL]] sets the black level the same as the blanking level, while [[NTSC]] sets the black level approximately 54&amp;nbsp;mV above the blanking level. 

User misadjustment of black level on monitors is common. It results in darker colors having their hue changed, it affects contrast, and in many cases causes some of the image detail to be lost.

Black level is set by displaying a testcard image and adjusting display controls. With CRT displays:
* “brightness” adjusts black level
* “contrast” adjusts white level
* CRTs tend to have some interdependence of controls, so a control sometimes needs adjustment more than once.

In [[digital video]] black level usually means the range of [[RGB]] values in video signal, which can be either [0..255] (typical of a computer output) or [16..235] (standard for video).

In July 2014, prior to the game's release, 2K Australia's head Tony Lawrence reiterated that there was a possibility that ''The Pre-Sequel'' could be ported to [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]—gauged by fan demand and sales.&lt;ref name="polygon-maybenextgen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarkar|first1=Samit|title=Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel could eventually come to PS4, Xbox One|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/7/5877987/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-ps4-xbox-one-possible|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, it was reported that a game titled ''Borderlands Remastered Edition'', which was presumed to be a ''Borderlands'' port to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, had received a rating from the [[Australian Classification Board]]. No other details had been announced at that point. The discovery drew comparisons to other "remastered" ports of recent previous generation games to the consoles, including ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[The Last of Us]]'', fellow [[Take-Two Interactive]] title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', and ''[[Halo: The Master Chief Collection]]''.&lt;ref name="polygon-australianrating"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tach|first1=Dave|title=Borderlands Remastered Edition spotted on Australian ratings website|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/12/12/7381557/borderlands-remastered-edition|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot-australianrating"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crossley|first1=Rob|title=Borderlands Remastered Listing Hints at Xbox One and PS4 Port|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-remastered-listing-hints-at-xbox-one-a/1100-6424172/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compilation was announced on January 20, 2015, as ''The Handsome Collection'', for a release in North America on March 24, 2015, and elsewhere on March 27, 2015.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-handsomecollection"&gt;{{cite web|title=Borderlands: The Handsome Collection bundles previous two games for PS4 and Xbox One|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/borderlands-handsome-collection-bundles-previous-two-games-ps4-and-xbox-one/|website=GamesRadar|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limited "Claptrap-in-a-Box" edition was also announced; this US$399 bundle includes [[lithograph]]s of the playable characters from both games, a [[Steelbook]] case for the game, and a remote-controlled version of the robot character [[List of Borderlands characters#Claptrap|Claptrap]]; it can be controlled from an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[iOS]] device using the "Claptr[[mobile app|App]]", features a single wheel and gyroscopic stabilization, can play Claptrap's in-game quotes, and has a camera in its eye that can be viewed from within the app.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-claptrap"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=New Borderlands collection comes in $399 package with RC Claptrap|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/new-borderlands-collection-comes-in-399-package-with-rc-claptrap/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 5,000 copies of this edition were produced.&lt;ref name="gameinformer-claptrap"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Futter|first1=Mike|title=Borderlands: The Handsome Collection Lands On Xbox One, PS4 In March With A $400 Limited Edition|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/01/20/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-lands-on-xbox-one-ps4-in-march-with-a-400-limited-edition.aspx|website=Game Informer|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compilation does not include [[Borderlands (video game)|the first ''Borderlands'']]: speaking at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX South]], Gearbox CEO [[Randy Pitchford]] stated that they may consider creating a port of the original game if ''The Handsome Collection'' is "wildly successful".&lt;ref name="ign-isnton"&gt;{{cite web|title=PAX South 2015: Why Borderlands Isn't on Next-Gen and How You Can Change That|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/01/25/pax-south-2015-why-borderlands-isnt-on-next-gen-and-how-you-can-change-that|website=IGN|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2015, Gearbox Software and 2K Games confirmed that the game had been declared [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|gold]], indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/18/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-goes-gold|title=Borderlands: The Handsome Collection Gone Gold|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Jordan|last=Sirani|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changes ==
Both games in ''The Handsome Collection'' feature remastered graphics, and are capable of running at [[1080p]] resolution at 60 [[frames per second]] when playing with one or two local players. The games are also capable of local split-screen multiplayer with up to four players, rather than the two-player limit of the previous-generation versions; four-player mode will reduce the frame rate to 30 frames per second.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-handsomecollection" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gameinformer-claptrap" /&gt;

Save data from the previous-generation versions of ''2'' or ''The Pre-Sequel'' (including characters and Badass Rank) can be migrated to ''The Handsome Collection'' from the PlayStation 3 and Vita versions to PlayStation 4, and the Xbox 360 version to Xbox One.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-handsomecollection" /&gt; Both games include all of their respective downloadable content—such as campaigns and additional playable characters. ''Claptastic Voyage''—a campaign for ''The Pre-Sequel'' that was released on the same day as ''The Handsome Collection'', is not included on-disc, but is a free download.&lt;ref name="shacknews-claptasticvoyage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel goes on a 'Claptastic Voyage' on March 24|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/88475/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-goes-on-a-claptastic-voyage-on-march-24|website=ShackNews|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vrworld-handsomecollection"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strickland|first1=Derek|title=Borderlands Collection announced for PS4, Xbox One|url=http://www.vrworld.com/2015/01/20/borderlands-collection-announced-ps4-xbox-one/|website=VR World|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Borderlands: The Handsome Collection'' received positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites [[Metacritic]] gave the PlayStation 4 version 82/100 based on 49 reviews.&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;

[[IGN]] gave the compilation an 8.4 out of 10, praising the performance of its ''Borderlands 2'' port for being "rock solid". Some issues were noted, including that the inventory menu in four-player mode was not scaled to fit the smaller amount of screen space, ''The Pre-Sequel'' had inconsistent frame rates, and users are unable to switch between the two games without rebooting it entirely, concluding that "Minor quibbles aside, ''The Handsome Collection'' is a great package for any console-bound ''Borderlands'' fan."&lt;ref name="ign-review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Borderlands: The Handsome Collection review - The Butt Stallion You Rode In On|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review|website=IGN.com|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamesRadar]]'' was also positive, praising the extent of content available, but criticized minor framerate issues and that no significant new features were added.&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt;

'''Buenos Aires in the Southern Highlands''' (or short '''BASH''') is a social [[Tango]] dance event held annually in November at [[Bundanoon, New South Wales|Bundanoon, NSW]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buenos Aires in the Southern Highlands (bash) 2014|url=http://www.aroundyou.com.au/whats-on/events/buenos-aires-in-the-southern-highlands-bash-2014|publisher=[[AroundYou]]|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by [[Tango Social Club]] of [[Canberra]] and Tango Synergy of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buenos Aires in the Southern Highlands (BASH)|url=http://www.so-tango.com/tango-events-interstate/buenosairesinthesouthernhighlandsbash|website=SoTango|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buenos Aires in the Southern Highlands 2016|url=http://bash2016.weebly.com/|publisher=[[Weebly]]|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

BASH was the originally thought up by Linda Macfarlane, [[Canberra]] and Karen Garnett, [[Sydney]]. Linda said that the tango crowd from Canberra wanted to dance with more people, and Karen from Sydney said the same about the Sydney scene. They both thought, ''why not bring the two crowds together?'' Figuring that a place geographically right in the middle would be ideal, Linda found Bundanoon as the perfect place. Thus BASH was born. 

What started as a small idea for the Tango scenes of two cities to meet became an attractive dance event that grew to be well known national-wide and internationally: Tango dancers from Australia, New Zealand and come together for a weekend, usually in the second half of November to dance Tango to a variety of [[Tango music]]. BASH was first held in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buenos Aires in the Southern Highlands 2016|url=http://bash2016.weebly.com/|publisher=[[Weebly]]|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this it is one of the longest running recurring festivals in Oceania, with up to 200 Tango dancers gathering for a weekend together and making the event an important icon of Australia's tango scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader/Follower Balance|url=http://bash2016.weebly.com/leaderfollower-balance.html|publisher=[[Weebly]]|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cannon Fodder 3''''' is an [[Action game|action]]-[[Strategy video game|strategy]] [[Personal computer|PC]] game developed and published – originally in Russia – by [[Game Factory Interactive]] (GFI), along with developer Burut CT. The game is the second sequel to ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]'', a commercially and critically successful game released for multiple formats in 1993. [[Jon Hare]] and his company [[Sensible Software]], the developers of ''Cannon Fodder'' and its prior sequel, were uninvolved with ''Cannon Fodder 3''.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; GFI instead licensed the intellectual property from now-owner [[Codemasters]].

The game is a combination of action and strategy involving a small number of soldiers battling enemy terrorists. The protagonists are heavily outnumbered and easily killed. The player must rely on strategy and heavy secondary weapons to overcome enemies, their vehicles and installations.

''Cannon Fodder 3'' was released in Russia in December 2011 and – via download service [[GamersGate]] – Europe and North America on 9 February 2012, receiving mixed reviews. Reviewers found the game to be enjoyable but limited and repetitive. The graphics and humour received both positive and negative criticism. Critics derided the poor English translations as well as technical problems.

==Overview==
''Cannon Fodder 3'' has a basic premise involving American soldiers&lt;ref name="pcgamer"/&gt; battling disparate terrorists who have united with the aim of world domination. Like the earlier games in the series, it features a mix of "old school" action and strategy gameplay viewed from an isometric perspective. The player directs a small squad of soldiers, primarily with the mouse though the keyboard is used to deploy additional weaponry.&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt; The control system "is very similar to ‘twin-stick’ shooters like [[Geometry Wars]], except here you control just one of the four soldiers while the others fall in line, shooting when the lead does."&lt;ref name="powerplay"/&gt; Each squad begins with four soldiers. They are fragile (though, possessing [[Health (gaming)|health bars]], are somewhat tougher than the protagonists of the originals),&lt;ref name="strategy informer"/&gt; but increase in status and power should they survive; the player is provided with a replacement squad should all his platoon die. The player can also split the squad into smaller units should strategy so require. The game has an [[Cooperative gameplay|online cooperative]] mode for up to four players,&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt; though Strategy Informer noted this mode is unpopular.&lt;ref name="strategy informer"/&gt; As well as facing large numbers of equally frail enemy infantry, the player must combat vehicles, buildings and turrets which cannot be destroyed with the standard machine guns. For this reason, the player must rely on explosive secondary weapons such as grenades and rockets, which are essential to destroy enemy structures and more powerful units. He can also make use of vehicles – such as tanks and helicopters – as well as various [[power-up]]s.&lt;ref name="powerplay"/&gt; The game features an extensively destructible environment and several settings, including the moon.&lt;ref name="SI interview"/&gt;

==Development==
''Cannon Fodder 3'' is the third installment in the ''Cannon Fodder'' series, the first two games of which – ''Cannon Fodder'' and ''[[Cannon Fodder 2]]'' – were successful across multiple formats in the 1990s. Those games were created by [[Sensible Software]] led by [[Jon Hare]]; Hare later worked on abortive sequels for both the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]], as well as planning a version for [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref name="eurogamer iphone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro iphone"/&gt; However, the publisher [[Codemasters]] had acquired Sensible Software and its intellectual property. In 2008 Codemasters licensed Russian company [[Game Factory Interactive]] (GFI) – which had previously been involved in games such as ''[[Precursors (video game)|The Precursors]]'', ''[[Boiling Point: Road to Hell]]'' and ''[[White Gold: War in Paradise]]'' – to develop ''Cannon Fodder 3''. While English-language media reported on the development in January 2011, GFI was initially permitted only to release the game in Russia and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], with the possibility of a wider European or North American release unclear.&lt;ref name="rockpaper 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt; GFI, described as an "unknown",&lt;ref name="eurogamer 2011"/&gt; or "little-known" company,&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt; published the game in Russia in December 2011, with both GFI&lt;ref name="eurogamer 3feb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rockpaper 2012"/&gt; and Burut CT&lt;ref name="pcgamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer 9feb"/&gt; variously reported as developers. [[Eurogamer]] then reported that Codemasters had clarified the agreement between itself and GFI: Codemasters had reserved the option to publish the game in the UK, but ultimately declined. This allowed GFI to distribute the game out with Russia and dispelled the belief that GFI was not authorised to make such a release.&lt;ref name="eurogamer 9feb"/&gt; The game was released via [[GamersGate]], in Europe and North America, on 9 February 2012.&lt;ref name="digitalspy2"/&gt;

GFI's Oleg Lychaniy stated the developers attempted to retain the most appealing elements of the original ''Cannon Fodder'' while attracting new players. GFI also attempted to retain ''Cannon Fodder's'' "antimilitarist message" and was most proud of the new destructible environment. The developers broadened the variety of weapons and vehicles and changed the level structure by adding sub-missions.&lt;ref name="SI interview"/&gt;

Richard Cobbet, writing in ''[[PC Gamer#PC Gamer UK|PC Gamer UK]]'' said: "just maybe, this is going too far", in reference to images of soldiers' gory corpses cleared from the interface by windscreen wipers. The reviewer expressed bemusement at "Terrorists with robots and plasma guns" antagonists, but reflected – in reference to ''Cannon Fodder 2'' – "Still, could be worse. They could be time-travelling aliens again." He said the "biggest issue" is that a "[[gung-ho]]" approach to play is infeasible and that the "precise and tactical" approach faithful to earlier games in the series "turns out to be a very different experience from before. Far less satisfying". This is due to the "key problem" of the ease with which enemy weapons such as rocket launcher-armed turrets can destroy the player's soldiers. The player is thus forced "to play with aching, paranoid care, picking away at base defences from as far away as possible, and rubbing up against the save points like a lovely cat finally reunited with its owner. This is not fun." He also complained about the arbitrary death inflicted by exploding barrels "raining down over the entire screen." Cobbet summarised that the departure from the original game meant that ''Cannon Fodder 3'' did not evoke nostalgia and was a "poor substitute" for other action or strategy games. On the other hand, he found the game "admittedly nowhere near as frustrating" as the original. He reflected that it "does have a solid crack at updating the action for a new age, and it's far from as bad as expected" given its obscure development.&lt;ref name="pcgamer"/&gt;

[[File:Cannon Fodder 3 screenshot.png|thumb|right|The player's soldiers destroy an enemy building in a snowy locale.]]
Liam Martin of [[Digital Spy]] noted that the variety of locations and weather effects added to the distinctiveness of individual levels. He praised the "simple but effective", "cartoonish" and colorful visual style, the improved detail from the game's predecessors along with the "light-hearted tone" and "spectacular and bloody" gore effects. He praised the destructible environments but thought the characters too small. He felt use of strategy to be "limited" but the action "enormous amounts of explosive fun" and enjoyed the gratification of destroying enemies and buildings with rifles and tanks. The writer found the game a "little repetitive" with a "tendency to grate", which he blamed on somewhat tedious level design, a lack of variety in objectives, a poor [[Virtual camera system|camera]] and long loading times. The lack of a tutorial or [[mini-map]] proved sometimes confusing. He noted the "welcome" but limited on-line cooperative mode. Martin felt the game was "best played in short bursts" and summarised: "Provided you're not expecting a game with much depth or that's oozing innovation, Cannon Fodder 3 proves that virtual war can still be a lot of fun."&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt;

Nathan Cocks of ''[[PC PowerPlay]]'' complained the need for secondary weapons proves frustrating: "It is not uncommon to run out of the weapons needed for the job, forcing the player to engage in a tedious game of hide and seek as they scour the map in the hopes of finding another cache." He wrote: "In fact, tedium is a frequent bedfellow in Cannon Fodder 3", due to the lack of variety in the gameplay and mission objectives. He felt the player's vehicles to be of limited effectiveness as is the ability to split the squad. Cocks complained of the game's "bargain basement production" ruining the tone of the game due to low quality translations and voice acting, as well as numerous bugs causing problems with running the game, crashes, [[Spawning (video gaming)|spawning]] and using vehicles. The reviewer acknowledged the "wonderfully cartoony" graphics, found the gory windscreen wipers "amusing" and wrote "It’s all over-the-top explosive goodness and contributes a great deal to what little appeal is present." Cocks summarised: "Cannon Fodder 3 is the ultimate coat-tail rider [...] perhaps there is some nostalgic pleasure to be taken in this but for the most part, we suggest leaving well enough alone."&lt;ref name="powerplay"/&gt;

Strategy Informer felt the game had updated and improved upon the original, noting better controls, more forgiving health bars and save points, and more engaging mission goals. The reviewer criticised the poor translations and perceived borderline ethnic stereotypes in the enemy characters. Overall the reviewer was impressed by the game, saying "in the end CF3 far exceeded my expectations".&lt;ref name="strategy informer"/&gt; ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' had some praise for the graphics but complained of a lack of any fun and poor camera, controls and level design. The reviewer called the translated dialogue worse than that of ''[[Zero Wing]]''.&lt;ref name="metro review"/&gt; Greece's ''[[Compupress#Key titles|PC Master]]'' praised the game as enjoyable and while somewhat repetitive, a successful update of the ''Cannon Fodder'' series.&lt;ref name="metacritic"/&gt; Czech website Games.cz criticised the game as a failure, with poor graphics, music, sound effects and immature, unimpressive humour, saying the game would only be worth buying at a lower price.&lt;ref name="games.cz"/&gt;

[[File:This Was Your Life.gif|thumb|''This Was Your Life!'' is a Chick tract that was translated in over 100 languages and is described by Chick Publications as its most popular title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.chick.com/catalog/assortments/0915.asp | title=English Tract Assortment Pack | publisher=Chick Tracts | accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Chick tracts''' are short [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[gospel]] [[tract (literature)|tracts]], originally created and published by American publisher and religious cartoonist [[Jack Chick]]. Since his death, his company (Chick Publications) has continued to print new tracts using other authors working for the company.

Although many of Chick's tracts express views that are generally accepted within [[Christian theology]], several tracts have expressed controversial viewpoints. Most notably, Chick tracts were known for expressing strongly [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic views]], as well as his criticisms of other religions including Islam and [[Mormonism]].

==Chick Publications==
Chick Publications produces and markets the Chick tracts, along with other comic books, books, and posters.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Roger (2010) ''Culture Wars: an Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices'', Volume 1 M E Sharpe, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Chick Publications has its headquarters in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Rancho Cucamonga]]&lt;ref name="Company Profile:Chi"&gt;{{cite web
| title=Company Profile:Chick Publications, Inc
| publisher=Dun and Bradstreet, Inc.
| year=2007
| url =http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_c4x0hn
| accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an [[Ontario, California]] mailing address.

The company estimates it has printed over 800 million tracts during its first 50 years of business. On its website they note that "Our ministry is primarily publishing the gospel tracts of Jack T. Chick, but we do occasionally publish a manuscript in book form."&lt;ref name="FAQ: Will Chick Pu"&gt;{{cite web

| date=1984–2008
| url =http://www.chick.com/information/general/chickinfo.asp#publish
| accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that if the content "educates Christians in one of the areas for which we have a tract, we would love to see it" and cite several examples; the online store lists nearly a dozen book categories.&lt;ref name="FAQ: Will Chick Pu"/&gt;

As of January 2015, Chick Publications had produced over 250 different titles, about 100 of which are still in print, and are available in over 100 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| date=2015
| url =http://www.monsterwax.com/chick.html
| accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and storylines==
The tracts themselves are approximately three inches high by five inches wide in dimension, and approximately twenty pages in length.&lt;ref&gt;Bivins (2008) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The material is written in [[comic book]] format, with the front panel featuring the title of the tract and the inside back panel devoted to a standard [[sinner's prayer]]. The back cover of the tract contains a blank space for churches to stamp their name and address; Chick Publications is willing to print custom back covers, but at least 10,000 tracts must be ordered.

The storyline commonly features at least one Christian person and one or more "non-Christians". Depending on the storyline the "non-Christian" may be 1) a stereotypical "wicked person" (such as a criminal; an example being the eponymous character of the tract ''Bad Bob!''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0021/0021_01.asp |title=Bad Bob! |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) a member of a "false religion" (as Chick defines such; an example being the Mormon missionaries from ''The Visitors''),&lt;ref name="The Visitors"&gt;{{cite comic|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0061/0061_01.asp|title=The Visitors|date=1984|writer=Jack Chick}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or 3) a "moral person" depending on "good works" to gain eventual entrance to Heaven (as opposed to salvation through Jesus Christ; an example is the marshal in ''Gun Slinger'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0037/0037_01.asp |title=Gun Slinger |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these storylines, the Christian attempts to convert the non-Christian to [[Christianity]] (and may also feature a contrast where another character, often the "moral person", does not), with the convert receiving entry into [[heaven]], while the person rejecting the message is [[damnation|condemned]] to [[hell]]. The endings may feature a recycled scene in which [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (portrayed as a giant, glowing, faceless figure sitting on a throne) condemns or welcomes a character, an angel taking the believer to Heaven, and/or the non-believer meeting demons upon his/her arrival to Hell.

==Themes==

Chick tracts end with a suggested prayer for the reader to pray to accept [[Jesus Christ]]. In most of these tracts it is a standard [[sinner's prayer]] for [[salvation]]. In the tracts dealing with "false religions", the prayer includes a clause to reject these religions. Included with the prayer are directions for converting to Christianity, which is also repeated on the inside back panel along with steps to take should the reader convert to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/documents/the-nightmare-world-of-jack-t-chick |title=The Nightmare World of Jack T. Chick &amp;#124; Catholic Answers |publisher=Catholic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108154607/http://www.catholic.com/documents/the-nightmare-world-of-jack-t-chick |archivedate=2014-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Strips, Toons, and Bluesies'', written by Douglas Bevan Dowd and [[Todd Hignite]], stated that "it's safe to assume Chick saw at least some" [[Tijuana bible]]s since the books and, according to Dowd and Hignite, Chick tracts were "strikingly similar" to Tijuana bibles; like Tijuana bibles the tracts mostly targeted youth of lower socioeconomic classes and "were loaded with stereotypes". The book stated that Chick tracts contained "way-out, wild" portrayals of recreational drug usage and portrayed "the sexual revolution". In addition the comics included supernatural elements, occult rituals, torture, and cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dowd, Douglas Bevan  |author2=Todd Hignite|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjzlxyfWbxwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA40,M1|title=Strips, Toons, and Bluesies|publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|year=2006|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Anti-Catholicism===
[[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is a frequent target of Chick tracts and other writings. No fewer than twenty of the tracts are devoted to Catholicism, including ''Are Roman Catholics Christians?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0071/0071_01.asp|title=Are Roman Catholics Christians?|date=1985|writer=Jack Chick}}&lt;/ref&gt; (arguing that they are not), ''The Death Cookie''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0074/0074_01.asp|title=The Death Cookie|date=1988|writer=Jack Chick}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a polemic against the Catholic [[Eucharist]]), and ''Why is Mary Crying?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0040/0040_01.asp|title=Why is Mary Crying?|date=1987|writer=Jack Chick}}&lt;/ref&gt; (arguing that Mary does not support the [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|veneration]] Catholicism gives her).&lt;ref name="akin"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Nightmare World of Jack Chick |last= Akin |first= Jimmy |authorlink= Jimmy Akin |year= 2008 |location= San Diego |publisher= [[Catholic Answers]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Chick, defended the controversial [[Alberto Rivera (activist)|Alberto Rivera]] in at least one book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/books/0199.asp|title=Is Alberto For Real?|author=Sidney Hunter|isbn=9780937958292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/comiclist.asp#alberto |title=The compelling testimony of Alberto Rivera, a former Jesuit priest |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an entire series of six full-length comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/comiclist.asp#alberto |title=Comic List |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chick also asserted that the Catholic Church, in a grand conspiracy, created [[Islam]], [[Communism]], [[Nazism]], and [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1077/1077_01.asp|title=Mama's Girls|date=2012|writer=Jack Chick}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The New Anti-Catholicism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Philip |authorlink=Philip Jenkins|  title = The New Anti-Catholicism | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | location = City | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-517604-9| page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; religious historian [[Philip Jenkins]] describes Chick tracts as promulgating "bizarre allegations of Catholic conspiracy and sexual hypocrisy" to perpetuate "[[anti-papal]] and anti-Catholic mythologies". Michael Ian Borer, a sociology professor of [[Furman University]] at the time, described Chick's strong anti-Catholic themes in a 2007 [[American Sociological Association]] presentation&lt;ref&gt;Borer, Michael. (2007) "Drawing Religious Battle Lines: The “Culture Wars Work” of Jack Chick’s Anti-Catholic Cartoons"[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p181814_index.html "Drawing Religious Battle Lines: The “Culture Wars Work” of Jack Chick’s Anti-Catholic Cartoons"] paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in a peer reviewed article the next year in ''Religion and American Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

''[[Catholic Answers]]'' published a response to the claims of Chick Publications against Roman Catholics and a criticism of Chick Tracts in general called ''The Nightmare World of Jack T. Chick'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholic.com/library/sr_chick_tracts.asp |title=The Nightmare World of Jack T. Chick |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904055234/http://www.catholic.com/library/sr_chick_tracts.asp |archivedate=September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the inaccuracies, factual errors, and how a "typical tactic in Chick tracts is to portray Catholics as being unpleasant or revolting in various ways".

===Anti-homosexuality===
Chick tracts are unequivocal and explicit in their opposition to [[homosexuality]], and repeatedly employ two anti-homosexual themes:
*the belief that God hates [[homosexuality]] and considers it to be sinful, and
*the true nature of homosexuality is revealed in the Christian interpretation of the biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] story.

According to Cynthia Burack, Chick's earliest anti-homosexuality tract, ''The Gay Blade''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0084/0084_01.asp |title=The Gay Blade |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (originally written in 1972, revised in 1984 and now out-of-print except by special order), borrowed several of its frames from a 1971 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine photo-essay on the [[Gay Liberation]] movement, but with the images altered to make the gay men look more dissolute or stereotypically feminized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burack | first = Cynthia | title = Sin, Sex, and Democracy | publisher = State University of New York Press | location = Albany | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7914-7405-4 |pages=33–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-evolution===
{{Redirect|Big Daddy?||Big Daddy (disambiguation){{!}}Big Daddy}}
{{further|Evidence of common descent}}
Chick published several [[Objections to evolution|anti-evolution]] tracts, but ''Big Daddy?''&lt;ref name="Big Daddy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0055/0055_01.asp |title=Big Daddy? |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; remains "the most widely distributed anti-evolution booklet in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Moore | first1 = Randy | last2 = Decker | first2 = Mark D.  |title = More than Darwin: an Encyclopedia of the People and Places of the Evolution-Creationism Controversy | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-313-34155-7 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics point out that the ''Big Daddy?'' tract mainly uses [[Kent Hovind]] as a reference, despite the fact that Hovind has no degrees from accredited institutions in the relevant fields, that the thesis referred to is considered to be of very poor quality, and that his claims are at odds with the published statements of experts in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Vickers  | first = Brett  | title = Some Questionable Creationist Credentials  | year = 1998  | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/credentials.html  | accessdate = June 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Bartelt, Ph.D.  | first = Foley  | title = The Dissertation Kent Hovind Doesn't Want You to Read  | year = 2001 | url = http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/bartelt_dissertation_on_hovind_thesis.htm  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070718063636/http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/bartelt_dissertation_on_hovind_thesis.htm |archivedate = 2007-07-18 | accessdate = June 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Foley  | first = Jim  | title = Fossil Hominids: Big Daddy?  | publisher = talkorigins.org  | date = August 31, 2001  | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/bigdaddy.html  | accessdate = June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fowler"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Fowler  | first = Robert B. | title = The World of Jack T. Chick  | year = 2001  | publisher = Last Gasp  | pages= 2–10  | ISBN = 0-86719-512-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Big Daddy?'' is presented in the 2007 book ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters'' as a "typical of the genre" example of just how "misleading and dishonest" [[Creationism|creationist]] presentations are. The examples of the "deceptive and misleading" distortions, misrepresentation, and fabrications presented in that work regarding ''Big Daddy?'' are "[[Nebraska Man]]" (the misinterpretation of which was corrected after only a year and its existence was debated from the beginning&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, John; James S. Mellett (1985) [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/wolfmellett.html "The role of "Nebraska man" in the creation-evolution debate"] ''Creation/Evolution'' 16:31-43, National Center for Science Education&lt;/ref&gt;), "[[New Guinea Man]]" (which is actually ''Homo sapiens''), and the implication "[[Cro-Magnon]]" man was viewed as different from ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Prothero   | first = Donald R.   | authorlink =  | last2=Buell  | first2= Carl Dennis   | title = Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters  | publisher = Columbia University Press  | year = 2007  | pages = 334–335  | isbn = 0-231-13962-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Satanism and Satanic influence===
[[File:Nervous Witch 20.png|350px|thumb|A page from ''"The Nervous Witch"'', a Chick tract depicting the purportedly occult dangers of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series.]]
The concept of malign influences led to the theme of [[spiritual warfare]] being frequently portrayed in the tracts.  Chick considered all forms of [[witchcraft]] to be demonic, regardless of whether it was "white witchcraft" (i.e. purportedly using such gifts for good) or "black witchcraft" (i.e. purportedly using such gifts for evil). ''Gladys''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/5017/5017_01.asp |title=Gladys |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of one of Chick's tracts on this issue.
Consistent with his views on demonic influence, Chick also considered [[Halloween]] to be "the devil's holiday" and opposed Christians celebrating it, with one notable exception &amp;ndash; Chick did not oppose Christians engaging in the traditional Halloween custom of passing out candy to neighborhood children, considering it to be an opportunity to present the Gospel message via his tracts.&lt;ref&gt;Chick portrayed this dramatically in the tract ''The Little Princess'' (http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0063/0063_01.asp), the story of a terminally-ill young girl who receives a Chick tract from her neighbors on Halloween, accepts Christ and has the neighbors share the Gospel with her family, before dying later that night.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Chick's views on Satanism and [[Satan]]ic influence, ''Catholic Answers'' states that "Chick portrays a world full of paranoia and conspiracy where nothing is what it seems and nearly everything is a Satanic plot to lead people to hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The tracts' claims about conspiracies are based in large part on the testimony of people who claim to have been members of these groups before converting to [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christianity, most prominently [[Alberto Rivera (activist)|Alberto Rivera]] and William Schnoebelen. Many of Chick's critics consider these sources to be frauds or [[fantasy|fantasists]].&lt;ref name="fowler" /&gt; One such case was "The Prophet"&lt;ref name=Prophet&gt;{{cite comic

==Parodies and popular culture==

===In film===
* A live-action film [[Dark Dungeons (film)|''Dark Dungeons'']], based on the Chick tract of the same name that warns against the supposed evil influence of ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', was released in August 2014. Producer JR Ralls was given the rights to the tract for free after contacting Chick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Edidin |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/dark-dungeons-movie/ |title=A Fearmongering Anti-RPG Comic Gets the Film Adaptation It Deserves &amp;#124; Underwire |publisher=WIRED |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In print===
Some [[cartoonist]]s have published [[parodies]] that mimic Chick tracts' familiar layout and narrative conventions. Examples include:

==Criticism==
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has designated Chick Publications as an active [[hate group]].&lt;ref name="Active U.S. Hate"&gt;{{cite web
 | title=Active General Hate Groups
 | publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]
 | url=http://www.splcenter.org/node/105/activegroups
 | accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The group was listed due to its strong anti-Catholic, anti-Muslim, and anti-homosexual rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2011/11/02/pastor-apologizes-for-hate-filled-halloween-hand-out/|title=Pastor Apologizes For Hate-filled Halloween Hand-out|website=splcenter.org|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chick's views on homosexuality have angered gay activists since his first tract on the subject in 1972 (''The Gay Blade'' tract warned of a gay agenda to push for same sex marriage and urged homosexuals to repent so they could make it into heaven).

Chick's critics (such as [[talk.origins]], [[Hindu American Foundation]], and [[Catholic Answers]]) have accused him of misrepresentation.

The [[Hindu American Foundation]] put out an electronic PDF paper called "Hyperlink to [[Hinduphobia]]: Online Hatred, Extremism and Bigotry Against [[Hindus]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduamericanfoundation.org/pdf/hate_report_2007.pdf |title=Hyperlink to Hinduphobia: Online Hatred, Extremism and Bigotry Against Hindus |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains a section on Chick's site; the paper ends with the statement "Chick Publications promotes hatred not just against Hindus, but also towards Muslims, Catholics, and others as is evidenced by the following titles of their tracts: 'Last Rites – When this Catholic dies, he learns that his church couldn't save him';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0082/0082_01.asp |title=Last Rites |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'The Little Bride – Protect children against being recruited as Muslims.

In October 2011, the Northview Baptist Church in [[Hillsboro, Ohio]] gave out copies of the Chick tract ''Mean Momma''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1068/1068_01.asp |title=Mean Momma, Chick Publications |publisher=Chick.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with candy at [[Halloween]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mean Momma'' tells the story of Petunia Parker, hated by the town for her prior actions and her delinquent raising of her three sons; she scornfully rejects the church and refuses to fear God, only to have all three children die.  The tract shows a gruesome detail of one child [[suicide by hanging|hanging himself]], while a caption quotes that "the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away" while showing a tornado hitting her house, killing her only remaining child (the first died in a car crash while attempting to elude law enforcement).&lt;/ref&gt; The church received complaints from parishioners, and its pastor apologized for issuing the tracts, saying that, "Our church does not endorse this type of extreme methodology that was represented in this particular tract, and we can assure you that we will not let this happen again ... our church is a loving church that loves souls and wants to do all we can in our community to help as well as spread and share the Gospel message of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wnewsj.com/Main.asp?SectionID=49&amp;SubSectionID=156&amp;ArticleID=194019|title=Pastor apologizes for pamphlet handed out to trick-or-treaters|date=4 November 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=16 May 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062748/http://wnewsj.com/Main.asp?SectionID=49&amp;SubSectionID=156&amp;ArticleID=194019|archivedate=4 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Chick tract ''Unforgiven''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1043/1043_01.asp|title= Unforgiven |website=Chick Publications |date=2007 |accessdate=Jan 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was distributed by Bible Baptist Church in [[Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia]] and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract tells the story of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told [[WDBJ-TV]] that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. "It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true," he said. "It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, 'If you weren't my grandma, I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar.{{'"}} In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he will "die in [his] sins" and be unforgiven by God if he does not. But the young man is not swayed by her pleas. "I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!" he screams. "Get out of my house, you infidel!" Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/06/12/i-choose-muhammad-the-fiery-christian-tract-that-has-some-muslims-up-in-arms |title='I Choose Muhammad!': The Fiery Christian Tract That Has Some Muslims Up in Arms |website=[[TheBlaze]] |date=Jun 12, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cirque Plume''' is an internationally renowned [[contemporary circus]] company founded in 1984 by Bernard Kudlak in the [[Franche-Comté]] region of [[France]].

French newspaper ''[[Le Parisien]]'' has described Cirque Plume as "the oldest of the New Circuses... It is one of the rare troupes who seem to be able to reconcile both the children, numerous in the audience... and adults, uncomfortable with the traditional circus, but who are rather in search of a certain atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;Yves Jaegle. [http://www.cirqueplume.com/archives/melanges/melanges/gb/presse/leparisiengb.htm "Envolez-vous avec le Cirque Plume."] ''Le Parisien''. 29 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[Le Figaro]]'', "The word circus here is what you see and what you get. The techniques of juggling, acrobatics or flying trapeze are totally respected. Their chief originality is the way in which they are all brought into the gigantic mixer."&lt;ref&gt;François de Santerre. [http://www.cirqueplume.com/archives/melanges/melanges/gb/presse/lefigarogb.htm "Un merveilleux truc en plumes."] ''Le Figaro''.  1 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">The '''Dance Music [[Hall of Fame]]''' was an organization established in 2003 to honor and remember significant contributors to the genre of [[dance music]].  It had its first inductions in 2004 but went inactive after the 2005 induction ceremony.

==History==
The Dance Music Hall of Fame was created in 2003 when music industry veteran John Parker ([[Robbins Entertainment]]) thought that something needed to be done to honor the creators and innovators of [[dance music]].  He enlisted the help of Eddie O'Loughlin ([[Next Plateau Records]]) initially and then they brought [[Daniel Glass]] (Glassworks), [[Tom Silverman]] ([[Tommy Boy Records]]) &amp; Brian Chin (noted dance music writer/historian) in to form the organization.  The Dance Music Hall of Fame recognizes the contributions of those who have had a significant impact on the evolution and development of dance music and celebrates the history and significance of the genre.

Artists, Producers, Record, Remixer and DJs that helped to shape the dance music industry become eligible for induction 25 years after their first contribution or record release.  Criteria include the influence and significance of the nominee's contributions to dance music.
The Dance Music Hall Of Fame Board of Advisers was composed of dance music professionals, historians and journalists.  When the nominees were selected the ballots were sent to an international voting committee of over 1,000 dance music experts.  An awards ceremony announcing the inductees in the Dance Music Hall Of Fame would take place annually at a formal dinner event in New York.

Due to financial differences among the Board members, The Dance Music Hall of Fame ceased operations after its second ceremony in 2005.

When ''American Gladiators'' returned to the U.S. airwaves on [[ESPN Classic]] on April 1, 2007, the network aired a marathon of episodes. Clark was the on-air host for that marathon, telling behind-the-scenes stories and trivia about the series in between the episodes. Clark also conducted an ESPN chat session related with the show and was one of the producers of the revamped "[[American Gladiator]]" on NBC that debuted to over 40 million viewers in 2010 making it one of the highest rated debuts of the season.

'''''Dick Tracy''''' is an American [[comic strip]] featuring [[Dick Tracy (character)|Dick Tracy]] (originally Plainclothes Tracy),&lt;ref&gt;[[American Pickers]], Urban Cowboys&lt;/ref&gt; a tough and intelligent police detective created by [[Chester Gould]]. The strip made its debut on October 14, 1931, in the ''[[Detroit Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name=ME/&gt; It was distributed by the [[Tribune Media Services|Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate]]. Gould wrote and drew the strip until 1972.&lt;ref name="ME"&gt;webpage:
[https://www.dicktracymuseum.com/timeline-1/]:
notes villains and includes short bio of Chester Gould.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, various artists and writers have continued the strip, which still runs in newspapers today. Dick Tracy has also been the hero in a number of films, [[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|notably one]] in which [[Warren Beatty]] played the crime fighter in 1990.

===Characters and story===
{{POV section|date=May 2013}}
Tracy uses [[forensic science]], advanced gadgetry, and wits in an early example of the [[police procedural]] mystery story&amp;mdash;although stories often end in gunfights just the same. Stories typically follow a criminal committing a crime and Tracy's relentless pursuit of said criminal. The strip's most popular [[List of Dick Tracy villain debuts|villain]] was [[Flattop (Dick Tracy villain)|Flattop Jones]], a freelance hitman hired by [[black market]]eers to murder Tracy. When Flattop was killed, fans went into public mourning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Flattop story was reprinted in ''[[Limited Collectors' Edition]]'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly|first=Rob|title=The World's Second Greatest Detective: Dick Tracy |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=48–49|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villains' small crimes led to bigger, out-of-control situations, reflecting [[film noir]]. Similarly, innocent witnesses were frequently killed, and Tracy's paramour [[Tess Trueheart (character)|Tess Trueheart]] was often endangered by the villains. As the story progressed, Tracy adopted an orphan under the name Dick Tracy Jr., or "Junior" for short, who appeared in investigations until becoming a police [[forensic artist]] in his father's precinct. He also cultivated a professional partner, ex-steelworker Pat Patton, who gradually became a detective of skill and courage enough to satisfy Tracy's requirements.
{{Original research section|date=November 2014}}
Tracy characters were often caricatures of celebrities. There was [[Breathless Mahoney]], modeled after [[Veronica Lake]].{{sfn|Roberts|1993|pp=105&amp;ndash;6}} Likewise, B.O. Plenty was inspired by [[George "Gabby" Hayes]] (with perhaps a nod to [[Al St. John]] also), Vitamin Flintheart by [[John Barrymore]],{{sfn|Roberts|1993|p=99}} and Spike Dyke by [[Spike Jones]]. Others include villains like Rughead ([[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), Oodles ([[Jackie Gleason]]) and Mumbles ([[Bing Crosby]]).  Gould even parodied himself as the out-of-shape Pearshape.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Evolution of the strip===
{{anchor|WristRadio}}
On January 13, 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Garyn G. Roberts, ''Dick Tracy and American Culture: Morality and Mythology, Text and Context'' (McFarland, 2003), p38&lt;/ref&gt; the 2-Way Wrist Radio became one of the strip's most immediately recognizable icons, worn as a wristwatch by Tracy and members of the police force. This radio wristwatch inspired [[Martin_Cooper_(inventor)|Martin Cooper]]'s invention of the smartphone, and may have inspired later [[smartwatch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-dick-tracy-invented-smartwatch-180954506/ |title=How Dick Tracy Invented the Smartwatch |date=March 9, 2015 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2-Way Wrist Radio was upgraded to a 2-Way Wrist TV in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;https://infostory.com/2011/01/24/the-evolution-of-dick-tracys-wristwatch/&lt;/ref&gt; This development also led to the introduction of an important supporting character, Diet Smith, an eccentric industrialist who financed the development of this equipment. In a conspicuous coincidence, the idea of a radio built into a wrist watch played an important role in the story line of "Superman – The Talking Cat" broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System on January 9 through 28, 1946 (episodes 878 through 891).

In late 1948, a botched security detail led to the death of the semi-regular character Brilliant, the [[Blindness|blind]] inventor of the 2-Way Wrist Radio (among other devices) whereupon Chief Brandon, Dick Tracy's superior on the police force and a presence in the strip since 1931, resigned in shame and Pat Patton was promoted to police chief in Brandon's place, previously having been Tracy's buffoonish partner. A new character was introduced named Sam Catchem to take Patton's place as Tracy's sidekick.

===The 1950s===
[[File:Spike Dyke Dick Tracy.jpg|right|thumb|370px|In 1949, [[Spike Jones]] was caricatured in the ''Dick Tracy'' dailies as Spike Dyke.]]
Gould introduced topical story lines about television, [[juvenile delinquency]], [[Police corruption|graft]], [[organized crime]], and other developments in American life during the 1950s; and elements of [[soap opera]] depicted Dick, Tess, and Junior (along with the Tracys' baby daughter Bonnie Braids) at home as a family. Depictions of family life alternated with the story's crime drama, as in the kidnapping of Bonnie Braids by fugitive Crewy Lou, or Junior's girlfriend Model being accidentally killed by her brother.

Gould incurred some controversy when he had Tracy live in an unaccountably ostentatious manner on a police officer's salary, and responded with a story wherein Tracy was accused of corruption and had to explain the origin of his possessions in detail. In his book-length examination of the strip, ''Dick Tracy – The Official Biography'', Jay Maeder suggested that Gould's critics were unsatisfied by his explanation. Nevertheless, the controversy eventually faded, and the cartoonist reduced exposure to Tracy's home life.
[[File:Dicktracy10121941.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Chester Gould's ''Dick Tracy'' vs "The Mole" (October 12, 1941)]]
Tracy's cases generally incriminated independent operators rather than organized crime—with a few exceptions, such as [[Alphonse "Big Boy" Caprice|Big Boy]], a fictionalized version of [[Al Capone]] and the strip's first villain. Tracy opposed a series of big-time mobsters in the 1950s, such as the King, George "Mr. Crime" Alpha, Odds Zonn, and Willie "The Fifth" Millyun, after events like the [[Kefauver Hearings]]. As Tess faded into the background, Tracy assumed as assistant the rookie policewoman Lizz Worthington.

From 1956 to 1964, the ''Dick Tracy'' Sunday page was accompanied by a [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] humor strip called ''The Gravies'' and drawn by Gould and his assistants.

===Space period===
As technology progressed, the methods that Tracy and the police used to track and capture criminals took the form of increasingly fanciful [[atom]]ic-powered gadgets developed by Diet Smith Industries. This eventually led to the 1960s advent of the Space Coupe, a spacecraft with a magnetic propulsion system. This marked the beginning of the strip's "Space Period," which saw Tracy and friends having adventures on the Moon and meeting [[Moon Maid (comics)|Moon Maid]], the daughter of the leader of a race of humanoid people living in "Moon Valley" in 1964. After an eventual sharing of technological information, Moon technology became standard issue on Tracy's police force, including air cars, flying cylindrical vehicles. The villains became even more exaggerated in power, resulting in an escalating series of stories that no longer resembled the urban crime drama roots of the strip. During this period, Tracy met famed cartoonist Chet Jade, creator of the comic strip ''Sawdust'', in which the only characters are talking dots.

One of the new characters, Mr. Intro, was only manifested as a disembodied voice. His goal was world domination in the vein of a [[James Bond]] villain. Tracy eventually used an atomic laser beam to annihilate Intro and his island base.

Junior married Moon Maid in October 1964. Their daughter Honey Moon Tracy had antennae and magnetic hands. In the spring of 1969, Tracy was offered the post of Chief of Police in Moon Valley. However, he ended up back on Earth when the [[Apollo 11]] mission in 1969 showed that the moon was barren of all life. Many of the accoutrements of the space period stories remained for many years afterward, such as the Space Coupe and much of the high-tech gadgetry. Moon Maid receded from the storyline.

The stories of this period took an increasingly condemnatory tone pertaining to contemporary court decisions concerning the [[rights of the accused]], which often involved Tracy being frustrated by legal technicalities. For example, having caught a gang of diamond thieves red-handed, Tracy was forced to let them walk because he could not ''prove'' beyond a reasonable doubt that the diamonds were stolen. As he saw the thieves get off without penalty, Tracy was heard to grumble, "Yes, under today's interpretation of the laws, it seems it's the police who are handcuffed!"

===1970s===
[[File:Tracydickmarch870.jpg|thumb|400px|Color guide for ''Dick Tracy'' (March 8, 1970)]]
In the 1970s, Gould modernized Tracy by giving him a longer hair style and [[mustache]], and added a [[hippie]] [[sidekick]], Groovy Grove. Groovy's first appearance in print, as it happened, occurred during the same week as the [[Kent State shootings]]. Groovy remained with the strip, off and on until his death in 1984.

Shortly before his retirement, Gould drew a strip in which Sam, Lizz, and Groovy held Tracy down to shave off his mustache.

At this time, the standard publication size and space of newspaper comics was sharply reduced; for example, the ''Dick Tracy'' [[Sunday strip]], which had traditionally been a full-page episode containing 12 panels, was cut in size to a half-page format that offered, at most, eight panels—these new restrictions created challenges for all comic artists.

===Plenty family===
The Plenty family was a group of goofy [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] yokels headed by the former villain Bob Oscar ("B.O."), along with Gertrude ("Gravel Gertie") Plenty. Gravel Gertie was introduced as the unwitting dupe (accessory) of the villain the Brow, who was on the run from Dick Tracy. The family provided a humorous counterpoint to Tracy's adventures. The Plenty sub-story was decades long, and saw Sparkle Plenty grow from an infant to a young married lady, eventually becoming a beautiful fashion model. Sparkle Plenty's May 30, 1947 birth became a significant mainstream media event, with spinoff merchandising and magazine coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/big-deals-comics-highest-profile-moments/ "Big Deals: Comics’ Highest-Profile Moments," ''Hogan's Alley'' #17, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plenty family appeared with Tracy in a story that occurred in a bank, where "B.O." found a way to prevent thieves from snatching an envelope of money from a counter.

In the April 24, 2011 strip, B.O. and Gertie had a second child, Attitude,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocomics.com/dicktracy/2011/04/24 Dick Tracy comic strip] (via GoComics), April 24, 2011. Retrieved October 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; a boy who is as ugly as Sparkle is beautiful. His face has yet to be shown.

===Crimestoppers' Textbook===
Beginning in the early 1950s, the Sunday strip included a frame devoted to a page from the "Crimestoppers' Textbook", a series of handy illustrated hints for the amateur crime-fighter. This was named after a short-lived youth group seen in the strip during the late 1940s, led by Junior Tracy, called "Dick Tracy's Crimestoppers." This feature ended when Gould retired from the strip in 1977, but Max Allan Collins reinstated it, and it is still part of the comic strip. After Gould's retirement, Collins initially replaced the Textbook with "Dick Tracy's Rogues Gallery," a salute to memorable ''Tracy'' villains of the past.

===Later years===
Chester Gould retired from comics in 1977; his last ''Dick Tracy'' strip appeared in print on Sunday, December 25 (Christmas Day) of that same year. The following Monday, ''Dick Tracy'' was taken over by [[Max Allan Collins]] and longtime Gould's assistant [[Rick Fletcher]]. Gould's name remained in the byline for a few years after his retirement as a story consultant.

In one of Collins' first stories as the strip's writer, the gangster known as [[Alphonse "Big Boy" Caprice|"Big Boy"]] learned that he was dying and had less than a year to live. Big Boy was still seeking revenge on the plainclothesman who sent him up the river, and he wanted to live just long enough to see Tracy's death. He put out an open contract on Tracy's head worth one million dollars, knowing that every small-time hood in the City would take a crack at the famous cop for that amount of money. One of the would-be collectors rigged Tracy's car to explode, but inadvertently killed Moon Maid instead of Tracy in the explosion. A funeral strip for Moon Maid explicitly stated that this officially severed all ties between Earth and the Moon in the strip,&lt;ref&gt;''Dick Tracy'', August 13, 1978. Strip reprinted in ''Dick Tracy – The Official Biography'' by Jay Maeder, 1990 (color plate #12).&lt;/ref&gt; thus eliminating the last remnants of the Space Period. Honeymoon received a new hairstyle that covered her antennae, and she was ultimately phased out of the strip. Junior later married Sparkle Plenty (the daughter of B.O. and Gravel Gertie Plenty), and had a daughter named Sparkle Plenty Jr. In the 1990s, Tracy's son Joseph Flintheart Tracy took on a role similar to Junior's in the earlier strips.

In addition, Collins removed other Gould creations of the 1960s and 1970s (including Groovy Grove, who was gravely wounded in the line of duty and later died in the hospital; Lizz married him before his death). On a more philosophical level, Collins took a generally less cynical view of the [[justice system]] than Gould; Tracy came to accept its limitations and requirements as a normal part of the process which he could manage. Extreme technology was phased out, such as the Space Coupe, in favor of more realistic advanced tools such as the 2-Way Wrist Computer in 1987.

New semi-regular characters introduced by Collins and Fletcher included: Dr. Will Carver, a [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] with underworld ties who often worked on known felons; Wendy Wichel, a smarmy newspaper reporter/editorialist with a strong anti-Tracy bias in her articles; and Lee Ebony, an African-American female detective. Vitamin Flintheart reappeared occasionally as a comic-relief figure, the aged ham actor created by Gould in 1944 who had not been seen in the strip for almost three decades. The Plenty family (B.O., Gravel Gertie, and Sparkle) were also brought back as semi-regulars; Junior and Sparkle were married following the death of Moon Maid, and soon gave birth to their own daughter Sparkle Plenty, Jr.

Original villains seen during this period included Angeltop (the revenge-seeking, [[psychopathic]] daughter of the slain Flattop), Torcher (whose scheme was arson-for-profit), and Splitscreen (a video pirate). Collins brought back at least one "classic" Gould villain or revenge-seeking family member per year. The revived Gould villains were often provided with full names, and marriages, children, and other family connections were developed, bringing more humanity to many of the originally grotesque brutes. "Flattop", particularly, had a number of relatives, all with his characteristic head structure and facial attributes, who turned up one by one to avenge their ancestor on Tracy.

Rick Fletcher died in 1983 and was succeeded by editorial cartoonist [[Dick Locher]], who had assisted Gould on the strip in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Locher was assisted by his son John, who died in 1986.

Max Allan Collins was fired from the strip in 1992, following a financial reorganization of their comic strip holdings, and ''Tribune'' staff writer and columnist [[Mike Kilian]] took over the writing. Kilian was paid less than half of what Collins was making per strip {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, but continued until his death on October 27, 2005. Locher was both author and artist for over three years, beginning on January 9, 2006. On March 16, 2009, [[Jim Brozman]] began collaborating with Locher, taking over the drawing duties while Locher continued to write the strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2009/03/17/jim-brozman-working-with-locher-on-dick-tracy/ Jim Brozman working with Locher on Dick Tracy The Daily Cartoonist]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Tracy was a guest at Blondie and Dagwood's 75th anniversary party in the comic strip ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]''. Later, Dick Tracy appeared in the comic strip ''[[Gasoline Alley]]''.

On January 19, 2011, [[Tribune Media Services]] announced that Locher was retiring from the strip and handing the reins to artist [[Joe Staton]] and writer [[Mike Curtis (writer)|Mike Curtis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/01/dick-locher-passes-tms-dick-tracy-to-new-artist-writer.html Chicago Tribune: Dick Locher passes 'Dick Tracy' to new artist, writer]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64kDO4xXp?url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/01/dick-locher-passes-tms-dick-tracy-to-new-artist-writer.html |date=January 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Phil |authorlink=Phil Rosenthal |title=Dick Locher passes TMS' 'Dick Tracy' to new artist, writer |work=Tower Ticker |publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' |date=January 19, 2011 |url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/01/dick-locher-passes-tms-dick-tracy-to-new-artist-writer.html |accessdate=January 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64kDO4xXp?url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/01/dick-locher-passes-tms-dick-tracy-to-new-artist-writer.html |archivedate=January 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new creative team has previously worked together on ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]]'', and'' [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/blog/dick-locher-hangs-up-his-fedora/ The Comics Journal: Dick Locher Hangs Up His Fedora]&lt;/ref&gt; Their first Dick Tracy strip was published March 14, 2011. Staton and Curtis are assisted by Shelley Pleger, who inks and letters Staton's drawings, along with Shane Fisher, who provides the coloring on the Sunday strips.  Chicago-area police sergeant Jim Doherty provided "Crimestopper" captions for the Sunday strips and acted as the feature's [[technical advisor]].  Doherty also introduced a new feature, "Tracy's Hall of Fame" (which replaces the "Crimestopper" panel approximately once each month), in which a real-life police officer is profiled and honored. Doherty was replaced in 2016 by police lieutenant Walter Reimer, who introduced the "First Responders Roll of Honor", which honors real-life police officers, firefighters and paramedics who died on duty.

Staton and Curtis reintroduced many of the characters of the forties through the sixties, including a second Mr. Crime and a reformed Mole, while introducing more deformed and grotesque villains such as Abner Kadaver, Panda, and The Jumbler. They have also brought back all the gadgets and plot elements of the 1960s space era, starting in early 2013, although the reintroduced Moon Maid is not the same as the original; rather, she is a human genetically modified to resemble the original Moon Maid and thus, is christened Mysta Chimera and placed under Diet Smith's care. They have also done crossovers, with cameos from ''[[Popeye]]'', ''[[Brenda Starr, Reporter]]'', ''[[Funky Winkerbean]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicsalliance.com/dick-tracy-funky-winterbean-crossove/ 'Funky Winkerbean' And 'Dick Tracy' Are Crossing Over]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fearless Fosdick]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/29917-dick-tracy-meets-his-hillbilly-match-in-unique-comic-strip-crossover.htmlDICK TRACY Meets His Hillbilly Match In Unique Comic Strip Crossover],&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Spirit]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicsalliance.com/dick-tracy-spirit-crossover/ 'Dick Tracy' Is Hanging Out With The Spirit (And More)],&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Green Hornet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dicktracy.info/2018-dick-tracy-green-hornet-crossover/ 2018 Dick Tracy / Green Hornet Crossover!],&lt;/ref&gt; [[For Better or For Worse]], and a long sequence involving ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]''.

==Awards and honors==
Chester Gould won the [[Reuben Award]] for the strip in 1959 and 1977.

The [[Mystery Writers of America]] honored Gould and his work with a Special [[Edgar Award]] in 1980.  This was the first time MWA ever honored a comic strip.

==In other media==
===Radio===
{{Main article|Dick Tracy (radio series)}}

''Dick Tracy'' had a long run on radio, from 1934 weekdays on NBC's New England stations to the ABC network in 1948. Bob Burlen was the first radio Tracy in 1934, and others heard in the role during the 1930s and 1940s were Barry Thomson, [[Ned Wever]] and [[Matt Crowley]]. The early shows all had 15-minute episodes.

On CBS, with Sterling Products as sponsor, the serial aired four times a week from February 4, 1935 to July 11, 1935, moving to Mutual from September 30, 1935 to March 24, 1937 with Bill McClintock doing the sound effects. NBC's weekday afternoon run from January 3, 1938 to April 28, 1939 had sound effects by Keene Crockett and was sponsored by Quaker Oats, which brought ''Dick Tracy'' into primetime (Saturdays at 7&amp;nbsp;pm and, briefly, Mondays at 8&amp;nbsp;pm) with 30-minute episodes from April 29, 1939 to September 30, 1939. The series returned to 15-minute episodes on the ABC Blue Network from March 15, 1943 to July 16, 1948, sponsored by [[Tootsie Roll]], which used the music theme of "Toot Toot, Tootsie" for its 30-minute Saturday ABC series from October 6, 1945 to June 1, 1946. Sound effects on ABC were supplied by Walt McDonough and Al Finelli.

On February 15, 1945, ''[[Command Performance (radio series)|Command Performance]]'' broadcast the musical comedy ''[[Dick Tracy in B-Flat]]'' with [[Bing Crosby]] as Tracy, [[Bob Hope]] as Flattop, [[Dinah Shore]] as Tess Trueheart, among the cast. Dick Tracy's wedding is repeatedly interrupted as Tracy chases after one villain after another. In the strip, his marriage wasn't until 1950 and his honeymoon was disrupted by his going after [[List of Dick Tracy villains#1940s|Wormy]].

===Recordings===
[[Jim Ameche]] portrayed Tracy in a two-record set recorded by [[Mercury Records]] in 1947. The record sleeves were illustrated with [[Sunday strip]]s reprinted in black-and-white for children to color.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dgwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT16&amp;dq=martin+block&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=skXzTMPxKc-mnQel_cD0Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20block&amp;f=false ''Billboard'', July 26, 1947.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
[[File:Gould1947.jpg|upright|thumb|Chester Gould's cover for 1947 Quaker [[Puffed Wheat]] giveaway comic book reprinting early 1940s ''Dick Tracy'' strips.]]
Tracy made his first comic book appearance in 1936 as one of the features included in the first issue of [[Dell Comics|Dell's]] ''Popular Comics''. These were reprints from the newspaper strip, reconfigured to fit the pages of a comic book, as was the case with most Tracy comic book appearances. Tracy remained a regular feature in ''Popular Comics'' through the publication's 21st issue.

The first comic book to feature Tracy exclusively was the ''Dick Tracy Feature Book'', published in May 1937 by [[David McKay Publications]]. McKay's Feature Books were magazines that rotated several popular characters from comics strips through 1938. Three more of McKay's Feature Books starred Tracy in the following months.

In 1939, Dell started a comic magazine series called "Black and White Comics," essentially identical to McKay's "Feature Books." Six of the 15 issues featured Tracy. In 1941, Dell's "Black and White" series was replaced by the "Large Feature Books," the third issue of which featured Tracy. As with the McKay series, the Dell "Black and White" and "Large Feature" series were abridged reprints of the strip.

In 1938, ''Tracy'' became one of several regular newspaper strips featured in Dell's regular monthly ''Super Comics'', remaining a regular part of that publication until 1948. In 1939, ''Tracy'' was the sole feature in the very first issue of Dell's ''[[Four Color|Four-Color Comics]]'', which put out more than 1,300 issues starring hundreds of characters between 1939 and 1962. Tracy was featured in seven more ''Four-Color'' issues throughout the 1940s.

Tracy was frequently featured in comic books used as promotional items by various companies. In 1947, for example, Sig Feuchtwanger produced a comic book that was a giveaway prize in boxes of [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker]] Puffed Wheat cereal, sponsor of the popular ''Dick Tracy'' radio series.

In January 1948, Dell began the first regular ''Dick Tracy'' comic book series, ''Dick Tracy Monthly''. This series ultimately ran for 145 issues, the first 24 of which were published by Dell, after which it was picked up by [[Harvey Comics]]. Continuing the same numbering, Harvey published the series until 1961. As with most previous Tracy comic book incarnations, these were, with the exception of the last few Dell issues which featured original material, slightly abridged and reconfigured reprints of the newspaper strips.

''Dick Tracy'' was revived in 1986 by [[Blackthorne Publishing]] and ran for 99 issues. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] produced a series of three issues as a tie-in for their 1990 film. This miniseries, ''True Hearts and Tommy Guns'', was drawn by [[Kyle Baker]] and edited by [[Len Wein]]. The third issue was a direct adaptation of the film.

In 2018, [[IDW Publishing]] announced a new ''Dick Tracy'' comic book by [[Mike Allred]] (co-writer/cover artist/inker), Lee Allred (co-writer), Rich Tommaso (penciller) and [[Laura Allred]] (colorist). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/dick-tracy-mike-allred-idw-comic-book/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
Over the years, many reprints of ''Dick Tracy'' newspaper strips have been published. Beginning in 2006, [[IDW Publishing]] started reprinting the complete strip in hardcover volumes, eventually being done under their [[The Library of American Comics]] imprint.

===Film===
====Film serials====
Dick Tracy made his film debut in ''[[Dick Tracy (serial)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1937), a 15-chapter [[serial (film)|movie serial]] by [[Republic Pictures]] starring [[Ralph Byrd]].&lt;ref name="DTM-20150218"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Dick  Tracy Museum - February 18, 2015 |url=http://www.dicktracymuseum.com/headquarters/at-the-movies/ |date=February 18, 2015 |work=[[Old McHenry County Courthouse#Chester Gould-Dick Tracy Museum|Chester Gould Dick Tracy Museum]] |accessdate=February 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spider Gang was on the loose, tired of Dick Tracy's cunning skills. Through the 15-chapter serial, 15 different cases were solved, all plots by the Spider Gang. Dick Tracy was also in search of his missing brother, Gordon Tracy ([[Carleton Young]]). The Dick Tracy character proved very popular, and a second serial, ''[[Dick Tracy Returns]]'', appeared in 1938 (reissued in 1948). ''[[Dick Tracy's G-Men]]'' was released in 1939 (reissued in 1955). The last was ''[[Dick Tracy vs. Crime Inc.]]'' in 1941 (reissued as ''Dick Tracy vs. the Phantom Empire'' in 1952).

The sequels were produced under an interpretation of the contract for the first ''Dick Tracy'' serial, which gave license for "a series or serial". As a result, Chester Gould received no further money for the sequel serials.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In these serials, Dick Tracy is portrayed as an [[FBI]] agent, or "[[G-Man (slang)|G-Man]]", based in California rather than as a detective in the police force of a [[Midwestern]] city resembling Chicago, and, aside from himself and Junior, no characters from the strip appear in any of the four films.

However, comic relief sidekick "Mike McGurk" bears some resemblance to Tracy's partner from the strip, Pat Patton; Tracy's secretary, Gwen Andrews (played by several actresses in the course of the series, including [[Jennifer Jones (actor)|Jennifer Jones]] under a variation of her real name, Phyllis Isley), provides the same kind of feminine interest as Tess Trueheart; and FBI Director Clive Anderson ([[Francis X. Bushman]] and others) is the same kind of avuncular superior as Chief Brandon.

The first serial, ''Dick Tracy'', is now in the [[public domain]].

====Early feature films====
Six years after the release of the final Republic serial, Dick Tracy headlined four feature films, produced by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. ''[[Dick Tracy (1945 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (a.k.a. ''Dick Tracy, Detective'') (1945) was followed by ''[[Dick Tracy vs. Cueball]]'' in 1946, both with [[Morgan Conway]] as Tracy. Ralph Byrd returned for the last two features, both released in 1947: ''[[Dick Tracy's Dilemma]]'' and ''[[Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome]]''. ''Gruesome'' is probably the best known of the four, with the villain portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]]. All four movies had many of the visual features associated with [[film noir]]: dramatic, shadowy photographic compositions, with many exterior scenes filmed at night (at the RKO Encino [[movie ranch]]). Lyle Latell co-starred in all four films as Pat Patton. [[Anne Jeffreys]] played Tess Trueheart in the first two, succeeded by Kay Christopher and finally [[Anne Gwynne]]; [[Ian Keith]] joined the cast as the actor Vitamin Flintheart for two films; Joseph Crehan played Chief Brandon. RKO stocked the films with familiar faces, creating a veritable rogues' gallery of characters: [[Mike Mazurki]] as Splitface, [[Dick Wessel]] as Cueball, [[Esther Howard]] as Filthy Flora, [[Jack Lambert (American actor)|Jack Lambert]] as hook-handed villain The Claw; baldheaded, pop-eyed Milton Parsons, mild-mannered [[Byron Foulger]], dangerous [[Trevor Bardette]] and pockmarked, gently sinister [[Skelton Knaggs]].

====1990 film====
{{Main|Dick Tracy (1990 film)}}
In 1990, [[Warren Beatty]] directed and starred as the title character in a live action [[ensemble cast|all-star-cast]] film along with [[Al Pacino]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].

The strip has had limited exposure on television with one early live-action series, two animated series, one unsold pilot that was never picked up, and a proposed TV series currently held up in litigation.

====First live-action series====
[[Ralph Byrd]], who had played the square-jawed sleuth in all four Republic movie serials, and in two of the RKO feature-length films, reprised his role in a short-lived live-action ''Dick Tracy'' series that ran on ABC from 1950 to 1951. Additional episodes intended for first-run [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] continued to be produced into 1952. Produced by P. K. Palmer, who also wrote many of the scripts, the series often featured Gould-created villains such as [[Flattop Jones|Flattop]], Shaky, the Mole, Breathless Mahoney, Heels Beals, and Influence, all of whom appeared on film for the first time on this series. Other cast members included Joe Devlin as Sam Catchem, Angela Greene as Tess Tracy (née Trueheart), Martin Dean as Junior, and [[Pierre Watkin]] as Chief Patton. Criticized for its violence, the series remained popular. It ended, not in response to criticism, but because of Byrd's unexpected, premature death in 1952. The series was filmed on a low budget, with many long hours and a rushed shooting schedule. Many episodes of this series have been released on various public domain TV detective DVD sets.

====Animated cartoons====
{{Main|The Dick Tracy Show}}
[[File:Dicktracy1961cartoon.jpg|right|thumb|180px|DVD release of the 1961 cartoon.]]
The first cartoon series was produced from 1960 to 1961 by [[United Productions of America|UPA]]. Tracy employed a series of cartoon-like subordinate flatfoots to fight crime each week, contacting them on his two-way wrist radio. [[Everett Sloane]] voiced Tracy and supporting characters and villains were voiced by Jerry Hausner, [[Mel Blanc]], [[Benny Rubin]], Johnny Coons, [[Paul Frees]] and others. These subordinates included "Go-Go" Gomez, [[Joe Jitsu (Dick Tracy)|Joe Jitsu]], Hemlock Holmes and the Retouchables, and Officer Heap O'Calorie. 130 five-minute cartoons were designed and packaged for syndication, usually intended for local children's shows.

UPA was also the production company behind the [[Mr. Magoo]] cartoons, so it was possible for them to arrange a meeting between Tracy and Magoo in a 1965 episode of the season-long TV series ''[[The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo]]''. In the episode ''Dick Tracy and the Mob'', Tracy persuades Magoo (a well-known actor in the context of the ''Famous Adventures'' series) to impersonate an international hit man named Squinty Eyes, who he resembles, and infiltrate a gang of criminals made up of Flattop, Pruneface, Itchy, Mumbles and others. Unlike the earlier animated Tracy shorts, this longer episode was played relatively straight, with Tracy getting much more screen time. Pitting Tracy against a coalition of several of his foes was adopted more than two decades later in the [[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|1990 film]].

A second cartoon series was produced in 1971 and was a feature in ''[[Archie's TV Funnies]]'', produced by [[Filmation]]. It adhered more closely to the comic strip, although it was hampered by cruder animation than the UPA shorts, typical of the studio's production standards.

====Live-action television pilot====
[[William Dozier]] produced a pilot for a live-action Dick Tracy series in 1967 starring [[Ray MacDonnell]] in the title role. (Dozier was the producer responsible for the 1966 ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series.) The pilot was "The Plot To Kill NATO", featuring "Special Guest Villain" [[Victor Buono]] as 'Mr. Memory'. The quality was slightly above-average, but the series was not purchased by either [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] or [[NBC]], as ratings for the ''Batman'' series were dropping and a similar series featuring ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' had recently flopped. To the networks, the "Hero Camp" or ''[[Batmania]]'' craze was dying, and they chose not to take a risk on another series.

The pilot is notable for a phantom credit. [[Eve Plumb]], who would later find fame as Jan Brady on ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', is credited for a character named Bonnie Braids, who does not appear in the pilot.

===Licensed products===
[[File:Jo-Jo0736.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Dick Tracy Rapid-Fire Tommy Gun]] 
In the 1960s, [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] produced a plastic model kit of Dick Tracy sliding down a fire escape ladder into an alley, in hot pursuit with gun drawn. A Dick Tracy Space Coupe model came next.  Both have been reissued by Polar Lights.  Also in the market were Mattel's Dick Tracy range of [[toy gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjS2pPCyUSk&amp;feature=related TV Advertisement]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Playmates Toys]] released a line of action figures called ''Dick Tracy: Coppers and Gangsters'' to coincide with the Dick Tracy movie. The figures were 5" tall, stylized with exaggerated comicy looks and came with lots of accessories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualtoychest.com/dicktracy/dicktracy.html Dick Tracy: Coppers and Gangsters]&lt;/ref&gt; Two figures in the line had limited availability; Steve the Tramp (called "The Tramp" on the package front) was pulled from the assortment after complaints of portrayal of a homeless person as a criminal. The figure of "The Blank" was added to the assortment well after the film's release to keep the secret of the identity of the character. As a result, only limited quantities of these two figures made it to store shelves.

The Dick Tracy video game was developed by [[Titus Software]] in 1990. It was ported to many platforms including Amiga, Commodore and MS-DOS. ''Dick Tracy'' is a side scrolling action shooting game. The player controls Dick Tracy through five stages.&lt;ref&gt;Mobygames: [http://www.mobygames.com/game/dick-tracy__ Dick Tracy]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also games made for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (1990), [[Sega Master System]] (1990), [[Sega Genesis]] (1990), and [[Game Boy]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?q=Dick+Tracy Mobygames]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Shocker Toys]] released a [[monochromatic]] Dick Tracy action figure as an exclusive product for the [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. The figure appears in a suit with two-way wrist radio. There was also a variant figure released of Dick Tracy in his signature trench coat and fedora with a [[tommy gun]] accessory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shockertoys.com/ Shocker Toys]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights to adapt in other media===
Media outlets reported a legal battle being waged over rights to the Dick Tracy character. Warren Beatty announced plans to make a sequel to his 1990 movie. At the same time, television producers announced plans for a new ''Dick Tracy'' TV series. Both sides claimed that they were the legal owners of the rights to Dick Tracy. In May 2005, Beatty sued the Tribune Company, claiming he has owned the rights to the Dick Tracy character since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/dick_tracy_and_the_attached_sub_rider/The Comics Reporter] [[Tom Spurgeon|Spurgeon, Tom]] (2005). "Dick Tracy and the Attached Sub-Rider". ''The Comics Reporter''. Retrieved 2006-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure from Beatty led to the cancellation of a proposed collaboration between artist [[Mike Oeming]] and writer [[Brian Bendis]] on a new serialized Dick Tracy comic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traffic.libsyn.com/wordballoon/WBbendistapes0610pt4.mp3 /Word Balloon] John Siuntres (2010). "The Bendis Tapes Part 4: Secret Origin of Manuel Sanchez". "Word Balloon". Accessed 2010-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit was resolved in Beatty's favor, with a US District judge ruling that Beatty did everything contractually required of him to keep the rights to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/03/25/dick-tracy-warren-beatty-finally-gets-his-man/ | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Dick Tracy: Warren Beatty finally gets his man | date = March 25, 2011 | accessdate = October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The superhero [[The Tick]] had several villains that made fun of the disfigurements of Dick Tracy villains, including Chairface.
* The artist Jess Collins used an [[X-Acto]] knife and rubber cement to reassemble Gould's strip into ''Tricky Cad''. Gould threatened to sue if the ''Tricky Cad'' collages were published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com/2009/10/jess-collins-images-from-tricky-cad.html Poems and Poetics: ''Tricky Cad'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Al Capp]]'s satiric comic strip ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', there was a long-running [[parody]] of ''Dick Tracy'' called ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]''. An intermittent, strip-within-the-strip feature in ''Li'l Abner'', ''Fosdick'' lampooned every aspect of ''Dick Tracy''—from Fosdick's impossibly square-jawed profile to his propensity for bullet-riddled "ventilation." The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely burlesqued ''Tracy'', complete with outrageous villains, ludicrously satirical plotlines, and ramped-up cartoon violence. Whatever Capp really thought of ''Dick Tracy'', he was always careful to praise Gould and his strip in conversation and in print, invariably referring to it as "Chester Gould's magnificent ''Dick Tracy''."
* On February 15, 1945, ''[[Command Performance (radio series)|Command Performance]]'' presented "Dick Tracy in B Flat," or "For Goodness Sakes, Isn't He Ever Going To Marry Tess Trueheart?" Billed as "the world's first comic strip operetta", it starred [[Bing Crosby]] as Dick Tracy, [[Dinah Shore]] as Tess Trueheart, and [[Bob Hope]] as [[Flattop Jones]]. The cast also included [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] (police chief), [[Frank Morgan]] (Vitamin Flintheart), [[Jimmy Durante]] (The Mole), [[Judy Garland]] (Snowflake Falls), [[The Andrews Sisters]] (The Summer Sisters—May, June &amp; July), [[Frank Sinatra]] (Shaky), [[Cass Daley]] (Gravel Gertie), and [[Harry Von Zell]] (narrator).The storyline has Dick Tracy's wedding with Tess Trueheart repeatedly interrupted by major villains putting Tracy in elaborate deathtraps.
* Dick Tracy is also spoofed in the comic strip ''[[Red Meat]]'' by [[Max Cannon]]. The character of ''Stacy'' is a down on his luck alcoholic kicked off the force.
* A classic Warner Bros. cartoon with [[Daffy Duck]] called ''[[The Great Piggy Bank Robbery]]'' spoofed Dick Tracy as "Duck Twacy". The cartoon was directed by WB legend [[Bob Clampett]] in 1946. Daffy wore Dick's yellow hat again in a [[Tiny Toons]] episode where [[Plucky Duck]] becomes the protagonist of a Dick-Tracy-themed [[dream sequence]] just like Daffy did in TGPBR. Also, in ''Easter Yeggs'', Elmer Fudd says "I can't miss with my Dick Twacy hat!"
* The [[United Productions of America|UPA]] version of Dick Tracy was scheduled to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene "Acme's Funeral" from the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.[http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2014/05/08/storyboards-reveal-what-marvin-acme-s-funeral-in-quot-who-framed-roger-rabbit-quot-would-have-looked-like.aspx] Dick Tracy already appeared as a cameo in the novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'' by [[Gary K. Wolf]]. [https://www.mouseplanet.com/8606/The_Roger_Rabbit_That_Never_Was] Roger briefly imitates Tracy when cuffing himself and Eddie Valiant. In Toontown, Valiant's shadow also briefly takes on the form of Tracy.
* The "Crimestopper's Textbook" was parodied in two editions of ''[[The Stan Freberg Show]]'' in 1957, both in a discussion sketch called "Face the Funnies." In the first, a self-proclaimed ''Dick Tracy'' expert (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) advised, "If [[Vandalism|vandals]] [[Kidnapping|kidnap]] you, look for [[fingerprint]]s on or about your person." In the second example, Butler said, "If someone shoots you in the chest, extract the bullet and look for small tell-tale bore markings on the [[Shotgun slug|slug]], and then call a doctor."
* ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' once eulogized Tracy as having died from [[lead poisoning]], which resulted from being shot in the left shoulder 47 times (noting Gould's repeatedly showing Tracy being wounded in that spot). Other issues of ''Mad'' showed Tracy identifying Pruneface despite a facelift (by viewing his still-wrinkled [[buttock]]s), or ranting in ''[[Doonesbury]]'' style about changing trends in police procedures. (In the latter, Junior suggests "There's always the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]!") A parody of the 1990 film was also made, where Warren Beatty's Tracy is killed in the end by the Blank, who reveals himself to be the original comic strip-style Dick Tracy.
* In issue No. 5, October/November 1954, ''Mad'''s sister magazine, ''Panic'', ran a full-length Tracy parody titled "Tick Dracy."
* Parody show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' parodied the Dick Tracy strips labeling of villains based on their facial features. Tracy nicknames everybody in an insulting way. It is later revealed that Tracy himself is named Dick because his head looks like the head of a penis.
* Parodying a period when Tracy was blind, ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]'' [[Underground comix]] books featured '''Tricky Prickears''', a very conservative blind and deaf detective. These comic-within-a comic episodes appeared under the heading ''Crime Stoppers, Mein Kampf''.
* [[Maxwell House]]'s 'hug-a-mug' 80's TV commercials sometimes featured cartoon Dick Tracy cameos, including one where he is sitting at a live action diner counter along with some live action cops. As Tracy raises his coffee mug, his two-way wrist radio sounds. He tilts his wrist to listen, only to have the coffee spill to the amusement of the cops.
* The February 1949 issue of ''[[The Yale Record]]'' (cover titled ''Record Comics'') contains several full-color comics parodies, including the Dick Tracy parody called "Hotshot Stacy". In this two-page feature, the detective pursues "The Head", a man with a giant egg-shaped head, and corners him at the head; literally, an outhouse. During the strip, The Head puts "Bright Boy" through a meat grinder. The art is signed by Sylvester Goul, in the style of Chester Gould's signature. The whole magazine is a precursor to the comics parodies in early issues of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''.
* In 1960, American Pop artist [[Andy Warhol]] made several paintings, each called ''Dick Tracy'', reproducing Gould's hero in a faux [[Abstract Expressionist]] style.
* In 1974, Tracy appeared with [[Clark Kent]] and [[Shazam!]] in a commercial for [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette's]] "The Dry Look" men's hair spray. 
* In the 80's, Spanish cartoonist [[Marti Riera]] updated the style with his graphic pastiche "[[The Cabbie (comics)|The Cabbie]]", an even grittier take on Dick Tracy's world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-cabbie-vol.-1-pre-order-with-special-offer-5.html "The Cabbie" – Official presentation at [[Fantagraphics]].]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode, "[[Hurricane Neddy]]", [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] shows his "Prune Tracy" remark, which is a pun on Dick Tracy and Pruneface, while Dr. Foster had stopped the name, "Dick Face".
* In the novel ''[[Trueman Bradley]]'', by [[Alexei Maxim Russell]], the autistic detective who is the hero of the story becomes obsessed with classic comic book detectives and seeks to emulate Dick Tracy, specifically, in order to motivate him and help unlock his own detective powers.

'''[[Digital audio]] cassette''' formats introduced to the [[professional audio]] and consumer markets:

*[[Digital Audio Tape]] (or DAT) is the most well-known, and had some success as an audio storage format among professionals and "prosumers" before the prices of [[hard drive]] and solid-state [[flash memory]]-based [[digital recording]] devices dropped in the late 1990s. Hard-drive recording has mostly made DAT obsolete, as [[hard disk recorder]]s offer more editing versatility than tape, and easier importation into [[digital audio workstation]]s (DAWs) and [[non-linear video editing]] (NLE) systems.
*[[Digital Compact Cassette]] was intended as a digital replacement for the mass-market [[Compact audio cassette|analog cassette tape]], but received very little attention or adaptation. Its failure is generally attributed to higher production costs than [[Compact disc|audio CDs]], and lukewarm reception by consumers.

'''Digital [[videocassette]]s''' include:

* [[Betacam IMX]] ([[Sony]])
* [[D-VHS]] ([[JVC]])
* [[D1 (Sony)|D1]] ([[Sony]])
* [[D2 (video format)|D2]] ([[Sony]])
* [[D3 (video)|D3]]
* [[D5 HD]]
* [[Digital-S]] D9 ([[JVC]])
* [[Digital Betacam]] ([[Sony]])
* [[Digital8]] ([[Sony]])
* [[DV]]
* [[HDV]]
* [[ProHD]] ([[JVC]])
* [[MiniDV]]

'''Analog cassettes used as digital data storage:'''
*Historically, the [[Compact audio cassette]] which was originally designed for [[analog signal|analog]] storage of music was used as an alternative to [[disk drive]]s in the late 1970s and early 1980s to provide [[Compact Cassette#Data recording|data storage]] for [[home computer]]s.
*The [[ADAT]] system uses [[Super VHS]] tapes to record 8 synchronized digital audiotracks at once.
*There have also been several audio recording systems which used [[VHS]] [[VCR|video recorders]] as storage devices and [[video tape]] transports, generally by encoding the digital data to be recorded into an analog [[composite video]] signal (which resembles static) and then recording this to [[magnetic tape]]. These systems were generally used as "mixdown" recorders, to record the finished mix from a [[Multitrack recording|multi-track recorder]] in preparation for the manufacture of a vinyl record, cassette tape, or CD. An example was the [[dbx Model 700 Digital Audio Processor|dbx Model 700]].
*Several companies sold VHS backup solutions in the 80s and 90s where data was converted to a video image which was then saved on a VHS tape [http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/VideoBackup.html].

'''''Entertainment Tonight UK''''' (usually presented on screen as simply '''''Entertainment Tonight''''') is a British version of the celebrity news show ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''. The British show is fronted by [[Amanda Byram]] and launched in January 2005 on pay TV channel [[Sky One]], which also screens episodes of the US version a day after the American broadcast.

The British version airs in a weekly hour-long slot and places particular emphasis on British-born celebrities now based in Hollywood [http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds17363.html 1], though the show also recycles some content from the US version.

'''Aquarium filters''' are critical components of both freshwater and marine aquaria.&lt;ref name="baensch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Riehl |first=Rüdiger. Editor. |author2=Baensch, HA |title=Aquarium Atlas |year=1996|edition=5th |publisher=Tetra Press |location=Germany |isbn=3-88244-050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FKGSAC"&gt;Leibel WS  (1993) ''A fishkeepers guide to South American cichlids.''

Furthermore, aquarium filters are necessary to support life as aquaria are relatively small, closed volumes of water compared to the natural environment of most fish.&lt;ref name="FKGCC"&gt;Sands D  (1994) ''A fishkeepers guide to Central American cichlids.'' Tetra Press. Belgium pg 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Animals, typically fish, kept in [[Aquarium|fish tanks]] produce waste from excrement and respiration.  Another source of waste is uneaten food or plants and fish which have died.  These waste products collect in the tanks and contaminate the water.  As the degree of contamination rises, the risk to the health of the aquaria increases and removal of the contamination becomes critical.  Filtration is a common method used for maintenance of healthy aquaria.

===Biological filtration and the nitrogen cycle===
[[File:KoiPondTrickleFilter.jpg|right|175px|thumb|A large shower biological filter designed to maximize the beneficial effects of the nitrogen cycle, in a [[koi pond]]]]
Proper management of the [[nitrogen cycle]] is a vital element of a successful aquarium.  Excretia and other decomposing organic matter produce [[ammonia]] which is highly toxic to fish.  Bacterial processes oxidize this ammonia into the slightly less toxic [[nitrites]], and these are in turn oxidized to form the much less toxic [[nitrates]].  In the natural environment these nitrates are subsequently taken up by plants as fertilizer and this does indeed happen to some extent in an aquarium planted with real plants.

An aquarium is, however, an imperfect microcosm of the natural world.  Aquariums are usually much more densely stocked with fish than the natural environment.  This increases the amount of ammonia produced in the relatively small volume of the aquarium.  The bacteria responsible for breaking down the ammonia colonize the surface of any objects inside the aquarium.  In most cases, a biological filter is nothing more than a chemically inert porous sponge, which provides a greatly enlarged surface area on which these bacteria can develop.  These bacterial colonies take several weeks to form, during which time the aquarium is vulnerable to a condition commonly known as "new tank syndrome" if stocked with fish too quickly. Some systems incorporate bacteria capable of converting nitrates into nitrogen gas.&lt;ref name="aquariumslife.com"&gt;http://www.aquariumslife.com/diy-projects/diy-aquariumdenitrator&lt;/ref&gt;

Accumulation of toxic ammonia from decomposing wastes is the largest cause of fish mortality in new, poorly maintained, or overloaded aquariums.&lt;ref name="isbn0-85199-443-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patrick T. K. Woo; David W. Bruno |title=Diseases and disorders of finfish in cage culture |publisher=CABI Pub |location=Wallingford, Oxon, UK |year=2002 |pages=284 |isbn=0-85199-443-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the artificial environment of the aquarium, the nitrogen cycle effectively ends with the production of nitrates.  In order that the nitrate level does not build up to a harmful level regular partial water changes are required to remove the nitrates and introduce new, uncontaminated water.&lt;ref name="aquacadabra.com"&gt;http://www.aquacadabra.com/blog/the-basics-of-filtration&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical and chemical filtration===
The process of mechanical filtration removes particulate material from the water column. This particulate matter may include uneaten food, feces or plant or algal debris. Mechanical filtration is typically achieved by passing water through materials which act as a sieve, physically trapping the particulate matter.&lt;ref name="baensch"/&gt;  Removal of solid waste can be as simple as physical hand netting of debris, and/or involve highly complex equipment.  All removal of solid wastes involve filtering water through some form of mesh in a process known as '''mechanical filtration'''.  The solid wastes are first collected, and then must be physically removed from the aquarium system.  Mechanical filtration is ultimately ineffective if the solid wastes are not removed from the filter, and are allowed to decay and dissolve in the water.

Dissolved wastes are more difficult to remove from the water.  Several techniques, collectively known as '''chemical filtration''', are used for the removal of dissolved wastes, the most popular being the use of [[activated carbon]] and [[foam fractionation]].  To a certain extent, healthy plants extract dissolved chemical wastes from water when they grow, so plants can serve a role in the containment of dissolved wastes.

A final and less common situation requiring filtration involves the desire to sterilize water-borne pathogens.  This sterilization is accomplished by passing aquarium water through filtration devices which expose the water to high intensity ultraviolet light and/or exposing the water to dissolved ozone gas.

==Materials suitable for aquarium filtration==
[[File:Filtermaterial 060227.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Sponges, plastic balls, ceramic tubes and gravel are all suitable for aquarium filtration]]
Numerous materials are suitable as aquarium filtration media. These include synthetic wools, known in the aquarium hobby as filter wool, made of [[polyethylene terephthalate]] or [[nylon]]. [[Sponge (tool)|Synthetic sponges or foams]], various ceramic and [[Sintered glass filter#Filter media|sintered glass]] and silicon products along with igneous [[gravel]]s are also used as mechanical filter materials. Materials with a greater surface area provide both mechanical and biological filtration. Some filter materials, such as plastic "bioballs", are best used for biological filtration.

With the notable exception of diatom filters, aquarium filters are rarely purely mechanical in action, as bacteria will colonise most filter materials effecting some degree of biological filtration.&lt;ref name="baensch"/&gt; [[Activated carbon]] and [[zeolites]] are also frequently added to aquarium filters. These highly [[porous]] materials act as [[Adsorption|adsorbates]] binding various chemicals to their large external surfaces&lt;ref name="FKGSAC"/&gt; and also as sites of bacterial colonisation.

The simplest type of aquarium filter consists only of filter wool and activated carbon. The filter wool traps large debris and particles, and the activated carbon [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] smaller impurities. These should be changed regularly at suitable intervals.&lt;ref name=axelrod&gt;{{cite book | title = Exotic Tropical Fishes | last = Axelrod | first = Herbert, R. | publisher = T.F.H. Publications. | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-87666-543-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is particularly important in the case of activated carbon filters, which may re-release their adsorbed contents in large (and therefore harmful) doses if they are allowed to saturate.&lt;ref name=eade&gt;{{cite book | title = Coldwater Fishkeeping | last = Eade | first = Andrew | publisher = Ringpress Books | pages = 33 | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-86054-072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activated carbon adsorbs toxins on the extended porous surface of the carbon. It cannot be reactivated by boiling in water. The adsorption of activated carbon can be restored by [[Activated carbon#Reactivation and regeneration|thermal regeneration]] at temperatures of 500–900&amp;nbsp;°C (932–1,652&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref name=sabio&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sabio | first = E. | authorlink =  | author2 = Gonzalez, E. | author3 = Gonzalez, J.

For the aquarist, replacing the activated carbon with fresh material is simple and inexpensive.

==Types of aquarium filters==
[[File:Aquarium - external filter.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A commercially available canister filter]]
Numerous types of aquarium filters are commercially available,&lt;ref name="rich"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Aquarium Fish Handbook|pages=26|author=Mary Bailey|author2=Nick Dakin|publisher=[[New Holland Publishers]]|year=2001|isbn=978-1-85974-190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

===Power filters===
Power or HOB (hang on back) filters, typically powered by an [[impeller]], remove water from the aquarium, which is then pushed (or pulled) through a series of different filter media and returned to the aquarium. These are the most common filter.&lt;ref name="baensch"/&gt; They are usually more effective and easier to maintain than internal filters.&lt;ref name=Sanford&gt;{{cite book | title = Aquarium Owner's Guide | last = Sanford | first = Gina | publisher = [[DK Publishing]] | location = New York | year = 1999 | pages = 164–167 | isbn = 0-7894-4614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of this type of filter are that they allow for a selection of different types of filter media depending on the tank needs, and that they are easy to clean without disturbing the inhabitants of the tank because they sit on the outside of the fish tank. Disadvantages of power filters include their smaller capacity for filter media compared to canister filters, and  noise resulting from vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aquariumfishhub.com/freshwater-aquariums/freshwater-aquarium-filters/#Hang_on_back_filters_also_known_as_power_filters|title=Freshwater Aquarium Filters – Aquarium Fish Hub|website=aquariumfishhub.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canister filters====
Compared to filters that hang on the back of the aquarium, canister-style external filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice.&lt;ref name="FKGSAC"/&gt; Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two [[siphon]]s, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).

Benefits of this type of filter are that they can provide a high volume of filter material without reducing the internal space in the aquarium, and that they can be disconnected from the tank for cleaning/maintenance and replaced without disturbing the aquarium interior or occupants. Also, as a filter with external plumbing, it supports in-line installation of other aquarium equipment, such as water heaters and [[carbon dioxide]] diffusers. Such equipment can be removed from the tank and installed in-line into the return pipe of the filter.  Disadvantages of canister filters include the increased cost and complexity relative to internal filters and difficulties in cleaning the tubes which transfer water to and from the aquarium.&lt;ref name="Loiselle"/&gt; There is also the risk of a leak, which naturally is an issue for any filter placed outside of the aquarium.

Canister filters were initially designed to filter drinking water, under low pressure. Canister filters for aquariums use high water pressure, from a properly powered pump, to force water through the dense filter media. A pump can draw water from an under-gravel filter, and run it into a canister for double filtration.

====Diatom filters====
Diatom filters are used only for sporadic cleaning of tanks, they are not continuously operated on aquariums. These filters utilise [[diatomaceous earth]] to create an extremely fine filter down to 1&amp;nbsp;µm which removes particulate matter from the water column.&lt;ref name="baensch"/&gt;

====Trickle filters====
{{see also|Trickling filter}}
&lt;!-- this section needs references and rewrites, it's a copy and paste from [[Wet_dry_filter]], now a redirect) --&gt;
Trickle filters, also known as wet/dry filters are another water filtration systems for marine and freshwater aquariums.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt; This filter comes in two configurations, one which is placed on top of the aquarium (more rarely seen) and one which is placed below the aquarium (more common).

If the wet/dry filter is placed on top of the aquarium, water is pumped over a number of perforated trays containing filter wool or some other filter material. The water trickles through the trays, keeping the filter wool wet but not completely submerged, allowing [[Aerobic organism|aerobic bacteria]] to grow and aiding biological filtration. The water returns to the aquarium like rain.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt;

Alternatively, the wet/dry filter may be placed below the tank. In this design, water is fed by gravity to the filter below the aquarium. Prefiltered water is delivered to a perforated plate (drip plate). Prefiltering may take place in the aquarium via a foam block or sleeve in the overflow, or [[weir]] siphon, or it may be prefiltered by filter wool resting on the perforated plate. The waste laden water from the aquarium spreads over the drip plate, and rains down through a medium. This may be a filter wool/plastic grid rolled into a circular shape (DLS or "Double Layer Spiral") or any number of plastic media commonly known as Bio Balls. As the water cascades over the media, CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; is given off, oxygen is picked up, and bacteria convert the waste from the tank into less harmful materials. From here the water enters the sump. The sump may contain a number of compartments, each with its own filtration material. Often, heaters and thermostats are placed in the sump.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt;

====Algae filters====
{{see also|Algae scrubber}}
[[File:Modern floating surface algae scrubber filter, floating on top of aquarium.jpg|thumb|201x201px|[[Algae scrubber]] (upflow version) floating on a reef pond]]
Algae may be grown purposely, which removes chemicals from the water which need to be removed in order to have healthy fish, invertebrates and corals. This is a natural ("green") filtering method, which lets an aquarium operate the way oceans and lakes operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reefbase.org/resource_center/publication/main.aspx?refid=10859 Nutrient Cycling In The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium. Proceedings of the 6th International Coral Reef Symposium, Australia, 1988, Vol. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Algae and disease-causing organisms can also be removed by treating the water with [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Aquarium and pond|ultraviolet irradiation]], but the drawback of UV is that it will kill beneficial bacteria as well. Therefore, UV treatment is typically used only when needed, and not all the time.

====Baffle filters====
[[File:Baffle filter.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A newly set up baffle filter, under a large volume [[cichlid]] aquarium]]
Baffle filters are similar to wet and dry, trickle filters in that they are generally situated below the aquarium. This type of filter consists of a series of baffles that the water must pass through in order to reach the pump which is returning water to the aquarium. These baffles then act much like a series of canister filters and can be filled with different filter media for different purposes.&lt;ref name="Sandford&amp;Crow"&gt;Sandford G, Crow R (1991) ''The Manual of Tank Busters.'' Tetra Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fluidized bed filter====
[[File:Fluidized.jpg|thumb|130 px|Simple DIY fluidized sand bed filter]]
The [[fluidized bed]] filter (FBF) is a biological reactor only. The principle is to direct water through a sand (or similar media) bed from below so that the sand becomes fluidized – behaves like a fluid. This mechanism is seen in [[liquefaction]], [[quick sand]], and industrial processes including municipal [[sewage]] treatment. The combined surface of all sand particles in the filter is very large, and so there is a large surface for aerobic [[denitrification]] bacteria. Therefore, the size of the filter can be modest.

The filter itself can be internal or external. In its simplest [[DIY]] internal version an FBF is very easy to build, with a container, sand, pump, and some plumbing. There are many variables: shape and size of the container, quantity of sand or equivalent, particle sizes, the pump's power, and plumbing.

===Internal filters===
[[File:Internal filter2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|An internal aquarium filter driven by air displacement]]
Internal filters are, by definition, filters within the confines of the aquarium. These include the sponge filter, variations on the corner filter (pictured top right and left), foam cartridge filter and the undergravel filter.&lt;ref name="baensch"/&gt; An internal filter may have an electric pump and thus be an internal power filter, often attached to the inside of aquaria via suction cups.

====Airlift filters====
Sponge filters and corner filters (sometimes called box filters) work by essentially the same mechanism as an internal filter. Both generally work by [[airlift pump|airlift]], using bubbles from an air pump rising in a tube to create flow. In a sponge filter, the inlet may only be covered by a simple open-cell block of foam. A corner filter is slightly more complex. These filters are often placed in the corner on the bottom of the aquarium. Water enters slits in the box, passes through a layer of medium, then exits through the airlift tube to return to the aquarium. These filters tend to only be suitable for small and lightly stocked aquaria. The sponge filter is especially useful for rearing fry where the sponge prevents the small fish from entering the filter.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt;

====Undergravel filters====
[[File:Undergravel filter.svg|thumb|right|260px|A schematic diagram of an undergravel filter run by both an air displacement and water pump (powerhead)]]
One of the oldest types of filters, the undergravel filters consist of a porous plate which is placed beneath the gravel on the base of the aquarium and one, or more, uplift tubes. Historically, undergravel filters have been driven via air displacement. Air stones are placed at the base of uplift tubes which force water out of the uplift tube creating negative pressure beneath the undergravel filter plate (also called the plenum).&lt;ref name="Spotte1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spotte|first=Stephen|title=Marine Aquarium Keeping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0lJAtPDxvoC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=14 October 2014|date=1993-07-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471594895|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water then percolates down through the gravel which itself is the filtration material.&lt;ref name="baensch"/&gt; Greater flow rate of water through the gravel can be achieved via the use of water pump rather than air displacement.&lt;ref name="baensch"/&gt;

Beneficial bacteria colonize the gravel bed and provide biological filtration, using the [[substrate (aquarium)|substrate]] of the aquarium itself as a biological filter.&lt;ref name=axelrod/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt;

Undergravel filters can be detrimental to the health of aquatic plants.&lt;ref name=axelrod/&gt; Fine substrates such as sand or peat may clog an undergravel filter.&lt;ref name=Sanford/&gt; Undergravel filters are not effective if the substrate bed is uneven.  In an uneven gravel bed, water will flow only through the thin portions of the bed, leaving the more heavily covered areas to become [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12777">'''Heroic bloodshed''' is a genre of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] revolving around stylized action sequences and dramatic themes such as brotherhood, duty, honour, redemption and [[violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hong Kong's Heroic Bloodshed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpAIAAAACAAJ|last=Fitzgerald|first=Martin|year=2000 |publisher=Pocket Essentials |isbn=1-903047-07-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A-Z of Cult Films and Film-Makers |last=Davies |first=Steven Paul |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Batsford |location= |isbn=0-7134-8704-6 |pages=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''heroic bloodshed'' was coined by editor Rick Baker in the magazine ''Eastern Heroes''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hong Kong Action Cinema |last=Logan |first=Bey |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Overlook Press |location= |isbn=0-87951-663-1 |pages=191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1980s, specifically referring to the styles of directors [[John Woo]] and [[Ringo Lam]]. Baker defined the genre as "a Hong Kong action film that features a lot of [[Gun fu|gun play]] and [[Gangster film|gangsters]] rather than [[kung fu]]. Lots of blood. Lots of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=City on Fire: Hong Kong Cinema |last=Stokes |first=Lisa Odham |authorlink= |author2=Michael Hoover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AGX0YSmaYYC&amp;pg=PA333|year=1999 |publisher=Verso |location= |isbn=1-85984-716-1 |pages=333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo's breakthrough film ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' (1986) largely set the template for the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morton |first=Lisa |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=The Cinema of Tsui Hark |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hv3yJ6MaoYsC&amp;pg=PA62 |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2001 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0-7864-0990-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo has also been a major influence in its continued popularity and evolution in his following works, namely ''[[A Better Tomorrow 2]]'' (1987), ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'' (1989) and ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morton |first=Lisa |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=The Cinema of Tsui Hark |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hv3yJ6MaoYsC&amp;pg=PA62 |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2001 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0-7864-0990-8 |oclc= |doi= |pages=62 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}

The heroic bloodshed genre had a considerable impact on [[world cinema]], including [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Diplomat"&gt;{{cite news|last=Volodzko|first=David|title=30 Years Later, This Chinese Film Still Echoes in Hollywood|url=https://thediplomat.com/2015/06/30-years-later-this-chinese-film-still-echoes-in-hollywood/|work=[[The Diplomat]]|date=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo introduced his brand of heroic bloodshed to Hollywood in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fang|first1=Karen|title=John Woo's A Better Tomorrow: Autobiographical Stories by Modern Chinese Women Writers|date=2004|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|isbn=9789622096523|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BogcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lam's ''[[City on Fire (1987 film)|City on Fire]]'' (1987) inspired [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spicer|first1=Andrew|title=Historical Dictionary of Film Noir|date=2010|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|isbn=9780810873780|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixVekSdvQCMC&amp;pg=PA141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarantino was an admirer of the heroic bloodshed genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ingham|first1=Michael|title=Johnnie To Kei-Fung's PTU|date=2009|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|isbn=9789622099197|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ROqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Killer'' also heavily influenced [[Luc Besson]]’s ''[[Léon: The Professional]]'' (1994).&lt;ref name="Diplomat"/&gt;

==Motifs==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Protagonists in these films are often good-willed criminals, typically [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] members, [[Hit man|hit men]], or thieves with a strict code of ethics, which in some cases leads to the betrayal of their employers and the saving of many intended victims. The police officer with a conscience, who cannot be corrupted in any way, is also common, and is usually modeled after the [[Hardboiled|hardboiled detective]]. Loyalty, family and brotherhood are the most typical themes of the genre. Heroic bloodshed films generally have a strong emotional angle, not only between, but during action sequences.

Pistols and [[submachine gun]]s are frequently utilized by the heroes due to the light weight they provide, enabling their wielders to move more quickly. They are frequently [[dual wield]]ed. The heroes are extremely agile and implement rolls, dives, slides, and falls while they duel, making for a graceful, [[ballet]]-like performance in the midst of gunfire.

Heroic bloodshed films often end on a downbeat or tragic note with the main heroes either dead, arrested by the police, or severely incapacitated.

"'''I'll be back'''" is a [[catchphrase]] associated with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], which he first used in his role as the title character from the 1984 [[science fiction film]] ''[[The Terminator]]''. On June 21, 2005, it was chosen as #37 on the [[American Film Institute]] list, [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100701230246/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/quotes.aspx Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give A Damn]", [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]], [[American Film Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger uses the same line, or some variant of it, in many of his later films.

==History==
Schwarzenegger first used the line in ''The Terminator.'' In the scene, his character, the [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]], a [[cyborg]] assassin, is refused entry to the police station where his target is housed. He surveys the counter, then tells the police sergeant: "I'll be back." Moments later, he drives a car into the station, destroying the counter, and massacres the staff.

In an October 1, 2012, interview on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', Schwarzenegger revealed that he had had difficulty pronouncing the word ''I'll'' and asked director [[James Cameron]] if it could be changed to "I will be back". Cameron refused but told him that the shot would be taken more than once and the best would be used in the final cut of the film so Schwarzenegger could vary the line.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-ill-be-back-video_n_1930644.html "Arnold Schwarzenegger: 'I'll Be Back' Quote Was Almost Ruined"]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. October 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
Variations of the line have been used by Schwarzenegger in a number of other films in which he appears.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) – "I'll be back". Said by [[Terminator (character)|the Terminator]] after being denied entry into a police station. The character returns by driving a car through the front door. Schwarzenegger has been quoted that he had not thought much about the line when filming the movie. Cameron notes in the DVD features that he expected the line to get a laugh only upon repeat viewings when what the character means is known, and he was surprised to see it get a big reaction from first-time audiences, who had quickly come to understand the character and immediately anticipated the outrageous violence the nonchalant line signifies. In the novelization of the film script, ''The Terminator'' by [[Shaun Hutson]] the Terminator says "I'll come back," rather than "I'll be back," on p.&amp;nbsp;117. {{ISBN|0-352-31645-4}}.
* ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991) – "Stay here, I'll be back." (1:53:47) It is said by the Terminator to Sarah and John Connor during the escape from the Cyberdyne building. The character returns by driving a truck through the front door to rescue the human protagonists trapped inside, referencing the same scene in the first movie.
* ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003) – "She'll be back" is said by the Terminator in reference to the enemy [[T-X]] android. He says, "I'm back!" after he flies a helicopter into the antechamber of a military bunker and emerges from the wreckage. In the latter use, the phrase "I'm back" also refers to his return to loyalty and allegiance with the protagonists, after having been "corrupted" by the villainous T-X. Schwarzenegger also uses it in the DVD introduction.
* ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009) – "I'll be back" is said by [[John Connor]] after being asked by his wife [[Kate Brewster]], "What should I tell your men when they find out you're gone?"
* ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015) – "I'll be back" is said by [[Terminator (character)|the Terminator]] right before jumping out of a helicopter onto a pursuing helicopter. Also "I'll go back," is said by [[Kyle Reese]] as he volunteers for teleporting back to 1984.

=== In other films ===
In addition to being the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator's]] catchphrase, Schwarzenegger has used it as his personal catchphrase in many of his other films.

* ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985) – "I'll be back, Bennett!" before he is put on an airplane against his will at the behest of the film's main villain Arius ([[Dan Hedaya]]). Bennett, who is Arius's main henchman and a rival of Schwarzenegger's John Matrix, eagerly retorts, "I'll be ready, John."
* ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986) – "I'll be right back", said Mark Kaminski (Schwarzenegger) to Max Keller in 1:14:02 time of film.
* ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987) – "Killian, I'll be back", said to [[reality show|reality]]/[[game show]] host Damon Killian ([[Richard Dawson]]), who does not expect Schwarzenegger's character to survive the broadcast. Killian's response is, "Only in a [[rerun]]."
* ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988) – "If you're lying to me, I'll be back!" (0:58:40-43), to the doctor who headed the experiment that created him.
* ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) – "I'll be back", said by Quaid, about to have his memory altered by a machine into which he is strapped.
* ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) – "I'm back!", returning from the hospital to his kindergarten class in the ending scene.
* ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993) – the phrase is used three times. "I'll be back.... Ha! You didn't know I was going to say that, did you?!?" (0:40:56-0:41:01), said as Jack Slater, a character played by Schwarzenegger in a film-within-the-film. Schwarzenegger also plays himself in the real movie. It was said to the child protagonist, Danny Madigan, who is aware of Schwarzenegger's real-life use of the phrase. Madigan answered: "That's what you always say." "I do?" "Everybody waits for you to say it. It is like your calling card." The second time it is used, Madigan overtakes Slater and says to him: "I'll be back. I know. I know." (0:46:10-11). In the third instance, Ripper said this phrase to Slater (1:44:45-49). Slater answered: "The hell you will".
* ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' (1994) – In the film, Schwarzenegger says to his character's friend when they return to his home: "It's nice to be back…".
* ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996) – The phrase is not in the movie but at the climactic shootout his character says "I'll be right out."
* ''[[Jingle All the Way]]'' (1996) – In the film, Schwarzenegger says to his character's wife: "I'll be back with the doll later…".
* ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) – Schwarzenegger's character is visiting a 're-pet' store and notices a 'sim-pal' stand outside. He turns to the sale assistant: "I might be back."  The assistant replies, "Oh, you'll be back."
* ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' (2012) – Schwarzenegger's character Trench Mauser says "I'm back" upon rescuing the Expendables from a trapped mine. Later, in the final gunfight, he says "I'll be back" to [[Bruce Willis]]'s character Mr. Church, to which Church replies "You've been back enough. ''I'll'' be back." Mauser then replies with [[John McClane#Catchphrase|"Yippee-ki-yay"]]  (the catchphrase of [[Bruce Willis]]'s character [[John McClane]] from the [[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard series]]).

Schwarzenegger has since used the phrase during public speeches as part of his career as the [[Governor of California|governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/world/?content_id=3967 TotallyJewish.com | News | World]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221903/http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/world/?content_id=3967 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailybulletin.com/news/ci_4095330 DailyBulletin.com – Schwarzenegger visits Rancho ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311065649/http://www.dailybulletin.com/news/ci_4095330 |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prior Use In Other Movies ===
The same phrase was used in the 1982 National Lampoon's comedy "Class Reunion", and was also spoken with a thick eastern European accent. The vampire character Egon Von Stoker, played by Jim Staahl, attempts to pick up a woman at the bar in the main hall, and upon rejection, responds with "I'll be back" in a tone and accent similar to Schwarzenegger, although somewhat less aggressive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2558">The word '''indignation''' is used to describe strong displeasure at something considered unjust, offensive, insulting or unrighteous.

==History==

The term was coined in [[France]] during the 12th Century. It comes from the Latin word ''indignationem'', meaning displeasure. In [[nominative]] form, ''indignationem'' is ''indignatio''. ''Indignation'' is a noun of action from the past participle stem of ''indignari'', meaning unworthy, to be angry at, or to be displeased with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=indignation|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==

According to Cicero’s ''De Inventione'', Book I, “indignation is a kind of speech by which the effect produced is, that great hatred is excited against a man, or dislike of some proceeding is originated.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/cicero/dnv1-4.htm|title=Cicero's De Inventione, Book I, translated by C. D. Yonge, at Peitho's Web|work=classicpersuasion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is for the speaker to create anger projected towards the opponent or the accused such that the speaker is seen more positively than the opponent. One of the features of ''indignatio'' is that it cannot function without a target of displeasure. To successfully employ the technique, the speaker must have a target, an audience with which the speaker identifies, and a desired reaction. If a speaker achieves a reaction from the audience in which they are displeased with his opponent, then the speaker has successfully employed ''indignation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhetconcepts.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/indignatio-overview/|title=Indignatio: Overview|work=Rhetorical Devices and Concepts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle==

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his Book II, Chapter 9, “indignation is the emotion most directly opposed to pity.” Aristotle also writes “Indignation is pain caused by the sight of undeserved good fortune.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.cs.uri.edu/courses/fall2007/csc305/Schedule/rhetoric/rhet29.htm|title=Aristotle's Rhetoric: Book II - Chapter 9|work=uri.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms indignation and indignatio are closely related in part by their common negative emotionality and anger. A speaker may successfully employ indignatio and the audience will feel indignation towards the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet2-9.html|title=Book II - Chapter 9|work=eserver.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inokashira Park Zoo''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: いのかしらしぜんぶんかえん; [[Kanji]]: 井の頭自然文化園) is a city zoo in [[Musashino, Tokyo]]. It is in a corner of [[Inokashira Park]]. A branch of the zoo is in [[Mitaka, Tokyo|Mitaka]]. It opened on May 17, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tokyo-zoo.net/zoo/ino/history.html|title=井の頭自然文化園の歴史 ｜ 井の頭自然文化園公式サイト - 東京ズーネット|website=www.tokyo-zoo.net|language=ja|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Large animals such as the [[Asian elephant]] Hanako were bred until 2016. Other animals such as the [[Japanese serow]] and [[raccoon]] are bred as well. 

In 2006,  to disperse the risk of breeding, the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] moved some endangered [[Leopard cat|Tsushima leopard cats]] to the zoo (Breeding restarted on February 22, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://natgeo.nikkeibp.co.jp/atcl/web/17/072500011/072600002/?P=2|title=第1回　絶滅危惧種ツシマヤマネコに会ってみた|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20161029/k00/00m/040/047000c|title=井の頭自然文化園：「ヤマネコ祭」２９・３０日開催…東京 - 毎日新聞|work=毎日新聞|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is divided into a main zoo in Gotenyama, Musashino and a branch location in Inokashira, Mitaka. In the main park, mainly mammals and birds are raised, and water birds are kept in the garden surrounded by Inokashira pond. Also, there is a cultural museum, where special exhibition, lecture meeting, and etc. are held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kichijoji.keizai.biz/headline/2683/|title=井の頭自然文化園で「大人のための動物園・水族園講座」　ゆったり学び楽しむ|work=吉祥寺経済新聞|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a "tropical bird greenhouse", but on June 2, 2013 it closed due to its age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tokyo-zoo.net/topic/topics_detail?kind=news&amp;inst=&amp;link_num=21706|title=熱帯鳥温室の取り壊し工事開始のお知らせと、飼育されていた動物たちの移動先について|work=東京ズーネット TOKYO ZOO NET|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an aquarium with fish and amphibians in the secondary park.

A sculpture garden is set up in a corner of the park with works by [[Seibo Kitamura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.iko-yo.net/articles/13415|title=動物が生き生き暮らす「井の頭自然文化園」　親子向けエリア紹介 {{!}} いこレポ|website=report.iko-yo.net|language=ja|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://style.nikkei.com/article/DGXDZO45477140Y2A820C1EL1P01?channel=DF130120166138|title=東京・武蔵野、三鷹　昭和史、文人に思いはせる 四季の移ろい、自…｜フード・レストラン｜NIKKEI STYLE|last=日本経済新聞社・日経BP社|work=NIKKEI STYLE|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a small amusement park (a merry-go round, teacups, train) is set up in one corner of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.iko-yo.net/articles/13003|title=「こどもの日」都内の入園無料スポット11選！　遊園地＆動物園も {{!}} いこレポ|website=report.iko-yo.net|language=ja|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In September 1905, [[Shibusawa Eiichi]] borrowed a corner of Inokashira Gotenyama Garden from the Imperial Family and founded the Tokyo Maternity Hospital Conversion Division (later Inokashira School) to accommodate juvenile delinquents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sakuraso.jp/house/modules/engeibunkagaku/index.php/content0076.html|title=明治後期に高まる「郊外型公園」への機運 - 桜草数寄（Sakuraso House）|last=Laboratory|first=K Creative|website=sakuraso.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1917, the entire town was granted to Tokyo and Inokashira Park was opened. On May 5, 1934, "Nakanoshima small animal zoo" opened at the current branch location.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=井の頭自然文化園50年の歩みと将来|last=|first=|publisher=東京都建設局西部公園緑地事務所|year=1992|isbn=|location=武蔵野|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, when the Inokashira school relocated, the plan to build a big zoo in this area was advanced. Initially it was conceived as "a big zoo" comparable to the [[Ueno Zoo]], but due to the wartime budget and supplies shortage, large animals can not be gathered. The plan changed to a "nature observation park". It opened on May 17, 1942.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Two giraffes were bred at the time of the opening, but both died by the end of the war.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Hanako ==
[[File:Elephas_maximus_bengalensis_hanako.jpg|thumb|Hanako on April 28th, 2006]]
[[File:Hanako-1.jpg|thumb|Statue of "Hanako the elephant" in front of [[Kichijōji Station]] (taken on March 23, 2018)]]
Hanako is a female Asian elephant which was raised at Inokashira Park Zoo. She was born in Thailand in 1947. She came to Japan for the first time after the war, gifted to Ueno Zoo in 1949. She inherited the name of the elephant "Hanako (Wanry)" who was starved to death during the war. Hanako visited the whole country and Tokyo under the Ueno Zoo's  "Mobile Zoo" project that began in 1950 and visited Inokashira Natural Culture Park for 3 consecutive years. On 5 March 1954 she was moved to Inokashira Park Zoo from Ueno Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nicovideo.jp/watch/nw3374526|title=はな子が去って、まもなく2年...　井の頭自然文化園の「ゾウ舎」特別開放|work=ニコニコニュース|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414225122/http://www.city.mitaka.tokyo.jp/c_press/030/030720.html|title=三鷹市 ｜井の頭自然文化園のアジアゾウ「はな子」に感謝状を贈呈します|date=2013-04-14|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, she stepped on and killed a drunken man who was trespassing before the garden opened,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ironna.jp/article/3228|title=父の生き方は象のはな子がみんな教えてくれた|work=オピニオンサイト「iRONNA（いろんな）」|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1960 she stepped on and killed a male keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924065836/http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0822/TKY201108220336.html|title=asahi.com（朝日新聞社）：「はな子」お世話、今後は柵越しだゾウ　飼育事故多発で - 社会|date=2011-09-24|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her lower left teeth fell in the 1980s, so she was fed with a liquid diet with banana and apple.

In 2013, Hanako broke the longevity record of elephants raised in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tokyo-zoo.net/topic/topics_detail?kind=news&amp;inst=ino&amp;link_num=21317|title=アジアゾウ「はな子」、日本新記録!!|work=東京ズーネット TOKYO ZOO NET|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2016, she died at the age of 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20160526/k00/00e/040/263000c|title=ゾウ：国内最高齢「はな子」死ぬ６９歳　井の頭自然文化園 - 毎日新聞|work=毎日新聞|access-date=2018-11-27|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is composed in the same [[Persian metres|meter]] as Shahnameh. The author mentions his name as Qāsem-e Mādeḥ in one of the last couplets of the poem. Composed in [[Herat]], it contains nearly 3,600 couplets.

Unlike other poems in Persian, Jahangirnameh contains relatively high number of Arabic loanwords, and the stories also were under Islamic influence. According to [[Zabihullah Safa]], this indicates that the poem is composed in late 6th century AH or early 7th century AH.

The poem seems to be largely an imitation of the [[Borzu Nama]]. In both stories, Rostam's son is brought up in [[Turan]] by Turanians and unknowingly fights against his Iranian compatriots. But at the end, he is recognized by Iranians and then joins Iranian army.

==Changes in the 2010s==

'''2012'''

On April 6, 2011 the Recording Academy announced a major overhaul of many Grammy Award categories.&lt;ref name="grammy.org"&gt;[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement Recording Academy Awards Category Restructuring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408162804/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement |date=2011-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the number of categories fell from 109 to 78. Some categories were discontinued, others were merged or renamed.

'''2013'''

On June 8, 2012, the Academy announced a few changes {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, including the addition of three new categories: Best Classical Compendium, Best Latin Jazz Album and Best Urban Contemporary Album. This meant the number of categories in 2013 rose to 81.

According to the Academy, the '''Best Classical Compendium''' is "for an album collection containing (...) newly recorded material of performances (vocal or instrumental) by various soloist(s) and/or ensemble(s) involving a mixture of classical subgenres."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/jun-08-2012-320-am|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY®'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING RESULTS IN CONTINUED EVOLUTION OF GRAMMY® CATEGORIES|work=The GRAMMYs|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albums entered in this category cannot be entered in other classical album categories, but individual tracks can.

The intent for the newly formed '''Best Latin Jazz Album''' is "to recognize recordings that represent the blending of jazz with Latin, Iberian-American, Brazilian, and Argentinean tango music."&lt;ref name="grammy.org"/&gt;

The new '''Best Urban Contemporary Album''' category is for albums with contemporary songs derivative of R&amp;B. It is for artists who blend contemporary styles with R&amp;B music, such as urban (euro)pop, urban rock and/or urban alternative.

Other changes for the 2013 Grammy Award season were:
* [[Best Small Ensemble Performance]] category (in the classical field) has been renamed [[Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance]].
* [[Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album]] has been split into two categories: [[Best Latin Pop Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album|Best Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album]], thereby returning to the situation prior to 2012.
* The [[Best Banda or Norteño Album]] and [[Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album]] categories have been merged into one category: [[Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)|Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)]].
* Mastering engineers will now be considered nominees and award winners in the [[Record of the Year]] category.

'''2014'''

Changes were made in 2014. One was the introduction of a new category, '''[[Best American Roots Song]]''', which encompasses all subgenres in the American roots music field such as Americana, bluegrass, blues, folk and regional roots music. The award will be presented to the songwriter(s).
The '''[[Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance]]''' category, introduced in 2012, was split and recognises metal performances only. It was renamed '''[[Best Metal Performance]]''' (returning to the situation prior to 2012). Hard rock performances are screened in the [[Best Rock Performance]] category, thus losing its own genre award.
The two Music Video categories were renamed. The '''Best Short Form Music Video''' became the [[Best Music Video]] category, while '''Best Long Form Music Video''' is now [[Best Music Film]]. The rules and description of these two categories did not change. Also new for 2014 was the '''Music Educator Award.''' It recognizes "current educators (kindergarten through college, public and private schools) who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of music education and who demonstrate a commitment to the broader cause of maintaining music education in the schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/a-total-of-25-semifinalists-from-across-the-us-announced-for-first|title=A TOTAL OF 25 SEMIFINALISTS FROM ACROSS THE U.S. ANNOUNCED FOR FIRST-EVER MUSIC EDUCATOR AWARD PRESENTED BY  THE RECORDING ACADEMY® AND  THE GRAMMY FOUNDATION®|work=The GRAMMYs|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015'''

The Recording Academy introduced further changes beginning on the 2015 ceremony: particularly allowing [[Music sampling|samples]] or [[interpolation (music)|interpolations]] of previously written songs in all songwriting categories, most notably the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] category.&lt;ref name="Grammy 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/the-recording-academy-announces-grammy-awards-process-changes |title=The Recording Academy Announces GRAMMY Awards Process Changes |publisher=The Recording Academy |date=June 12, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional changes include:
* the introduction of '''[[Best American Roots Performance]]''' in the American Roots Music Field
* Dance/Electronica Field to Dance/Electronic Music Field
** renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Dance/Electronica Album]] to '''Best Dance/Electronic Album'''
* introduction of Contemporary Instrumental Music Field
** renaming of [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album|Best Pop Instrumental Album]] to '''Best Contemporary Instrumental Album'''
* restructuring the categories of the Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/6776/20140612/grammy-awards-makes-changes-christian-gospel-categories.htm |title=The Grammy Awards Makes Changes to the Christian/Gospel Categories |publisher=Music Times |date=June 12, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** creation of [[Best Gospel Performance/Song]], with both the artist(s) and songwriter(s) as recipient(s)
** creation of [[Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]], with both the artist(s) and songwriter(s) as recipient(s)
** introduction of [[Best Roots Gospel Album]]
* moving [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] to the Pop Field
* changing [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance|Best Classical Vocal Solo]] (albums and tracks) to '''Best Classical Solo Vocal Album''' (limited to albums only)
* renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement|Best Instrumental Arrangement]] to '''Best Arrangement, Instruments And Vocals'''
* renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)|Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)]] to '''Best Arrangement, Instrumental Or A Cappella'''

The introduction of the changed will push the total number of categories to 83.&lt;ref name="Grammy 2015" /&gt;

'''2017'''

In June 2016, the Grammy organization announced changes to the voting and awarding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/the-recording-academy-announces-rule-amendments-and-dates-for-the|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY® ANNOUNCES RULE AMENDMENTS AND DATES FOR THE 59TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS PROCESS|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings released solely through streaming services became eligible to enter the award process. These recordings must be available through streaming platforms. Applicable streaming services are paid subscription, full catalog, on-demand streaming/limited download platforms that have existed as such within the United States for at least one full year as of the submission deadline. All recordings entered must have an assigned [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC).

Best New Artist rules were amended to remove the album barrier given trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted; many new artists first release singles, tracks, or EPs rather than full albums. To become eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:
* Must have released a minimum of five singles/tracks or one album, but no more than 30 singles/tracks or three albums.
* May not have entered the category more than three times, including as a performing member of an established group.
* Must have achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and impacted the musical landscape during the eligibility period.

The [[Best Blues Album]] category was split back into two distinct categories, as they were prior to 2012:
* [[Best Traditional Blues Album]] (Blues recordings with traditional blues song and harmonic structures, including various subgenres such as Delta blues, Piedmont blues, jump/swing blues, Chicago blues, and classic/Southern soul).
* [[Best Contemporary Blues Album]] (Recordings which may employ non-traditional blues rhythms such as funk, hip-hop, reggae, and rock, or which feature contemporary techniques such as synthesizers or [[Loop (music)|loops]]).

The Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category (in the Rap field) was renamed as Best Rap/Sung Performance to allow solo performances, a result of "the current state and future trajectory of rap by expanding the category beyond collaborations between rappers and vocalists to include recordings by a solo artist who blurs the lines between rapping and singing."

Additional amendments were made to the number and type of music creators recognized in the categories of [[Best Choral Performance]] and [[Best jazz vocal album|Best Jazz Vocal Album]].

It may also include dances which could either be considered specific dances or a family of related dances.  For example, [[ballet]], [[ballroom dance]] and [[folk dance]] can be single dance styles or families of related dances. 

See following for categorized lists:
* [[List of dance style categories]]

Cats listed on these specialized (categorized) lists should also be included in this general index.

&lt;!--

IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE ADDING AN ENTRY:
Please ONLY add dances with a Wikipedia entry. They are likely to be removed otherwise. Don't add additional information, which should be instead added to the dances' respective articles.

Specific dances are listed below in alphabetical order.  Variants of a specific dance should be listed as indented items, and not as separate items.  For example, Waltz has several variants.  This makes the list easier to read, and avoids redundant links. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10677">The '''Musolaphone''' (also marketed as the '''Multa Musola'''), developed by the [[Automatic Electric Company]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]], was an audio distribution system, which transmitted news and entertainment, over telephone lines, to subscribing homes and business. The company's recently developed "Automatic Enunciator" loudspeakers were employed at the receiving end.

A test commercial installation was established in southside Chicago in 1913, but the project was short-lived and did not prove to be financially successful. This was the last significant attempt to set up a "[[telephone newspaper]]" to transmit entertainment over telephone lines in the United States, prior to the development of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s.

==History==

[[File:1913 Chicago Musolaphone Comer demonstration.JPG|300px|thumb|right|John J. Comer, inventor, demonstrating the Chicago Musolaphone transmission equipment.&lt;ref name="increasing"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435063043525;view=1up;seq=935 "Increasing the Revenue Producing Efficiency of a Plant"] by Stanley R. Edwards, ''Telephony'', October 11, 1913, pages 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1910, the Automatic Electric Company, an established firm best known for making automatic telephone switchboards, announced its development of a new loudspeaker, called the "Automatic Enunciator", which was envisioned to have multiple potential uses. In part, Joseph Harris, president of the company, predicted: "An automatic enunciator, by which a man talking in New York can be heard in every part of a large room in Chicago... may make it possible for a public speaker to address a million or more people at one time... Running descriptions of baseball games, or prize fights can be sent over long distances for the entertainment of sporting fans of all varieties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85053089/1910-07-22/ed-1/seq-6/ "Replaces Bell Boy"], ''The (Culbertson, Montana) Searchlight'', July 22, 1910, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 the Automatic Enunciator Company was formed in Chicago to market the invention.&lt;ref name="formed"&gt;''Robert D. Fisher Manual of Valuable and Worthless Securities: Volume 6'' (1938), page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Automatic Enunciators were employed in [[public address system]]s, for making announcements in establishments such as department stores, factories, and railroad stations. In 1913, multiple units were installed throughout the [[Comiskey Park]] baseball field in Chicago, both for announcements and to provide musical interludes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxhfu5;view=1up;seq=273 "Loud-Speaking Telephone Enunciators in Baseball Grand Stand"], ''Electrical World'', August 2, 1913, page 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step was to expand the system to distribute programming to multiple sites, initially under the name "Multa Musola". Company publicity included the following description: "The object of the Multa Musola service is to distribute music by telephone wires from an instrument at the central office, so it can be easily heard in any part of a room without having to listen carefully."&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015080168217;view=1up;seq=220 "An Interesting By-Product for Telephone Companies"], ''Telephony'', August 10, 1912, pages 190, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The summer of 1912 saw a series of Multa Musola demonstrations in Portland, Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1912-08-04/ed-1/seq-10/ "Have You Heard the Multa Musola?"] (advertisement), ''Sunday (Portland) Oregonian'', August 4, 1912, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the spring of the next year, advertisements for the Oregon Enunciator Company appeared, promoting both home and business service. This would have competed with another telephone-based news and entertainment service, the  [[United States Telephone Herald Company#Oregon Telephone Herald Co. (Portland)|Oregon Telephone Herald Company's]] "telephone newspaper", but there is no evidence that the Multa Musola system ever began operation. Moreover, later that year, Oregon's Corporation Commissioner, R. A. Watson, acting under the state's "Blue Sky" law, prohibited both the Oregon Enunciator Company and the Oregon Telephone Herald Company from doing business in the state, due to concern about their financial viability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-08-29/ed-1/seq-6/ "Blue Sky Law Applied"], ''Morning (Portland) Oregonian'', August 29, 1913, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an experimental commercial Musolaphone service was established in south-side Chicago in 1913, working in conjunction with the Illinois Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. Two features that were superior to the Telephone Herald "telephone newspaper" systems was that listening was done over loudspeakers instead of headphones, and the system did not need dedicated, separate telephone lines, because "as soon as connection is made in the telephone exchange to the subscriber's line upon which the service is being given, the other equipment is automatically disconnected. When the subscriber desires to use the telephone, disconnection from the Musolaphone service, as it is called, is obtained by the operation of a push button installed at the telephone instrument".&lt;ref name="increasing" /&gt; John J. Comer, former General Manager of a similarly designed [[Tel-musici]] installation at Wilmington, Delaware, was described as the inventor.

An early 1914 report reviewed the Chicago Musolaphone's daily schedule:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"From eight to twelve in the morning, announcement of special bargain sales at the leading stores is made, and the principal news items are read from the morning papers including the United States weather report, stock market quotations, announcements of special events happening during the day, etc. At twelve o'clock the announcement of standard Western Union time is made. From twelve to one-thirty is given up to a musical program, especially adapted to cafes, restaurants, dining rooms, etc., and following this is a running description of ball games of the home team and scores by innings of other teams in both leagues during the baseball season. In winter lectures by prominent people will be obtainable besides language lessons in French, German, Italian, etc., and a period will be set aside for the reading of children's stories. A half hour's music for dancing will be offered each evening."&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510028078018;view=1up;seq=335 "The Loud Voice"], ''Popular Electricity and the World's Advance'', January 1914, pages 1037-1038.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subscribers were charged $3 a week for the service.&lt;ref name="opinions"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.35112102865609;view=1up;seq=506 October 27, 1913 opinion by Bryan Y. Craig], ''Opinions of the Corporation Counsel and Assistants from January 1, 1913, to October 5, 1914 (City of Chicago)'', Volume 7, 1913/1914, pages 502-503.&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, at this time issues of the ''Chicago Tribune'' newspaper cost one cent on weekdays and five cents on Sundays.) Eventually interactive communication was established, as one report stated: "There is in Chicago a teacher of languages whose pupils have grown so in number recently that personal attention to each pupil has come to be out of the question. An arrangement was made with the Automatic Company's studio for connections and service and now the lessons are all transmitted by telephones, service can be cut in any time for the purpose of asking questions or more information on certain points and in all ways the telephone service proves as flexible as the ordinary arrangement in a studyroom."&lt;ref name="metered"&gt;"Metered Music and Oratory Over Automatic Phone", ''Buffalo (New York) Express'', March 12, 1914, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A challenge was submitted to the Chicago Counsel about the legality of the Musolaphone's operation on Sundays, and the fact that the telephone company was partnering with a service that charged extra beyond the normal telephone rental fees, but a ruling did not sustain either of these objections.&lt;ref name="opinions"/&gt; An additional complaint was made to the City of Chicago by "a prominent news bureau... which protested that the music interfered with the news service". Again the city ruled in favor of the Musolaphone operation, while further noting that "The company, however, discontinued the music service."&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433020507376;view=1up;seq=16 "Telephone Report: Service Standards: Measured Service Study"] (M. Ferry, October 5, 1914), ''The Telephone Bureau of the Department of Public Service City of Chicago: October 1, 1914'', page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1914, it was announced that the Federal Telephone Company of Buffalo, New York was planning to establish its own Musolaphone service, but it appears that no other systems were ever established.&lt;ref name="metered" /&gt; However, Automatic Enunciator loudspeakers continued to be marketed, with the emphasis returning to their use in public address systems. The Automatic Enunciator Company was dissolved in 1926.&lt;ref name="formed" /&gt;

The '''[[National Anthem]] of [[Chile]]''' ({{lang-es|'''Himno Nacional de Chile'''|links=no}}) is also known as '''''Canción Nacional''''' (National Song). The song has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions. The current version was composed by [[Ramón Carnicer]], with words by Eusebio Lillo, and has six parts plus the chorus.

== First national anthem ==
The first Chilean National Anthem dates back to 1819, when the government called for, on the 19th of July, the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose.

The composer Manuel Robles and the poet Bernardo de Vera y Pintado fulfilled this mandate and their "National Song" debuted on 20 August 1820 in the Domingo Arteaga theater, although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of September 1819.

In the beginning, everyone would stand for the song. The custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared, until it was requested that it only be sung at the anniversary of the country.

The doctor Bernardo Vera, known in the history of the independence, was the author of the verses that were sung to Robles' music.

This first hymn was sung until 1828,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalanthems.info/cl-47.htm first hymn original lyric 1819-1847]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5fkM1Ov-8 first original hymn Full lyric 1819-1847]&lt;/ref&gt; when it was replaced with what is sung today.

== Second national anthem ==
[[File:Himno Nacional de Chile en Fa mayor Piano.png|thumb|450px|"National Anthem of Chile", opening piano.]]
The second Chilean National Anthem was composed by the Spanish composer Ramón Carnicer, when he was exiled in England because of his liberal ideas. Mariano Egaña, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.

The Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], in the Arteaga theater, 23 December 1828.

Years later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by [[Andrés Bello]], retained the original chorus ("''Dulce patria, recibe los votos...''"). The lyrics were slightly revised in 1909.

During the military government (1973–1990) of [[Augusto Pinochet]], the Verse III was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police (Carabiners). After the end of Pinochet's regime, in 1990, it was only sung in military events. Supporters from the former military regime also sing the anthem with the Verse III in private ceremonies and rallies.

In the celebrations marking the return of democracy in March 1990 at Santiago's [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos]], the anthem was played in its present melody, raised to F Major (the Royal Musical Official Version of the anthem) which is the original melody of the second anthem by Carnicer, but using the 1847 lyrics as text, save for the original chorus of the 1819 anthem. This was the version that from 1991 to 2013 was played during [[sign-on]] and [[sign-off]] broadcasts of Chilean television stations. Now the anthem is played in C Major during sign-on and sign-off.

[[Joe Walsh]], famed musician who was part of the United States rock band the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], sang the National Anthem of Chile at a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball game in 2003.

'''Nordvision''' is a cooperative venture, established in 1959, between seven [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]]: Denmark's [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]], Norway's [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]], Iceland's [[RÚV]], Sweden's [[Sveriges Television|SVT]], [[Sveriges Radio|SR]] and [[Sveriges Utbildningsradio|UR]], and Finland's [[YLE]]. Greenland's [[Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa|KNR]] and the Faroe Islands' [[Kringvarp Føroya]] are associate members.

Nordvision's main task is the [[International co-production|co-production]] and exchange of television programmes. It has its secretariat in [[Copenhagen]], at [[DR Byen]].

== History ==
The founding of Nordvision was primarily based on cultural rather than economic incentives. The Nordic countries are important potential markets for one another's productions. One of the original thoughts was to take advantage of the similarity of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], even if in practice, while the languages are closely related, they are too far apart to be fully understood without subtitles when television series are broadcast to the audiences in neighbouring countries. Nevertheless, other cultural similarities and the tradition of Nordic collaboration have favoured production and distribution of television programmes across Nordic countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=-uKxAgAAQBAJ|title=Writing and Producing Television Drama in Denmark: From The Kingdom to The Killing|last=Redvall|first=Eva Novrup|date=27 November 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137288417|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television was introduced in Western Europe in the early 1950s but came late to most Nordic countries. Denmark started regular broadcasts in 1954, Sweden in 1956, Finland in 1957, while Norway did not begin until 1960. Sweden, Finland and Norway have a large territory but a relatively small population, and one reason for the late introduction of television was related to the feasibility a transmitter system that would provide the majority of the population with access. Moreover, the government policy for example in Sweden concentrated efforts and financial resources on the construction of a network of stations rather than on increasing programming hours. Thus, a regional programme exchange was also seen as a solution to programme supply, particularly in categories with high productions costs, such as entertainment and drama. In this context, television was seen as having a potential to make a major contribution towards developing and fostering Nordic cooperation. Whilst the more extensive European exchange system [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]] already existed since 1955, the programming it provided was focused on sports, news and cultural events, due to the technological constraints posed by live transmissions and language differences as it would not have been possible to provide subtitles. Mainly because of the late start of television in Norway, Nordvision began later than its wider European counterpart. Denmark and Sweden had begun cooperating in TV production as early as the summer of 1958, but the official start of the Nordic exchange did not take place until October 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Björk|first=Ulf Jonas|date=1 January 1998|title=Nordvision on Swedish Television: The Rise and Decline of a Regional Program Exchange|jstor=40920063|journal=Scandinavian Studies|volume=70|issue=3|pages=325–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Eurovision, the Nordvision exchange programmes also included light entertainment and  popular music series, helping to make popular culture from the Nordic countries familiar across national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pajala|first=Mari|date=24 June 2014|title=East and West on the Finnish Screen.

It is usually played in groups. In nuntaa, a child stands in a circle, and has to chase the others.&lt;ref name="shaptahik"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.shaptahik-2000.com/?p=1239 | script-title=বাঙালির খেলা | publisher= shaptahik-2000 |language=Bengali | accessdate=2013-05-22 | author=Z M Saad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Wakil |year=2012 |chapter=Folk Games |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Folk_Games |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kalerkantho"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/?view=details&amp;feature=yes&amp;type=gold&amp;data=Loan&amp;pub_no=306&amp;cat_id=3&amp;menu_id=83&amp;news_type_id=1&amp;index=11&amp;archiev=yes&amp;arch_date=09-10-2010 | script-title=নুনতা খেলা | work=The Daily Kalerkantho |language=Bengali | date=2 November 2010 | accessdate=2013-05-22| author=মোহাম্মদ আসাদ |location=Dhaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== System ==
In nuntaa, a circular area called the "house" is drawn on the ground. One person is then selected as the "nuntaa", and stands outside the house, while the others stay inside the house. The player outside starts reciting "Nuntaa Bolooree"; those inside reply "ek holooree". After saying "Nuntaa" up to seven times, the others run away, and the nuntaa occupies the house.&lt;ref name="bdnews24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidz.bdnews24.com/mainStory.php?mainstoryid=20 | script-title=নুনতা | publisher= bdnews24.com |language=Bengali | accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, the nuntaa [[apnea|holds his breath]] and, while reciting an agreed-upon phrase, the "nuntaa" chases the others. The first person tagged becomes a member of nuntaa and tries to get the others; the nuntaa group thus quickly becomes crowded. The person who is caught last becomes the owner of the house for the next game.&lt;ref name="bdnews24"/&gt; If the nuntaa breathes while running, the others may catch him and beat him on the back until he or they reach the house.

'''Prince Vultan''' is the prince of the bird-like Hawkmen in the ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' comic strip and its adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3OorBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=hans+zarkov+flash+gordon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=npD_VP_yHPCO7Abn4oHICA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=hans%20zarkov%20flash%20gordon&amp;f=false |title=Great Movie Serials Cb: Great Movie Serial - Jim Harmon, Donald F. Glut - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2013-10-28 |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vultan and his people dwell in Sky City, a [[Floating city (science fiction)|metropolis that floats in the sky]].&lt;ref name="tcbb"&gt;Don Thompson and [[Richard A. Lupoff]], ''The Comic-Book Book''. New Rochelle, N.Y., Arlington House, 1974, {{ISBN|9780870001932}} (p.335).&lt;/ref&gt;  Prince Vultan starts his career as a half-villain (he resents Ming's domination but does not oppose it out of fear of reprisal) with a lecherous side (he lusts after Earth woman [[Dale Arden]]).&lt;ref name="tcbb" /&gt; However, after Zarkov saves his city he reforms into one of Flash Gordon's greatest allies. His character fits the stereotype of the barrel-chested chieftain with more than a hint of the [[pirate]] captain or the [[viking]] reaver in it, endowed with a booming voice and a great appetite for life, food and women.&lt;ref name="tcbb" /&gt;  In the original comic, he has several wives, one of whom tries to kill Dale, as she is jealous of her. He claims to have become King of Sky City after winning one of the Tournaments of Mongo. When Ming tries to take Flash, Vultan calls for a Tournament of Mongo. It is revealed that with [[Ming the Merciless|Emperor Ming]] and King Jugrid of the Lion Men he is one of the three most powerful rulers on Mongo. When Flash is given the unconquered Kingdom of Caves by Ming,Vultan sends a party of Hawkmen under Captain Khan to help Flash conquer his Kingdom.&lt;ref name="tcbb" /&gt; The Hawkmen later come into conflict with Queen Azura and her Blue Magic Men. The image of the Hawkmen descending to attack Azura's army (from the June 16, 1935 storyline) is one of the most reproduced scenes from the ''Flash Gordon'' strip.&lt;ref name="kotc"&gt;"One of Alex Raymond's most spectacular-and controversial -Sunday Pages, featuring the Hawkmen. Some church leaders complained about what they saw as religious undertones in the angel-like characters".[[Dean Mullaney]], Bruce Canwell and Brian Walker, ''King of the Comics : One Hundred Years of King Features Syndicate''. San Diego : [[IDW Publishing]], 2015. {{ISBN|9781631403736}} (p. 168)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Raymond, ''Flash Gordon:Mongo,the Planet of Doom''. Princeton, Wis. : Kitchen Sink Press. 1990. {{ISBN|0878161147}} (p.111)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vultan and the other Hawkmen provoked some controversy at the time of publication. Some Christian leaders regarded the characters as blasphemous because they resembled [[angel]]s.&lt;ref name="kotc" /&gt;

==In other media==
In the 1936 film serial, he was portrayed by [[Jack Lipson]] (1901-1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2_h9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=king+vultan+flash+gordon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwA2oVChMIwbTPspmNxgIV6yDbCh0-ogAY#v=onepage&amp;q=king%20vultan%20flash%20gordon&amp;f=false |title=Outer Limits: The Filmgoers' Guide to the Great Science-fiction Films - Howard Hughes |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2014-05-30 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allan Melvin]] provided Vultan's voice in the 1979 [[Filmation]] animated series. He is referred to here as King Vultan, not Prince. His Sky City is a marvel of Mongo technology, as the massive construct is suspended miles above ground by beams of polarized anti-gravity light. Unlike [[Prince Barin]]'s kingdom of Arboria, Vultan's Hawkmen do not make use of airships in battle. Instead, they fly under their own power or ride giant warbirds armed with harness-mounted energy cannons.

He was portrayed by [[Brian Blessed]] in the cult [[1980 in film|1980]] film ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1334574/Brian-Blessed-accused-throttling-Savoy-diner-insulted-films.html |title=Brian Blessed accused of throttling Savoy diner who insulted one of his films |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Flash Gordon (album)|film's soundtrack]] by the rock group [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Freddie Mercury]] composed a song called "Vultan's Theme". At the end, he is appointed the General of the Armies when Prince Barin is revealed as the rightful ruler of Mongo.

In the 1996 ''[[Flash Gordon (1996 TV series)|Flash Gordon]]'' animated series, Vultan is a somewhat conservative leader, and reluctant to act against Ming for fear of reprisals against his people. His role as Flash's ally is taken by his teenage son, Prince Talon.

In the [[Flash Gordon (2007 TV series)|2007 television series]], Vultan appears as the leaders of a group of nomadic mercenaries called Dactyls (a variation of the Hawkmen). In the episode, ''Ascension'', Vultan travels to Earth, using [[Princess Aura]]'s rift key. He kidnaps a teenage boy who he claims is his son. He is played by [[Ty Olsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/09/17/flash-gordon-ascension-review |title=Flash Gordon: "Ascension" Review - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 episode of the animated sitcom ''[[Family Guy]]'' called "[[Road to Germany]]", Brian, Stewie and Mort enlist the help of Vultan's Hawkman Army in a dogfight over Europe against the [[Luftwaffe]]. Blessed returns to voice Vultan briefly during the episode.

In [[England|English]] [[British popular music|popular culture]], the "traditional" '''pub songs''' typified by the [[Cockney]] "[[knees up]]" mostly come from the classics of the [[music hall]], along with numbers from film, the stage and other forms of popular music.

The tradition is continued in the UK by acts such as [[Chas &amp; Dave]]  and a Tribute to Chas and Dave called Gertcha, many of whose works are in a 'pub song' format.

Typical songs include:
*"[[Any Old Iron (song)|Any Old Iron]]"
*"[[Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow]]"
*"[[Knees Up Mother Brown]]"
*"[[King of Skiffle|My Old Man's a Dustman]]"
*"[[Nellie Dean]]"
*"[[Underneath the Arches (song)|Underneath the Arches]]"
*"[[Where Did You Get That Hat?]]"

'''''Pussy in Boots''''' is a cult 1994 [[VHS]] adult [[pantomime]] starring [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and ''[[EastEnders]]'' actor [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]], with co-stars [[Barbara Windsor]] and [[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]], as well as ''[[Coronation Street]]'' actress [[Lynne Perrie]]. Adult actress and model [[Cindy Milo]] played the role of Pussy.

It was filmed in front of a live theatre audience in East London and is based on the classic pantomime tale of "[[Puss in Boots]]". It is cited as one of the first adult pantomimes, which later became popular with the comedian [[Jim Davidson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447380 Pussy in Boots entry] on [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] was already starring as [[Frank Butcher]] in the [[BBC]] television soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' when he starred in the pantomime, although he left the soap later in the year. Reid was also known as a stand-up comedian and had released VHS videos of his material. The show was directed by Reid's friend [[Brian Klein]] and was co-written by him and author [[Norman Giller]], with additional dialogue by comedian [[Ted Robbins]] 

Barbara Windsor had yet to join ''[[EastEnders]]'', while John Altman was already starring as Nasty [[Nick Cotton]] in the soap. [[Lynne Perrie]] had been axed from ''[[Coronation Street]]'' a few months before the pantomime and was currently working the chat show circuit.

== Plot ==
Based on the tale of "Puss in Boots", ''Pussy in Boots'' follows 'Pussy' as she searches for her pantomime Prince. The role of Pussy is played by the adult actress [[Cindy Milo]]. Pussy is helped to find her Prince by Big [[Dick Whittington]] (played by Reid) and a [[fairy godmother]] known as 'Wonder Woman' played by Windsor.

Milo is often seen scantily clad, and appears nude in one scene. The pantomime story is stopped on a number of occasions for Reid to tell [[Off-color humor|blue jokes]] to the audience.

In one scene in which Reid attempts to comfort 'Pussy', he says the most famous line from the pantomime: "Oh Pussy Pussy Pussy."

The '''Sarajevo Film Festival'''  ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Sarajevski filmski festival'' / Сарајевски филмски фестивал) is the premier and largest [[film festival]] in [[Southeast Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sff.ba/en/page/about-the-festival |title=About the Festival |publisher=Sarajevo Film Festival Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidefilm.com/europe.html |title=Inside Film's Guide to Film Festivals in Europe |publisher=Inside Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the largest film festivals in Europe. It was founded in [[Sarajevo]] in 1995 during the [[siege of Sarajevo]] in the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian Independence War]], and brings international and local [[celebrities]] to Sarajevo every year. It is held in August and showcases an extensive variety of [[feature films|feature]] and [[short films]] from around the world. The current director of the festival is Mirsad Purivatra, former [[CEO]] of the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] branch of [[McCann Erickson]].

==History==
The first Sarajevo Film Festival was held from October 25th to November 5th 1995. At that time, the [[siege of Sarajevo]] was still going on, and attendance projections were very low. However, a surprising 15,000 people came to see the films, of which there were 37 from 15 different countries. The festival grew at a remarkable pace now being the most prominent film festival in South-East Europe, attracting more than 100,000 people annually on all programs and screening hundreds of films from 60 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/sarajevo-film-festival-celebrates-20th-year-under-long-shadow-of-war/ |title=Sarajevo Film Festival Celebrates 20th Year Under the Long Shadow of War |publisher=[[TheWrap]] |first=Steve |last=Pond |date=17 August 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sarajevo Film Festival is hosted at the National Theater in front of which the Festival Square and the red carpet are located, with screenings at the Open-air theater Metalac, Bosnian Cultural Center, and five other cinemas and projection locations around the city. The festival has been attended by celebrities such as [[Robert De Niro]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Daniel Craig]], [[Danny Glover]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Oliver Stone]], [[John Cleese]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Bono|Bono Vox]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Coolio]], [[Stephen Frears]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Michael Moore]], [[Gérard Depardieu]], [[Darren Aronofsky]], [[Sophie Okonedo]], [[Gillian Anderson]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Eric Cantona]], [[Benicio del Toro]] and many others.

By 2001, the European Film Association made the Sarajevo Film Festival one of the eleven festivals that could nominate a film for the award of "Europe's Best Short Film". The 2001 winner of the Sarajevo Film Festival, Danis Tanović's ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'', went on to win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the United States. In 2004, the Best Movie Award was named "The Heart of Sarajevo".

Beginning with the 13th Sarajevo Film Festival in 2007 and in cooperation with the Berlin International Film Festival and Berlinale Talent Campus, the Sarajevo Talent Campus has been added to the festival. In 2014, Sarajevo Talent Campus gets a new name and at the 20th Sarajevo Film Festival it is named "Talents Sarajevo". Talents Sarajevo is an educational and creative platform for up and coming young film professionals, and has eventually come to be revered as the most prestigious film training event in the region.

The festival also features CineLink, a year-long project development program resulting in an annual co-production market during the festival dates. The CineLink Market each year presents about 10 finest regional projects for feature-length fiction films, also offering festival guests a special opportunity to meet with the assembled regional industry, with emphasis on young filmmakers, producers and directors presenting their latest projects, productions and works in progress, with highlights of the regional production presented to international distributors, TV-buyers and festival programmers, making CineLink the most important international market place for new features from [[Southeast Europe]].

The first edition of CineLink, which was part of the 9th Sarajevo Film Festival, was held in 2003. Of the 91 entries from across the region, a three-member jury, Philippe Bober, Behrooz Hashemian and Čedomir Kolar, producers whose films have won awards at all the major international film festivals such as [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], [[International Film Festival Rotterdam|Rotterdam]] and [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], chose six winning, and the winners were: ''Bare Skin'' (''[[The Abandoned (2010 film)|The Abandoned]]'') - [[Zlatko Topčić]], ''Bosnian Pot'' - Vedran Fajković, ''Slowly'' - Nikola Mišić, ''Total Privat'' - Nedžad Begović, ''Roses for Tosca'' - Branko Đurić, Simona Stražisar and ''Last Day'' - Namik Kabil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/sff-14-polufinalista-cinelinka/030526009|title=SFF: 14 polufinalista Cinelinka|work=klix.ba|date=26 May 2003|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/sff-glavni-ziri-cinelinka-izabrao-6-projekata/030625001|title=SFF: Glavni žiri CineLinka izabrao 6 projekata|work=klix.ba|date=24 June 2003|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/sff-skript-doktori-zapoceli-rad-sa-finalistima-cinelinka/030702004|title=SFF: Skript doktori započeli rad sa finalistima CineLinka|work=klix.ba|date=2 July 2003|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/zavrsen-cinelinkov-program-usavrsavanja-scenarija/030709004|title=Završen CineLinkov program usavršavanja scenarija|work=klix.ba|date=9 July 2003|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/prvi-bh-nacionalni-filmski-festival/030602002|title=Prvi bh. nacionalni filmski festival|work=klix.ba|date=2 June 2003|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation he was one of only eleven students to receive a performing contract to tour with [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|The Greatest Show on Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Roberts [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2002/05/01/stage/the-u-s-ambassador-of-magic/#.VpH07hUrLWK] May 1, 2002 The Japan Times&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Taiwan Film Institute''' ('''TFI'''; {{zh|c=國家電影中心|p=Guójiā Diànyǐng Zhōngxīn|l=National Film Center}}) is a foundation in [[Zhongzheng District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] which aims at preserving Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese films.

==History==
Plans for a national film archive were first proposed in 1967 by the Cultural Bureau of the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]]. Two years later, drafting of the Film Archive Establishment Act began. However, the Cultural Bureau was shut down in 1973, and the film archive project was placed on hold. Oversight of [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwanese cinema]] was delegated to the [[Government Information Office]] (GIO). The Motion Picture Development Foundation, which had been established in 1975 with help from the GIO and the Taipei Film Business Association, announced in 1978 that a film library would be funded via the GIO. The Film Library of the Motion Picture Development Foundation opened on 19 January 1979. The film library later became responsible for hosting the [[Golden Horse Awards]] ceremony. It was renamed the National Film Archive in 1989, shortly before its founding director [[Hsu Li-kong]] left his post. Hsu's successor Ray Jing ended the archive's involvement with the Golden Horse Awards. Additionally, the name change brought with it a new mission. Jing began compiling old [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] films and other artifacts of the Taiwanese film industry, choosing to set aside the cultural education of the public. In 1991, the National Film Archive split from the Motion Picture Development Foundation, and was placed under the purview of the National Film Archive Foundation shortly thereafter. The foundation itself answered to the Department of Motion Picture Affairs, a division of the Government Information Office. The National Film Archive sought membership in the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] in 1992. Membership was granted in 1995, after the archive became the Chinese Taipei Film Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Daw-Ming|title=Historical Dictionary of Taiwan Cinema|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810879225|pages=123–124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYubb-xIgiYC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 2014, the [[Ministry of Culture (Taiwan)|Ministry of Culture]] replaced it with the Taiwan Film Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Culture ministry’s new center to aid local film industry|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/07/29/2003596189|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=Taipei Times|agency=Central News Agency|date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TFI was launched in a ceremony attended by culture minister [[Lung Ying-tai]] and [[Mayor of New Taipei|New Taipei Mayor]] [[Eric Chu]].&lt;ref name="var"/&gt; On 26 December 2016, the institute launched an online [[box office]], an attempt to increase the transparency of the Taiwanese film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&amp;post=106321|date=23 December 2016|title=Film institute to launch online box-office revenue system|publisher=Taiwan Today|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, it launched its film restoration laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3265079|date=30 September 2017|first1=Pei-ju|last1=Teng|title=Taiwan Film Institute premieres first digitally restored documentary|publisher=Taiwan News|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sims 3'' is built upon the same concept as its predecessors. Players control their own Sims' activities and relationships in a manner similar to real life. The game play is open-ended and does not have a defined goal. Challenges occur randomly based on aspects of each Sim's lifestyle, such as relationships, skills and job. Career opportunities such as working overtime or completing special tasks can yield a pay raise, cash bonus, or relationship boost. Skill opportunities are requests by neighbors or community members for Sims to solve problems using their acquired skills for cash or relationship rewards. If the opportunity is connected to a Sim's school, the reward may be increased school performance.

The new reward system Wishes replaces the Wants And Fears system in its predecessor ''[[The Sims 2]]''. Fulfilling a Sim's wish contributes to the Sim's Lifetime Happiness score, allowing players to purchase lifetime rewards for the cost of those Lifetime Happiness points.

The game includes an optional feature called "Story Progression" which allows all Sims in the neighborhood to autonomously continue free will without the player ever controlling those Sims. Sims live for a set duration of time that is adjustable by the player and advance through several life stages (baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and elder). Sims can die of [[old age]] or they can die prematurely from causes such as fire, starvation, drowning, electrocution. Further causes of death were added in the games expansion packs.

===Create a Sim===

''The Sims 3'' introduces many more character customization options than its predecessor ''[[The Sims 2]]''.

The player has a larger selection of body types for Sims as muscle and body weight sliders have been introduced. However, toddlers do not have the option to have their weight customized. The [[The Sims 3: Late Night|''Late Night'']] expansion pack also added sliders for breast size and muscle definition that are also included in the base game. Expanded skin tone options have also been added. Each skin tone can be further customized with a light to dark slider. The player is able to pick their Sim's shoes, a feature previously limited to console versions of The Sims and The Sims 2.

There are a total of 22 hairstyles for female Sims and 17 hairstyles for male Sims with more available through either expansion packs, stuff packs, The Sims 3 Store or third-party custom content. Hats and accessories may be applied and may also have their colors and textures altered. Each Sim's hair color can be chosen from one of eight basic colors, or the hair color can be customized using a color wheel to choose the base hair color, roots, highlights or tips.

The Sims 3 offers many more character customization options than its predecessors. With the addition of "Advanced Mode", players can focus on single features on a characters body to modify, allowing for detailed customization. Players also have the option of giving freckles, beauty marks, and tattoos to their Sims.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sims 3 Information|url=http://www.simsglobe.com/the-sims-3/|website=SimsGlobe|publisher=Sims Globe|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skills===
There are several skill-dependent abilities, such as more social interactions available from high charisma, special songs for guitar players, and appliance upgrades (self-cleaning, more TV channels, etc.) for high handiness. Sims can begin building skills as early as their toddler days. While skills do not show up in the meter right away, using skill building objects is rewarded once the toddler grows into a child. The basic skills include Logic, Cooking, Painting, Gardening, Writing, Guitar, Athletic, Handiness, Charisma and Fishing. New skills were later added in expansion packs. When Sims reach level 10 of a skill, they will get a certificate in the mail.

Each skill has a tab in the skill journal detailing the level of the skill, statistics, what the challenges are, and sometimes other special information. Various challenges are also available in the skill journal. When a challenge is completed, Sims can earn rewards. All of these rewards earn some kind of benefit, such as quicker completion, better results, etc. With the ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions|Ambitions]]'' expansion pack, the skill journal also shows hidden skills that a Sim has learned.

===Careers===
Many of the careers from ''[[The Sims 2]]'', and ''The Sims,'' such as the Law Enforcement and Athletic tracks, are in ''The Sims 3''. The careers in the core game are Business, Culinary, Criminal, Journalism, Law Enforcement, Medical, Military, Music, Political, Science, and Professional Sports. Professions in the ''Ambitions'' expansion pack include Firefighter, Ghost Hunter, Investigator, Architectural Designer, and Stylist. The [[part-time job]]s available include such positions as a Bookstore Clerk, Grocery Store Clerk, Spa Receptionist, Spa Specialist and a Mausoleum Gravedigger. Part-time jobs have a lower pay than full-time jobs and do not give career [[The Sims 3#Opportunities|opportunities]]. Part-time jobs are also available for teen Sims after they attend school. The ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions|Ambitions]]'' expansion pack also introduced professions, careers that allow the player direct control over their Sims' work and how they spend their days, and the ability for Sims to register at City Hall as self-employed in a skill career.

Sims can look for these jobs in the newspaper, the computer, or apply at the "rabbit hole" building where they would like to work. Sims are also able to make a living at home through their skills such as selling their own paintings, writing novels, playing guitar for tips, or growing fruit and vegetables. Jobs such as nectar making is also a profession with the Sims 3 World Adventures. Sims can also [[investment|buy out businesses]] and receive a percentage of the profits they earn.

Advancing in a career still depends on mood and skills, but with the addition that relationships with colleagues/boss and even certain goals that have to be fulfilled. Players now have more control as to their Sims work, with the option to "Work Hard", "Take It Easy", "Suck Up To Boss", etc. Depending upon which of these the Sim is directed affects the performance bar. If the performance bar is maxed out, this will help to increase a Sims chances of being promoted.

A new feature ''The Sims 3'' offers is branching careers, which allows Sims to choose a certain path in their career (such as a Sim in the Music career can eventually choose to specialize in Symphonic music or Rock). These branches are generally offered around level 6 of a career, depending on which career the Sim is working.

===Worlds===
Neighborhoods are now being officially referred to as 'worlds', or, when moving, towns, possibly due to [[Electronic Arts]]' use of the [[The Sims 3#Create a World|Create a World]] tool and the neighborhoods scale. Worlds are now 'seamless', open to exploration between lots and are affected by a new [[game mechanic]] called story progression. The primary world in the game is Sunset Valley, while an additional world called Riverview can be obtained for free. All expansion packs to date (except [[The Sims 3: Generations|Generations]] and [[The Sims 3: Seasons|Seasons]]) have included a world, and additional worlds can be bought at The Sims 3 Store for sim points.

The Create a World tool allows players to make their own neighborhoods with custom terrains similar to [[Sim City 4]]. A game patch, released in conjunction with the release of ''Ambitions'', also allows players to manipulate pre-made neighborhoods to a limited degree, such as adding or removing lots and scenery. As of ''Late Night'', worlds are divided into "''Sims 3 Towns'' and "''Late Night Towns''". There seem to be important differences between the two, like the Sims they can spawn, etc. {{As of|alt=Up to now|2011|April|5}}, Bridgeport is the only pre-made world to be cataloged as a city. The rest, including the exotic destinations from ''World Adventures'', are considered suburbs.

On March 19, 2008, EA revealed [[open world]], a new feature, for ''The Sims 3''. Players can explore the world outside their Sims' homes without having to face strenuous loading times. Every house lot is now synchronized with the main neighborhood time. In previous ''Sims'' games, the time of day was separate and different for each house lot. Players can interact with every building and amenity in a city. Although players are unable to see inside of certain commercial buildings often called rabbitholes (grocery, bookstore, theater, police station, school, etc.), they are able to enter and retain limited control over their Sims' actions while in these locations. The player has complete control in some other commercial buildings – such as the gym, library and the beach house. All occupied residential buildings can be entered in the same manner as a Sims' home, provided that the buildings are not empty or it is not too late at night.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/860/860744p1.html|title=IGN: The Sims 3 Preview|publisher=IGN|last=Ocampo|first=Jason |date= March 19, 2008|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Build/Buy modes===

The build and buy modes have received their own makeover. The square tile outlines that appeared on the ground in previous ''Sims'' games' build and buy modes are now a quarter of their original size to give the player more liberty to place objects where they want. Alternatively, it is possible to place objects freely without square tiles, an option that was missing in previous Sims games. Players can re-color and re-pattern the furniture and other items to specific shades and patterns with the new Create-a-Style and make houses with five levels (basements of up to four floors deep).

Build mode is one of three modes in ''The Sims 3''. It is used mainly for construction and architectural work. Some items that would be considered to be in build mode, such as counters and lights, are actually in the buy mode section. Build mode can be used to do many things including adding walls, paint/cover walls, add doors and windows, lay down flooring, create foundations and raised decks, create basements by using either foundations or the Basement tool, add columns and supports, create pools, raise and lower land, create ponds, build gardens and landscape a lot, add fireplaces, add additional floors/stories to a building, add stairs, and add a roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/wikis/the-sims-3?objectid=802129 |title=The Sims 3 Guide &amp; Walkthrough|publisher=Guides.ign.com |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expansion packs released after ''The Sims 3'' add extra build mode features such as ceiling construction and designing the terrain, Players cannot build or place objects outside the limits of the lot. Walls and foundations cannot be placed within one tile of the outer limit of the lot. Fences can be placed all the way up to the edge of the lot and all structures built by the players are limited to five above-ground stories as well as four basement levels. Buildings can be modified to appear to be taller than five stories, either using shells (introduced in Late Night) or by use of the constrainfloorelevation false cheat, which disables the requirement for above-ground floors to be uniform in height and level. There will, however, still be only a maximum of five usable above-ground floors. The height of a section of wall is equal to the length of 3-floor squares. This is most noticeable while placing a 45° roof. It is possible that the length of a game tile is 1 meter, and that the height of a section of wall would then be 3 meters.
In some situations, Build mode, as well as Buy mode, may become disabled, such as during a fire, burglary, or other major event. This is done to prevent modifications to the lot that may impact or prevent a game event from occurring. After the event has ended, Build and Buy modes will be re-activated. This feature has been an annoyance to many players and is disabled in many mods. Depreciation of objects is visible in ''The Sims 3''. All objects depreciate 10% as soon as the player exits build mode. This adds realism to the game and gives the player limited tries at building before the costs of building use up too much of the funds intended for furnishing and living expenses. When in build mode, players can return items for full value by using the undo tool.

In Buy mode, the player may purchase items from the catalog, sell objects that are on the current lot, and arrange objects on the current lot. Construction-related elements such as doors, windows, fences, and stairs are not associated with buy mode, but are in build mode.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Buy mode largely focuses on furniture and appliances. The descriptions of many of the objects available for purchase in the game (namely the least expensive ones) involve humor, sarcasm, insults towards the player, and wit, and serves as comic relief in the game. For example, one of the cheapest cars available in The Sims 3, the "Big Lemon", notes that although the car's doors are jammed and its ignition is faulty, it is still worth buying. Another example is the outdoor entertainment item "Foot-and-Hand Ball" used to train the athletic skill, which references and pokes fun at American football, which, despite its name, rarely involves contact with the ball via the feet. A feature that was introduced in The Sims 2 and stays present currently is the eyedropper tool. When the eyedropper tool is pointed at a wall covering, floor covering, or most objects, will show the name of what it's pointed at. Clicking on a wall or floor covering will switch to the appropriate area of build mode and select that covering so it can be applied. Clicking on an object will make an exact duplicate of it, and will focus the catalog on that object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/features/sims-3-primer-guide-6209418/?page=4 |title=Sims 3 Primer Guide, Page 4 |publisher=GameSpot.com |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family inventory is a space where objects that are too large to be held in a Sim's personal inventory are kept. Certain opportunities may make an object available in the Family Inventory. When a Sim family moves, if "pack furniture" is selected, all objects in the household will be placed in the Family inventory, to be moved and rearranged in the new house.

Introduced in patch 42, blueprint mode (a subset of the build mode), allows players to choose from pre-made rooms. A player can place down blueprints anywhere furniture can go, and after "realizing" them, have the blueprints automatically laid out.

===Create a World===
On October 29, 2009, [[Electronic Arts]] announced "Create a World" (CAW), which is a [[game world]] editor that allows players to create their own custom cities from scratch for use within the game. Players can customize lots, choose terrain patterns and add roads, vegetation and neighborhood accents (such as water towers and lighthouses). CAW also allows players to import designs from PNG files for use in their worlds. Users can upload their worlds to ''The Sims 3 Exchange'' for download by other players. The editor tool is offered to players as a separate download (156MB), and was released on December 16, 2009 as a [[beta version]]. EA will offer technical support and updates. Players are able to share their neighborhoods as with other content. The Create A World tool is currently only available for Windows-based PCs.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesims3.com/game/tools/world|title=Create a World-The Game-Community-The Sims 3|author=Arts, Electronic|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=May 3, 2010|date=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Electronic Arts]] first announced ''The Sims 3'' on March 19, 2008.&lt;ref name="actiontrip-site"&gt;{{cite web | last = Paul | first = Ure | title = The Sims 3 Announced | publisher = Action Trip.com | date = March 19, 2008 | url = http://www.actiontrip.com/news/the-sims-3-announced-screens/031908_9 | accessdate = April 5, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120848/http://www.actiontrip.com/news/the-sims-3-announced-screens/031908_9 | archivedate = October 2, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed at The Sims Studio located in Redwood Shores, California. On January 15, 2009, EA invited "some of the best" custom content creators to their campus at Redwood Shores where they were hosting a Creator's Camp. Creators have been invited to spend the week exploring and creating content like Sims, houses and customized content. The Creators' work was used to pre-populate The Sims 3 Exchange. In the seventh expansion pack for ''The Sims 2'', ''[[The Sims 2: FreeTime]]'', an event occurs in which a Sim-version of [[Rod Humble]], the head of The Sims franchise, gives the player's Sim family an unopened gift box. When opened, the family gets a computer with ''The Sims 3'' on it. ''The Sims 3'' game cannot be bought in the catalog. Sims can then play ''The Sims 3'' on their computers or console systems. Like all the other games that Sims can play in ''The Sims 2'', ''The Sims 3'' is a looping gameplay video shown on the player's Sim's computer screens when played by a Sim. On July 15, 2008 the first video preview of ''The Sims 3'' appeared on the official website as did seven new screenshots and five Create-A-Sim screens. Four screenshots that appeared on the website and were then taken down soon after, leaked onto the Internet by a member of the community.&lt;!-- do not add the "lost screenshots" tidbit here. This is irrelevant and not important to the article. Please discuss this on the talk page before re-entering it. --&gt;

Copies of the video game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' also came packaged with fliers advertising the game, with information stating whole-neighborhood accessibility and endless possibilities on character creation. On October 31, 2008, two teaser trailers were released by [[Electronic Arts]] featuring a comical view on the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] in the United States. Candidates [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]] were included along with respective running mates [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Joe Biden]]. In the eighth expansion pack of ''The Sims 2'', ''[[The Sims 2: Apartment Life]]'', new objects were added including logo posters and framed screenshots. The game was shipped with a code and an Internet address, where the player could download clothing with ''The Sims 3'' logo on it. Another developer walk through was released on November 6, 2008, featuring in-depth previews of the neighborhood and Create-A-Sim.

On May 8, 2009, EA announced that ''The Sims 3'' had [[Gold release#Production or live release|gone gold]] meaning that the game had finished beta testing stage and was off for manufacturing ahead of its June 2009 release. On May 15, 2009 EA released some online interactive teaser experiences on ''The Sims 3'' Website, including 'SimFriend', which allows users to choose a virtual Sim Friend who would email them throughout the day. 'SimSocial', which allows users to create their own Sim online, and have an adventure with them. 'SimSidekick', which allows users to surf the web with a sim. Two weeks before the game was scheduled to be released, an unauthorized copy of the [[digital distribution]] version of the game leaked onto the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sims 3 leaked to torrent sites weeks before retail release |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/05/sims-3-leaked-to-torrent-sites-weeks-before-retail-release/ |author=Ben Kuchera |publisher=Ars Technica |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; EA later commented the leak was a "buggy, pre-final" version. EA claims that more than half of the game is missing and is susceptible to crashes or worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/05/23/0523gamepiracy.html|title=Video game pirates swoop on 'The Sims 3'|last=Satariano|first=Adam |date=May 23, 2009 |publisher=BLOOMBERG NEWS|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the title has seen higher [[copyright infringement]] rates than that of the most torrented game of 2008, ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2009/05/30/sims_3_piracy_rates_higher_than_spore |title='Sims 3' piracy rates higher than 'Spore' |publisher=Afterdawn.com |date=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developing Team: Bringing the Game to Life ===
{{Cleanup section|reason={{small|Tone is not very encyclopedic and has much unnecessary detail, source citations need cleanup (duplicates, wrong cite types), general copy-editing needed.}}|date=June 2018}}
The development team was faced with bringing the game to life and pleasing the community of players who were familiar with the original Sims games and wanted something fresh. In order to get the community involved and bring life into a programmed world they relied on user feedback and inspiration from the real world to harness into a digital space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2462117/sims-3-producers-advice-to-devs-screw-up-a-lot-developer-pop-quiz-10/|title='Sims 3' Producer's Advice To Devs: Screw Up A Lot -- Developer Pop Quiz #10|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to create the animations in the game, so they look believable but goofy, they shot real life references of people doing tasks in outrageous ways until satisfied with the outcome. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation|last=The Sims|title=The Sims 3 - Behind the Scenes|date=2008-08-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouH0G6-wK9g|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This use of real world influence can be seen in the [[The Sims 3: World Adventures|World Adventures]] where they have three worlds (each world represents China, Egypt, and Paris) and the [[The Sims 3: Showtime|Katy Perry]] branded expansion and stuff packs which feature Katy Perry in Sims form and an array of different items themed to candy and food.

The Sims team also brought in music artists to perform some of their songs in the language of Sims, [[Simlish]]. The music taste of Sims is just as diverse in game as it is in real life and the developers sought people from all musical backgrounds to record songs for in game. This not only brings in another real world aspect to the game but it is also an exclusive honor given to those chosen by the development team; these artists have ranged from Katy Perry, Lady Antebellum, Flaming Lips, Damien Marley, Depeche Mode, Nelly Furtado, and even Flo Rida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ea.com/news/reknown-artists-partner-with-ea-on-the-sims|title=Flo Rida, My Chemical Romance, Travie McCoy, 3oh!3, and More Partner with EA on the Uber Popular Life Simulator Series The Sims|last=Arts|first=Electronic|date=2010-09-02|work=Electronic Arts Inc.|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recordings for the Simlish versions of the songs can also be found on the official Sims team YouTube channel, [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSims/featured The Sims.] 

==== Story Creation for Game Play ====
The stories that the developers intertwine in the Sims 3, that the players then interact with, is what also makes the Sims feel more like a simulation of life. The developers understand that "one of the coolest things about the Sims 3 is that my story is part of a bigger story, the neighborhood is growing and changing around me and my characters and the story I'm telling is affected by that..."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and from all of this cross story mixing comes a new player experience. These stories create immersion in the game for the players and those who play the game can start sharing some of their funny experiences in the game with people in the real world; thus bringing in players who have never even considered playing video games before. &lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gameplanet.co.nz/pc/features/i133344/The-Sims-3-How-does-it-all-work/|title=The Sims 3: How does it all work?|work=Gameplanet|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each character in the game that was specifically created by the developers have their own life story, wishes, dreams, and personalities. The developers spend a lot of time trying to get the world to feel seamless and the characters to feel real&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; but they do not forget about the Sims and homes they populate the game with before release. One of the most well known and even infamous families in The Sims 3 would be The Goths, who have been written into the games lore since the beginning of The Sims in 2000. The players have fallen in love with the mystery and lore of the Goth family and many people have taken it into their own hands to speculate on what really happened to the family. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/a-sims-fan-theory-that-gets-pretty-dark-1641330321|title=A Sims Fan Theory That Gets Pretty Dark|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|work=Kotaku|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers want the players to be able to take the game and make their own individual worlds, characters and stories.

===Marketing===
In April 2009, [[Electronic Arts]] began to post billboards in many areas in advertisement for the game. Many of the billboards covered skyscrapers in densely populated areas, most notably [[Times Square]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kee |first=Tameka |url=http://paidcontent.org/2009/04/13/419-ea-goes-all-out-with-sims-3-ad-blitz/ |title=EA Goes All Out With Pricey Sims 3 Ad Blitz |publisher=paidContent |date=April 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of these billboards was estimated to be $10 million a month. This marketing campaign proved successful, as ''The Sims 3'' sold 1.4 million copies in its first week, breaking the record for all EA games.

On March 23, 2009, the look and feel of ''The Sims 3'' was threaded throughout the storyline of an episode of [[The CW Television Network|The CW series]] ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. On screen, the episode opens in an idealized Sims version of ''One Tree Hill'' and then transitions into the real Tree Hill. As this episode plays out, Sims versions of popular ''One Tree Hill'' characters are introduced and then morph into the real-life characters, including Dan ([[Paul Johansson]]), Lucas ([[Chad Michael Murray]]) and Peyton ([[Hilarie Burton]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesims2.ea.com/news/detail.php?id=1728 The Sims 3 visits One Tree Hill on The CW Tonight!] from TheSims2.com&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sims 3'' versions of the characters are available for download via [[The CW Television Network|CW]]'s official website. On April 19, 2009, Target exclusively released a promotional disc of ''The Sims 3'' that features a [[Ladytron]] band poster, ''The Sims 3'' theme song music download, and a $5 off coupon. The main menu includes screensaver downloads, videos, Create-A-Sim, Create-A-House, and much more. There is no actual gameplay involved, but it describes what playing feels like.

On July 14, 2010, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor]] began a promotion at ''The Sims 3 Store'' by allowing players to download their newest car at the time, the [[Ford Fiesta]] Mark VII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.thesims3.com/fiesta?intcmp=eaint505&amp;sourceid=eaom695 |title=Fiesta Urban Landscape |author=Electronic Arts |date=July 14, 2010 |publisher=Electronic Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car also came with a collection of street signs. On October 27, 2010, the download was updated to include the Fiesta Hatchback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondsims.com/26473/the-sims-3-store-updates-with-free-2011-fiesta-hatchback/ |title=The Sims 3 Store updates with FREE 2011 Fiesta Hatchback |author=Judhudson |date=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 [[Ford Focus]] was made available to download on June 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondsims.com/31013/2012-ford-focus-now-available-to-download-for-the-sims-3/ |title=2012 Ford Focus now available to download for The Sims 3 |author=Judhudson |date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car included one male Ford T-shirt, one female Ford T-shirt, a stereo, and a set of neon lights, all for use in-game. The Focus pack was available to download on Mac, PC, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.

===Audio===
Music for ''The Sims 3'' was composed by [[Steve Jablonsky]]. Scores were recorded with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at Newman Scoring Stage at [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name=scoring&gt;{{Cite news| author=Goldwasser, Dan | url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/160 | title=Steve Jablonsky scores The Sims 3 | publisher=Scoring Sessions | date=November 2, 2008 | accessdate= February 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music for the game's stereo and guitar objects was produced by others, including [[Darrell Brown (musician)|Darrell Brown]], [[Rebeca Mauleon]], and [[Peppino D'Agostino]]. Additional music was produced by [[APM Music]].&lt;ref name=mobygames1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sims 3 (2009) Windows credits – MobyGames|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/sims-3/credits|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two soundtracks have been released for ''The Sims 3'' base game, ''The Sims 3 Soundtrack'' and ''The Sims 3 – Stereo Jams''. The soundtrack includes theme music and the ''Stereo Jams'' album includes music from stereos in game. All songs on ''Stereo Jams'' are in [[Simlish]].

===Software copy restriction===
Some of EA's other PC titles from the same time period, such as ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' and ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'', used a [[SecuROM]] copy restriction scheme that requires online and offline authentication and limits the number of times a user can install the game to five. While it was speculated that ''The Sims 3'' would use the same system, on March 26, 2009, executive producer [[Rod Humble]] revealed that ''The Sims 3'' uses traditional disk-based copy protection as ''Sims 2'' did and does not require online authentication to install. A [[product key]] is also required. However, SecuROM based restriction is still present within the digital version of the title, limiting users to a total of 5 authorizations for 5 different machines via online activation, each of which can be de-authorized online at any time. A legitimate serial key is required to download custom objects and Sims from the official website. This includes custom designs created by other Sims 3 players as well as additional content from EA.

===Delay===
On February 3, 2009, it was announced that the release date of ''The Sims 3'' would be delayed from February 20, 2009 to June 2, 2009 in the US, and June 5, 2009 in the UK. John Riccitiello, CEO of Electronic Arts, said "In the case of [''The Sims 3''], we're moving this title to June 2 to give us additional time to build the worldwide marketing campaign a title like this deserves". Grant Rodiek, Associate Producer of ''The Sims 3'' said:

{{quote|''The Sims 3'' June launch gives more time for tuning and polish and the ability to launch the game on PC and Mac platforms simultaneously. This is a key EA franchise and title and it deserves a bigger bet on the best Sims game EA has made. These last few months will give us a little more time to tune, tweak, and polish the game. Our players have been waiting for something awesome and that's exactly what we intend to give them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheer |first=Dan |url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132872.20090220.The-Sims-3-Q-A-session/ |title=The Sims 3 Q&amp;A session – Gameplanet Feature |publisher=Gameplanet.co.nz |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

EA Singapore launched ''The Sims 3'' with a large launch party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Electronic Arts (EA) Singapore |url=http://thesims3.ea.com.sg |title=''The Sims 3'' Pre-order &amp; Launch Party site for Singapore |publisher=Thesims3.ea.com.sg |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was held on June 2, 2009 at the new shopping mall [[Iluma]] in Singapore. At the event, ''The Sims 3'' T-shirts were available for purchase. In Sydney, Australia on June 4, 2009 a fashion event to show off the freedom and self-expression in ''The Sims 3'' was held by Electronic Arts Australia, and included a performance by [[Jessica Mauboy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicarts.com.au/news/sims3launchevent |title=Are You A Fan of the Sims?

The game was released as both a standard edition and a [[Special edition|Collector's Edition]]. Both the collector's edition and the standard edition of the game comes with a coupon for 1000 Sim Points to spend at ''The Sims 3 Store''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/the-sims-3-collectors-edition |title=The Sims 3 Collector's Edition: PC Mac – EA Games |publisher=Ea.com |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard edition contains the first release of the core game, while the Collector's Edition includes the ''Sims 3 ''core game, a 2GB The Sims [[Plumbob]] [[USB flash drive]] (preloaded with [[Computer wallpaper|wallpapers]] and [[screensaver]]s of the game, and the main theme as an MP3 file) with matching Green Carabiner, an exclusive European-styled Sports Car download, a Prima Tips and Hints Guide (not the actual ''Sims 3'' Prima Guide), and Plumbob stickers. Those that pre-ordered the game also got a Vintage Sports Car download, ''The Sims 3'' Neighborhood Poster, and a quick start reference guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/ce_preorder.jsp |title=About The Sims 3 |publisher=Electronic Arts |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preview CD with more information about ''The Sims 3'', such as music samples, family descriptions, and career information, was also released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applethoughts.com/news/show/93979/the-sims-3-in-the-app-store.html |title=The Sims 3 in the App Store |publisher=Applethoughts.com |date=June 3, 2009 |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smartphone===
[[File:Iphone-sim3-screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|A player editing a Sim in Create a Sim (smartphone version).]]
A version of ''The Sims 3'' was released on [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Bada]], [[Symbian]], [[BlackBerry OS]] and [[Windows Phone]] on June 2, 2009. The iPhone game works similar to that of the PC version. In Create-a-Sim, instead of Lifetime Wishes, there are personas. Personas decide which lifetime wishes your sim will have, as a persona is the largest factor in a Sim's personality. Sims start out with a small house. The house can be expanded every five sim days if the player can afford it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sims 3 on iTunes App Store|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-sims-3/id317904170?mt=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four careers in the town: biology, politics, business, and culinary. As in the PC version, Sims can also learn skills. There are nearly 75 wishes in the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wireless.ign.com/articles/989/989265p1.html]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When all of them are fulfilled, Sims unlock the criminal career and have the ability to purchase a car. In some events, such as appliances breaking down, the player must play a minigame to solve or do the action. The game was updated on November 30, 2010, to add support for the Retina display of newer devices.

An expansion pack for the iOS version, ''World Adventures'', was released on April 2, 2010. Unlike expansion packs for the PC, this is a standalone application. ''World Adventures'' adds tombs, new challenges, personas, and careers, new places to explore ([[Egypt]], [[China]] and [[France]]), clothes and new furniture. A second expansion pack, ''Ambitions'', was released on September 16, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheatsguru.com/iphone/the_sims_3_ambitions/walkthrough/2167118.htm|title=Walkthrough - Sims 3 Ambitions for iPhone / iPod Touch Career Guide Walkthrough for The Sims 3 Ambitions IPhone|website=www.cheatsguru.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with ''World Adventures'', the game was a standalone application. ''Ambitions'' added new skills (firefighting, painting, parenting and sports), new community buildings, and the ability to have children. On November 6, 2009, EA announced the release of a vampire theme pack for the iPhone. The pack included Live it or Wear it Sets with Vampires and Werewolves, Castle and Campus Life themes. "Live it" sets contain car, furniture, decoration, wallpaper, and flooring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesims3.com/community/news.html?selMonth=10&amp;selYear=2009|title=News and Events - Community - The Sims 3|website=www.thesims3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wear it" sets contain clothing, new CAS options, and hair styles.

===Console===
''The Sims 3'' was released to [[Video game console|game consoles]] on October 26, 2010, for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Nintendo DS]] and the [[Wii]] platform on November 15, 2010. The game was released for [[Nintendo 3DS]] on March 25, 2011.&lt;ref name="EA Announces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesims3.com/console_annc/|title=The Sims 3|website=www.thesims3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game allows the player to take on up to three friends in the Life Moments Game on the Wii, upload and download content on [[Xbox Live]] and [[PlayStation Network]], including furnishings, houses, and player creations or experience a full life simulation on a handheld with Nintendo DS. Reviews for the game ranged from average to moderately positive. Sims can age and die, but life cycles can be disabled optionally as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Anthony Gallegos |url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/109/1095336p1.html |title=The Sims 3 Console First Look – PlayStation 3 Preview at IGN |publisher=Uk.ps3.ign.com |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sims 3'' features a new Karma system (similar to the [[Social influence|influence]] system in ''The Sims 2'').&lt;ref name="EA Announces" /&gt; Sims can interact with child Sims around the neighborhood, or have children of their own.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SG3QqlWPc |title=The Sims 3 for Console Interview – Sam Player |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the PC version of the game, the console versions have loading times when moving from one area to another, and when accessing build / buy modes.&lt;ref name="simprograms1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simprograms.com/17209/gamescom-2010-megapost-late-night-fast-lane-medieval-mysims-and-more/#more-17209 |title=GamesCom 2010 MegaPost – Late Night, Fast Lane, Medieval, MySims and more! |publisher=Simprograms |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions received mostly positive reviews. On [[Metacritic]], it currently holds an average score of 77 and 76 out of 100 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, respectively. [[Game Informer]] gave the 360 and PS3 versions a 9/10, praising the new Karma system and The Exchange. [[GameSpot]] gave the game a 7/10, noting that "the game lacks fluidity, but is fun in its own right."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/strategy/thesims3/review.html The Sims 3 Review for Playstation 3].

Retrieved 2011-19-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In a positive review, [[IGN]] praised the game for its controls on consoles, but said they were disappointed by the fact that there is only one town in the game, as well as bugs, including a glitch where the game will not save once a certain week has been reached.

===The Sims 3 Store===
The Sims 3 Store is an online store where players of ''The Sims 3'' can purchase and download content for their game online for additional fees. To date, unlike [[The Sims 2#The Sims 2 Store|its counterpart for ''The Sims 2'']], The Sims 3 Store only offers exclusive objects, clothing, skins, and hairstyles not found through any other medium. The Store also offers variants of special objects found in expansions (such as laundry and hot-tubs), which offer their features for players who haven't purchased those expansions. The store is updated with new items for purchase every month. Premium content, such as the [[Massage#Tables and chairs|foot massage chair]] and [[wind chime]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.thesims3.com/productList.html?scategoryId=13062 |title=Premium Content – Store – The Sims™ 3 |publisher=Store.thesims3.com |date=August 24, 2011 |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; add new gameplay or animations. The update of August 2014 is the last.

The store uses a point system in which players can purchase additional SimPoints using a credit card or Points Card, which may be purchased at retail stores or via the Origin online store. It was launched on June 4, 2009 to coincide with the launch of the game. Players can download purchased items using the game launcher or the Store Mode interface found within the game itself. When a user purchases additional SimPoints, they obtain an object in the game for buying SimPoints.

Several worlds and towns for players to play in have been published on The Sims 3 Store:

He is the ancestor of the ''[[aliʻi]]'' ([[nobility]] of Hawaii), the [[ruling class]] that make up the [[aristocracy]] known as the ''noho ali‘i o Hawai‘i'' (ruling chiefs of Hawai‘i). Wākea is the grandson of [[Welaahilaninui]]. The priests and common people come from his brothers, one of whom was called Makuʻu. 

Wākea means expansive space, zenith, or heaven and Papa means foundation or surface; together, they create a symbol of land and sky or heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall D. Sahlins, ''Historical Metaphors and Mythical Realities : Structure in the Early History of the Sandwich Islands Kingdom'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1981), 15, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wākea's first high priest was called Komo{{okina}}awa.&lt;ref&gt;''Kapu: Gender Roles in Traditional Society'' by Malcolm Nāea Chun&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Wākea was on Earth in ancient times, he was a [[High Chief]].

== Consorts ==
In one legend, Wākea lives in [[Hihiku]] and marries [[Papahānaumoku]], who is a princess of Olalo-i-mehani and a granddaughter of Princess [[Kaoupe-alii]]. The [[Hawaiian Islands]] were created by Wākea and Papahānaumoku. Their daughter was [[Hoʻohokukalani]], who was a mother of Haloa by Wākea.

== Family ==
In the genealogies, Wākea and Papahānaumoku are 37th in the [[Kumu-Honua|Kumuhonua]] genealogy, and 28th in the [[Kumuʻuli]]. Kumuhonua, the ancestor of the Kumuhonua genealogy, was believed to be the first man in one tradition.  

Together, Papahānaumoku and Wākea created [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]], [[Maui]],  [[Kauai]], and Ho’ohokukalani. 

After having incest with his own daughter, Ho’ohokukalani, she gave birth to Haloa-naka, meaning trembling long stalk&lt;ref&gt;www.wehewehe.org&lt;/ref&gt;. It was a stillborn baby, which they later planted and became the first kalo or taro, a staple of the Hawaiian diet. After Haloa-naka, Ho’ohokukalani gave birth to another child named Haloa, meaning long stalk, and he became the first kanaka or Hawaiian person. 

The relationship between Haloa-naka and Haloa describes the balance of relationships between the land and the people that live in it. Haloa-naka, as the elder sibling, is responsible for the well being of their younger siblings, that of which being Haloa.  As Kalo, Haloa-naka upholds this by providing sustainance for the people, while the people take care of their older sibling by ensuring the life of the Kalo.  Likewise, it is also inappropriate to argue in front of Kalo at any time as well as it is not allowed to argue in front of your older siblings, nor elders.

Later on, Wākea reunites with Papahānaumoku and they create [[Niihau|Ni'ihau]], [[Lehua]], and [[Kaʻula]].&lt;ref&gt;Lilikalā Kame’eleihiwa, ''In Native Lands and Foreign Desires: Pehea Lā E Pono Ai?'' (Honolulu: Bishop Museum, 1992), 19-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one tradition, the first person on [[Earth]] was the woman [[Laʻilaʻi]]. She and her husband [[Kealiʻiwahilani]] are the parents of [[Kahiko]], the father of Wākea. Wākea made the land and sea from the [[calabash]] or gourd (''‘ipu'') of Papahānaumoku. He threw it up high, and it became the heavens. He made the rain from its juice and from the seeds he made the sun, moon, and stars.&lt;ref&gt;Tregear 1891:28–29, 392&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender roles==
Wanting to sleep with his daughter, Wākea made a bargain with his high priest, Komo’awa, to make [[Papahānaumoku]] go away for four nights. In her seclusion, it was ''[[kapu]]'' or restricted for her to eat certain foods; a tradition known as ''ʻaikapu'', which was a sacred eating arrangement established by Wākea.  The purpose of the ''ʻaikapu'' was to separate the women from the men. In traditional Hawaiian society, men were responsible for cooking.  

Examples of some foods that Hawaiian women could not eat:&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Nāea Chun, ''No Na Mamo : Traditional and Contemporary Hawaiian Beliefs and Practices'' (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2011), 289-293.&lt;/ref&gt;
