[[Al St. John]] (1893-1963) was an American comic actor who appeared some 350 or more films between 1913 and 1952. Starting at [[Mack Sennett]]'s Keystone Film Company, St. John rose through the ranks to become one of the major comedy stars of the 1920s, though less than half of his starring roles still survive today. With the advent of sound drastically changing and curtailing the two-reel comedy format, St. John diversified, creating a second career for himself as a comic sidekick in Western films and ultimately developing the character of "Fuzzy Q. Jones," for which he is best known in posterity.

==Starring Al St. John==

St. John's first starring roles were made at Keystone, but most of these were made at the very end of the history of the company, just as Mack Sennett was abandoning the "Keystone" moniker in order to extricate himself from the [[Triangle Film Corporation]] partnership. St. John got a second chance at solo stardom starting in 1919 with [[Paramount Pictures]] and the early [[Warner Bros.]] studio, and this led to extended series of 2-reel comedies for [[Fox Film Corporation]] and [[Educational Pictures]]. Al St. John starred in more than 70 2-reel comedies through 1932. This is the most important part of his personal legacy, but it remains the least accessible part of his activity. Changes to this list are inevitable, and are welcomed.

==Fuzzy Q. Jones Roles==

"Fuzzy Q. Jones" was developed when Al St. John filled in for actor Fuzzy Knight on a film Knight was unable to make. St. John made more than 80 western films in this character, which proved indispensable to the PRC studio and so popular that "Fuzzy Settles Down" (1944) remains the only American B-Western that is titled after the sidekick. In post-war Germany, where Fuzzy was especially popular, he was always billed in the title of his pictures, despite the presence of the hero. It was as Fuzzy—whom Al came to regard as a separate person, apart from himself—that St. John finished out his long film career.
These films had, in many cases, multiple theatrical distributors, and most of the PRCs were re-released in the 1950s by Madison Pictures, though in some instances in cut down versions. In cases where a television vendor is the more likely medium through which one may see a given title, the vendor is listed in the distribution field is given rather than the original theatrical distributor. A listing for a home video does not automatically mean that the title is still available for viewing. All of these films were made in sound, and are extant.

==With Roscoe Arbuckle and/or Buster Keaton==

Al St. John's association with his uncle, Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, was central to his film career. Arbuckle first brought St. John to the Keystone set in 1913; over the years to follow, Arbuckle routinely employed St. John in playing rubes, rivals and other parts in support of his popular "Fatty" character. When Arbuckle left Keystone in early 1917 to form the Comique Comedy unit at Paramount, he and St. John were joined by stage comedian Buster Keaton, and the three created a singular cycle of silent comedies that exploited their matched acrobatic abilities and hard-driving capabilities in slapstick. This section represents onscreen appearances in films by St. John with either Arbuckle, Keaton or both, and it remains the most accessible area of Al St. John's silent comedy work. Arbuckle-directed comedies starring Al St. John are listed in the "Starring Al St. John" section above.&lt;ref&gt;Although previously listed here, Al St. John does not appear in the following Keystone, according to Brent Walker in ''Mack Sennett's Fun Factory'' (McFarland, Jefferson NC 2013): [[The Gangsters]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting Roles: Shorts==

Upon his arrival at Keystone, Al St. John was swiftly absorbed into the Keystone repertory company; he appeared in more 1914 films than Charlie Chaplin did. After Keystone, St. John appeared in support of other comics in 2-reelers up to the end of the silent era. Appearances in films with Roscoe Arbuckle are included in the list above. This list may be incomplete, as the full extent of St. John's appearances of this kind is not known, owing to so many lost films that may serve as possible candidates. For Keystones, the principal actor is included, though in many cases it is unclear who within the film that may be. Owing to the ensemble nature of many early Keystones, there are films which essentially do not have a central comedian as the fixture, and outside of Charlie Chaplin, survival rates on Keystones are less than what would be ideal. Unconfirmed appearances are not included in this list.&lt;ref&gt;Although previously listed here, Al St. John does not appear in the following Keystones, according to Brent Walker in ''Mack Sennett's Fun Factory'' (McFarland, Jefferson NC 2013): Soldiers of Misfortune (1914), He Loved the Ladies (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting Roles: Features==

With the dawn of sound around 1930, Al St. John went from appearing almost exclusively in two-reel shorts to appearing almost exclusively in features. While his Fuzzy Q. Jones roles dominate St. John's feature output, he did appear in a number of features in other parts, mostly in Westerns. Some of these, particularly his serio-comic turn as "Uncle Billy" in The Outcasts of Poker Flat (1937), demonstrate a greater range of acting ability than the average Fuzzy Q. Jones role might suggest. Several parts listed here, however, are the tiniest of tiny bit roles.

'''Alfred Ritter von Kropatschek''' ([[Bielitz]], January 30, 1838 &amp;ndash; [[Lovran]], May 2, 1911)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_K/Kropatschek_Alfred_1838_1911.xml Biography in the ''Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815 – 1950''].&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[general]] in the [[Austrian Army]] and a weapons designer of the late 19th century, who was responsible for several rifle and revolver designs in affiliation with the [[Steyr Mannlicher]]; these weapons were used by the armed forces of the [[Austrian Empire]] and several other nations. His rifles feature a tubular magazine under the barrel similar to a [[Winchester rifle]]; the [[cartridge lifter]] was the key to the Kropatschek design. One of his designs was sold to the [[French Navy]], and was later adapted by the [[French Army]] in the development of the prolific [[Lebel rifle]], which served as [[France]]'s front-line rifle from 1886 through the [[World War I|First World War]]. According to historian Roger A Pauly, some people joked that more bullets from Kropatschek-designed rifles were fired at the Austrians, than by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Firearms: The Life Story of a Technology |author= Roger A. Pauly|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-32796-3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=izGOfMdSm2IC&amp;pg=PA111 | page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kropatschek's tubular magazine design was also adapted to the German [[Mauser Model 1871]] rifle, resulting in the Model 71/84.

Kropatschek was a contemporary of [[Ferdinand Mannlicher]] in their affiliations with the Steyr munitions company, but they had competing designs. The Steyr Kropatschek rifles featured the tubular magazine and the Steyr Mannlicher rifles featured a box magazine. The limiting factors of the tubular magazines were: a risk of pointed tip bullets firing the primer of the next cartridge in the tube, and the lack of magazine capacity for short weapons such as carbines (shorter tubes). An advantage of the box magazine is quick reloading by inserting a full clip or by a [[stripper-clip]].

The '''Awamir''' ({{lang-ar|العوامر}}) (singular Al Amiri {{lang-ar|العامري}}) is a [[Bedouin]] Arab tribe in the [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]] and [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol II|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warlike, fiercely independent and frequently murderous, they were camel breeders, raiders and occasionally date farmers before settling in the 1960s.

== History ==
The Awamir roamed across the whole Oman peninsula, from [[Muscat]] and [[Nizwa]] to [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Liwa Oasis|Liwa]]. The Awamir in the area of Abu Dhabi were considered affiliated to the [[Bani Yas]] and frequently supported them in conflicts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=39|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large tribe, the Awamir originated in the steppes to the north of the [[Hadhramaut|Hadhramut]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; settling in the north in a process of migration which took place over 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=430|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsection of the tribe, 'Afar, was linked to Dhafrah. Some 4,000 Awamir settled outside of Oman proper at the turn of the 20th century and of the whole tribe, numbered at the time as 10,000 strong, some 3,500 were nomadic [[Bedouin]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol II|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Gordon Lorimer (civil servant)|J. G. Lorimer]] characterised the Awamir as "Reputed brave and warlike but crafty, treacherous and predatory; they are said to plunder indiscriminately all whom they meet..."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Bani Yas affiliation ==
In 1848, [[Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan|Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan]] was spurred into action against the [[Emirate of Nejd|Wahhabis]] encamped in [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi]], capturing his two forts back with the help of the Awamir. The Awamir formed part of the tribal confederacy force he then pulled together and used to clear the oasis and block a relieving army under Sa'ad bin Mutlaq. By 1850, Saeed's great tribal association had cleared Buraimi Oasis of Wahhabi forces. He subsequently accepted a stipend from the [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Sultan of Muscat]] for the defence of Buraimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=50|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awamir supported Saeed's successor, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan|Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] in his extended war with [[Qatar]] in the 1880s, a series of conflicts that secured the western border of Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hajji 2001, pp 171-4&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, the Awamir were central to a number of conflicts between the tribes around Buraimi and Abu Dhabi town, fighting with the [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]], [[Duru (tribe)|Duru]] and [[Bani Qitab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945874284|title=The Origins of the United Arab Emirates : a Political and Social History of the Trucial States.|last=Said.|first=Zahlan, Rosemarie|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781317244653|location=|pages=83|oclc=945874284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Raiding ==
By the 1930s, the decline of pearling on the [[Trucial States|Trucial Coast]] had led to a general recession and the Awamir's raiding activities grew as demand for their camels and services as drivers dropped. The raids on [[Dubai]] alone were part of the general unrest (in a time of depression and poverty) felt by the people against their Ruler, [[Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum|Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum Bin Hasher Al Maktoum]], leading to the Majlis movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945874284|title=The Origins of the United Arab Emirates : a Political and Social History of the Trucial States.|last=Said.|first=Zahlan, Rosemarie|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781317244653|location=|pages=54|oclc=945874284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 alone several such incidents included raids on [[camel train]]s, on settlements and date groves and, in at least one case, sheer vandalism in retaliation against a ruler's punishment of them: they cut down 20 unripe date palms in [[Umm Al Quwain]] following an outbreak of looting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=231|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raiding led to open conflict between tribes and Abu Dhabi found itself called to account on behalf of its unruly subjects as raids led to open and bloody warfare between tribes. For the first time, the British were forced to intervene in matters of the interior and broker an agreement between Abu Dhabi and Dubai over their border and the terms of a peace between the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=302|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awamir had long been in conflict with the Duru and in the 1940s, the ongoing conflict led the headman of the Bedouin Awamir, Salim bin Hamad bin Rakkad, to lead his people to [[Al-Hasa|Al Hasa]] in 1943. They returned in 1948, but in subsequent years were constantly drawn back to Hasa.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=40|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the tribe remained at Buraimi and petitioned the [[Al Nahyan family|Al Bu Falah]] for protection. One of [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s first acts when he was appointed ''[[wali]]'' of Al Ain was to call for Salim bin Mussalam bin Hamm and appoint him as head of the Bedouin Awamir. The portion of the tribe which had moved south under Salim bin Hamad became [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] citizens and this schism within the Awamir was later to form part of the territorial arguments put forward in the [[Buraimi Dispute]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Settlement ==
By the 1950s, some 50 families of the Awamir had acquired date plantations in Buraimi but few settled in Liwa. Staunchly nomadic and focused on breeding and herding camels, the Awamir had no interests in the pearling beyond casual work on the boats&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=174|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained essentially nomadic.

By 1968, some 1,721 members of the Awamir were identified in a census, many of whom had taken up employment with the oil companies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A rare [[Tanjore painting|Tanjore]] style painting from the late 19th century depicting the ten Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and [[Bhai Mardana]].]]
'''Bhai Bala''' ({{lang-pa|ਭਾਈ ਬਾਲਾ}} 1466–1544), born in Talvandi Rai Bhoi (now called [[Nankana Sahib]] in [[Pakistan]]),Into [[Hindu]] [[Jat]] family,&lt;ref name="McLeod, W.H. 1968"&gt;McLeod, W.H., Guru Nanak and the Sikh Religion. Oxford, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allaboutsikhs.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17 A Gateway to Sikhism | Early Gursikhs: Bhai Bala Ji - A Gateway to Sikhism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was a supposed childhood friend and lifelong companion of [[Bhai Mardana]] and [[Guru Nanak]]. According to the Bhai Bala Janam Sakhi's, he travelled with Guru Nanak and [[Bhai Mardana]] on all of their great journeys around the world including [[China]], [[Mecca]], and around [[India]]. He supposedly died in Khadur Sahib, in his late 70s, in 1544. There is currently ongoing debate surrounding the existence of Bhai Bala.&lt;ref name="McLeod, W.H. 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macauliffe"&gt;Max Arthur Macauliffe, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhai Bala's Existence==

There has been considerable discussion as regards to Bhai Bala's existence, particularly within the Sikh academic field. The reasons for this are:

[[Bhai Gurdas]], who has listed all Guru Nanak's prominent disciples (in his 11th Var), does not mention the name of Bhai Bala (this may be an oversight, for he does not mention Rai Bular either). However [[Bhai Mani Singh]]'s Bhagat Ratanwali, which contains essentially the same list as that by Bhai Gurdas, but with more detail, also does not mention Bhai Bala. There are a number of other anomalies, which Dr. Kirpal Singh has explicated in his Punjabi work `Janamsakhi Tradition.'&lt;ref name="Singh, Dr Kirpal 2004"&gt;Singh, Dr Kirpal, Janamsakhi Tradition (An Analytical Study). Singh Brothers, 2004.(page 10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sikhnerd.com/downloads/sikh/janamsakhi_tradition_dr_kirpal_singh.pdf |title=Janamsakhi Tradition – An Analytical Study |author= Dr. Kirpal Singh |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Surjit Hans also notes that the only role of Bhai Bala was to denigrate the name of Nanak and that Guru Nanak prophesizes about a greater bhagat (Hundal) to come:

''The first clue to grasping the true character of the Bala Janamsakhi is the fact that the persons related most closely to Guru Nanak are presented in uncomplimentary light. His father, Kalu, for instance, is a cruel man; he is greedy and ill spoken; he blames Mardana for spoiling his son; and Guru Nanak is rather chary of meeting him. Guru Nanak’s wife regrets marrying him, she is hot-tempered and full of anger. His mother-in-law is quarrelsome and hardhearted. His father-in-law curses his fate to have a son-in-law like Guru Nanak. The Guru’s constant companion, Mardana, is pleased with counterfeit coins and cast off clothes; he is all the time hungry.''&lt;ref name="Hans, Professor Surjit 1988"&gt;Hans, Professor Surjit, A Construction Of Sikh History From Sikh Literature. ABS Publications, 1988. (page 205)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the Bhai Bala Janamsakhi are several language inconsistencies. For example, the Sikh salutation 'Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh' is used in the Bala Janamsakhi, however this term only gained currency during the reign of [[Guru Gobind Singh]].

'''Robert Rennick Dalton''' (May 13, 1869 – October 5, 1892), better known as '''Bob Dalton''', was an [[United States|American]] [[outlaw]] in the [[American Old West]].  He led the ill-fated [[Dalton Gang]] raid on two banks in [[Coffeyville, Kansas]].  Ambushed by town citizens, Bob, [[Bill Power (outlaw)|Bill Power]], [[Grat Dalton]] and Richard L. "Dick" Broadwell were all killed.

==Early life==
The Dalton family came from [[Jackson County, Missouri]]. Dalton's father, Lewis Dalton, was a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] keeper in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], when he married Adeline Younger, the aunt of [[Cole Younger|Cole]] and [[Jim Younger]]. By 1882, the family moved to northeast Oklahoma, then known as the [[Indian Territory]], and by 1886 they had moved to [[Coffeyville, Kansas|Coffeyville]] in southeast Kansas. Bob was one of 13 of the couple's 15 children who survived to maturity.  His siblings included: [[Frank Dalton|Frank]], [[Gratton Dalton|Grat]], [[William M. Dalton|Bill]] and [[Emmett Dalton|Emmett]].

Bob acquired a reputation for being dangerous after he killed a man at age 19.  A deputy at the time, he claimed the killing was in the line of duty. The victim, however, was suspected of flirting with a man that Bob liked.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawman career==
Bob's older brother Frank was a U.S.A.U. (meaning?) Deputy Marshal and Bob served with him on several [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posses]].  Frank was killed by a gang of horse thieves, the [[Smith-Dixon Gang]], on November 27, 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gunslinger.com/dalton.html |title=The Dalton Gang |author=gunslinger.com |date= |work= |publisher=gunslinger.com |accessdate=6 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511223239/http://www.gunslinger.com/dalton.html# |archive-date=2011-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bob may have been part of that posse.&lt;ref name="legends"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-daltonbrothers2.html#Bob%20Dalton |title=The Dalton Brothers - Lawmen &amp; Outlaws |author=LEGENDS OF AMERICA |date= |work= |publisher=LEGENDS OF AMERICA |accessdate=6 March 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  After that incident Bob wished to be commissioned as a Deputy Marshal in the Western District at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]] and was assigned to work for the [[Wichita, Kansas]] Court.  Additionally, Dalton also served as the [[Chief of police]] for the [[Osage Nation]] while he was with the Kansas court.&lt;ref name="legends"/&gt;

On August 26, 1889, Dalton was sent to Coffeyville, Kansas to arrest a man named Charley Montgomery, who was charged with illegally selling whiskey and [[Horse thief|stealing horses]] in Indian Territory.  Montgomery resisted arrest and drew his guns forcing Dalton to kill him with his pistol.  Since there was no [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Montgomery Dalton did not receive any payment when he returned with Montgomery's corpse to Fort Smith.  When no one claimed the outlaw's body, as was the custom of the time, Dalton was required to pay for the burial.&lt;ref name="legends"/&gt;

In April 1890, both Dalton and his brother Grat were sent to [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore, Indian Territory]] to arrest Alex Cochran who had been accused of killing U.S. Deputy Marshal Cox.  The Daltons followed a rider fitting the description of the fugitive but the rider attempted to distance himself from the two deputies.  The man refused to stop so, from a distance of 300 yards, Bob shot both the rider and his horse. The dead man, unfortunately, was Cochran's son, not Alex himself.&lt;ref name="legends"/&gt;

While Dalton continued to work as Police chief for the Osage Nation rumors began that he and his youngest brother Emmett were illegally selling whiskey to the Indians and the brothers became involved in a noisy disturbance with them.  U.S. Commissioner Fitzpatrick called Bob Dalton in from the field, when he heard of the news, to demand his badge and discharge him from his position. Angered, Dalton claimed that he resigned, rather than being dismissed, over being cheated him out of several expenses.&lt;ref name="legends"/&gt;  Charged with selling liquor in Indian Territory he would pay his [[bail]] but not appear for his trial.&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt;

==Early outlaw career==
In July 1890, Bob, Grat, and Emmett were accused of stealing horses near Claremore to sell them in Kansas. With a posse close behind of them Bob and Emmett left the territories for California where brother Bill was residing.  Grat was arrested for the crime but would gain his release because of a lack of evidence. He would join his brothers in California.&lt;ref name="slinger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gunslinger.com/dalton.html |title=The Dalton Gang |author=gunslinger.com |date= |work= |publisher=gunslinger.com |accessdate=6 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511223239/http://www.gunslinger.com/dalton.html# |archive-date=2011-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of February 6, 1891 the Daltons raided a train operated by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], near [[Alila, California|Alila]], stealing $60,000.  The boys were accused of the crime causing Bob and Emmett to flee the state, with a posse after them, while Grat and Bill were arrested.  Grat would be found guilty on July 3, 1891 after a jury trial.&lt;ref name="slinger"/&gt;

==Next 18 months==
Bob and Emmett retreated to the Indian Territories, but the law was still after them, so they decided to hide themselves.  When Emmett worked, previously, at the [[Bar X Bar Ranch]] he became friends with cowboys [[Bill Doolin]] and Bill Power.  Acquaintances of Emmett from other ranches included [[Charlie Pierce]], [[George Newcomb]], [[Charlie Bryant]], and Richard Broadwell.&lt;ref name="slinger"/&gt;  Bob, as gang leader, decided they needed reinforcements and the future gang recruits were tough men who would help the brothers rob banks and trains throughout the [[Oklahoma Territory]] over the following 18 months.&lt;ref name="legends"/&gt;

The Dalton boys, at first, connected with Bryant and Newcomb in [[Wharton, Oklahoma Territory]] to rob a train in May 1891 earning $1745.  Shortly after the robbery, Bryant fell ill and was taken to [[Hennessey, Oklahoma|Hennessey]] to see a doctor.  After being spotted and arrested by Deputy Marshal Ed Short they killed each other during an escape attempt.&lt;ref name="slinger"/&gt; 

On the night of September 15, 1891 they robbed the [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad|KATY train]] at [[Leliaetta, Oklahoma|Leliaetta]], near [[Wagoner, Oklahoma|Wagoner, Indian Territory]]. Bob and Emmett Dalton led Newcomb, Powers, Broadwell, Pierce and Doolin on the raid.  The gang stopped and boarded the train and then stole $2500 from the express car.&lt;ref name="slinger"/&gt;

Grat escaped from jail on Sept. 18 while awaiting sentence in California and promptly returned to Oklahoma to rejoin his brothers.  At the end of May 1892 the three Dalton brothers led Pierce, Newcomb, Powers, Broadwell, and Doolin on another train robbery.  At the Red Rock train station, June 1, 1892, the gang positioned themselves to await an approaching train.  A train entered the station with its coaches dark, which alerted the gang to a problem, so they allowed it to continue. A second train suddenly arrived which the gang boarded as it stopped at the station.  They gang boarded it and robbed it but only collected $50.   The gang later ed that the first train carried armed guards protecting $70,000 of the [[Sac and Fox Nation]] annuity.&lt;ref name="slinger"/&gt;

The gang made its last train robbery at [[Adair County, Oklahoma|Adair, Indian Territory]] on July 14, 1892. The train was again loaded with deputies, but the gang was quick and quiet enough not to disturb the marshals until the job was nearly completed. Exiting from the train the marshals engaged the gang in a violent but short gun battle. The battle claimed the life of an innocent bystander and wounded another. The Dalton Gang escaped without casualties and with the cash.&lt;ref name="slinger"/&gt;

==Coffeyville raid==

The gang split to pursue their own goals after the Adair raid. Bob and his brothers were deeply concerned with the pressure put upon them by the law.  They decided to make one last robbery to earn enough money to leave the country. Their plan was to rob two banks in the same town at the same time to get the money and to also make history for accomplishing something that no other outlaw gang had even attempted. Their target was their old hometown of Coffeyville, Kansas.&lt;ref name="slinger" /&gt;

Early on Oct. 5 1892, Bob, Grat, Emmett, Powers and Broadwell entered Coffeyville.  Tying up their horses in the alley across from the banks, they walked across the street dividing into two groups before entering the Condon National Bank and First National Bank. Well known by the townspeople they were recognized and an alarm was given. Townsmen quickly armed themselves with guns from the local hardware stores and took positions to defend their town. As the Dalton Gang began their escape a gun battle erupted that killed gang members and four town citizens.&lt;ref name="slinger" /&gt;  The lone survivor among the gang, Emmett, was seriously wounded receiving 23 gunshot wounds&lt;ref name="legends"/&gt; and he stood trial for the bank robberies after recovering.  Sentenced to life in prison, he was granted a pardon by the governor after 14 years.&lt;ref name="slinger" /&gt; 

Deputy Marshal [[Heck Thomas]] remembered Bob Dalton as the most accurate shot he had ever seen. Dalton is buried at the Coffeyville, Kansas Cemetery under a group marker for himself, his brother Grat, and Bill Power.&lt;ref name="legends"/&gt;

The [[actor]] [[Forrest Tucker]] played Bob Dalton in the 1963 episode "Three Minutes to Eternity" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', a dramatization of the simultaneous bank robberies in Coffeyville. [[Tom Skerritt]] portrayed the surviving [[Emmett Dalton]]; [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]] was cast as [[Grat Dalton]]. The episode was narrated by [[Stanley Andrews]], known as "The Old Ranger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556909/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title=Three Minutes to Eternity on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Bob Dalton was played by the actor [[Robert Conrad]] in the TV movie western ''The Last Day''.

Heraldic '''[[Label (heraldry)|labels]]''' are used to [[cadency|differentiate]] the personal [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of members of the [[royal family of the United Kingdom]] from that of the monarch and from each other.  In the Gallo-British heraldic tradition, cadency marks have been available to "difference" the arms of a son from those of his father, and the arms of brothers from each other, and traditionally this was often done when it was considered important for each man to have a distinctive individual coat of arms and/or to differentiate the arms of the head of a house from junior members of the family.  This was especially important in the case of arms of sovereignty: to use the undifferenced arms of a kingdom is to assert a claim to the throne. Therefore, in the English royal family, cadency marks were used from the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], typically a label or bordure alluding to the arms of the bearer's mother or wife. After about 1340, when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] made a claim to the throne of France, a blue label did not contrast sufficiently with the blue field of the French quarter of the royal arms; accordingly most royal cadets used labels [[argent]]: that of the heir apparent was plain, and all others were charged.&lt;ref&gt;''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies (1909), p.&amp;nbsp;494.  (Online texts at https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft or http://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~bprince/hr/foxdavies/index.htm .)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bordures of various tinctures continued to be used into the 15th century.

==The label==
{{Main|Label (heraldry)}}
In the ordinary system of differences a label of three points (which has also been termed a label with three files) is the distinction of the eldest son during the lifetime of his father. In the oldest rolls of arms the labels are all of five points; but labels of three points were at an early period used interchangeably. Besides being used as mere temporary marks of cadency, labels are also employed as permanent distinctions, borne (like any other charge) by every member of some particular branches of certain families. Labels are the principal cadency marks used in certain royal families.  In the British royal family, all labels are ''[[argent]]'' (white). The sons and daughters of the sovereign all bear labels of three points argent; that of the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|arms of the Prince of Wales]] is plain, but all others are charged. Further descendants of princes bear labels of five points charged. All such differences should be borne on the arms, crest, and supporters.

The system of a special mark for difference for each member of the family goes back to the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], whose successor, as a prince, placed such a mark on the shield of England. Since 1340 this label has almost always been white, and overlaid with small figures, or charges, such as red [[St George's cross|crosses of St George]].&lt;ref name="Neubecker"&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]] &amp; [[John Brooke-Little]]: ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (1997). {{ISBN|0-316-64141-3}}. "Signs of Differencing" (pp. 96–97).&lt;/ref&gt; This red cross represents England and its [[patron saint]], and was first borne by Richard of Bordeaux (future king [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]) before the death of his father [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in 1376. Other charges used:
* A '''blue anchor''', a symbol of hope, or of naval service, as borne by several Dukes of York.
* The '''Crown''' of England (sometimes called the Imperial or [[St Edward's Crown]]) borne by the abdicated king the [[Duke of Windsor]], which is as unusual as the occurrence itself.
* '''[[Rose (symbolism)|Roses]]''': the [[Tudor Rose]] (combined red and white) has been used as an English [[Royal Supporters of England|royal badge]] since 1485.
* Red '''[[heart (symbol)|hearts]]''' may allude to the arms of [[Lüneburg]] (part of the Hanoverian arms) or – for the descendants of Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark – to the [[coat of arms of Denmark]].
* The blue '''[[fleur-de-lis]]''' appears amongst the Royal Badges in England of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]].
* The '''[[thistle#Heraldry|thistle]]''' is an ancient badge of [[Scotland]].
* The '''escallop shell''' was traditionally a token of pilgrimage on the [[Way of St James]].  The shell in the labels of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Prince Harry]] alludes to their [[Diana, Princess of Wales|mother's Spencer]] arms.
* The '''bee''' is a canting charge in the label of [[Princess Beatrice of York]].
* The '''[[trefoil]]''' is a badge of Ireland, associated with [[St Patrick]], who used it to illustrate the [[doctrine of the Trinity]].

'''Charles August Selby''' (24 October 1755 – 15 March 1823) was an [[English people|English]]-[[Danish people|Danish]] merchant and landowner. He built the [[Orupgaard]] [[manor house]] on [[Falster]] and [[Bækkeskov]] on [[Zealand]]. Salby also owned property in [[Copenhagen]], including [[Strandgade 24]] in [[Christianshavn]]. 

The [[Baron]]'s oldest son, the politician and landowner, Charles Borre Selby, inherited the estate.&lt;ref name=OG&gt;[http://www.orupgaard.dk/default.asp?menuid=298 "Orupgaards historie"], Orupgaard Gods. {{da icon}} Retrieved 22 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LFH&gt;[http://www.lollands-herregaarde.dk/ "Orupgård"], Lolland-Falsters Herregårde. {{da icon}} Retrieved 22 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Øer 08 Ovrupgaard Ø 1867.jpg|thumbnail|left|Orupgaard was built by Selby.]]
Educated by [[English Benedictine Congregation|English Benedictine]] monks in [[Douai]] in [[Flanders]], he then entered commerce. In 1773, he joined [[William Chippendale]]'s firm in Copenhagen which had interests in a sugar refinery. He was also associated with the Copenhagen&lt;ref name="BruunHovgaard1893"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruun|first1=Carl|last2=Hovgaard|first2=Andreas Peter|last3=Rist|first3=Peter Frederik|title=Museum: Tidsskrift for Historie og Geografi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwTAkFLINckC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=1 December 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1893|publisher=Gyldendal|language=Danish|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt; firm of Handelshus Selby &amp; Co., which later became Selby &amp; Ter-Borch, and in 1795, the company was taken over by Selby's partner, the Austrian [[consul]] Thomas Ter-Borch.&lt;ref name="Thalbitzer1906" /&gt; Selby developed a profitable interest in West-Indian trade until 1795 when he bought [[Bækkeskov]] and the [[Bredeshave]] farm. There, he was successful in introducing English and Flemish methods of farming. He built a Neoclassical manor at Bækkeskov but surprisingly sold it again in 1805 for reasons unknown.&lt;ref name=DBL&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Handel_og_industri/Grosserer/Charles_Selby "Charles Selby"], ''Dansk Biografisk Leksikon''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 29 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Selby was styled as [[Baron]] in 1796.&lt;ref name="Thalbitzer1906"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thalbitzer|first=Sophie Dorothea Zinn|title="Grandmama" bekiendelser."|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RNMTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA110|accessdate=1 December 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1906|publisher=Gyldendalske boghandel, Nordisk forlag|language=Danish|pages=110–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his first wife died in 1809, he bought [[Orupgård]] on the island of Falster, redesigning the manor and developing farming there. Through his second wife, he acquired [[Güldenstein]] in [[Holstein]] together with several farms in the vicinity where he applied model approaches to cattle farming and forestry for the remainder of his life. From his correspondence, it can be seen Selby was a well-educated, gentlemanly figure with an interest in art and aesthetics. He demonstrated strong affinities with Denmark, donating considerable sums for the reconstruction of its fleet.&lt;ref name=DBL/&gt;

'''Frederick James Whishaw''' (14 March 1854 – 8 July 1934) was a Russian-born British novelist, historian, poet and musician. A popular author of [[children's fiction]] at the turn of the 20th century, he published over forty volumes of his work between 1884 and 1914.

He was a prolific [[historical novel]]ist, many of his books being set in [[Czarist Russia]], and his "schoolboy" and [[adventure fiction|adventure]] [[serial (literature)|serials]] appeared in many [[British boys' magazines|boys' magazines]] of the era. Several of these were published as full-length novels, such as ''Gubbins Minor and Some Other Fellows'' (1897), ''The Boys of Brierley Grange'' (1906) and ''The Competitors: A Tale of Upton House School'' (1906).&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;Watson, Benjamin. ''English Schoolboy Stories: An Annotated Bibliography of Hardcover Fiction''. Metuchen, New Jersey: Scarecrow Press, 1992. (pg. 158) {{ISBN|0-8108-2572-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other stories, such as ''The White Witch of the Matabele'' (1897) or ''The Three Scouts: A Story of the Boer War'' (1900), depicted [[colonial Africa]].

Whishaw was also one of the first translators of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]],&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; the first in the English language.  He had several of the Russian author's novels published between 1886 and 1888.&lt;ref name="Foulkes"&gt;Foulkes, Richard, ed. ''Henry Irving: A Re-Evaluation of the Pre-Eminent Victorian Actor-Manager''. Aldershot, UK and Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate, 2008. (pg. 87) {{ISBN|0-7546-5829-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Frederick James Whishaw was born in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]], to English-born parents, Bernard Whishaw of Cheltenham and Isabel Maria Cattley, on 14 March 1854; he was one of eight children.  His family had been in Russia since the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Anthony Glenn. ''The Russian Theme in English Literature from the Sixteenth Century to 1980: An Introductory Survey and a Bibliography''. Oxford: Willem A. Meeuws, 1985. (pg. 54) {{ISBN|0-902672-70-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight weeks after his birth, his parents moved the family back to Great Britain and settled in [[Paignton]], [[Devon]] where Whishaw would spend much of his childhood. He was educated at [[Leamington College]] and then at [[Uppingham School|Uppingham]] where became an accomplished [[Sportsperson|sportsman]] and [[tenor]]. He was also popular among his classmates for the [[care package|food hampers]] he often received from Russia.&lt;!--despite that his family had moved to England?--&gt;&lt;ref name="Auchmuty"&gt;Auchmuty, Rosemary, Robert J. Kirkpatrick and Joy Wotton, eds. ''The Encyclopaedia of Boy's School Stories, Volume 2''. Aldershot, UK and Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate, 2000. (pg. 336) {{ISBN|0-7546-0083-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16, Whishaw left school and returned to St. Petersburg to work for an office firm. He spent much of his recreational time running and rowing. He also had a collection of verses, ''Loves of the Flowers'', published in 1878. Unhappy with his occupation, Whishaw left ''Hills &amp; Whishaw'' and eventually emigrated to England after his marriage to Ethel Charlotte Moberly on 30 March 1880. Their first and only child, Gwendolen, was born on 13 January 1884. Returning to his childhood home of Paignton, he began a career as a musician and soon became a well-known and successful [[tenor]].&lt;ref name="Auchmuty"/&gt;

During this time, he also began translating the work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] which was published by [[Henry Vizetelly]] between 1886 and 1888.&lt;ref name="Foulkes"/&gt; His efforts eventually resulted in many of Dostoevsky's novels being made available for English-language readers in [[Victorian Britain]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="Auchmuty"/&gt;

Whishaw was soon inspired to try his hand at writing and had his [[semi-autobiography]], ''Out of Doors in Tsarland: A Record of the Seeings and Doings of a Wanderer in Russia'', published in 1893. A year later, his wrote his first children's novel, ''Boris the Bear-Hunter'', followed by ten more novels between 1895 and 1898, including his first collection of English "schoolboy" stories, ''Gubbins Minor and Some Other Fellows''. These and other stories were published as popular [[serial (literature)|serials]] in many [[British boys' magazines|boys' adventure magazines]] throughout his career.&lt;ref name="Auchmuty"/&gt;

His schoolboy stories were a mix of gentle humor and more serious themes of public school life such as theft, house matches&lt;!--is this intramural competition?--&gt;, and other common behavior of the time. It was his Russian-themed children's adventure stories and [[historical novels]] for which he was best known. Several of these stories took place in other parts of the world, such as [[colonial Africa]], as seen in ''The White Witch of the Matabele'' (1897), and focused on then-current events like ''The Three Scouts: A Story of the Boer War'' (1900). Whishaw also wrote several books on [[Russian history]], most notably the well-received ''Moscow: A Story of the French Invasion of 1812'' in 1905. He wrote his final novel, ''A Bespoken Bride'', in 1914 though many of his earlier stories continued to be reprinted for years afterwards. Whishaw died at his home in [[Slapton, Devon|Slapton]], [[Devon]] on 8 July 1934.&lt;ref name="Auchmuty"/&gt;

'''Frederick Schaefer''' was a [[Germans|German]] revolutionary and [[Union Army]] [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] during the [[American Civil War]].  He was a brigade commander at the battles of [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]] and [[Battle of Stones River|Stones River]] where he was killed in action.

==Biography==
Schaefer was born in [[Baden]] and served in the armed forces there.&lt;ref name=Sheridan&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4362/4362-h/p2.htm Personal Memoirs of Philip H. Sheridan]&lt;/ref&gt;  He came to the United States as a result of his participation in the [[Revolutions of 1848]], and settled in [[Missouri]].  He was appointed colonel of the [[2nd Missouri Volunteer Infantry|2nd Missouri Infantry]] and assigned to the [[Army of the Southwest]].  His regiment was part of the understrength 2nd Division commanded by [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Alexander Asboth]].  By seniority of his rank, Schaefer assumed command of the 1st Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Shea p.332&lt;/ref&gt;  During the battle of Pea Ridge, Asboth's division was primarily held in reserved.  On the second day of the battle, Schaefer's brigade took part in [[Franz Sigel]]'s counterattack.&lt;ref&gt;Shea p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Union victory at Pea Ridge much of the Army of the Southwest was transferred to the Western Army Group commanded by [[Henry Halleck]].  Asboth's division was decreased to a brigade status in the [[Army of the Mississippi]].  Schaefer returned to regimental command during the [[siege of Corinth]].  During the [[Confederate Heartland Offensive|Kentucky Campaign]], Schaefer was on sick leave and his regiment was led by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Bernard Laiboldt.  When Schaefer returned to command he was once again the ranking officer in his brigade.  He assumed command of the 2nd Brigade in [[Philip H. Sheridan]]'s 3rd Division of the [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]].  During the battle of Stones River Schaefer's brigade was initially held in reserve of Sheridan's division.  His men were soon on the front lines and eventually began to run low on ammunition.  Not having an adequate supply on hand, Sheridan ordered his brigade commanders to fix bayonets and continue to resist the Confederate attacks.  Sheridan's division was hard pressed throughout the first day of the battle and Schaefer became Sheridan's fourth brigade commander to fall in battle.&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt;

'''Hadley J. Castille''' (March 3, 1933&lt;ref name="yule09p49"&gt;[[#Yule09|Yule 2009]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; – October 25, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kplctv.com/story/19917179/louisiana-fiddling-legend-hadley-castille-dies|title=Louisiana Fiddling Legend Hadley Castille Dies|first=Elona|last=Weston|accessdate=October 30, 2012|date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a prominent [[Cajun]] [[fiddler]].

==Early life==
Castille was born to a [[Cajun French]] speaking family.  His father was named François Castille. He learned to play the fiddle from his Uncle Cyprien Castille at around the age of 9.&lt;ref name="yule09p49" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AcadianMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acadianmuseum.com/legends.php?viewID=56|title=Hadley J. Castille|accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving around for a while, he ended up in [[Pecaniere]] – a small community near Leonville, LA. Here, he first heard "Jole Blon" by [[Harry Choates]] during a trip to the Silver Slipper, a grocery store and bar.&lt;ref name="Brasseaux09p157"&gt;[[#Brasseaux09|Brasseaux 2009]], p.157.&lt;/ref&gt; The song inspired him to take up a new style of playing.&lt;ref name="yule09p50"&gt;[[#Yule09|Yule 2009]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s, he started playing at Roy's Bar in [[Port Barre, LA]] and local house parties.&lt;ref name="yule09p51"&gt;[[#Yule09|Yule 2009]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they played on the KSLO "Amateur Hour" segments on Saturday mornings.&lt;ref name="yule09p51" /&gt; After graduating, Castille moved to New Orleans to play in a country band.  However, after four to five months he moved back to Leonville, and eventually enlisted in the [[US Army]].&lt;ref name="yule09p51" /&gt; The [[Korean War]] ended soon after arriving in [[Fort Hood, Texas]].  He spent his entire service in [[Killeen, Texas]], where he played in an on base band.&lt;ref name="yule09p51" /&gt; After service, he backed off from music to focus on family and his plumbing business.&lt;ref name="yule09p52"&gt;[[#Yule09|Yule 2009]], p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival du Voyageur==
In the early 1980s, Castille was invited to perform at Le Festival du Voyageur, Western Canada's largest winter festival.  This experience caused him to relearn old Cajun tunes and focus on sharpening his skills.&lt;ref name="yule09p52" /&gt; He returned to the festival for the next 18 years.&lt;ref name="yule09p52" /&gt; He started recording music and playing many festivals during this time.&lt;ref name="yule09p52" /&gt;

==Later life==
In his later life, Castille continued to perform with his sharecropper band, and also lead many workshops at festivals.&lt;ref name="yule09p52"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Castille's played Cajun music most his life.  This earned Castille many awards over the years.  He has been inducted into the Louisiana Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="AcadianMuseum" /&gt; Also, he has received the Acadiana Folk Heritage Award from the Acadiana Arts Council. He has been inducted into the Northwestern University Hall of Master Folk Artists.&lt;ref name="AcadianMuseum" /&gt; His work with "200 Lines: I Must Not Speak French" has earned him a Cajun French Music Association Heritage Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hadley-J.-Castille/e/B000AQ2XW2/|title=Hadley J. Castille: Albums, Songs, Bios, Photos|accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an honorable discharge from the United States Army having served during the Korean War.&lt;ref name="AcadianMuseum" /&gt; Also, his music has been heard in films, such as [[A Perfect World]] with [[Clint Eastwood]].&lt;ref name="AcadianMuseum" /&gt;

'''Harold Waldwin Percival''' (15 April 1868 - 6 March 1953) was a philosopher and writer, best known for ''[[Thinking and Destiny]]'', in print since 1946.  Between 1904 and 1917 he published ''The Word''. In 1950 he founded [[The Word Foundation]], Inc. to keep ''Thinking and Destiny'' and all of his other works in print.

==Biography==
Harold Waldwin Percival was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, British West Indies in 1868 to parents of English descent. When his father died his mother moved to the United States, eventually settling in New York City.
 
Even as a young boy, Harold Percival was a seeker of truth. He was convinced that there were "wise ones" who could answer his many questions and impart knowledge. As a young man, one of his first experiences on his quest for knowledge came in 1892 when he joined the [[Theosophical Society]]. He would later help to organize the Theosophical Society Independent of New York and for many years serve as its president while also writing and lecturing.

In 1893, and twice during the next 14 years, Percival had the unique experience of being "conscious of Consciousness," a potent spiritual and noetic enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;''Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology'', Fifth Edition, Volume 2 Edited by J. Gordon Melton Page 1196 Gale Group 27500 Drake Rd. Farmington Hills, MI 48331 {{ISBN|0810394898}} (Volume 2)&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the value of that experience was that it enabled him to know about any subject by a process he called "real thinking." Because these experiences revealed to him more than was contained in Theosophy, he wanted to share this knowledge with humanity.

In 1902 Percival started to develop his own system. For over 30 years he worked on the manuscript that would lead to the writing of his magnum opus, ''[[Thinking and Destiny]]'', now more than 65 years in print. He subsequently published three books expanding upon topics in the light of his system: ''Man and Woman and Child'' (1951), ''Masonry and Its Symbols'' (1952 ) and ''Democracy Is Self-Government'' (1952).

Between 1904 and 1917 Mr. Percival published ''The Word'', a magazine with a worldwide circulation dedicated to the brotherhood of humanity. Percival's own articles earned him a place in Who's Who in America (1928–29).

In 1950, The Word Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization, was established for the purpose of making known to the people of the world the writings of Harold W. Percival.

==Influence==
Percival’s works were noted as a major influence upon Richard Matheson, the famous science-fiction author. He said that his book ''The Path'' (1998) was based largely on ''[[Thinking and Destiny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, Richard (1998). ''The Path: Metaphysics for the 90’s.'' [[The Word Foundation]], Inc. {{ISBN|091165013X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''The [[Bhagavad Gita]]: The Song of the Exalted Self'', 1999, by Owen Slight, the author states that Harold W. Percival’s ''Thinking and Destiny'', like the [[Bhagavad Gita]], reveals relevant, instructive and long lasting lessons regarding the higher self and the human plight—long lost lessons of everlasting truth contained both in the Sanskrit ''Bhagavad Gita'' and ''Thinking and Destiny''. Both books contain complete systems of knowledge. The plight of [[Arjuna]] is shown by Percival to be our own.&lt;ref&gt;Slight, Owen, The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self, Owen Slight Publisher, 1999 {{ISBN|064635602X}}, 9780646356020&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ion Iliescu''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon iliˈesku|-|Ro-Ion Iliescu.ogg}}; born 3 March 1930) is a Romanian [[politician]] who served as [[President of Romania]] from 1989 until 1996, and from 2000 until 2004. From 1996 to 2000 and from 2004 until his retirement in 2008, Iliescu was a [[Senate of Romania|senator]] for the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), of which he is honorary president.

He joined the Communist Party in 1953 and became a member of its Central Committee in 1965. However, beginning with 1971, he was gradually marginalized by [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]. He had a leading role in the [[Romanian Revolution]], becoming the country's president in December 1989. In May 1990, he became Romania's first freely elected head of state. After a new constitution was approved by popular referendum, he served a further two terms as president, from 1992 to 1996, and from 2000 to 2004, separated by the presidency of [[Emil Constantinescu]], who defeated him in 1996.

Iliescu is widely recognized as a predominant figure in the first fifteen years of post-revolution politics. During his presidency, Romania joined [[NATO]]. In April 2018, Ion Iliescu was charged in Romania with committing [[crimes against humanity]] during the deadly aftermath of the country's 1989 revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stirileprotv.ro/justitie/ion-iliescu-asteptat-la-parchetul-general-fostul-presedinte-este-urmarit-penal-in-dosarul-revolutiei.html |title=Dosarul ”Revoluției”.

==Early life and entering politics==
{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}
Iliescu's father, Alexandru Iliescu, was a railroad worker with [[Communism|Communist]] views during the period in which the [[Romanian Communist Party]] was banned by the authorities. In 1931, he went to the [[Soviet Union]] to take part in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] Congress of [[Moscow]]. He remained in the USSR for the next four years and was arrested upon his return. He was imprisoned from June 1940 to August 1944 and died in August 1945. During his time in the Soviet Union, Alexandru Iliescu divorced and married Marița, a chambermaid.

Iliescu married Nina Șerbănescu in 1951; they have no children, not by choice but because they could not, as Nina had three [[miscarriage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ziua.net/news.php?data=2008-09-06&amp;id=12256 "De ce nu a avut Ion Iliescu urmasi"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Ziua'', 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Oltenița]], Iliescu studied [[fluid mechanics]] at the [[Bucharest Polytechnic Institute]] and then as a foreign student at the Energy Institute of the [[Moscow University]]. During his stay in Moscow, he was the secretary of the "Association of Romanian Students" it is alleged that he met [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], although Iliescu always denied this.&lt;ref name="risingstar"&gt;[[New York Times]], "Upheaval in the East: A Rising Star; A Man Who Could Become Rumania's Leader", 23 December 1989, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, years later, president [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] probably believed that there was a connection between the two, since during Gorbachev's visit to Romania in July 1989, Iliescu was sent outside of Bucharest to prevent any contact.&lt;ref&gt;''[[România Liberă]]''. "Gura lumii despre România", 8 May 1990, quoting [[Paris Match]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:016.Vacanta-pentrecuta-in-Moldova-1976.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ion Iliescu in 1976 with [[Elena Ceaușescu]]]]
He joined the [[Union of Communist Youth]] in 1944 and the Communist Party in 1953 and made a career in the Communist [[nomenklatura]], becoming a secretary of the [[Central Committee]] of the Union of Communist Youth in 1956 and a member of the Central Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] in 1965. At one point, he served as the head of the Central Committee's Department of Propaganda.&lt;ref name="risingstar"/&gt; Iliescu later served as Minister for Youth-related Issues between 1967 and 1971.

However, in 1971, Ceaușescu felt threatened by Iliescu, who was seen as Ceaușescu's heir apparent. He was marginalized and removed from all major political offices, becoming vice-president of the [[Timiș County]] Council (1971–1974), and later president of the [[Iași County|Iași]] Council (1974–1979). Until 1989, he was in charge of the Editura Tehnică publishing house. For most of the 1980s (if not before), he was tailed by the [[Securitate]] (secret police), as he was known to oppose Ceaușescu's harsh rule.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanian Revolution==
{{Main article|Romanian Revolution}}
The Romanian Revolution began as a popular revolt in [[Timișoara]]. After Ceaușescu was overthrown on 22 December (he was executed on Christmas Day), the political vacuum was filled by an organization named [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN: ''Frontul Salvării Naționale''), formed spontaneously by second-rank communist party members opposed to the policies of Ceaușescu and non-affiliated participants in the revolt. Iliescu was quickly acknowledged as the leader of the organization and therefore of the provisional authority. He first learned of the revolution when he noticed the Securitate was no longer tailing him.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;

[[File:CFSN Revolution Roumaine.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three men are walking side-by-side holding papers. The first two are wearing a suit and the third is wearing a red sweater. The first man is smiling and flashing a V sign.|Iliescu (center) with FSN members Dumitru Mazilu (left) and [[Petre Roman]] (right) on 23 December 1989, one day after the formation of the FSN.]]
Iliescu proposed multi-party elections and an "original democracy". This is widely held to have meant the adoption of ''[[Perestroika]]''-style reforms rather than the complete removal of existing institutions; it can be linked to the warm reception the new regime was given by Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leadership, and the fact that the first post-revolutionary international agreement signed by Romania was with that country.

Iliescu did not renounce Communist ideology and the program he initially presented during the revolution included restructuring the agriculture and the reorganization of trade, but not a switch to capitalism.&lt;ref name="risingstar"/&gt; These views were held by other members of the FSN as well, such as [[Silviu Brucan]], who claimed in early 1990 that the revolution was against Ceaușescu, not against communism.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Iliescu later evoked the possibility of trying a "[[Sweden|Swedish]] model" of socialism.

Rumours abounded for years that Illiescu and other second-rank Communists had been planning to overthrow Ceaușescu, but the events of December 1989 overtook them. For instance, [[Nicolae Militaru]], the new regime's first [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|defense minister]], said that Illiescu and others had planned to take Ceaușescu prisoner in February 1990 while he was out of the capital. However, Illiescu denies this, saying that the nature of the Ceaușescu regime—particularly the Securitate's ubiquity—made advance planning for a coup all but impossible.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;

The [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] decided to organize itself as a party and run in the [[Romanian general election, 1990|1990 general election]]—the first free election held in the country in 53 years. It won a sweeping victory, taking over 70% of the votes. In the separate presidential election, Iliescu won handily, taking 85 percent of the vote. He thus became Romania's first democratically elected head of state, and the first since 1947 who was not a Communist or [[fellow traveler]].

Iliescu and his supporters split from the Front and created the Democratic National Salvation Front (NSDF), which later evolved into the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), then the Social Democratic Party (PSD) (see [[Social Democratic Party of Romania]]). Progressively, the Front lost its character as a [[Central government|national government]] or generic coalition, and became vulnerable to criticism for using its appeal as the first institution involved in power sharing, while engaging itself in political battles with forces that could not enjoy this status, nor the credibility.

Under the pressure of the events that led to the [[Mineriad]]s, his political stance has veered with time: from a proponent of ''Perestroika'', Iliescu recast himself as a Western European [[social democracy|social democrat]]. The main debate around the subject of his commitment to such ideals is linked to the special conditions in Romania, and especially to the strong [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist]] and autarkic attitude visible within the Ceaușescu regime. Critics have pointed out that, unlike most communist-to-social democrat changes in the [[Eastern bloc]], Romania's tended to retain various cornerstones.

The new [[Romanian Constitution|Constitution]] was adopted in 1991, and in 1992 he won a second term when he received 61% of the vote. He immediately suspended his NSDF membership; the Constitution does not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his term. After the June 16, 1991 [[bridge of flowers (event)|bridge of flowers]], [[Mircea Snegur]], then [[President of the Republic of Moldova]], proposed in August Iliescu the union of the two countries. Snegur would become the Vice President of Romania. However, his proposal was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/cum-explica-ion-iliescu-faptul-romania-republica-moldova-nu-s-au-unit-august-1991-1_53e7567d0d133766a82a7a34/index.html |title=Cum explică Ion Iliescu faptul că România și Republica Moldova nu s-au unit în august 1991 |work=Adevărul |author=Sebastian Zachmann |date=August 10, 2014 |language=Romanian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028164824/http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/cum-explica-ion-iliescu-faptul-romania-republica-moldova-nu-s-au-unit-august-1991-1_53e7567d0d133766a82a7a34/index.html |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran for a third time in 1996 but, stripped of media monopoly, he lost to [[Emil Constantinescu]]. Over 1,000,000 votes were cancelled, leading to accusations of widespread fraud.

In the [[Romanian presidential elections, 2000|2000 presidential election]] Iliescu ran again and won in the run-off against the ultra-nationalist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitatea.net/preda-antonescu-il-secondeaza-pe-vadim-tudor-cu-discursul-ultranationalist_718413.html|title=Preda: Antonescu îl secondează pe Vadim Tudor cu discursul ultranaţionalist|publisher=Realitatea|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927232910/http://www.realitatea.net/preda-antonescu-il-secondeaza-pe-vadim-tudor-cu-discursul-ultranationalist_718413.html|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?sec=article&amp;article_id=4066|title=Article|publisher=SF Bay Times|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016063611/http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?sec=article&amp;article_id=4066|archivedate=16 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/romania/tudor.html|title=House of Tudor|publisher=PBS|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106052244/http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/romania/tudor.html|archivedate=6 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]]. He began his third term on 20 December of that year, ending on 20 December 2004. The center-right was severely defeated during the 2000 elections due largely to public dissatisfaction with the harsh economic reforms of the previous four years as well as the political instability and infighting of the multiparty coalition. Tudor's extreme views also ensured that most urban voters either abstained or chose Iliescu.

In the PSD elections of 21 April 2005, Iliescu lost the Party presidency to [[Mircea Geoană]], but was elected as honorary president of the party in 2006, a position without official executive authority in the party.

==Controversies==
Though enjoying a certain popularity due to his opposition to Ceaușescu and image as a revolutionary, his political career after 1989 was characterized by multiple controversies and scandals. Public opinion regarding his tenure as president is still divided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfin.ro/articol_13481/al_cincilea_iliescu.html?action=print|title=Al Cincilea Iliescu|publisher=Income Magazine|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323014416/http://www.sfin.ro/articol_13481/al_cincilea_iliescu.html?action=print|archivedate=23 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged KGB connections===
Some alleged Iliescu had connections to the [[KGB]], the allegations continued during 2003–2008, when Russian dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], who had been granted access to Soviet archives, declared that Iliescu and some of the NSF members were KGB agents, that Iliescu had been in close connection with Mikhail Gorbachev ever since they had allegedly met during Iliescu's stay in Moscow, and that the Romanian Revolution of 1989 was a plot organized by the KGB to regain control of the country's policies (gradually lost under Ceaușescu's rule).&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-6209804-russian-dissident-who-copied-the-gorbachev-foundations-archive-mitterrand-and-gorbachev-wanted-the-european-socialist-union-thatcher-opposed-germanys-reunification.htm Russian dissident who copied the Gorbachev Foundation's archive: Mitterrand and Gorbachev wanted the European Socialist Union, Thatcher opposed Germany's reunification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130233603/http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-6209804-russian-dissident-who-copied-the-gorbachev-foundations-archive-mitterrand-and-gorbachev-wanted-the-european-socialist-union-thatcher-opposed-germanys-reunification.htm |date=30 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only hard evidence published was a discussion between Gorbachev and Bulgaria's [[Aleksandar Lilov]] from 23 May 1990 (after Iliescu's victory in the May 20 elections) in which Gorbachev says that Iliescu holds a "calculated position", and that despite sharing common views with Iliescu, Gorbachev wanted to avoid sharing this impression with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=199569&amp;data=15-05-2006 Dovada Bukovski] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201102614/http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=199569&amp;data=15-05-2006 |date=1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mineriads===
{{Main article|Mineriad}}
He, along with other figures in the leading [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|FSN]], was allegedly responsible for calling the [[Jiu Valley]] miners to Bucharest on 28 January and 14 June 1990 to end the protests of the citizens gathered in [[University Square, Bucharest]], protests aimed against the ex-communist leaders of Romania (like himself). The pejorative term for this demonstration was the [[Golaniad]] (from the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''golan'', rascal). On 13 June, an attempt of the authorities to remove from the square around 100 protesters, which had remained in the street even after the [[Romanian presidential election, 1990|May elections]] had confirmed Iliescu and the FSN, resulted in attacks against several state institutions, such as the Ministry of Interior, the Bucharest Police Headquarters and the National Television. Iliescu issued a call to the Romanian people to come and defend the government, prompting several groups of miners to descend on the capital, armed with wooden clubs and bats. They trashed the [[University of Bucharest]], some newspaper offices and the headquarters of opposition parties, claiming that they were havens of decadence and immorality – drugs, firearms and munitions, "an automatic typewriter", and fake currency. The [[June 1990 Mineriad]] in particular was widely criticized both at home and internationally, with one historian (Andrei Pippidi) comparing the events to Nazi Germany's [[Kristallnacht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Constantin Petre|url=http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/mineriadele-anului-1990-democratia-sub-bate-898037.html|title=Mineriadele anului 1990, democraţia sub bâte|publisher=EVZ|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010083428/http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/mineriadele-anului-1990-democratia-sub-bate-898037.html|archivedate=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/exclusiv-rl/investigatii/minerii-au-terorizat-capitala-30479.html|title=Minerii au terorizat Capitala|publisher=Romania Libera|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008110518/http://www.romanialibera.ro/exclusiv-rl/investigatii/minerii-au-terorizat-capitala-30479.html|archivedate=8 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government inquiries later established that the miners were infiltrated and instigated by former [[Securitate]] operatives.&lt;ref name="Baleanu"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/romania/g43.html Baleanu, V.

===King Michael===
In 1992, three years after the revolution which overthrew the Communist dictatorship, the Romanian government allowed [[Michael I of Romania|King Michael]] to return to his country for Easter celebrations, where he drew large crowds{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. In Bucharest over a million people turned out to see him{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Michael's popularity alarmed the government of President Ion Iliescu, so Michael was forbidden to visit Romania again for five years{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. In 1997, after Iliescu's defeat by Emil Constantinescu, the Romanian Government restored Michael's citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

In December 2001, Iliescu pardoned three inmates convicted for [[bribery]], including George Tănase, former [[Garda Financiara|Financial Guard]] head commissioner for [[Ialomița County|Ialomița]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www2.gds.ro/Actualitate/2002-01-04/Presedintele+Ion+Iliescu+a+acordat+gratieri Presedintele Ion Iliescu a acordat gratieri] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619125248/http://www2.gds.ro/Actualitate/2002-01-04/Presedintele+Ion+Iliescu+a+acordat+gratieri |date=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iliescu had to revoke Tănase's pardon a few days later due to the media outcry, claiming that "a legal adviser was superficial in analyzing the case".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-49352551.html Romania's president to cancel pardon, pledges to fight corruption] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106062029/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-49352551.html |date=6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}}[http://www2.gds.ro/Opinii/2002-01-14/Colaboratorii+presedintelui Colaboratorii presedintelui.

He was sentenced to three years and a half but was pardoned after only a couple of months.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-arhiva-1248257-ambasada-sua-nu-inceput-anchetarea-puscasului-marin.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925231808/http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-arhiva-1248257-ambasada-sua-nu-inceput-anchetarea-puscasului-marin.htm |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Ambasada SUA: Nu a inceput anchetarea puscasului marin] (in the background section)&lt;/ref&gt; Tartagă was later sentenced to a two-year sentence for [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.phg.ro/stire.php?id=7335&amp;cat_id=10 Afacere imobiliara cu iz de TBC la Brasov] (in the background section)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most controversial of all, on 15 December 2004, a few days before the end of his last term, Iliescu [[pardon]]ed 47 convicts, including [[Miron Cozma]], the leader of the miners during the early 1990s, who had been sentenced in 1999 to 18 years in prison in conjunction with the [[September 1991 Mineriad]]. This has attracted harsh criticism from all Romanian media.&lt;ref name=evz46&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://archive.is/20130416115702/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/669963/Gratiatii-lui-Iliescu-Nastase-corupti-tilhari-violatori-tepari/ Gratiatii lui Iliescu-Nastase: corupti, tilhari, violatori, tepari]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pardoned had been convicted for corruption or other economic crimes, while one had been imprisoned for his involvement in the attempts at suppressing the 1989 Revolution.&lt;ref name=evz46/&gt;

===Decorating Vadim Tudor===
In the last days of his President mandate, he awarded the National Order ''[[Steaua României]]'' (rank of ceremonial knighthood) to the ultra-nationalist controversial politician [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]], a gesture which drew criticism in the press and prompted [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Elie Wiesel]], fifteen [[Radio Free Europe]] journalists, [[Timișoara]] mayor [[Gheorghe Ciuhandu]], songwriter [[Alexandru Andrieș]], and historian [[Randolph Braham]] to return their Romanian honours in protest. The leader of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, [[Béla Markó]], did not show up to claim the award he received on the same occasion. President Traian Băsescu revoked the award granted to Tudor on 24 May 2007, but a lawsuit is ongoing even after Băsescu's decree was declared constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.ziua.ro/news.php?data=2009-01-20&amp;id=19614 Curtea Constituțională a respins excepția invocată de Vadim Tudor in procesul privind Ordinul "Steaua Romaniei"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927095437/http://www.ziua.ro/news.php?data=2009-01-20&amp;id=19614 |date=27 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black sites===
Ion Iliescu is mentioned in the report of the [[Council of Europe]] investigator into illegal activities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in Europe, [[Dick Marty]]. He is pointed out as one of the people who authorized or at least knew about and have to stand accountable for [[Black site|torture prisons]] at [[Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport|Mihail Kogălniceanu]] airbase from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2007/EMarty_20070608_NoEmbargo.pdf|title=Secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states: second report|author=Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights|date=7 June 2007|work=Parliamentary Assembly|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=11 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606232511/http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2007/EMarty_20070608_NoEmbargo.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, Iliescu confirmed that he had granted a CIA request for a site in Romania, but was not aware of the nature of the site, describing it as a small gesture of goodwill to an ally in advance of Romania's eventual accession to NATO. Iliescu further stated that had he known of the intended use of the site, he would certainly not have approved the request.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 2015-04-22"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verseck |first=Keno |date=2015-04-22 |title=Folter in Rumänien: Ex-Staatschef Iliescu gibt Existenz von CIA-Gefängnis zu |trans-title=Torture in Romania: Former Head of State Iliescu Acknowledges Existence of CIA Prison |language=German |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/cia-foltergefaengnisse-in-rumaenien-ion-iliescu-gibt-existenz-zu-a-1028917.html |journal=[[Der Spiegel]] |location=Hamburg, Germany |publisher=Spiegel-Verlag |access-date=2015-04-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423154042/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/cia-foltergefaengnisse-in-rumaenien-ion-iliescu-gibt-existenz-zu-a-1028917.html |archivedate=23 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaiah ben Abraham Horowitz''' ({{lang-he-n|ישעיה בן אברהם הלוי הורוויץ}}), (c. 1555&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trachtenberg/&gt; – March 24, 1630), also known as the '''''Shelah haqQaddosh''''' ({{hebrew|השל"ה הקדוש}} "the holy ''Shelah''") after the title of his best-known work, was a prominent [[Levite]] [[rabbi]] and [[Kabbalah|mystic]].

==Biography==
Isaiah Horowitz was born in [[Prague]] around 1555.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=HOROWITZ, ISAIAH|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7876-horowitz-isaiah|accessdate=Jan 5, 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;'''''Jewish Encyclopedia'' bibliography:'''{{Bulleted list|[[David Conforte|Conforte]], ''Ḳore ha-Dorot'', p. 47b;|[[Chaim Yosef David Azulai|Azulai]], ''Shem ha-Gedolim'';|[[Moritz Steinschneider|Steinschneider]], ''{{abbr|Cat. Bodl.|Catalogue of the Hebrew Books in the Bodleian Library }}'';|[[Leser Landshuth|Landshuth]], ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Ammude ha-'Abodah'', pp. 133-134, Berlin, 1862;|[[Aryeh Leib Frumkin|Frumkin]], ''Eben Shemuel'', pp. 111-122, Jerusalem and Wilna, 1874;|[[Márkus Horovitz|Horovitz]], ''Frankfurter Rabbinen'', i. 41-44, 58-60 (in which Horowitz's contract with the Frankfort congregation is reproduced);|Pesis, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Aṭeret ha-Lewiyim'', Warsaw, 1902.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trachtenberg&gt;{{Cite book|last=Trachtenberg|first=Joshua|title=Jewish Magic and Superstition|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|year=2004|origyear=Originally published 1939|isbn=9780812218626|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first teacher was his father, Avraham ben Shabtai Sheftel Horowitz, a notable scholar and author, and a disciple of [[Moses Isserles]] (Rema). Horowitz studied under [[Meir Lublin]] and [[Joshua Falk]]. He married Chaya, daughter of Abraham Moul, of [[Vienna]], and was a wealthy and active philanthropist, supporting [[Torah study]], especially in [[Jerusalem]]. In 1590, in [[Lublin]], he participated in a meeting of the [[Council of Four Lands]], and his signature appears on a decree that condemns the purchase of rabbinic positions.

In 1602, Isaiah Horowitz was appointed [[Av Beit Din]] in [[Austria]], and in 1606 was appointed Rabbi of [[Frankfurt]]. In 1614, after serving as rabbi in prominent cities in [[Europe]], he left following the [[Frankfurter Judengasse#The Fettmilch Uprising|Fettmilch Uprising]] and assumed the prestigious position of chief rabbi of [[Prague]].

In 1621, after the death of his wife, he moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], was appointed rabbi of the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi community]] in Jerusalem, and married Hava, daughter of Eleazer. In 1625, he was kidnapped and imprisoned, together with 15 other Jewish rabbis and scholars, by the [[Pasha]] (Ibn Faruh) and held for ransom. After 1626, Horowitz moved to [[Safed]], erstwhile home of Kabbalah, and later died in [[Tiberias]] on March 24, 1630 ([[Nisan]] 11, 5390 on the [[Hebrew calendar]]).

In his many [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]], [[aggadah|homiletic]] and [[halakha|halachic]] works, he stressed the joy in every action, and how one should convert the [[Jewish principles of faith#The soul is pure at birth|evil inclination]] into good, two concepts that influenced Jewish thought through to the eighteenth-century, and greatly influenced the development of [[Hasidic Judaism]].

Famous descendants of Isaiah Horowitz included [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin]] (known as {{hebrew|החוזה מלובלין}} "The Seer of Lublin"), the prominent Billiczer rabbinical family of [[Szerencs]], [[Hungary]] and the Dym family of rabbis and communal leaders in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. [[Aaron HaLevi ben Moses of Staroselye]], one of the most prominent student of [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], founder of [[Chabad]], the Fruchter-Langer families and Rabbi Meir Zelig Mann of Memel, Lithuania (b. 1921, d. 2008).

==Works==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tanya]] --&gt;
His most important work ''Shenei Luḥot HaBerit'' ({{lang-he-n|שני לוחות הברית}}, ''[[Ten Commandments#Written in Stone|Two Tablets]] of the Covenant'', abbreviated ''Shelah'' {{hebrew|של"ה}}), is an encyclopedic compilation of ritual, [[ethics]], and mysticism. It was originally intended as an [[ethical will]] - written as a compendium of the Jewish religion. The title page of the first edition states that the work is "compiled from both [[Torah]]s, [[Chumash (Judaism)|Written]] and [[Oral Torah|Oral]], [[tradition|handed down]] from [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Sinai]]". The work has had a profound influence on Jewish life - notably, on the early Hasidic movement, including the [[Baal Shem Tov]]; [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] was described as a "''Shelah [[Yid]]''", and ''Shelah'' clearly echoes in his work, ''[[Tanya]]''. The work was first published in 1648 by his son, [[Shabbethai Horowitz]], and has been often reprinted, especially in an abbreviated form. (See also [[:he:שני לוחות הברית (ספר)|שני לוחות הברית article]] in the [[Hebrew Wikipedia]]).

Horowitz also wrote the ''Sha'ar ha-Shamayim'' [[siddur]] (prayer book) which had an influence on the later Ashkenazi ''[[nusach]]''.

==Tefillat HaShlah - The Shelah's Prayer==
Rabbi Horowitz wrote that the eve of the first day of the month of [[Sivan]] is the most auspicious time to pray for the physical and spiritual welfare of one's children and grandchildren, since [[Sivan]] was the month that the [[Torah]] was given to the Jewish people. He composed a special prayer to be said on this day, known as the ''Tefillat HaShlah'' "the Shelah's Prayer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hakolhayehudi.co.il/midrash/ערב-ראש-חודש-סיוון-תפילת-השלה-171|date=May 18, 2015|website=hakolhayehudi.co.il|language=he|script-title=he:ערב ראש חודש סיוון: תפילת השל"ה|trans-title=Eve of the First of the Month of Sivan: The Shelah's Prayer|access-date=Jan 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the custom of saying this prayer on the appointed day has become very popular among [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] parents.

'''Issad Rebrab''' (born 1944), is an Algerian [[billionaire]] businessman, CEO of the [[Cevital]] industrial group, the largest private company in Algeria, active in steel, food, agribusiness and electronics.

According to ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'', Rebrab is the ninth richest person in Africa, with an estimated net worth of US$4.31 billion, as of June 2017.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|title=Issad Rebrab|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/issad-rebrab/|website=Forbes|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
After graduating from a professional school, Rebrab taught accounting and commercial law. He soon left teaching, and started his own accounting firm.

==Career==
His industrial career started in 1971, when one of his clients proposed he take shares in a metallurgical construction company. He took 20% of the shares in Sotecom. After that, he created other companies in the steel industry: Profilor in 1975 and Metal Sider in 1988.

In 1995, his main installations were destroyed in a terrorist attack. After he recognized the risks of staying, Rebrab decided to leave Algeria. He came back in 1998 with Cevital, the biggest group in agricultural business, which later became the largest private Algerian company. Cevital owns one of the largest sugar refineries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nsehe|first1=Mfonobong|title=Algeria's Richest Man Issad Rebrab to Construct $150 Million Sugar Refinery in Sri Lanka|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2016/10/15/algerias-richest-man-issad-rebrab-to-construct-150-million-sugar-refinery-in-sri-lanka/#a971be64eea2|website=Forbes|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issam al-Attar''' ({{lang-ar|عصام العطار}}) is a former [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leader, a symbol of resistance to [[Hafez al-Assad]], and in exile in [[Aachen]], Germany since the 1970s.

'''James William Benson''' ({{circa|1945}} – October 10, 2008),&lt;ref name= "TWP"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/15/AR2008101503271.html |title= James Benson; Inventor Led Computer, Space Firms |author= Sullivan, Patricia |date= October 16, 2008 |work= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate= June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Jim Benson''', was the founder of [[SpaceDev]], a commercial satellite and satellite component development company, and the Benson Space Company, a civilian spaceflight venture focused on commercial space tourism.

==Biography==
Benson spent thirty years associated with the computer field, spanning the era from the introduction of modern mainframe computers, to the dominance of the computer industry by microcomputers. Benson's partner Hal Woodward invented modern [[Full text search|full text computer indexing and searching]] in 1981 based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation – the search system was called FARA (FAR Automated), and Benson exploited the new field through companies he co-founded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Benson was active in the early days of [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC). In the early 1990s, he assembled a large collection of help files that became the predecessor to today's [http://www.irchelp.org/ IRChelp.org].

Benson was a founding member of the Personal Spaceflight Federation. Benson was on the Board of Directors of the [[California Space Authority]] from 2005 to 2007&lt;ref name=SpaceRef20050125&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=15989 2005-01-25 News release on SpaceRef]&lt;/ref&gt; was named one of the "50 People to Watch in 2005" by [[San Diego magazine]], and was named 2005 "Alumnus of the Year" by the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City|University of Missouri at Kansas City]]. He founded the non-profit Space Development Institute, and introduced the Benson Prize for Amateur Discovery of [[Near-Earth object|Near Earth Objects]]. Benson was Vice-Chairman and private sector representative on [[NASA]]'s national Space Grant Review Panel.&lt;ref name= "TWP"/&gt; Benson received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Geology]] from the [[University of Missouri at Kansas City]], in his hometown.

===SpaceDev===
{{Main|SpaceDev}}
After a successful career as a computer industry entrepreneur, Benson decided to take on the challenge of starting a [[commercialization of space|space commercialization]] venture. It combined his lifelong interests in science, technology and astronomy with his successful business experience.

Benson started the trend of successful high tech entrepreneurs moving into the space development arena, by incorporating [[SpaceDev|SpaceDev, Inc.]] as a publicly owned space exploration and development company in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Benson and SpaceDev worked to develop the world's first private sector enterprise to profitably explore and develop space beyond earth orbit. SpaceDev's mission is to help "make space happen" for all of humanity, through the development of a comprehensive private space program, by delivering affordable and practical space technologies, products and solutions to SpaceDev's government and commercial customers, while creating value for SpaceDev stockholders.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Benson searched NASA's archives{{when|date=September 2012}} and "saw the [[HL-20]]'s potential as a project that had already received huge amounts of development money. [The vehicle had] friendly flying characteristics combined with a thick pedigree of expensive studies."&lt;ref name=at20120906/&gt;  
SpaceDev licensed the HL-20 technology from NASA and extended it to use for its new [[Dream Chaser]] [[suborbital]] [[spacecraft]].  Later, the Dream Chaser became a candidate for NASA's [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) Program for delivering cargo to and from the [[International Space Station]].  In the event, SpaceDev was not selected for award under COTS, but did sign a non-reimburseable [[Space Act Agreement]] to facilitate additional exchange of non-cash project milestones with NASA.&lt;ref name=at20120906/&gt;

Afterwards, Benson stepped down as Chairman of SpaceDev and founded the Benson Space Company to pursue the Dream Chaser project. "In the fall of 2007, Benson Space announced a partnership with United Launch Alliance to turn the Dream Chaser into an orbital vehicle by launching it on an Atlas V rocket. Benson and his team were going to try to go all the way to orbit."&lt;ref name=at20120906&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Klingler|first=Dave |title=50 years to orbit: Dream Chaser's crazy Cold War backstory: The reusable mini-spaceplane is back from the dead—again—and prepping for space |journal=Ars Technica|date=2012-09-06 |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/the-long-complicated-voyage-of-the-dream-chaser-may-yet-end-in-space/ |accessdate=2012-09-07 |quote=''A decade after HL-20's cancellation, Jim Benson, the founder of a small aerospace company called SpaceDev, looked through NASA's storage buildings and saw the [[HL-20]]'s potential as a project that had already received huge amounts of development money. Like several other entrepreneurs at that time, Benson wanted to get into the suborbital tourism business. He had looked at many vehicles, but only the HL-20 had such friendly flying characteristics combined with a thick pedigree of expensive studies. According to current SNC Space Systems Chairman Mark Sirangelo, '…we realized that the vehicle was one of the most tested and reviewed vehicles that had never flown.'  SpaceDev executed a licensing agreement with NASA to use the HL-20's design for its new Dream Chaser suborbital spacecraft; somehow, the HL-20 had escaped The Archives. Shortly after, the Dream Chaser became a candidate for NASA's [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) Program. NASA still needed means of taking cargo to and from the International Space Station, and it had decided to partner with private companies to get one.  But NASA didn't ultimately select the Dream Chaser for COTS. SpaceDev ended up signing an unfunded Space Act Agreement, a means of working with NASA that didn't involve funding, but that kept the company in the running for the next competition. Benson stepped down as Chairman of SpaceDev and founded the Benson Space Company to pursue the project. In the fall of 2007, Benson Space announced a partnership with United Launch Alliance to turn the Dream Chaser into an orbital vehicle by launching it on an Atlas V rocket. Benson and his team were going to try to go all the way to orbit.  Jim Benson's own dream of going to space ended after he was diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumor in the spring of 2008. He died that fall, and the Dream Chaser project reverted to SpaceDev. Several months later, the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) announced that it had purchased SpaceDev.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceDev acquired the former Integrated Space Systems, a space systems engineering firm, in 1998.&lt;ref name="SpaceDevSEC2000"&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/dV3p8.4dj.htm SpaceDev SEC form 10KSB, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, SpaceDev and its chairman James Benson were named in an administrative proceeding alleging securities fraud. The SEC alleged that SpaceDev and chairman Benson made false and misleading statements through various media in an attempt to increase its stock value. A settlement was later agreed upon that states that the SEC was founded in its allegations and SpaceDev cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Mr. Benson cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-41279.txt|title=United States Securities and Exchange Commission ruling against Spacedev|date=April 13, 1999|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceDev acquired the intellectual property of [[American Rocket Company]] in 1999 after AMROC's 1996 bankruptcy. The AMROC-derived [[hybrid rocket]] motors were used in several SpaceDev projects that followed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

SpaceDev started developing the science mission [[CHIPSat]] for the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1999. In 2003, [[SpaceDev]] launched the United States' smallest, low-cost, high performance satellite named CHIPSat for NASA. [[CHIPSat]] is a suitcase-size science microsatellite that is also the first U.S. mission to use only TCP/IP Internet communications for end-to-end satellite operations control, becoming the first satellite whose mission control and operations center is any laptop computer located anywhere in the world. Although the nominal mission duration was one year, the satellite operated successfully for almost five years when mission was terminated in April 2008.

In 2004, SpaceDev's hybrid rocket motors were used by [[Burt Rutan]]'s [[SpaceShipOne]] to win the $10 million [[Ansari X Prize]].

During his 10 years with the company, Benson served as founder, chairman, chief executive officer and chief technology officer of SpaceDev. He stepped down on September 28, 2006 to announce that he was starting a new venture called Benson Space Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spacedev.com/newsite/templates/subpage_article.php?pid=583|title=SpaceDev Announces Founder James Benson Steps Down as Chairman and CTO; Benson  Starts Independent Space Company to Market SpaceDev’s Dream Chaser|publisher=SpaceDev|date=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benson Space Company===
Jim Benson announced on September 28, 2006 that he had launched an ambitious new venture focused on commercial space tourism, Benson Space Company.&lt;ref name=bsc20060926&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=20930 |title= SpaceDev Founder Jim Benson Launches Civilian Spaceflight Venture, Benson Space Company |publisher= SpaceRef |date= September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2006}}, Benson Space stated intentions to be first to market in the emerging multibillion-dollar space tourism or personal spaceflight industry, with the safest and lowest cost astronaut-making suborbital missions.&lt;ref name=bsc20060926/&gt;

"I am dedicated to opening space for all of humanity and, with SpaceDev well-managed and growing, I plan to spend the next several years creating the possibility that anyone who wants to go to space will be able to, safely and affordably," said Benson in September, 2006.  SpaceDev owns many of the patents and intellectual property rights associated with hybrid rocket motors used for safe human spaceflight.  Under Benson's guidance, SpaceDev developed critical hybrid rocket motor technology and furnished all of the rocket motors for [[Paul Allen]]'s SpaceShipOne, the craft that earned the $10 million [[Ansari X Prize]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=bsc20060926/&gt;

Benson Space had completed its first round of financing{{When|date=February 2011}} and submitted a request for proposal to [[SpaceDev]] for the design and development of its SpaceDev Dream Chaser spaceships.  BSC expected to be one of SpaceDev's largest customers, purchasing multiple spaceships and safe hybrid rocket motors for use in personal spaceflight.&lt;ref name=bsc20060926/&gt;

=== Death ===
SpaceDev announced on October 10, 2008, that James Benson had died earlier that day. He had been diagnosed with [[Glioblastoma multiforme]], a type of brain tumor, in the spring of 2008.&lt;ref name=at20120906/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedev.com/press_more_info.php?id=285 SpaceDev Founder Jim Benson Dies], SpaceDev, October 10, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014100852/http://www.spacedev.com/press_more_info.php?id=285 |date=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Jane Gilbert''' (born 1955) is an educationalist in [[New Zealand]].  She was the Chief Researcher of New Zealand Council for Educational Research ([[NZCER]]). From 2014, Jane was appointed as a professor of education at Auckland University of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.news.aut.ac.nz/news/schools/education/new-professor-brings-expertise-in-futures-education-to-aut| title=New Professor brings expertise in futures education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Jane Gilbert was a qualified teacher in [[Wellington, New Zealand]].  She had a Diploma in [[Teaching English as a second language]] (TESL), but she taught science and biology in a local secondary school for 10 years.  After that, she focused on educational research.  She worked in the School of Education at the [[University of Waikato]] at [[Hamilton, New Zealand]].  Then, she became a Senior Lecturer in the School of Education at [[Victoria University of Wellington]] in New Zealand.  In June 2003, she joined NZCER as a Senior Researcher and then the Chief Researcher.  Her research focuses on the following areas:
* curriculum development (especially in science and technology) in secondary schools and tertiary institutions
* gender equity issues in education
* language and literacy issues in education (for example, ESOL issues and Māori education in New Zealand)
* educational philosophy and sociology. 
* implications of the Knowledge Society for contemporary public education

In November 2006, she presented a speech about educational reform in New Zealand, and commented about why educational reform failed in most schools.  She also mentioned about the adaptation required to current curriculum in order to fit the future/current Information Society.  For example, moving towards [[integrated curriculum]] to promote thinking across subjects, as compared to traditional subjects/disciplines as practiced in most countries like UK and US.

'''Jean-Pierre Boyer''' (possibly 15 February 1776 – 9 July 1850) was one of the leaders of the [[Haitian Revolution]], and [[List of Presidents of Haïti|President of Haiti]] from 1818 to 1843. He reunited the north and south of Haiti in 1820 and also [[Annexation|annexed]] [[Invasion|by force]] the newly independent [[Spanish Haiti]] ([[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]), which brought all of Hispaniola under one Haitian government by 1822. Boyer managed to rule for the longest period of time of any of the revolutionary leaders of his generation.

==Early life and education==
Boyer was born in Port-au-Prince and was the son of a French tailor, and an African mother; a former [[slave]] from [[Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazard (1873), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to France by his father to become educated. During the [[French Revolution]], he fought as a [[battalion]] commander, and fought against [[Toussaint Louverture]] in the early years of the Haitian Revolution. He later allied himself with [[André Rigaud]], also of [[mulatto]] ancestry, in the latter's abortive insurrection against Toussaint to try to keep control of the southern region of [[Saint-Domingue]].

After going into exile in France, Boyer and [[Alexandre Pétion]], returned in 1802 with the French troops led by General [[Charles Leclerc]]. After it became clear the French were going to try to reimpose slavery and restrictions on free ''[[gens de couleur]]'', Boyer joined the patriots under Pétion and [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who led the colony to independence. After Pétion rose to power in the State of Haiti in the South, he chose Boyer as his successor. He was reportedly under the influence of his (and his predecessor's) lover, [[Marie-Madeleine Lachenais]], who acted as his political adviser.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haiticulture.ch/Madeleine_Lachenais.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Santo Domingo]] became independent late in 1821, Boyer was quick to occupy and gain control, uniting the entire island under his rule by 9 February 1822. Boyer ruled the island of [[Hispaniola]] until 1843, when he lost the support of the ruling elite and was ousted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Military career==
After the uprising of African slaves in the north of Saint-Domingue in 1791, Boyer joined with the French Commissioners and went there to fight against the ''grand blancs'' (plantation owners) and royalists. In 1794, Saint-Domingue was invaded by British forces trying to capitalize on the unrest in the formerly wealthy colony. Boyer went to Jacmel, where he joined forces with mulatto leader, General [[André Rigaud]]. While other mulatto leaders surrendered to Toussaint Louverture in southern Saint-Domingue, Boyer escaped to France with Rigaud and Alexandre Pétion.

At the time, the United States supported French efforts to re-establish control, although it sent 20,000 troops. Boyer traveled to Paris, where he stayed until 1801.

Next, he returned to Haiti to protest the independence that [[Toussaint Louverture]] had just achieved. By early 1802, Rigaud and other leaders learned that the French intended to take away the civil rights of mulattoes and re-institute slavery for former slaves in Saint-Domingue (as they had managed to do in Guadeloupe.) They sent General LeClerc to defeat the rebels, and over the next 21 months, added to his forces by 20,000 troops. Boyer collaborated with other native leaders to defeat the French. In November 1803, France withdrew its surviving 7,000 troops, less than one-third of the forces sent to the island. Most had died as a result of [[yellow fever]], which was endemic to the island.

Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a former slave from the North, declared Haitian independence on 1 January 1804. He established himself as [[Emperor]] Jacques I. He was assassinated by opponents in 1806.

Alexandre Pétion and [[Henri Christophe]] competed to rule Haiti, and represented the split between the urban mulatto elite of the South and the black former slaves of the North, respectively. After years of warfare, they established separate states: Pétion continuing the Republic of Haiti in the southern part of Haiti, and Christophe creating the State (later Kingdom) of Haiti in the north.

==State of Haiti==
In 1818 Pétion died and Boyer replaced him as the second President of the Republic of Haiti. This was an arranged transition since Pétion had selected Boyer for his succession and the Senate approved his choice. The 1816 revised constitution provided for the President to select his successor as a measure to protect the nation from foreign intrusion. [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]] also continued as the President's secretary and right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/229229512/Haiti-Free-Soil-And-Antislavery-Ferrer-40-66 | title=Haiti, Free Soil, and Antislavery in the Revolutionary Atlantic | author=Ferrer, Ada | journal=The American Historical Review | year=2012 | volume=117 | issue=1 | pages=40–66 | doi=10.1086/ahr.117.1.40 | access-date=2017-09-09 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228003611/https://www.scribd.com/doc/229229512/Haiti-Free-Soil-And-Antislavery-Ferrer-40-66 | archive-date=2014-12-28 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyer believed Haiti had to be acknowledged as an independent nation, and that this could be established only by cutting a deal with France. On 11 July 1825, Boyer signed an indemnity treaty stipulating that Haiti would pay France a certain amount of money to compensate for the lost property in slaves and trade in exchange for formal diplomatic recognition of its independence.

As soon as Boyer came to power, he was confronted with the continuing competition with Henri Christophe and the Kingdom of Haiti in the north. Christophe's autocratic rule created continued unrest in the Kingdom of Haiti. After his soldiers rebelled against him in 1820, in failing health and fearing assassination, Christophe committed suicide. Boyer reunited Haiti without a single battle.

==Unification of Hispaniola==
On 30 November 1821, several frontier towns near the border with Santo Domingo raised the Haitian flag as a show of independence. The new nation was known as the [[Republic of Spanish Haiti]]. On 1 December 1821, the leaders of the new nation resolved to unite it with [[Gran Colombia]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

But, some politicians and military officers in Santo Domingo favored unification with the Republic of Haiti.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Former slaves sought to secure emancipation under the Haitian President Jean-Pierre Boyer. Another faction based in Dajabon, near the border, opposed union with [[Gran Colombia]] and supported Boyer. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Boyer sought to protect his country from the danger of France or Spain re-taking Santo Domingo and attacking or re-conquering Haiti. He wanted to maintain Haitian independence and secure the freedom of the slaves in Santo Domingo.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

After promising protection to several Dominican frontier governors and securing their allegiance, in February 1822 Boyer annexed the newly independent state with a force of 50,000 soldiers. These forces encountered little resistance from the considerably smaller Dominican population. On 9 February 1822, Boyer formally entered the capital city, Santo Domingo, where Núñez de Cáceres handed over the keys to the city. Dominicans reacted uneasily to the Haitian invasion. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The island of Hispaniola was now united under one government from Cape Tiburon to Cape Samana. By awarding land to Haitian military officers at the expense of former members of the Spanish forces of Santo Domingo, Boyer reduced his influence with the Spanish-Haitian leadership. He continued the policy of Pétion, his former political mentor, of helping [[free people of color]] in other Spanish-American colonies to resist the Spanish crown. Boyer ignored Haitian political opponents who called for reforms, such as parliamentary democracy, and veteran generals of the War of Independence, who believed that the revolution was not complete and that they were being neglected. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==American black migration==
{{Main article|Haitian emigration|Samaná Americans}}
{{See also|Free negroes}}
Boyer, and his assistants, Joseph Balthazar Inginac and [[Jonathas Granville]], were deeply involved with the massive migration of black Americans to Haiti in 1824. Yet, this event did not happen in a vacuum. Neither did the migrants respond reflexively to the promises the Haitian government offered. The migration is often called a failure because of the 6,000 (or more) migrants, a couple or more thousands returned to the U.S. However, those who stayed often had a different assessment of the migration. The term failure, then, should be applied to the prospects the Haitian government had with the migrants and the idea many white philanthropists in the U.S. had of relocating the entire black population out of the country. None of these two objectives were met. Yet, for the [[Samaná Americans|descendants]] of the migrants now living in the [[Samaná Peninsula|Peninsula of Samaná]] and those who also assimilated into the local culture, the migration gave them the opportunity to find new life on the island, and often, to interact in a wider black diaspora through commerce and industry—their knowledge of the English language gave them an edge in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.academia.edu/567462/From_North_America_to_Hispaniola_First_Free_Black_Emigration_and_Settlements_in_Hispaniola | title=From North America to Hispaniola | publisher=Central Michigan University | author=Hidalgo, Dennis | year=2003 (2001) | location=Mt. Pleasant, Michigan | pages=2–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) noticed the recruitment effort. Concerned that free blacks could never assimilate to the United States, its members founded their society in 1816 to "repatriate" American blacks to Africa, regardless of where they had been born. It was an uneasy collaboration between abolitionists and slaveholders, who approached the issue from differing viewpoints. The ACS planned colonization in what became [[Liberia]] for former slaves. In 1817 [[Loring D. Dewey]] toured the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to recruit emigrants, starting in New York. The organization hoped to resettle 100,000 free people of color within 10 years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Dewey's meetings with people in New York convinced him to abandon the idea of colonizing Liberia. Most American blacks did not want to leave what they considered was fully their native country. Dewey met with Haitian citizens in New York, most of whom were refugee ethnic French and free people of color who had fled the revolution. They recommended Haiti as the ideal black homeland, due to its moderate weather conditions and independent black government. After Dewey wrote to Boyer to determine if he was still interested in receiving American immigrants, Boyer proposed that Haiti would seek blacks exclusively from the United States.

The ACS sent Boyer questions related to its goal of a colony for American free blacks. Boyer was confident that his government would be able to receive these people. The ACS tried to negotiate to have the Haitian government pay transportation costs for the emigrants. Boyer responded that the government would pay for those who could not afford it, but the ACS would have to take care of the rest of the finances. Haiti was already in debt to the French, which had exacted high payment for lost properties of planters, in essence making Haiti pay for its independence. The government did not have funds to transport American families to Haiti.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Dewey proposed establishing a colony for American free blacks that would be separate from the rest of the island, with its own laws, legislature, etc. Boyer was opposed to the idea of an American colony on the island, since the Haitians already feared re-colonization by the French. He told Dewey that the laws of the Haitian government applied to everyone across Haiti.

Beginning in September 1824, nearly 6,000 Americans, mostly free people of color, migrated to Haiti within a year, with ships departing from New York, [[Baltimore]] and [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti-archive/msg00868.html ''US Gazette'', Philadelphia, 1824] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910113052/http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti-archive/msg00868.html |date=2013-09-10 }}, from Girard Alphonse Firire, Ph.D., "HAITI AND ITS DIASPORA: NEW HISTORICAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC FRONTIERS", 27 Aug 1999, accessed 15 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the poverty of the island and the inability of Boyer's administration to help support the new immigrants in the transition, most returned to the United States within a short period of time.

==Payment of indemnity to France==
Boyer was anxious to eliminate the threat from France and opened negotiations. An agreement was reached on 11 July 1825, when Boyer signed an indemnity treaty. It stated that France would recognize Haiti as an independent country in return for 150 million francs paid within five years. While this sum was later reduced to 90 million francs (in 1838), it was a crushing economic blow to Haiti.

Boyer had to negotiate a loan from France of 30 million francs to pay the first part of the indemnity. Most of the largely rural Haitian population meanwhile was retreating into an agricultural [[subsistence]] pattern. He tried to enforce the semi-feudal ''fermage'' system in order to increase agricultural productivity on the island, but the people resisted being tied to other people's lands. With the Rural Act, Boyer resurrected a land distribution program. He broke up some of the large plantations and distributed land to the small farmers.  To try to produce enough products for export to generate revenue, the government "tied" the rural population to their smallholdings and established production quotas.

==Exile and death==
Boyer's rule lasted until 1843, when the poor economic situation was worsened by an [[1842 Cap-Haïtien earthquake|earthquake]]. The disadvantaged majority rural population rose up under [[Charles Rivière-Hérard]] in late January. On 13 February 1843, Boyer fled Haiti to nearby [[Jamaica]]. He eventually settled in [[exile]] in France, where he died in Paris in 1850. Descendants of Boyer still live in Haiti.

==Greek War of Independence==

[[Haiti]] was the first government of an independent state that recognised the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek revolution against the Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/en/blog/greece-bilateral-relations/haiti/ Hellenic Republic - Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Pierre Boyer, following a Greek request for assistance, addressed a letter on 15 January 1822. In the letter sent to Greek expatriates living in France, [[Adamantios Korais]], Christodoulos Klonaris, Christodoulos Klonaris, Konstantinos Polychroniades and A. Bogorides, who had assembled themselves into a Committee which was seeking international support for the ongoing Greek revolution, expressed his support for the Greek Revolution and compared the struggle underfoot across the Atlantic to the struggle for independence in [[Haitian Revolution|his own land]]. He apologized for being unable to support the Revolution in Greece financially, though he hoped he might be able to in the future. But he articulated his moral and political support for the revolution, notably by filling his letter with references to classical Greek history, demonstrating a detailed knowledge of this history and powerfully evoking the contemporary revolutionaries as the rightful heirs of their ancestors.&lt;ref name="Letter from Jean-Pierre Boyer to Greek Revolutionaries"&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1149177831/a-letter-from-jean-pierre-boyer-to-greek-revolutionaries A Letter from Jean-Pierre Boyer to Greek Revolutionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41715298?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents A Letter from Jean-Pierre Boyer to Greek Revolutionaries-jstor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some historians claim that Boyer also sent to the Greeks 25 tons of Haitian coffee that could be sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons, but not enough evidence exists to support this or the other claim that one hundred Haitian volunteers set off to fight in the Greek Revolution. Allegedly, their ship was boarded by pirates somewhere in the Mediterranean and these fighters purportedly never reached their destination.&lt;ref name="neoskosmos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neoskosmos.com/news/en/haiti-and-the-greek-revolution|publisher=neoskosmos.com|title=Haiti and the Greek revolution &amp;#124; Neos Kosmos|accessdate=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is the letter to the Greeks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''JEAN PIERRE BOYER

President of Haiti

To the citizens of Greece A. Korais, K. Polychoroniades, A. Bogorides and Ch. Klonaris.

In Paris

"Before I received your letter from Paris, dated last August 20, the news about the revolution of your co-citizens against the despotism which lasted for about three centuries had already arrived here. With great enthusiasm we learned that Hellas was finally forced to take up arms in order to gain her freedom and the position that she once held among the nations of the world.
Such a beautiful and just case, most importantly, the first successes which have accompanied it, cannot leave Haitians indifferent, for we, like the Hellenes, were for a long time subjected to a dishonorable slavery and finally, with our own chains, broke the head of tyranny.

Wishing to Heavens to protect the descendants of [[Leonidas]], we thought to assist these brave warriors, if not with military forces and ammunition, at least with money, which will be useful for acquisition of guns, which you need. But events that have occurred and imposed financial restrictions onto our country absorbed the entire budget, including the part that could be disposed by our administration. Moreover, at present, the revolution which triumphs on the eastern portion of our island is creating a new obstacle in carrying out our aim; in fact, this portion, which was incorporated into the Republic I preside over, is in extreme poverty and thus justifies immense expenditures of our budget. If the circumstances, as we wish, improve again, then we shall honorably assist you, the sons of Hellas, to the best of our abilities.

Citizens! Convey to your co-patriots the warm wishes that the people of Haiti send on the behalf of your liberation. The descendants of ancient Hellenes look forward, in the reawakening of their history, to trophies worthy of [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]. May they prove to be like their ancestors and guided by the commands of [[Miltiades]], and be able, in the fields of new [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], to achieve the triumph of the holy affair that they have undertaken on behalf of their rights, religion and motherland. May it be, at last, through their wise decisions, that they will be commemorated by history as the heirs of the endurance and virtues of their ancestors.

In the 15th of January 1822 and the 19th year of Independence"

BOYER''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John''' "'''Jock'''" '''Kane''' (7 April 1921 – 27 September 2013) was a Scottish [[whistleblower]] who was prevented from publishing two books alleging corruption at the British [[intelligence agency]] [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ). Kane served with the Royal Air Force in various European theatres as a radio operator in World War II, before joining GCHQ after the war. While serving with GCHQ in Hong Kong, Kane was concerned with the lack of security and after uncovering fraud, raised his complaints with officials. Kane retired in 1978 and his complaints were investigated by a senior civil servant, but the report was never published. Kane wrote a memoir in 1984, ''GCHQ: The Negative Asset'', which was subsequently banned, as was a second memoir,  ''The Hidden Depths of Treachery''. Kane later worked as a milkman after retiring from GCHQ.

==Personal life==
Kane was born in [[Coatbridge]], [[North Lanarkshire]], in 1921, his mother died in childbirth when he was two.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/10392405/Jock-Kane.html|title=Obituary: Jock Kane|date=20 October 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised by his father with the help of aunts, he was educated at St Patrick's High School in Coatbridge.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt; Kane was married twice, first to Alexandra in 1949, with whom he had two sons.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt; Kane had met Alexandra in Greece, where she had been a member of the [[Greek Resistance]]. Alexandra had been imprisoned during the Second World War for helping to evacuate Allied soldiers stranded there after the [[Battle of Greece]].&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt; Kane married Cynthia, his second wife, in 1983.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt; After his marriage to Cynthia, Kane moved to [[Barton on Sea]] in Hampshire, where he worked as a milkman and school bus driver.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt;

==Military and GCHQ career==
In 1939, Kane joined the [[Royal Air Force]], training as a [[radio operator]] in Blackpool. With the RAF Kane flew on [[sortie]]s during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], tasked with calibrating radar signals, to help combat the threat of German submarines to Allied shipping.&lt;ref name=ScotOct13/&gt; Kane also served with RAF squadrons supporting allied forces in North Africa and Italy, and was sent into [[occupied Yugoslavia]] in 1944, and Greece.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt;&lt;ref name=ScotOct13/&gt;
 
After leaving the RAF at the end of the war, Kane was recruited by intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] in November 1946. He was posted to a [[listening station]] at [[Hawklaw Y Station|Hawklaw]], near [[Cupar]] in Fife, Scotland.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Rusbridger|title=The Intelligence Game: The Illusions and Delusions of International Espionage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p62LN9EhsKYC&amp;pg=PA98|year=1991|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-338-5|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raw intelligence material would be supplied by Hawklaw to [[Bletchley Park]] (known as X-Station) to be de-coded.&lt;ref name=ScotOct13&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/obituaries/john-jock-kane.22487824|title=Radio interceptor for GCHQ|date=24 October 2013|work=The Herald Scotland|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], the target of Kane's interception efforts at Hawklaw were the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies behind the [[Iron curtain]].&lt;ref name=ScotOct13/&gt; Much of the material collected at Hawklaw would be subsequently transferred to the United States [[National Security Agency]] for further analysis.&lt;ref name=ScotOct13/&gt; The Cupar station was one of a number of British [[Y-stations]], monitoring the radio communications of Soviet naval vessels.&lt;ref name=ScotOct13/&gt;
 
Kane served with GCHQ in Istanbul, Aden, Singapore, Hong Kong and Belfast.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt; He retired from GCHQ in November 1978.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt;

===GCHQ whistleblower===
By the early 1970s Kane had been working for GCHQ for more than 25 years, having worked in almost every section of the organisation.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; In 1973, Kane uncovered fraud in GCHQ, concerned with subsistence allowances. Staff sent on training courses had been collecting their full allowance over a weekend, when they were already home.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; Fraud that Kane found in the GCHQ outpost of [[RAF Little Sai Wan|Little Sai Wan]] in Hong Kong concerned employees renting apartments at lower rates than their £600 rent allowance, then submitting false invoices for the higher amount, and sharing the difference with their Chinese landlords.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; Kane had worked in Hong Kong until 1976.&lt;ref name="West2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nigel West|title=Historical Dictionary of Signals Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTEfrBa5VZYC&amp;pg=PA121|date=31 August 2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7187-8|pages=121–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior GCHQ officers were also involved in the fraud, and Kane found that senior management at GCHQ were not interested in his complaints. Kane believed that these activities could expose staff to [[blackmail]] by hostile intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; A [[spy ring]] had already been uncovered in Little Sai Wan, with 150 people arrested for spying in Hong Kong from 1970–1976.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; His allegations also concerned the loss of secret documents and the collection of material from wastepaper baskets by Chinese cleaners, which he had established by intercepting communications between Chinese intelligence agents.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt;&lt;ref name=ScotOct13/&gt;

Lax security at GCHQ was another target of Kane's allegations.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; Kane said that there were no proper controls of photocopiers, with no record of the number of copies taken.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; In addition, too many people had access to highly classified material, and staff were often found in high-security areas without the necessary clearance.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt;

Though Kane was criticised by his GCHQ colleagues for taking security too seriously, he had subsequent meetings with [[Special Branch#United Kingdom|Special Branch]], the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]], the [[Security Commission]] and Member of Parliament [[Kenneth Warren (politician)|Kenneth Warren]].&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; Warren subsequently advanced Kane's complaints with Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]]. To investigate Kane's complaints Callaghan appointed a senior civil servant from the Home Office, [[James Waddell (civil servant)|James Waddell]].&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; Waddell's report was finished in April 1979, and never published. The new Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], described Kane's allegations as "unfounded" to Parliament; as a consequence Waddell hinted to a journalist that his report had not concluded that Kane's allegations were without foundation.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt;

A June 1980 episode of the investigative television show, ''[[World In Action]]'', titled ''Mr Kane's Campaign'', was dedicated to Kane's revelations and campaign for stricter security at GCHQ in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Times1980"&gt;Peter Dear. "Television." ''The Times'', London, 9 June 1980: pg 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was modified after having been restricted from being broadcast by the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]].&lt;ref name="Times1980"/&gt;

Kane's 1984 memoir, ''GCHQ: The Negative Asset'', was confiscated by Special Branch, and remains unpublished.&lt;ref name="MoranMoran2012"/&gt; The publishers of his first memoir, Robert Hale, were served with an injunction to prevent its publication.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; Details of the manuscript of ''The Negative Asset'' were published in ''The Washington Post'' in 1985; Kane denied leaking the manuscript to the newspaper.&lt;ref name="TimesNov85"&gt;Michael Binyon, and Stewart Tendler. "Banned GCHQ spy book is leaked." ''The Times'', London, 4 Nov. 1985: pg 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the ''Negative Asset'' were seized from its London publisher and from newspapers that had been considering serialization of its contents; police officers from Special Branch also travelled to New York to seize manuscripts.&lt;ref name="TimesNov85"/&gt;

The publication of Kane's 1987 memoir, ''The Hidden Depths of Treachery'' was also subsequently halted by an injunction served on the publishers [[Transworld Publishers|Transworld Publications, Ltd]].&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rusbridger1991"/&gt; The two books had been written by Kane following his failure to end what he believed was the widespread existence of fraudulent activities in GCHQ.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt; Kane was never prosecuted for his actions, which took place alongside the [[Geoffrey Prime]] affair and the [[ABC trial]]. Kane had also provided information to the defendants in the ABC trial.&lt;ref name="MoranMoran2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Moran|author2=Christopher R. Moran|title=Classified: Secrecy and the State in Modern Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p24kPDwzXkUC&amp;pg=PA198|date=13 December 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00099-5|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said that these events gave the "ring of truth" to Kane's criticisms.&lt;ref name=TelegOct13/&gt;

In July 1988, Kane made an extended appearance on the [[After Dark (TV series)#.22British Intelligence.22|''British Intelligence'' episode]] of the [[Channel 4]] discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'', alongside [[Merlyn Rees]], [[Robin Ramsay (editor)|Robin Ramsay]], [[H. Montgomery Hyde]] and others. He discussed with the former home secretary why he had been singled out by the authorities and said, as reported by ''[[The Scotsman]]'', "in reasoned and deliberate voice": "Special Branch arrived at my house in Hampshire on a Sunday morning and I endured three days of intense questioning. I was never arrested or charged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-jock-kane-radio-operator-1-3160648 Obituary], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', Alasdair Steven, 28 October 2013, accesssed 13 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ludwig Julius Christian Dettmann''' (25 July 1865, Adelby, near [[Flensburg]] - 19 November 1944, [[Berlin]]) was a German [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter.

== Biography ==
His father was a customs officer who was transferred to Hamburg while Ludwig was still a small child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flensburg-online.de/strassen/ludwig-dettmann-strasse.html Biographical notes] @ Flensburg online.&lt;/ref&gt; After some studies at a local arts and crafts school, he transferred to the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]], where he studied with [[Eugen Bracht]] and [[Franz Skarbina]]. He originally worked as an illustrator.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[http://www.kant.uni-mainz.de/ikonographie/Ikont.PDF/T004.pdf Biographies of Kunstakademie Konigsberg Directors] @ Kant-Forschungsstelle.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After 1891, he was a teacher at the drawing and painting school of the "{{ill|Association of Berlin Women Artists|de|Verein der Berliner Künstlerinnen}}".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vdbk1867.de/geschichte/zeichenschule.html Verein der Berliner Künstler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717194255/http://www.vdbk1867.de/geschichte/zeichenschule.html |date=2015-07-17 }} Brief history of the school.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1894, he won a small gold medal at the "{{ill|Great Berlin Art Exhibition|de|Große Berliner Kunstausstellung}}", a major annual event that ran from 1893 to 1969. (He would win a large gold medal there in 1909). 

Under the influence of [[Max Liebermann]], he turned to landscape painting in oils and watercolors. His first major project consisted of four murals at the town hall in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], depicting the city's history.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; 

In 1898, he was one of the founders of the [[Berlin Secession]] and, together with Max Liebermann, [[Walter Leistikow]], {{ill|Otto Heinrich Engel|de}}, [[Oskar Frenzel]], [[Curt Herrmann]] and [[Fritz Klimsch]], was a member of the advisory board. In 1900, he was appointed Director of the [[Kunstakademie Konigsberg]]. He also belonged to the committee charged with selecting artists for the popular [[trading card]]s in [[Stollwerck]] chocolates.  
[[File:Dettmann-Battle.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Battle Scene]]
In 1915, he organized the Army and Marine exhibition, composed of heroic war and battle scenes. It was shown at the Berlin Academy and at the Königsberger Art Association the following year. He contributed portraits of Generals [[Erich Ludendorff]] and [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. For the remainder of the war, he was an official [[war artist]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; 

After the war, he returned to Berlin. In 1923, he illustrated both volumes of ''Weltbrand – Deutschlands Tragödie 1914–1918'' (Conflagration, Germany's Tragedy), a detailed examination of the war and its aftermath by the novelist {{ill|Walter Bloem|de}}, an ardent nationalist. 

After Hitler seized power, Dettmann joined the [[Nazi Party]] and served on the board of the "{{ill|Reichsverband bildender Künstler Deutschlands|de}}" (Reich Association of Visual Artists). He would remain a party member until his death. In 1935, he was awarded the "[[Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft]]" and was chairman of the "{{ill|Association of Berlin Artists|de|Verein Berliner Kunstler}}" for the year 1936-37.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; 

In 1938 he wrote ''Ostfront. Ein Denkmal des Deutschen Kampfes'' (Eastern Front, a Monument to the German Struggle). Shortly before his death in 1944, his name was added to the [[Gottbegnadeten list]] of artists crucial to Nazi culture. In 1946, ''Ostfront'' was placed on the "Liste der auszusondernden Literatur" ("weeded-out" literature), a list of Nazi works that were forbidden in the [[Soviet occupation zone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polunbi.de/bibliothek/1946-nslit-d.html List of forbidden works] @ Polunbi-Katalog.&lt;/ref&gt;

He briefly worked at Duthie Books and was also briefly chief of a 20-man detachment of special state police that provided the security for Boston State Hospital. During the [[Vietnam War]], he filed an application with the draft board to be considered a [[conscientious objector]], which was denied. After taking the [[psychological examination]], he was given a [[psychiatric]] 4F classification and avoided [[conscription]] into the U.S. military.&lt;ref name="Eden"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2011}}

During his undergraduate years, he set out to become a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. He eventually abandoned that goal.&lt;ref name="Just"&gt;Vonnegut, Mark (2010). ''Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So.''  [[Delacorte Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-385-34379-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

He is the author of ''[[The Eden Express]]'' (1975), which describes his trip to [[British Columbia]] to set up a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] with his friends and his personal experiences with schizophrenia,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2014/10/06/celebration-vonnegut-cape/RUegb0NmUXBmi449E5TbJI/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; which at that time he attributed to stress, diet and in part, drug use. During this period, he lived mainly at the commune at [[Powell Lake]], located 18 kilometers by boat from the nearest road or electricity. The book is widely cited as useful for those coping with schizophrenia.
He married in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20065819,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; He had a son,  Eli James Vonnegut (b. 1980).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/09/style/weddings-celebrations-lydon-friedrich-eli-vonnegut.html?_r=0 ''WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS; Lydon Friedrich, Eli Vonnegut'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://voters.findthedata.com/d/b/Eli-Vonnegut{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 14, 1971, he was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia and committed to Hollywood Hospital in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref name= "Just"/&gt;{{rp|37}}  Standard [[psychotherapy]] did not help him, and most of his doctors said his case was hopeless.

Vonnegut first attributed his recovery to [[orthomolecular]] [[megavitamin therapy]] and then wrote ''The Eden Express''. However, it should be pointed out that in this book, he states that "approximately a third - improve without any treatment. Whatever shrink happens to be standing around when such remissions occur is usually willing to assume credit" pg. 267. From the book, one can see that he was trying to decide if it is the therapy or the ever changing medications that are the most effective for treatment. Vonnegut does not presently attribute his recovery to vitamins. In reality, such situations take years of trial and error treatment to figure out what actually is effective treatment since the diagnostic tools are based on statistics (a group of symptoms and how long they last and what is the age of the patient), making them inherently weak on predictability.  This is made worse given the short duration of any treatment because of the prohibitive costs of longer term productive treatment. He subsequently studied medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]] and later came to the conclusion that he actually had [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Vonnegut, Mark. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100218065648/http://www.namimass.org/conv2003/mvspeaks.htm Mark Vonnegut Speaks at Convention], ''NAMI'', May 17, 2003. archived version, February 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Vonnegut, despite odds against him, graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1979.  After graduation, Dr. Vonnegut completed a pediatric Internship and Residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Vonnegut published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine December 27, 2007 and has published several short pieces on pediatrics and other topics in The Boston Globe and The Patriot Ledger.  He has served on the National Institute for Health Consensus Conference on ADHD since November 1999. Dr. Vonnegut wrote The Eden Express which was first published in 1975 and re-published in 2002.  His new book, ''Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So'', was published October 5, 2010.  He has practiced pediatrics for over 30 years, opening his own practice, M.V. Pediatrics, in 2001. Dr. Vonnegut respects the parents’ right to choose what is best for their children, and will support parents' decisions. His practice discourages psychiatric medication use in children, and instead offers therapy via social workers, reiki, yoga, and acupuncture. He is currently a [[pediatrician]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Vonnegut, Mark.

Vonnegut published his second book, ''Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So'', in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130537541&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''The Eden Express'', it is autobiographical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithmag.net/memoirville/2010/10/19/interview-mark-vonnegut-md-author-of-just-like-someone-without-mental-illness-only-more-so/&lt;/ref&gt;

A signatory of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]],&lt;ref name="yog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_principles.htm |title=The Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[Yogyakarta Principles]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-08-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628071304/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_principles.htm |archivedate=2015-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; his work focuses on the reform of medical protocols and law reform. In July 2015, Cabral received the inaugural [[Bob Hepple]] Equality Award.&lt;ref name="lsg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/mandela-lawyer-award-winner-announced/5050164.article |title= Mandela lawyer award winner announced |last1=[[Law Society Gazette]] |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=July 2015 |website= |publisher=[[Law Society Gazette]] |access-date=2015-08-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and perspectives ==

Mauro Cabral Grinspan was assigned female at birth, but now lives as male. He has described how his body was discovered to be different or "incomplete" in his teens; after two surgeries he had to undergo several years of invasive procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59RwM0koP-M |title= Situación de Derechos Humanos de Personas Intersex: clips de audiencias|last1=Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2015 |website= YouTube |publisher=Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos |access-date=2015-06-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabral Grinspan describes how homophobia is a driving force in the normalization of intersex children, and how surgeries send a message to children that their bodies have to be changed to be acceptable. Cabral Grinspan defines the social challenge of intersex histories as a need to be open to the experience of body diversity without the need to medicalise that experience.&lt;ref name="interdic"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Mulabi| isbn = 978-987-05-5898-9| editor1-last = Cabral| editor1-first = Mauro| title = Interdicciones: Escrituras de la intersexualidad en castellano| location = Córdoba, Argentina| date = February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

Mauro Cabral Grinspan has been involved in activism on trans and intersex issues since at least 2005. From 2005 to 2007 he was in charge of coordinating the Trans and Intersex Area at the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission|IGLHRC]] Latin American Office.&lt;ref name="sobre" /&gt; He then worked for three years at [http://mulabi.org MULABI, Latin American Space for Sexualities and Rights], becoming Executive Director in 2009. Cabral became a co-director of [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] in January 2010 &lt;ref name="sobre"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://transactivists.org/about/ | title = About GATE | work = [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] | accessdate = 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iglhrc.org/content/latin-america-iglhrc´s-latin-america-and-caribbean-2005-work | title = Latin America: IGLHRC´s Latin America and the Caribbean 2005 work | work = [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission|IGLHRC]] | date = January 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also co-chairs the International Trans* Reference Group at the Global Forum on MSM and HIV/AIDS. Cabral is a member of the Latin American Consortium on Intersex Issues, and of the International Advisory Board at the Human Rights Watch LGTB Program.

Cabral Grinspan participated in actions that led to the approval of a ground-breaking law on gender identity by the Argentinian Senate in April 2012. The law makes it possible to change sex designation without undergoing surgical or clinical treatment, or judicial approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://100porciento.wordpress.com/2012/04/17/100-diversidad-y-derechos-primer-paso-en-el-senado-de-la-nacion-hacia-la-ley-de-identidad-de-genero/ | title = Primer paso en el Senado de la Nación hacia la Ley de Identidad de Género | work = 100% Diversidad y Derechos | date = April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/soy/1-2103-2011-08-26.html | title = Un día para recordar | work = [[Página/12]] | date = 26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabral Grinspan has co-ordinated work on reform of the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Classification of Diseases]], in particular a critique and alternative proposals in relation to "Gender Incongruence of Childhood".&lt;ref name="icd"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Cabral |first1=Mauro |url=http://globaltransaction.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/critique-and-alternative-proposal-to-the-_gender-incongruence-of-childhood_-category-in-icd-11.pdf |publisher=[[Global Action for Trans Equality]] |title=Critique and Alternative Proposal to the "Gender Incongruence of Childhood" Category in ICD-11 |accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a contributor to the [[World Health Organization]] report "Sexual health, human rights and the law".&lt;ref name="who2015"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = World Health Organization| isbn = 9789241564984| last = World Health Organization| title = Sexual health, human rights and the law| location = Geneva| date = June 2015| url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/175556/1/9789241564984_eng.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==

'''Mister Hyde''' ('''Calvin Zabo''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the father of [[Daisy Johnson]].

Calvin Zabo appears in the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', which is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], portrayed by [[Kyle MacLachlan]].

==Publication history==
Mister Hyde first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #99 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]]. Mister Hyde is based upon the [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|literary character]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

He has appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' since issue #157, and remained with the team after the title transitioned into ''Dark Avengers'' beginning with issue #175.

==Fictional character biography==
Calvin Zabo was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. He was a morally abject but brilliant [[biochemist]] who was fascinated by the effect of hormones on human physiology. One of his favorite stories was [[Robert Louis Stevenson|Stevenson]]'s 1886 classic, ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''. He was convinced that the experiment [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll]] performed in the story could actually be accomplished, and became obsessed with the idea of unleashing his full bestial nature in a superhuman form. However, he needed money to do this, so he robbed his various employers systematically. Though too intelligent to be caught, the medical community was suspicious of his tendency to always be employed by organizations which were subsequently robbed. Zabo eventually sought work as a [[surgeon]] in a hospital where [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Donald Blake]] was a directing [[physician]], yet Blake would not allow him a job due to his history. Zabo was enraged that Blake would not give him the position, even though he did indeed intend to rob the organization, and swore revenge. He was eventually successful in creating his formula and turned into a huge, [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]-like creature he called "Mister Hyde," named after the character in the novel. In this new form, he found he had superhuman strength enabling him to crush cars and tear through steel as though it were made of cardboard. With his new superhuman powers he sought out Blake, whom he tried to kill by throwing him from a window, but Blake transformed into Thor by striking his cane on the wall and survived, claiming he had saved Blake. Hyde, hearing of this on the radio, decided to eliminate Thor, and tried to frame him for a bank robbery by using his superhuman strength to tear open a bank vault while disguised as Thor. While Donald and Jane were out, Mister Hyde met and kidnapped them at gunpoint. As Don Blake, Thor was tied up next to a bomb that would explode in 24 hours unless Mr. Hyde defused it. However, when attempting to steal a Polaris submarine to roam the seas like a pirate, Hyde was defeated and the authorities, seeing his superhuman strength, realized he must have impersonated Thor, but Thor was forced to allow him to escape, as Jane Foster thought Blake was still in danger.&lt;ref&gt;''Journey into Mystery'' #99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde went into business as a full-time professional super-criminal and partnered himself with the [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]] to get revenge upon Thor, but they were both defeated despite getting Thor's hammer from him briefly.&lt;ref&gt;''Journey into Mystery'' #105-106&lt;/ref&gt; With the Cobra, he was bailed out and employed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] to kidnap [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], and they battled Thor again. Loki doubled their powers to try to help them. Loki showed Thor where Jane Foster was being held. The house had many traps set up for Thor, and Jane Foster was almost killed in an explosion. Thor was able to defeat both villains, and Mister Hyde was caught by a ray which paralyzed him. Both Hyde and Cobra were jailed, and Jane's life was saved by an Asgardian formula [[Balder (comics)|Balder]] sent to Thor.&lt;ref&gt;''Journey into Mystery'' #110-111&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde and the Cobra escaped prison, but were eventually recaptured by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #30-32&lt;/ref&gt; They teamed with the [[Jester (Marvel Comics)#Jonathan Powers|Jester]] to get revenge, but were defeated again.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #61&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], Hyde then battled [[Captain America]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #151-152&lt;/ref&gt; Teaming with the Cobra again, Hyde attempted to acquire Cagliostro's serum.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #142-143&lt;/ref&gt; While serving in prison following this failed attempt, Hyde was ensnared by the mind-control power of the [[Purple Man]], and forced to battle Daredevil in an arena alongside Cobra, the Jester, and the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]].&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #153-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiring of their repeated failures, the Cobra elected to sever their partnership when he escaped from Ryker's Island, taking the time to taunt Hyde before leaving.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #46&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde has never forgiven him for the slight. With [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]], Hyde later blackmailed New York City with a hijacked supertanker and attempted to destroy the entire city in order to kill Cobra. Eventually, he was defeated by Captain America with Batroc's aid.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #251-252&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde again stalked Cobra seeking revenge, and this time battled [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #231-232&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned again, but escaped Ryker's Island and battled Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] during another attempt at Cobra's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #88&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde later battled Daredevil again.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #235&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde later became a member of [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] and invaded [[Avengers Mansion]] along with them, torturing the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and [[Edwin Jarvis]]. With [[Erik Josten|Goliath]] and the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], he nearly killed [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], but was defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #273-276&lt;/ref&gt; Mister Hyde later attempted an escape from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] alongside [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]], [[Vibro (comics)|Vibro]], the [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], but was defeated and recaptured by [[Captain America|The Captain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' #228; ''Captain America'' #340&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually escaped from the Vault alongside the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Spotlight'' #26&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde was later defeated in combat by the Cobra.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #365-367&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde later fought with the [[Hulk (comics)|Grey Hulk]] and received head trauma that limited his ability to transform.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #368&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently caught by the police when he coincidentally checked into the same hotel as the one where the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' staff were attending [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]]'s retirement party, allowing Peter Parker to defeat him using an improvised costume.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #433&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Hyde had several run-ins with the [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] in which he was defeated with the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)#Powers and abilities|Penance Stare]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde briefly helped the [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]-bonded [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] track Cobra after a prison escape by providing a piece of skin for the symbiote to track.&lt;ref&gt;''Toxin'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Zabo was being held in The Raft (the Ryker's Island Prison complex) 6 months after the events of ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Alias'' #26&lt;/ref&gt; When a prison break was caused by the villain [[Electro (comics)#Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Zabo emerged in his Hyde persona, fought with Daredevil, and was knocked unconscious by [[Luke Cage]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Zabo was discovered by the [[Young Avengers]] to be selling a derivative of his Hyde formula on the street as one of the various illegal substances known as Mutant Growth Hormone.&lt;ref&gt;''Young Avengers'' #7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Zabo grafts abilities similar to the powers of Spider-Man to homeless teenagers. After Spider-Man revealed his identity during the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Zabo sought to recreate the circumstances of Spider-Man's "birth", by taking in orphans off the street, imbuing them with spider-powers, and seeing whether or not the teenagers would give in to their darker impulses. During the ensuing battle with Spider-Man, Hyde pulled webbing off his face, taking his eyelids with it, and was hit in the face with hydrochloric acid, courtesy of one of his own guinea pigs. It is stated by Spider-Man that he has been left blinded and had his face ruined as a result. [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] was later seen aiding Spider-Man in a cure for Calvin, one of Zabo's test subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #35-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde's daughter is [[Daisy Johnson]], who is a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; her mother was apparently a prostitute with whom Calvin Zabo regularly had 'business',&lt;ref&gt;''Secret War'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; and the girl was put up for adoption after birth. Daisy subsequently manifested superpowers inherited from Zabo's mutated genetic code.

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #35&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he was seen along with [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)#Firebrand|Firebrand]], [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)#Klaus Voorhees|King Cobra]], and [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], who attacked Yellowjacket, Constrictor and other Initiative staff and trainees.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #13&lt;/ref&gt;

Mister Hyde worked with [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to manipulate [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] III into procuring Norman Osborn's fortunes. This was thwarted by Venom and Green Goblin as Norman threw a bomb into Mister Hyde's mouth causing him to spit out blood. Norman Osborn then warned Mister Hyde and the villains that if they cross him again, he will kill everyone that they ever loved before they are tortured to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts: Reasons in Madness'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Mister Hyde joins the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s new [[Lethal Legion]], claiming embarrassment over Norman blowing up his mouth with a bomb.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Mister Hyde appears as member of Hood's crime syndicate, during an attack on the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #56&lt;/ref&gt;

Mister Hyde was selected to be a part of the "beta team" of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], alongside [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Gunna (comics)|Gunna]] and [[Centurius]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Mister Hyde began a drug operation in California where he came into conflict with [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] after his car had some of Mister Hyde's pills inside. Mister Hyde's mercenaries chase Robbie down during the race in order to retrieve the car and the pills. Robbie is gunned down by the mercenaries when he mistakes them for police, and they torch the scene. Robbie is revived as a demonic being called the [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Ghost Rider]] who sports a flaming helmet-like head. In this form, Robbie drives off in the car, now similarly ablaze. The Ghost Rider defeats a few mercenaries and soon disappears in an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;''All-New Ghost Rider'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Robbie eventually fights and defeats Zabo, becoming something of a local hero and urban legend.&lt;ref&gt;''All-New Ghost Rider'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Having regrouped and refined his Hyde Formula into new blue pills, Calvin Zabo gradually takes over the L.A. criminal underground with his "Blue Hyde Brigade," which includes Guero and his gang, longtime enemies of Robbie, calling themselves the "Blue Krüe."&lt;ref&gt;''All-New Ghost Rider'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Mister Hyde was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Mister Hyde is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; During Hydra's takeover of the United States, Mister Hyde is one of a few Army of Evil members not in a stasis pod and is shown leading a group of Hydra soldiers to invade New Attilan and capture the Inhumans.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Warriors'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; He alongside Hydra's Avengers catch his daughter Daisy and her team, the [[Secret Warriors (2017 series)|Secret Warriors]]. During interrogation, Daisy uses her powers to destroy the Helicarrier they're in, forcing Mister Hyde to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Warriors'' #3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The process that transforms Dr. Calvin Zabo into his Mr. Hyde persona is a hormonal transformation caused by ingestion of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)'' #37&lt;/ref&gt; As his body adjusted to its new form, Mr. Hyde's strength, stamina, durability, and resistance to physical injury all increase to superhuman levels. Hyde's powers are sufficient to stand toe to toe with the likes of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and survive. He has been shown tearing apart steel in a bank vault with ease.&lt;ref&gt;''Journey into Mystery'' #99&lt;/ref&gt; Through further experimental procedures over the years, his strength has been increased beyond its original limits. Mr. Hyde must ingest his special chemical formula periodically to maintain his ability to transform himself from one identity to the other at will; mental fatigue or injury can impair his ability to transform himself into Mr. Hyde. He employs a device that resembles a wristwatch that contains a supply of the formula that he can use to deliver it directly into his bloodstream, enabling him to transform at the push of a button.

Due to the nature of the transformation, Hyde's skin is warped. This gives his face a distorted look reminiscent of the [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)#Makeup|make-up]] used in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''.

Dr. Calvin Zabo is a brilliant medical research scientist with a Ph.D. in [[Medicine]] and extensive knowledge of [[biochemistry]]. These skills are lost to his Hyde persona.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the timeline of the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline Mr. Hyde (as well as the Cobra) is a near-feral and cannibal "Scavenger". He is known to prowl graveyards and attack anyone entering his territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales From The Age of Apocalypse'' #2 (December 1997). Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elseworlds===
Mr. Hyde appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Daredevil/Batman: Eye for an Eye]]'' crossover book. [[Two-Face]] partnered with Mister Hyde for a series of technological robberies. In truth, Two-Face had implanted Hyde's brain with the material needed to "grow" an experimental "organic" computer chip, and fed Hyde pills to keep him enraged. Once grown, the chip would kill Hyde, its current growth also weakening Hyde's strength as his energy is diverted to support the chip (Batman noting during the fight that Hyde should normally have a punch that could knock [[Superman]] into orbit). Hyde berates Two-Face, proud he has abandoned his past as Zabo and insults Two-Face for hanging onto his Harvey Dent side, as well as using a coin to decide between right and wrong. Two-Face is glad the process will kill Hyde. In the end, Daredevil uses his past friendship with Dent to talk Two-Face into supplying the antidote for the chip, which saves Hyde's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil/Batman: Eye for an Eye'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of M===
{{See also|House of M}}
Mister Hyde appears as a member of Hood's Masters of Evil.&lt;ref&gt;''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#House of M|Red Guard]] attacks Santo Rico, Mister Hyde leaves the team alongside [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)#Klaus Vorhees|Cobra (Klaus Voorhees)]], [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones (Brock Rumlow)]], and [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball (Eliot Franklin)]].&lt;ref&gt;''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; Mister Hyde was later seen as an Army scientist.&lt;ref&gt;''New Thunderbolts'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified Mister Hyde appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies 4]]''. He is seen attacking the new Midnight Sons, trying to bite one of them, but he is quickly killed by Man-Thing when he rips zombie Mister Hyde apart and holding a huge [[boulder]] and dropping it down on him, crushing the zombie Mister Hyde to death instantly.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies 4'' #1-4 (June – September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thor: The Mighty Avenger===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">'''Momir of Lučica''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Момир из Лучице}}; {{floruit}} 1804–13) was a [[Serbian Revolution]]ary commander who participated in the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804–13).

He was born in [[Lučica, Požarevac|Lučica]], at that time part of the [[Požarevac]] ''[[Nahiye (Ottoman)|nahiya]]'' in the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] ("Belgrade Pashaluk").

He was a ''knez'' before the uprising. He joined the uprising at the beginning, in 1804, and rallied people in the Morava and [[Stig (Serbia)|Stig]] regions. He participated in the [[Siege of Požarevac]] (1804), besieging the town from Morava to Salakovac. His [[trench]] was situated in Gornja Mala. Momir and [[Milenko Stojković]] cleansed the southern part of the Požarevac district from Ottomans. After the liberation of Požarevac, [[Karađorđe]] appointed him the ''knez'' of Morava (''Moravska knežina'').

[[Paulj Matejić]] begged for the hand of Momir's daughter for his son Budimir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milićević|first=Milan|authorlink=Milan Milićević|year=1901|title=Додатак поменику од 1888.

Momir had a mansion in Lučica, fenced by [[palisade]].

His son [[Ivo Momirović]] (fl. 1812–13) was a ''vojvoda''.

Momir is regarded the third, after [[Milenko Stojković]] and [[Petar Dobrnjac]], most important revolutionary in the [[First Serbian Uprising]] from the Požarevac area, based on courage, reputation and participation.{{sfn|Manojlović|2005|p=25}}

'''Paul Erickson''' (born 1962) is an American [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[political operative]] and lawyer who has been involved in several Republican presidential campaigns.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-nra-campaign.html|title=Operative Offered Trump Campaign ‘Kremlin Connection’ Using N.R.A.

== Education ==
Erickson's hometown is [[Vermillion, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt; He attended the [[University of South Dakota]] and then transferred to [[Yale University]], where he graduated with a bachelors degree in economics and political science in 1984. In 1980, while at USD, Erickson coordinated a youth campaign for Representative [[Jim Abdnor]]. For a year between his time at USD and Yale, Erickson served as the national treasurer of the [[College Republicans]] in Washington, D.C., whose staff at the time included [[Grover Norquist]], [[Ralph Reed]], and [[Jack Abramoff]]. Abramoff later wrote, "To every college Republican who contacted the national office, Paul Erickson was by far the most impressive person they had ever encountered in politics."&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt; 

Also while in college, Erickson wrote "Fritzbusters", a comedy routine that was critical of Democratic presidential nominee [[Walter Mondale]] which had similarities to the then newly released film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984).&lt;ref name=fritzbusters&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/04/us/young-fritzbusters-are-reined-in.html|title=Young Fritzbusters are Reined In|last=Barron|first=James|access-date=March 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson and some fellow College Republicans performed Fritzbusters at the [[1984 Republican National Convention]] and later as a warm-up act for [[Ronald Reagan]] at some rallies during the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name="rcj" /&gt; The campaign stopped running Fritzbusters after more than 100 students wearing Fritzbusters shirts heckled Mondale in September 1984.&lt;ref name=fritzbusters/&gt; Erickson earned a law degree from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt;

== Political consulting ==
In addition to his political work while in college, Erickson worked in 1985 as the deputy campaign manager for Richard Viguerie’s unsuccessful campaign for [[Virginia lieutenant governor]].&lt;ref name="rcj" /&gt;

Frustrated by the tax increase led by President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]], Erickson served as the national political director / campaign manager for the 1992 presidential campaign of [[Pat Buchanan]].&lt;ref name="rcj" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-19/news/mn-5929_1_bush-campaign|title=Buchanan Still at Odds With Bush|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 19, 1992|first=Cathleen|last=Decker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-kremlin-and-gop-have-a-new-friendand-boy-does-she-love-guns|title=The Kremlin and GOP Have a New Friend—and Boy, Does She Love Guns|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=February 23, 2017|first=Tim|last=Mak}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biographer of Buchanan later said Erickson was "the best there was at the price Pat could afford."&lt;ref name="rcj" /&gt; 

Erickson later served as an advisor to [[Mitt Romney]] for both of his presidential campaigns.&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; He is also a former board member of the [[American Conservative Union]], the group that organizes the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC).&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; He was a friend of [[Andrew Breitbart]].&lt;ref name="db" /&gt;

[[Stephen Moore (writer)|Stephen Moore]], founder of the right-leaning limited-government group [[Club for Growth]] often relies on what he calls Erickson’s “clever and creative ideas.”&lt;ref name=al&gt;{{cite news|url=http://argusleader.newspapers.com/image/243919174|title=Why is this man after Daschle?|date=May 25, 2003|page=1A|newspaper=[[Argus Leader]]|first=David|last=Kranz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Lee Schoenbeck, a former Republican Watertown Representative to the [[South Dakota House of Representatives]], has called him "the single biggest phony I’ve ever met in South Dakota politics."&lt;ref name=rcj&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/trump-putin-and-erickson-russia-probe-just-another-chapter-in/article_e9ed9038-3411-5112-86fa-f64bb0fa6549.html|title=Trump, Putin ... and Erickson? Russia probe just another chapter in South Dakotan's unusual life|newspaper=[[Rapid City Journal]]|date=February 11, 2018|first=Seth|last=Tupper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey Phillips, a South Dakota Republican political consultant, has said of Erickson, "He likes to put people in touch with people. He’s a person that’s at the center of relationships all over the place."&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt;

== Business and legal career ==

Erickson worked as an [[executive producer]] of ''[[Red Scorpion]]'' (1988), an [[anti-communist]] action film produced by Jack Abramoff.&lt;ref name="rcj" /&gt;

From 1993 to 1994, Erickson acted as a media adviser, agent, and lawyer for [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|John Wayne Bobbitt]], whose wife Lorena had cut off his penis with a kitchen knife. Erickson booked Bobbitt on an international "Love Hurts" tour during which Bobbitt made appearances on television shows such as ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.&lt;ref name="rcj" /&gt;

In 1994, Erickson obtained a $30,000 contract with [[Jack Abramoff]] to lobby for entrance into the [[United States]] by [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the [[military dictator]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] who had been banned from the entering the [[United States]] due to the corrupt and dictatorial nature of his regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/08/06/gop-activists-join-push-for-mobutu-visa/4aa2024b-0444-416f-b76a-c66c94c660a9/|title=GOP ACTIVISTS JOIN PUSH FOR MOBUTU VISA|last=Lippman|first=Thomas W.|date=1995-08-06|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobutu sought a visit to the [[United Nations]] to claim credit for this offer, but his visa request was ultimately denied due to his past human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reno|first=William|date=|title=Sovereignty and Personal Rule in Zaire|url=http://asq.africa.ufl.edu/files/Reno-Vol-1-Issue-3.pdf|journal=African Studies Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rcj" /&gt;

In 1997, Erickson founded Compass Care, a senior living company based in South Dakota dedicated to developing non-nursing home care options for seniors in the Midwest.  This venture led to senior care consulting spinoffs, independent living communities and the licensing of medical technology.&lt;ref name=al/&gt; Erickson and his companies have amassed at least seven [[judgment (law)|civil court judgment]]s against them over the years. In two such cases, lawsuits by investors in Compass Care alleged that Erickson had predicted investment returns of 25–100% but that neither investor received any returns and that Erickson had reneged on his promises to refund the original investments. One investor won a judgment for $115,417 in 2003 while another obtained a judgment for $190,000 in 2008. Two of Erickson's lawyers withdrew from the second case, one after Erickson wrote him a [[bad check]].&lt;ref name="rcj" /&gt;

==  NRA and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign ==

Erickson has strong ties to both the [[National Rifle Association]] and the Russian gun rights community.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He has supported [[Maria Butina]], now in jail awaiting her trial, who is a former assistant to [[Aleksandr Torshin]] and the founder of a Russian gun rights group called "The Right to Bear Arms".  In 2016, Erickson and Butina set up a South Dakota business named "Bridges, LLC", which Erickson later said was created to provide financial assistance for Butina's graduate studies.&lt;ref name="mcclatchy" /&gt; 

During [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016]], Erickson attempted to develop a [[Track II diplomacy|back-channel]] between the NRA and the [[Russian government]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; In May 2016, Erickson sent an e-mail with the subject line "Kremlin Connection" to Trump campaign adviser [[Rick Dearborn]] asking Dearborn and then-Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] for advice on setting up a meeting between Trump and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] at an annual NRA convention.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/donald-trump-robert-mueller-nra|title=Mueller’s Probe Is Dangerously Close to a Republican Red Line|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=January 18, 2018|first=Abigail|last=Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-trump-russia-nra-connection-heres-what-you-need-to-know-w515615|title=The Trump-Russia-NRA Connection: Here’s What You Need to Know|journal=[[The Rolling Stone]]|date=January 18, 2018|first=Tim|last=Dickinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Trump won the presidential election in November 2016, Erickson said he was advising [[Trump transition team|his transition team]].&lt;ref name="db" /&gt;

In Butina's indictment, federal prosecutors said an unnamed American political operative, later identified as Erickson, had worked with Butina to arrange introductions to influential people inside the U.S. and to advance Russian interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/16/629531772/feds-charge-russian-student-linked-to-nra-with-conspiracy|title=Feds Charge Russian Student, Linked To NRA, With Conspiracy|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=July 16, 2018|first=Carrie|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious activities ==
Erickson served a term on the board of directors of the Institute for Lutheran Theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/instituteoflutherantheology/docs/ilt_summer_newsletter2012|title=the Word at Work, the magazine of the Institute of Lutheran Theology, Summer 2012|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1997 Erickson helped to organize a religious revival service on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the [[Promise Keepers]], an [[Evangelical Christian]] men's organization.&lt;ref name=al/&gt; Hundreds of thousands of men participated in the day-long service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9710/04/promise.keepers.pm/|title=Promise Keepers fill Washington's Mall with prayer|date=October 4, 1997|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/250-000-christian-men-to-re-ignite-old-flame-27485/|title=250,000 Christian Men to Re-Ignite Old Flame|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Erickson is single and has never married.&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt; He has homes in New York, [[Los Angeles]], and [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt;

According to criminal charges against Butina, Erickson and Butina lived together and were in a sexual relationship, which Butina was using to advance Russian national interests.

'''Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton''', [[Royal Society|FRS]] (19 June 1809 – 11 August 1885) was an English poet, patron of literature and politician.

==Background and education==
Milnes was born in London, the son of [[Robert Pemberton Milnes]], of [[Fryston Hall]], Castleford, [[West Yorkshire]], and the Honourable Henrietta, daughter of [[Robert Monckton-Arundell, 4th Viscount Galway]]. He was educated privately, and entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MLNS827RM|name=Milnes, Richard Monckton}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he was drawn into a literary set, and became a member of the famous [[Apostles Club]], which then included [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], [[Arthur Hallam]], [[Richard Chenevix Trench]], [[Joseph Williams Blakesley]], and others. 
After graduating with an M.A. in 1831, Milnes travelled abroad, spending some time at the [[University of Bonn]].

He went to Italy and [[Greece]], and published in 1834 a volume of ''Memorials of a Tour in some Parts of Greece'', describing his experiences.{{sfn|Saunders|1894}}

==Political career==
Milnes returned to London in 1837, and was elected to Parliament as member for [[Pontefract (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. 
In parliament he interested himself particularly in the question of [[copyright]] and the conditions of reformatory schools. 
He left [[Prime Minister]] [[Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]]'s party over the [[Corn Law]] controversy, and was afterwards identified in politics with [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. 
His easy good nature had the effect that his political career was viewed with less seriousness by his contemporaries than it might otherwise have been. 
In 1848, he went to Paris to see something of the revolution, and to fraternise with both sides. 
On his return he wrote, as a ‘Letter to Lord Lansdowne,’ 1848.{{sfn|Saunders|1894}}
During the [[Chartism|Chartist]] riots of 1848, [[Matthew Arnold]] wrote to his mother:&lt;blockquote&gt;Tell [[Harriet Martineau|Miss Martineau]] it is said here that Monckton Milnes refused to be sworn in a [[Special Constabulary|special constable]], that he might be free to assume the post of President of the Republic at a moment's notice.&lt;ref&gt;[[George W. E. Russell]], Collections &amp; Recollections (Revised edition, Smith Elder &amp; Co, London, 1899), at page 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1863, Palmerston elevated Milnes to the peerage as '''Baron Houghton''', of Great Houghton in the West Riding of the County of York.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=22760 |date=7 August 1863 |page=3945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George W. E. Russell]] said of him: "As years advanced he became not (as the manner of most men is) less Liberal, but more so; keener in sympathy with all popular causes; livelier in his indignation against monopoly and injustice."&lt;ref&gt;George W. E. Russell, ''Collections &amp; Recollections'' (Revised edition, Smith Elder &amp; Co, London, 1899), at page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
[[File:Lord Houghton.jpg|thumb|left]]
Milnes' literary career was often influenced by church matters. He wrote a tract in 1841, which was praised by [[John Henry Newman]]. He took part in the discussion about "[[Essays and Reviews]]", defending the [[tractarian]] position in ''One Tract More'' (1841). He published two volumes of verse in 1838, ''Memorials of Residence upon the Continent and Poems of Many Years'', ''Poetry for the People'' in 1840 and ''Palm Leaves'' in 1844. He also wrote a ''Life and Letters of Keats'' in 1848, the material for which was largely provided by the poet's friend, [[Charles Armitage Brown]]. Milnes' [[ballad]]s were among the most popular of their day.{{sfn|Saunders|1894}} In 1868, Lord Houghton was elected to the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="Royal Society"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Royal Society |title=Fellows 1660–2007 |url=https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, he was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistm American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his piety, he had apparently an almost unsurpassed collection of [[erotic literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A history of pornography | first=Harford Montgomery | last=Hyde | authorlink=H. Montgomery Hyde | publisher=Heinemann | year=1965 | page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he bequeathed to the [[British Library]], a collection known to few in his lifetime. A man whom his biographer Saunders said, "had many fine tastes and some coarse ones,"{{sfn|Saunders|1894}} Milnes has been considered a possible author of ''[[The Rodiad]]'', a [[pornography|pornographic]] poem on the subject of [[flagellation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gendering the nation: studies in modern Scottish literature | first=Christopher | last=Whyte | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | year=1995 | isbn=0-7486-0619-X | page=216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=James G. | last=Nelson | title=Publisher to the Decadents: Leonard Smithers in the Careers of Beardsley, Wilde, Dowson | publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press | year=2000 | isbn=0-271-01974-3 | page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, his chief distinctions were his sense of literary merit in others, and the way he fostered it. He was surrounded by the most brilliant men of his time, many of whom he had been the first to acclaim.  His reputation rests largely on the part he played, as a man of influence in society and in moulding public opinion on literary matters, in connection with his large circle of talented friends. He secured a pension for [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], helped to make [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] known in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and was one of the earliest champions of [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. He helped [[David Gray (poet)|David Gray]] by writing a preface for ''The Luggie''.{{sfn|Saunders|1894}} He helped to obtain a job for [[Coventry Patmore]] at the [[British Museum]]. He was, in the traditional sense, a patron of literature, who never abused the privileges of his position.

He  likewise admired the literacy brilliance in female writers and was a firm friend of the  [[Elizabeth Gaskell|Gaskell family]] of [[Manchester]]. A believer in the advancement of women, he supported  Meta, the daughter of novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] in her work as the Representative of the ''Manchester Ladies' Educational Association'' and on [[The North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women]]. [[The Spectator]] reported upon Meta's death in 1913 that, "Lord Houghton once said that the conversation and society to be met with in the house of the Gaskells at Manchester – [[84 Plymouth Grove|Plymouth Grove]] – were the one thing which made life in that city tolerable for people of literary tastes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=J.

'''Rizpah''' (riz'-pa, "coal", "hot stone") was the daughter of [[Aiah]], and one of [[Saul]]'s concubines. She was the mother of [[Armoni and Mephibosheth]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:7|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb|2|Samuel|21:8-11|HE}}).

After the death of Saul, according to the Bible, [[Abner]] was accused of sleeping with Rizpah, resulting in a quarrel between him and Saul's son and successor, [[Ishbosheth]]. ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:7-8|HE}}) The quarrel led to Abner's defection to [[David]], ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:17-21|HE}}) who was then king of the breakaway [[Kingdom of Judah]]. This incident led to the downfall of Ishbosheth and the rise of David as king of a reunited [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]].

A famine lasting three years hit Israel during the earlier half of [[David]]'s reign at [[Jerusalem]]. This calamity was believed to have happened because of "Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeonites]]." The Gibeonites were not Israelites, but the remnant of the [[Amorites]], which Saul pursued from within Israel. [[David]] inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul's sons.({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:1-6|HE}})

David accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of [[Merab]], Saul's eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies at the sanctuary at [[Gibeah]]. ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:8-9|HE}}) Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah, and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:10|HE}}) till they were at length taken down and buried by David ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:13|HE}}) in the family grave at Zelah with the bones of Saul and [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]]. ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/nasb/nasb_2samuel21_sml.htm#2samuel_21:14 2 Samuel 21:14]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibler.org/glossary/rizpah.html |title=www.Bibler.org - Dictionary - Rizpah |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British rabbi [[Jonathan Magonet]] has described Rizpah as "every mother who sees her sons killed before their time for reasons of state, be they in time of peace or in war.  All that remains is for her to preserve the dignity of their memory and live on to bear witness and call to account the rulers of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Magonet, Jonathan (1992) ''Bible Lives'' (London: SCM), 11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Samantha Orobator''' (born August 23, 1988 in Nigeria) is a Nigerian born British drug trafficker whose trial had international repercussions. She was arrested in Laos in August 2008, found guilty and sentence to for life to [[Phonthong Prison]].  Her case attracted popular media attention because she was found to be pregnant after being taken to prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8038112.stm|title=The prisoner Laos does not want|date=2009-05-07|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drug incidence ==
In August 2008, Samantha Orobator was arrested in Laos with 680 grams of heroin and was detained at [[Phonthong Prison]]. In June 2009, under Laotian law that prescribes the death penalty for drug smuggling, Samantha was sentenced to life imprisonment after a three-hour trial. Her lawyers appealed the sentence on the grounds that she was found to be pregnant four months after detention. She was repatriated to the UK in August 2009 to serve her sentence in a UK prison. In January 2010, the High Court set a minimum time to serve of 18 months imprisonment before the English and Welsh Parole Board can consider her release.

'''Sheila Elizabeth Nicholls''' (born 9 February 1970 in [[Colchester]], Essex) is a British singer-songwriter, now residing in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]], Los Angeles, California.

==Early years==
While growing up, Nicholls attended [[Felsted School]]. She first found fame for performing [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]] while [[streaking]] at an [[England cricket team|England]] vs. [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] [[cricket]] match at [[Lord's]] in May 1989, in which she joined fellow school players [[Derek Pringle]] and [[John Stephenson (cricketer, born 1965)|John Stephenson]] on the field of play;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Streaker Sheila sneaks a bare run|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J001AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pKULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6414,2637812&amp;dq=sheila+nicholls+streaker&amp;hl=en|accessdate=24 December 2010|newspaper=[[Glasgow Herald]]|date=30 May 1989|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this footage was later included in the video ''Streaker'', narrated by [[George Best]].

Nicholls travelled to the United States later in 1989 and began performing with her band, Sheila Nicholls and the Splendid Frock, in New York City in the mid-1990s.

==Critical acclaim==
Nicholls then moved to Los Angeles where she recorded a solo album, the critically acclaimed ''Brief Strop'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All flavors, all finds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=24 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=20 June 2000|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started her own label, Essex Girl Records.

Shortly thereafter, Nicholls signed a deal with [[Hollywood Records]], which began distributing ''Brief Strop''. The song "Fallen for You," from the album, became a hit on [[Campus radio|college radio]] stations and found its way onto the best-selling soundtrack for the movie [[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]. She toured extensively with the album, including several gigs alongside [[k.d. lang]].

"After some moral deliberations about taking [[Criticism of The Walt Disney Company#General criticism|Disney blood money]]... I negotiated a deal in which I asked for final creative say across the board and the full ownership of my master copies, both of which I got."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Protest songs: Record labels aren't listening [Blowback]|url = http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2011/12/protest-songs-occupyla-sheila-nicholls-blowback.html|accessdate = 17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2002, Nicholls released her second album, ''Wake'', in which she worked with producers [[Glen Ballard]] and [[The Latin Project|Jez Colin]]. The album's first single, "Faith," co-written with Ballard, received ample radio play and reached the pop charts. Nicholls third album, "Songs From the Bardo" was released in August 2009. "After releasing two albums with Hollywood Records, I decided to lay low for a minute. I built a studio, bought equipment, and taught myself [[Pro Tools|ProTools]]. I really wanted to expand my abilities and have more creative independence. Consequently this record took a while because I did it myself, with some help from friends. Oh and I also had a baby."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Music Sheila Nicholls + free downloads|url = https://extramusicnew.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/new-music-sheila-nicholls-free-downloads/|accessdate = 17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Sheila Nichols was approached by singer, songwriter, executive producer and former Navy SEAL Curt Campbell asking her if she would be interested in recording an album of original material. Hence the emergence of her 4th album "All of Nature" which was released in 2016.

==Personal life==

Sheila has one daughter, born in 2007.

In 2011 she spent two months with [[Occupy Los Angeles]], camping outside [[Los Angeles City Hall|City Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Protest songs: Record labels aren't listening [Blowback]|url = http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2011/12/protest-songs-occupyla-sheila-nicholls-blowback.html|accessdate = 17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appearing in NPR's coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Battle Cry: Occupy's Messaging Tactics Catch On|url = https://www.npr.org/2011/12/06/142999617/battle-cry-occupys-messaging-tactics-catch-on|publisher = NPR|accessdate = 17 August 2015|first = Carrie Kahn Twitter Facebook|last = Tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary teachings ==
The primary teachings of Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj are [[Bhakti]], Sewa(Service), Prem (love) and [[Rāja yoga]] (meditation). The spiritual institution (Paramhans Satyarthi Mission) led by Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj believes in the principle of Vasudev Kutumbkam. The symbol of the mission is Hans or the [[swan]] bird on the lotus flower. "Satya" (truth)  is the methodology of the mission. Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj preaches the concept and relevance of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and self-realization. Advait refers to its idea that the soul ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) is the same as the highest metaphysical Reality ([[Brahman]]). Advaita Vedanta emphasizes the idea that ''[[moksha]]'' is achievable in this life in contrast to Indian philosophies that emphasize moksha after death. Advaita Vedanta is one of the most studied and most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Advaita philosophy is non-dualistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://satyarthiji.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=featured&amp;Itemid=435|title=Paramhans Satyarthi Mission|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.bhaskar.com/news/HAR-SONI-MAT-latest-sonipat-news-032026-3035387-NOR.html|title=Focus on family solidarity rather than money|last=|first=|date=2015-11-17|work=Dainik Bhaskar|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Raj yoga ===
Raj yoga is variously referred to as "royal yoga", "royal union", "sahaj marg", "best of yoga".  Raj yoga refers to the goal of yoga (which is usually [[samadhi]]).  Raja Yoga meditation is an inwardly oriented practice. Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj teaches the way to meditate on the pious name which is two and a half words powerful [[mantra]]. This mantra is given to the devotees as Updesh. It is known to make the person’s life free of all hassles, to show and guide him in the right direction. He has written several books on Rajyog, Sewa, Satya, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/state/uttar-pradesh/ghaziabad/quotthe-conquest-of-disorders-meet-god-39/articleshow/16645919.cms|title='विकारों पर विजय से मिलेंगे भगवान'|last=|first=|date=Oct 3, 2012|work=Navbharat times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sewa ===
In his view, sewa is the best way of practicing Bhakti. It could be in any way, by going to his temple and physically contributing to the activities happening there, by remembering him in our hearts and doing Pooja (worship) at home, by devoting (as per the wish) to the funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/punjab/jalandhar/news/PUN-JAL-OMC-MAT-latest-jalandhar-news-032526-2827860-NOR.html|title=माता-पिता बच्चों को गोसेवा के संस्कार दें|last=|first=|date=2016|work=Dainik Bhaskar|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bhakti ===
Bhakti means devotion. [[Bhakti yoga]] means to practice connecting the God, and establishing our relationship with, God, through acts of love and service, or devotional service. Basic principle of Bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is that the Absolute Truth is not an impersonal void but rather the Supreme Person. The goal of one who practices Bhakti yoga is to revive that state of pure consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/muzaffarnagar-13780637.html|title=Satyarthi Seva Dal- Knowledge Yajna in Sanatan Dharma Sabha|last=|first=|date=28 Mar 2016|work=Jagran|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He added valuable inputs{{which|date=August 2017}} in the process of constitution. Mahatma Gandhi would call him 'Bapa'.

Thakkarbapa visited forests in Assam, rural Bengal, drought affected areas of Orissa, Bhil belts in Gujarat and Harijan areas of Saurashtra, Mahar areas of Maharashtra, untouchables in Madras, hilly areas of Chhota Nagpur, desert of Tharparkar, foothills of Himalaya, coastal areas of [[Travancore]] with his mission of upliftment of tribal and harijans. He would always travel in third class of railway. Thakkarbapa spent 35 years of his life in service of tribal and harijans.

== Early life ==
Thakkar Bappa was born on 29 November 1869 in a middle-class family of [[Bhavnagar]] in Saurashtra region of Gujarat State India. His father Vithal Das Thakkar named the child Amrit Lal. He received his first schooling for benevolence and service to humanity from his father. He got his L.C.E. (Licenciate in Civil Engineering) from Poona in 1890. He worked as an engineer creditably in Porbander and later went out of India to serve in laying the First Railway Track in Uganda (East Africa). He served also as chief engineer in Sangli State for some time and then was employed in Bombay municipality as an engineer. It was here he saw, for the first time, the miserable conditions of those scavengers who had to dispose of the refuse of the whole town of Bombay. He was shocked to see the filthy colonies where the Sweepers had to live and made a firm resolve to devote the rest of his life to alleviate the lot of these people. He later served in Uganda (Country) railways in East Africa. In 1914, he resigned and took up social work. He became a member of Servants of India Society and advocated the rights of untouchables and tribals.

== Honors ==
The [[Government of India]] issued a stamp in his honour in 1969. A well known locality, [[Bappa Colony]] in [[Mumbai]] is named after him. The [[Madhya Pradesh]] state government has instituted an award named in his honour for dedicated services to poor, victimised and totally backward tribal community.Maharashtra government has set the scheme to improve aadivasi villages and colonies named Thakkar Bappa aadivasi vasti sudharana in the year 2007

== Popular culture ==
In [[Tamil Nadu]], Thakkar was popularly known as "Appa Thakkar", the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] version of "Thakkar Bapa". Due to the fact that he was very knowledgeable, often instantly answering questions thrown at him, the [[Madras Bashai]] term "appatakkar", meaning a [[Know-it-all|know-all]], developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnsxZaruv0U |title=Who is Appatakkar |last=Gowri |first=Madan |date=15 November 2017 |website=YouTube |language=ta |access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Tamil is semma gethu language machi' |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Tamil-is-semma-gethu-language-machi/articleshow/50884605.cms |accessdate=4 June 2018 |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term gained popularity through its usage in the 2010 Tamil film ''[[Boss Engira Bhaskaran]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Balachandran |first1=Logesh |title=Therikavidalama to Senjiduven: Quirky K'wood dialogues |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Therikavidalama-to-Senjiduven-Quirky-Kwood-dialogues/articleshow/49337190.cms |accessdate=4 June 2018 |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Two Moons''' (1847–1917), or ''Ishaynishus'' ([[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]]: ''Éše'he Ôhnéšesêstse''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdkc.edu/cheyennedictionary/index-english/main.htmm Cheyenne Dictionary]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Fisher, Leman, Pine, Sanchez.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the Cheyenne chiefs who took part in the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] and other battles against the United States Army.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. (1907) [http://curtis.library.northwestern.edu/ ''The North American Indian. Vol.6 The Piegan, the Cheyenne and the Arapaho''.].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Two Moons was the son of Carries the Otter, an [[Arikara]] captive who married into the [[Cheyenne]] tribe. Perhaps known best for his participation in battles such as the [[Battle of the Rosebud]] against [[George Crook|General Crook]] on June 17, 1876, in the [[Montana Territory]], the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]] on June 25, 1876 and what would prove to be his last battle, the [[Battle of Wolf Mountain]] on January 8, 1877. Two Moons' defeat in the battle at Wolf mountain by [[Nelson A. Miles|General Nelson A. Miles]] would inevitably lead to the surrender of his Cheyenne band at [[Fort Keogh]] in April, 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Hardorff, Richard G. Indian Views of the Custer Fight. University of Oklahoma Press 2005, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;

After the surrender of the Cheyenne band he led in 1877, Two Moons chose to enlist as an [[United States Army Indian Scouts|Indian Scout]] for the same General, Nelson A. Miles to whom he had not long since surrendered. As a result of Two Moons' pleasant personality, the friendliness that he showed towards the [[White American|whites]] as well as his ability to get along with the military, General Miles appointed him head Chief of the [[Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation|Cheyenne Northern Reservation]]. As head Chief, Two Moons would prove to play a crucial role in facilitating the surrender of Chief Little Cow's Cheyenne band to [[Fort Keogh]].&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Hamlin. Account of The Battle at Little Bighorn (Recalled in 1898 by Two Moons). [[McClure's|McClure's Magazine]], 1898&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Cheyenne Reservation==
[[file:Indian Head Buffalo Obverse.jpg | thumb | left |Two Moons was one of the models for the [[Buffalo nickel]].]]
Two Moons traveled on multiple occasions to [[Washington, D.C.]], to discuss and fight for the future of the Northern Cheyenne people and to better the conditions that existed on the reservation. In 1914, Two Moons met with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to discuss these matters.

Two Moons was one of the models selected for [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Fraser]]'s famous [[Buffalo Nickel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Vera Brown Starr''' (May 23, 1924 – March 4, 1985) was the first woman elected as chair of the [[Yavapai-Apache Nation]] and served two years in the office, as well as serving over fifteen years on the council. She was one of the delegates to the [[1977 National Women's Conference]], a major U.S. women's conference held in conjunction with the [[International Women's Year]] celebrations of the United Nations. In 2012, her name was inscribed on an arch recognizing women who were Native American leaders at the [[University of Arizona]].

==Early life==
Vera Brown was born on May 23, 1924 at the Indian Reservation of [[Camp Verde, Arizona]] to Mary and Sam Brown, members of the Mojave-[[Apache]]. She was the youngest of three siblings.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1934|p=8}} Her father was a miner, working in the United Verde Mine near [[Jerome, Arizona]] and the smelters in [[Clarkdale, Arizona|Clarkdale]] and [[Clemenceau, Arizona|Clemenceau]].{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} Until she was school age, the family lived in a ''[[Wigwam|wickiup]]'' near Clarkdale.{{sfn|Winters|1980|p=16}} She attended the segregated public school in Clarkdale, which allowed whites to attend in the mornings and [[Hispanic]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] to attend afternoon classes and though she was placed in the morning session, she remembered experiencing discrimination and did not speak English.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|Winters|1980|p=16}} When she was eleven, her father died on April 19, 1935, from [[silicosis]], having worked the mines without any protective respiratory equipment.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1934|p=8}} She was sent to the [[Valentine Indian School]] under the [[American Indian boarding schools|American Indian boarding school program]] and graduated from the Indian High School in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Though she earned a scholarship to the [[University of New Mexico]], Brown returned to Carkdale to care for her mother because the pension her father earned had ended after one year and her mother was denied social security.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} 

After World War II, Brown married Antonio L. Moreno (1924–1968), a veteran and miner, from Clarkdale.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1968|p=80}} The couple originally made their home in Jerome, where their children Anthony Jr. (1948–2009) and Petra (1949–2011) were born.{{sfn|''Ajo Copper News''|2009|p=2}}{{sfn|''Ajo Copper News''|2011|p=2}} In 1949, they moved to [[Ajo, Arizona|Ajo]], where Antonio worked at the [[Phelps Dodge|Phelps-Dodge smelter]].{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1968|p=80}} 

==Tribral council career==
In 1967, against her mother's recommendation, Moreno decided to run for a seat on the tribal council of the [[Yavapai-Apache Nation]].{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} After her husband's death in 1968, Moreno remarried with Henry Starr.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} She was successful in attaining a seat in 1969 and served for six years, before becoming the first woman to serve as the Tribal Chair in 1975.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1975|p=27}}{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} After serving two-years as Tribal Chair, the 1977 election was fraught with factionalism, causing a contested election, a court battle, and finally a new vote.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|October 27, 1977|p=29}} Starr did not win her re-election bid as Chair.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|November 15, 1977|p=21}} 

Starr joined the [[North American Indian Women's Association]] (NAIWA), an organization formed to foster inter-tribal betterment for Native Americans.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} In 1977, she attended the [[1977 National Women's Conference|National Women's Conference]], which was held in conjunction with the [[United Nations]]' [[International Women's Year]] celebrations. As one of Arizona's four Native American delegates, of specific interest to her were the anti-discrimination resolution passed by the women which addressed minority rights, including the removal of American Indian children from their homes and tribes, as well as the discussion of the failure of Arizona to pass [[Medicaid]] legislation to provide health care to low-income families.{{sfn|Sowers|1977|p=2}}

Though defeated in her bid for re-election to the chair, Starr continued to serve on the council, being returned in 1978 as a council member.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1978|p=16}} In 1981, she was elected as treasurer of the tribe and held that post until her election as vice chair of the tribe in 1982.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1982|p=18}} She returned as vice chair in 1983.{{sfn|Funk|1983|p=21}} Issues on which she focused during her time on the council were those that would improve the lives of tribe members. She advocated for improved housing, health care initiatives, and protection of water rights.{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}}{{sfn|Sowers|1977|p=2}}

==Death and legacy==
Starr died on March 4, 1985 in [[Cottonwood, Arizona]] at the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Hospital.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=38}} Posthumously, her name was inscribed in 2011 on the Native American Women of Arizona Arch on the [[University of Arizona]] campus,{{sfn|University of Arizona|2011}} after having been selected to represent their tribe by the Yavapai-Apache Nation.{{sfn|Ruiz-McGill|2012}}

'''Winthrop Ames''' (November 25, 1870 – November 3, 1937) was an [[United States|American]] theatre [[Theatre director|director]] and [[Theatrical producer|producer]], [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]].

For three decades at the beginning of the 20th century, Ames was an important force on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], whose repertoire included directing and producing Shakespeare and classic plays, new plays, and revivals of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy opera]]s.

==Biography==
Ames was born in [[Easton, Massachusetts|North Easton]], [[Massachusetts]] to Cathrine Hobart and [[Oakes Angier Ames]], members of a wealthy manufacturing family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss358_bioghist.html "Ames Family Papers, 1812-2008"], Biographical Notes, Five Colleges Archives and Manuscript Collections&lt;/ref&gt; Ames studied art and architecture at [[Harvard University]]. He worked in the publishing business before turning to a career in the theatre. In 1911, Ames married Lucy (Fuller) Cabot in London, and the couple had two daughters named Catherine and Joan.&lt;ref name=NYPL&gt;Elkind, Elisabeth. [http://archives.nypl.org/the/21762#overview "Guide to the Winthrop Ames Papers, 1908-1931"], Billy Rose Theatre Division, The [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
In 1904, Ames toured Europe to study the management techniques of sixty opera and theatre companies. Upon his return to America, he became manager of Boston's [[Castle Square Theatre]]. In 1908, he was appointed as the managing director of the [[Century Theatre (New York City)|New Theatre]], at [[Central Park West]] and 62nd Street in New York. In November 1909, the theatre opened officially to the public with an opulent production of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' starring [[Julia Marlowe]] and [[E. H. Sothern]]. The New Theatre was the largest playhouse in New York City at that time, and Ames began to mount ambitious productions, ranging from Shakespeare and other classics to modern works. The theatre was a financial failure and closed after only two seasons.&lt;ref name=NYPL/&gt;

In 1912, bucking the tide of Broadway commercialism, Ames used his own money to build the [[Helen Hayes Theatre|Little Theatre]] at 240 West 44th Street with the express idea of putting on experimental dramas and to give an opportunity to new playwrights. This theatre had 300 seats and was, at the time, the smallest legitimate theatre in New York. One of the plays he presented in October of the first year of operation was ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1912 play)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', which he billed as the "First play written entirely for the enjoyment of children."  Ames wrote the play under the pseudonym "Jessie Graham White" from the stories of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. The play received favorable reviews. He also built the [[Booth Theatre]] on West 45th Street in 1913 and managed both the Little Theatre and the Booth until 1930.&lt;ref name=NYPL/&gt;

Ames's most notable Broadway productions included an adaptation of ''[[Prunella (fairy tale)|Prunella]]'' (1913), ''[[The Philanderer]]'' (1913), ''A Pair of Silk Stockings'' (1914), and ''Pierrot the Prodigal'' (1916). During [[World War I]], Ames organized the Over There Theatre League, which arranged for actors to travel to Europe to entertain troops.&lt;ref name=NYPL/&gt;

After the war, Ames began to direct most of the Broadway shows that he produced, including ''The Betrothal'' (1918), ''[[The Green Goddess (stage play)|The Green Goddess]]'' (1921), ''The Truth About Blayds'' (1922), ''Will Shakespeare'' (1923), ''[[Beggar on Horseback]]'' (1924), ''Minick'' (1924), ''Old English'' (1924), ''White Wings'' (1926), ''[[Escape (1927 play)|Escape]]'' (1927), ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1928) and ''Mrs. Moonlight'' (1930).

By the 1920s, after the extraordinary success of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] works in America at the end of the nineteenth century, the popularity of Gilbert and Sullivan had waned. Ames revived interest in these [[comic opera]]s with lavish and lively seasons of ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'' from 1926 to 1929. Ames directed the productions himself at the Booth Theatre, which received critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, G. M. "Gilbert and Sullivan – And Winthrop Ames," ''The New Yorker'', June 6, 1931, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; These paved the way for American tours by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] in the 1930s. ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine wrote of Ames' production of ''Iolanthe'': "It is generally agreed that in this entertainment he has done the best job of any producer attempting one of the famous series in our time. The only anxiety now is that he may be distracted before he has revived everyone of the operas in an equally felicitous vein.... The show is now accepted as incomparably the finest musical preparation of its type in town, and probably in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721953,00.html "New Plays",] ''TIME'' magazine, May 03, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Ames began leasing his theatres to other producers, and he produced his last Broadway play in 1930. In 1931, as he wound down his business affairs with age and poor health, he sold the Little Theatre building to ''[[The New York Times]]''. In 1959, the theatre was converted back to a theatre and was briefly renamed in 1964 as the "Winthrop Ames Theatre", and in 1983 it was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]]. In 1932, Ames left New York to retire to North Easton, but there he helped to found the [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] School of Drama. In 1929, he was elected a trustee of Harvard and in 1936 became vice president of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]].

In addition to writing his children's adaptation of ''Snow White'' in 1913, Ames was commissioned by the [[Famous Players-Lasky Corporation]] to write the screenplay for their 1916 [[motion pictures]] ''Oliver Twist'' and ''[[Snow White (1916 film)|Snow White]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0024758/ Winthrop Ames] at the IMDB database&lt;/ref&gt;  He also translated ''The Merchant of Paris'' from the French in 1930 and wrote other plays.

Ames died of pneumonia in 1937 in [[Boston]] three weeks before his 67th birthday and was buried in North Easton. Like other influential Broadway theater producers, Ames's likeness was captured in caricature by [[Alex Gard]] for the wall of [[Sardi's]], the [[New York City]] [[Theater District]] restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/the/thesardis.xml The New York Public Library Inventory of  Sardi's Caricatures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames was inducted, posthumously, into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/03/theater/26-elected-theater-hall-fame-26-broadway-voted-into-theater-hall-fame.html "26 Elected to the Theater Hall of Fame."] ''The New York Times'', March 3, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
