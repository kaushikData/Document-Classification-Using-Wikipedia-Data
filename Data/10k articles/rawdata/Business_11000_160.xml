'''40 Wall Street''', also known as the '''Trump Building''', is a 71-story neo-gothic [[skyscraper]] between [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] and [[William Street (Manhattan)|William Street]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].  Erected by [[The Manhattan Company]] as its headquarters, the building was originally known as the '''Bank of Manhattan Trust Building''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirednewyork.com/skyscrapers/40wall/|title=40 Wall Street – The Trump Building|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also as the '''Manhattan Company Building''',&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; until its founding tenant merged to form the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]].&lt;ref name="AIA"&gt;{{cite AIA4}}. p.019.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was completed in 1930 after 11 months of construction.

[[Image:40 Wall Street Manhattan New York City.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An early picture of the Manhattan Company Building.]]

The building was designed by [[H. Craig Severance]], along with [[Yasuo Matsui]] (associate architect), and [[Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon|Shreve &amp; Lamb]] (consulting architects). [[Purdy and Henderson, Engineers|Purdy and Henderson]] were the structural engineers. [[Edward F. Caldwell &amp; Co.]] designed the lighting.  [[Der Scutt]] of Der Scutt Architect designed the lobby and entrance renovation.&lt;ref name="AIA"/&gt; Its pinnacle reaches 927 feet (283 m) and was very briefly the [[World's tallest structures|tallest building in the world]], surpassed by a spire attached to the [[Chrysler Building]] a few months later.&lt;ref name=CTBUH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=The History of Measuring Tall Buildings |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Competition for "world's tallest building" title ===
40 Wall Street was originally proposed by the banker [[George L. Ohrstrom]] to be a 47-story tower. Shortly after, Ohrstrom modified his project to have 60 floors, but it was still below the {{convert|792|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Woolworth Building]] and the {{convert|808|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Chrysler Building]] project, announced in 1928.&lt;ref name="Gray 1992"/&gt; In April 1928, Severance increased 40 Wall's height to {{convert|840|ft|m}} with 62 floors, which would exceed the Woolworth's height by {{convert|48|ft|m}} and the Chrysler's by {{convert|32|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Gray 1992"/&gt; The two structures started competing for the distinction of "[[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/the-trump-building-new-york-city-ny-usa|title=Emporis Data "...a celebrated three-way race to become the tallest building in the world."|author=Emporis GmbH|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscraper.org/TALLEST_TOWERS/t_manco.htm|title=The Manhattan Company – Skyscraper.org; "...'race' to erect the tallest tower in the world."|publisher=Skyscraper.org|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Building]] on 34th Street and Fifth Avenue would enter the competition in 1929. The "Race into the Sky", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, fueled by the building boom in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rasenberger | first=Jim | title=High Steel: The Daring Men Who Built the World's Greatest Skyline, 1881 to the Present | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-06-174675-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XDSxwPx-yJ4C |pages=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 40 Wall Street tower was revised from {{convert|840|ft|m}} to 925 feet in April 1929, making it the world's tallest.&lt;ref name=Tauranac&gt;{{cite book |title=The Empire State Building: The Making of a Landmark |last=Tauranac |first=John |publisher=Scribner |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-684-19678-7 |location=New York |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130}} Severance increased the height of his project and then publicly claimed the title of the world's tallest building.&lt;ref&gt;Emporis Data – See source no.4 line 4; "Briefly held the world's tallest title until it was eclipsed by the spire of Chrysler Building."&lt;/ref&gt; (This distinction excluded structures that were not fully habitable, such as the [[Eiffel Tower]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctbuh.org/|title=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of 40 Wall Street began in May 1929 at a frantic pace, and it was completed twelve months later.&lt;ref name="Gray 1992"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gray | first=Christopher | title=Streetscapes: 40 Wall Street; A Race for the Skies, Lost by a Spire | work=The New York Times| date=1992-11-15 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/realestate/streetscapes-40-wall-street-a-race-for-the-skies-lost-by-a-spire.html | access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the Chrysler's architect [[William Van Alen]] obtained permission for a {{Convert|38|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} long spire&lt;ref name=Stravitz&gt;{{cite book |last=Stravitz |first=David |title=The Chrysler Building: Creating a New York Icon Day by Day |year=2002 |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |location=New York |isbn=1-56898-354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|161}}&lt;ref name=Binders/&gt; and had it secretly constructed inside the frame of the building.&lt;ref name=Tauranac/&gt;{{rp|130}} The spire was delivered to the site in four different sections.&lt;ref name=Stravitz/&gt;{{rp|161}} On October 23, 1929, the day before the catastrophic [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] started, the bottom section of the spire was slowly hoisted to the top of the building's dome and lowered into the 66th floor of the building.&lt;ref name="Gray 1992"/&gt; The other remaining sections of the spire were hoisted and riveted to the first one in sequential order in 90 minutes,&lt;ref name=Stravitz/&gt;{{rp|xiii, 161}} helping raise the tower's height to {{convert|1,046|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8djsCB8-OUC&amp;pg=PA426|title=Chrysler: The Life and Times of an Automotive Genius|last=Curcio|first=V.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-19-514705-6|series=Automotive History and Personalities|location=|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E30rCBeM8nkC|title=The History of Stainless Steel|last=Cobb|first=H.M.|publisher=ASM International|year=2010|isbn=978-1-61503-011-8|series=Asm Handbook|location=|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steel tip brought the Chrysler Building to a height of {{convert|1046|ft|m}}, greatly exceeding 40 Wall Street's height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Building the Empire State |last=Willis |first=Carol |last2=Friedman |first2=Donald |publisher=W.W.

Upset by Chrysler's victory, [[William F. Lamb|Shreve &amp; Lamb]], consulting architects of 40 Wall Street, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly {{convert|100|ft|m}} above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and essentially inaccessible.&lt;ref name=Binders&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lcir7wwIzhIC&amp;pg=PA102|title=101 of the World's Tallest Buildings|last=Binders|first=George|publisher=Images Pub.|year=2006|isbn=978-1-86470-173-9|location=|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a moot point when the Empire State Building was completed eleven months later in May 1931, becoming the world's tallest building in both of those categories, at {{convert|1250|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=CTBUH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tauranac/&gt;{{rp|185}}

The Bank of Manhattan Building had an observation deck on the 69th and 70th floors, located {{Convert|836|ft|m}} above the street, with the observatory able to fit up to 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/06/01/118375009.pdf|title=TOWER RISES 836 FEET.; Lofty Observation Floor in Bank of Manhattan Building.|last=|first=|date=1930-06-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze statue of [[Oceanus]], a Greek god, was also erected atop the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/04/26/96109916.pdf|title=OCEANUS ADORNS FACADE.; New Skyscraper for Bank of Manhattan Building Gets Statue.|last=|first=|date=1930-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreclosure ===
In 1939, the Marine Midland Trust Company started [[foreclosure]] proceedings against the Forty Wall Street Corporation after the corporation [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] on "payments of interest, taxes and other charges".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/05/25/93918517.pdf|title=START FORECLOSURE ON 40 WALL STREET; Trustee Presents Reorganization Plan for Skyscraper|last=|first=|date=1939-05-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bondholders acquired the building in 1940 in a transaction worth almost $11.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/09/26/94001232.pdf|title=Bondholders Acquire 40 Wall Street Building On Bid of $11,489,500 in Reorganization Plan|last=|first=|date=1940-09-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1946 plane crash ===
On the evening of May 20, 1946, a [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Beechcraft Model 18|Beechcraft C-45F Expediter]] airplane crashed into the north side of the building. The twin-engined plane was heading for [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] on a flight originating at [[Chennault Air Force Base|Lake Charles Army Air Field]] in [[Louisiana]]. It struck the 58th floor of the building at about 8:10 PM, creating a {{convert|20|x|10|ft|m|adj=on}} hole in the masonry, and killing all five aboard the plane, including a [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)|WAC]] officer. The fuselage and the wing of the splintered plane fell and caught onto the 12th story ledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1946/05/21/page/1/article/plane-hits-wall-st-bank|title=PLANE HITS WALL ST. BANK (May 21, 1946)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fog and low visibility were identified as the main causes of the crash. At the time of the accident, [[LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia Field]] reported a heavy fog that reduced the ceiling to {{convert|500|ft|m}}, obscuring the view of the ground for the pilot at the building's 58th story level. Parts of the aircraft and pieces of brick and mortar from the building fell into the street below, but there were no reported injuries to any of the estimated 2,000 workers in the building, nor anyone on the street.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;"Pilot Lost in Fog," ''New York Times,'' May 21, 1946, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

This crash at 40 Wall Street was the second of its kind in New York City's history, the first being when an Army [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] bomber [[B-25 Empire State Building crash|struck the 78th floor]] of the [[Empire State Building]] in July 1945. The cause of that crash was also fog and poor visibility.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The 1946 accident was the last time an airplane accidentally struck a skyscraper in New York City until October 11, 2006, when a small plane carrying [[New York Yankees]] pitcher [[Cory Lidle]] [[2006 New York City plane crash|crashed into a 50-story condo building]] on Manhattan's Upper East Side.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Matthys and Salvadori, Mario, ''Why Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail'' (2002), p. 30: "… no plane has accidentally hit a skyscraper since the Empire State and Wall Street catastrophes."

=== Decline and revival ===

In 1982, Joseph J. and Ralph E. Bernstein purchased leasing rights of 40 Wall Street and were later found to be acting on behalf of [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]], the President of the [[Philippines]]. When Marcos was removed from power and his assets in the United States were frozen, the building was placed in limbo.&lt;ref&gt;Oser, Alan S. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD9173CF933A15755C0A965958260 "Perspectives: 40 Wall Street; Asian Buyer Accepts a Leasing Challenge"], ''New York Times'', 20 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citigroup|Citicorp]] then decided to undertake a $50 million renovation of 40 Wall Street, but the renovation was canceled in 1991 due to concerns that the tenants might move out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/10/realestate/commercial-property-40-wall-street-citicorp-aborts-50-million-financing.html|title=Commercial Property: 40 Wall Street; Citicorp Aborts $50 Million Financing of Renovation|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=1991-11-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1995, after years of neglect, the lease was transferred to [[Donald Trump]], who later renamed the building the "Trump Building".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/07/business/40-wall-street-is-sold-to-trump.html|title=40 Wall Street Is Sold to Trump|last=News|first=Bloomberg Business|date=1995-12-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://therealdeal.com/2017/01/06/meet-the-obscure-german-magnates-who-actually-own-trumps-most-valuable-building/ |title=Meet the obscure German magnates who actually own Trump's most valuable building|date=6 January 2017|work=The Real Deal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He planned to convert the upper half of it to residential space, leaving the bottom half as commercial space. The cost of converting it to residential space proved to be too high, and it remains 100% commercial space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George H. |last=Ross |title=Trump Strategies for Real Estate: Billionaire Lessons for the Small Investor |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2005 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ3l-QD6nmIC&amp;pg=PA51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to sell the building in 2003, expecting offers in excess of $300 million. They did not materialize. In the ninth episode of the fourth season of ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 4)|The Apprentice]]'', Trump claimed he only paid $1 million for the building, but that it was actually worth $400 million. This episode aired November 17, 2005. Trump's legal advisor, [[George H. Ross]], restated this claim in a 2005 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George H. |last=Ross |title=Trump Strategies for Real Estate: Billionaire Lessons for the Small Investor |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2005 |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ3l-QD6nmIC&amp;pg=PA50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On CNBC's ''The Billionaire Inside'', Trump again claimed he paid $1 million for the building, but stated the value as $600 million, a $200 million increase from two years earlier. The episode aired October 17, 2007, on CNBC. However, it has also been reported that Trump paid $10 million for the building and the building is now worth $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://therealdeal.com/blog/2012/01/23/trump-fills-40-wall-street-with-high-incentives-low-rents/ "Trump fills 40 Wall Street with low rents, incentives"], ''The Real Deal'', 23 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2015 Federal Election Commission filings, Trump has an outstanding mortgage on the property in excess of $50 million.&lt;ref name=Zurcher23July&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33644498|title=Five take-aways from Donald Trump's financial disclosure|work=BBC|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=March 2, 2016|first=Anthony|last=Zurcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the building was designated a landmark by the [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan|New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]. The tower was the tallest mid-block building in New York City until the completion of [[One57]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/trump-bragged-tallest-building/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Zachary Bronfman''' (born August 6, 1982) is an American entrepreneur and musician. Bronfman is a strategic advisor and principal investor with Algae Systems, a carbon capture project and an associate managing director at Global Thermostat, a bio-fuel company. He was a member of rock band [[The Exit]] (going by the name '''Ben Brewer''') and he is a member of the music collective Teachers and co-founder of the Green Owl record label. 

He is the second-eldest child of actress Sherry Brewer and [[Edgar Bronfman Jr.]] the former CEO of [[Warner Music Group]]. He and musician and activist [[M.I.A. (artist)|Mathangi "Maya" Arulpragasam]], better known under the stage name M.I.A., were engaged from 2009-2012 and have a son together.

==Early life and education==

Bronfman was born in New York City, and then lived in London briefly, during his father's tenure as managing director of [[Seagram|Seagram Distilleries]] Europe.  The family returned in 1984, once his father became President of Seagram's U.S. marketing division. His mother is [[African-American]] and his father is [[Jewish American]].&lt;ref name=sandrarose&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ogunnaike|first1=Lola|title=EBONY: Meet The Black Bronfmans|url=http://sandrarose.com/2011/07/ebony-meet-the-black-bronfmans/|website=SandraRose.com|accessdate=September 24, 2015|date=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-21237697.html "Seagram chairman admits he never approved of son's marriage to a Black woman"], ''Jet'',  March. 23, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is a member of the [[Lehman family]] via his paternal grandmother, Ann Loeb Bronfman.&lt;ref name=NYT-AnnLBronfman-obit&gt;{{cite web|title=Ann L. Bronfman: Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=150140174|work=Legacy.com|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 24, 2013|date=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronfman attended [[The Collegiate School]] in New York City, graduating in 2000.  He enrolled in [[Emerson College]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, where he studied Politics and Law before dropping out.

==Environment and technology==

Bronfman became interested in progressive environmental technologies &amp; geo-engineering in 2007. Teaming with [[Columbia University]] economist Graciela Chichilinsky he embarked on a project to reduce the atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]].

In 2007, he became associate managing director of Global Thermostat, Chichilinsky and fellow Columbia Professor, Peter Eisenberger's technology firm focused on developing a technology for direct air-capture of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=pompeo&gt;Pompeo, Joe. "[http://observer.com/2009/11/the-bedstuy-bronfman/ The Bed-Stuy Bronfman]", ''[[The New York Observer]]'', November 24, 2009. Retrieved  September 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The firm recently{{when|date=March 2011}} completed construction of its first pilot plant at The [[Stanford Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, Marc. "[http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2010/12/23/can-global-thermostat-turn-climate-change-around Can a 'Global Thermostat' Turn Climate Change Around?]", ''GreenBiz.com'', December 23,  2010. Retrieved September 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was integral in convincing his father to invest in the firm, and thus the subsequent appointment of Edgar Bronfman Jr. as chairman. In 2010, Benjamin Bronfman was named Strategic Advisor of Global Thermostat. 

On November 13, 2010, Bronfman presented Global Thermostat's vision and process as a speaker at the [[Ted (conference)|TED]] Brooklyn Conference at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY.&lt;ref&gt;Jovanovic, Rozalia. [http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/tedxbrooklyn-elitism-worth-spreading/23504 TEDx Brooklyn: Elitism worth spreading]", ''BlackBookMag.com'', November 25, 2010. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130212843/http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/tedxbrooklyn-elitism-worth-spreading/23504|date=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bronfman also became a principal investor and advisor at Algae Systems, LLC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanellos|first1=Michael|title=Sewage-to-Algae Unites Whiskey Fortune, Dead Lyricist, GreenFuel, and NASA|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/sewage-to-algae-unites-whiskey-fortune-dead-lyricist-greenfuel-and-nasa|website=GreenTechMedia.com|accessdate=September 24, 2015|date=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- replaced algaesystems.com 'source' as it went to a page that did not mention Bronfman, and was also a primary source --&gt; a third-generation bio-fuel company founded by Matthew Atwood that takes waste water from cities (using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured by GT) and generates jet fuel and diesel.

==Music==
[[File:TheExit.jpg|thumb|Bronfman performing with The Exit in 2004]]
Bronfman was guitarist for [[The Exit]], an indie/punk/reggae rock band he started with Gunnar Olsen and [[Jeff DaRosa]] in 2000, while he attended [[Emerson College]]. 

During this time period, he went by Ben Brewer, using his mother's maiden name to avoid unnecessary associations between the band and his father. In 2007, shortly after the official announcement of The Exit's breakup, Bronfman founded Green Owl, an independent record label distributed by Warner Music Group, created to be the first environmentally conscious sustainable record label and apparel line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Beat: The First Eco-friendly Record Label|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/04/green-beat-the.html|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=September 24, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130181612/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/04/green-beat-the.html|archivedate=November 30, 2009 |date=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2015}}

In 2010, he started a music collective known as [[Teachers]] (sometimes stylized T∑∆CH∑RS) with Grey McMurray, Steve Borth, Matt Kranz, and Scottie Redix.  The first single, "Gold", debuted on the website of the music editorial, [[The Fader]], on July 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Macia, Peter. "[http://www.thefader.com/2010/07/12/teachers-gold-mp3-teaser-video/ Teachers, 'Gold' MP3 + Teaser Video]", ''The Fader'', July 12, 2010. Retrieved  September 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Bronfman and Teachers worked with [[Kanye West]] and contributed to his single "[[Monster (Kanye West song)|Monster]]" featuring [[Jay-Z]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]] and [[Bon Iver]].

In 2013, Teachers co-produced New Slaves, the first single out of Kanye's [[Yeezus]] album, earning Bronfman his first Grammy nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Hear Kanye West's Original Instrumental 'New Slaves' Demo|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/premieres/exclusive-hear-kanye-wests-original-instrumental-new-slaves-demo-20141027|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bronfman met British recording artist, songwriter, painter and director [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. They became engaged and M.I.A gave birth to their son, Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman, on February 13, 2009.&lt;ref name=pompeo/&gt; In February 2012, it was announced that the two had separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sfgate.com/dailydish/2013/03/13/m-i-a-goes-public-with-child-custody-battle/ SF Gate: "M.I.A. goes public with child custody battle"] March 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronfman has two sisters, [[Hannah Bronfman|Hannah]] and Vanessa.&lt;ref name=sandrarose/&gt;

'''Business and Enterprise Colleges''' (BECs) were introduced in 2002 as part of the [[Specialist school|Specialist Schools Programme]] in England. The system enables [[secondary school]]s to specialise in certain fields. Schools that successfully apply to the [[Specialist Schools Trust]] and become Business and Enterprise Colleges receive extra funding for applied business teaching from this joint private sector and government scheme. Business and Enterprise Colleges also act as a local point of reference for other schools and businesses in the area, with an emphasis on promoting enterprise and commercial awareness within the community.

==Schools' Enterprise Education Network==
In his budget speech of March 2006, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]] announced that the government would be funding a network of best practice to support the delivery of Enterprise Education within the UK.  This network (called the Schools' [[Business|Enterprise]] Education Network (SEEN) was based on the expertise within BECs&amp;mdash;56 hubs (one per county) were identified in May 2006. At a launch conference the hub co-ordinators were advised of the local BECs that would act as 'spokes' to support the dissemination to all state-maintained secondary schools.

A '''business suite''' is a set of business software functions enabling the core business and business support processes inside and beyond the boundaries of an organization.

== Overview ==
The key characteristic of a business suite is the delivery of end-to-end [[business processes]] which span organizational boundaries such as business departments and locations. In the last years the focus of the business processes supported by business suites has expanded to integrate business partners such as customers, suppliers and service providers .

Business Suites are generally rooted in the traditional [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems that are based on a common [[data model]] used to storing the data to be shared between departments and their [[business processes]]. Most corporate ERP systems have been enhanced and complemented by additional applications over the years. As a result, the total cost of ownership ([[Total cost of ownership|TCO]]) grows, process integrity across applications is at stake, and the flexibility to consistently change and optimize business processes suffers. The vendors of business suites claim to address these issues.

== Topics ==
The issues with business process visibility, flexibility, efficiency, and integrity in heterogeneous business application environments have recently created 2 basic types of business suites:

* The "cumulative" business suite consists of a set of previously separate applications that are connected at the [[middleware]] or [[database]] level. The absence of a unified data and process model complicates the implementation of end-to-end processes with ensured process integrity for customers. System integrators are addressing this issue at the expense of a business suite owner.
* The "organic" business suite delivers end-to-end business processes designed to run in one offering. Modern organic business suites provide additional openness to integrate with other applications or extend processes to business partners through [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] technologies.

== Business Process Scope ==
A business suite usually encompasses all core business and business support processes of an organization, unlike business applications such as [[treasury management]] or [[Customer relationship management|CRM]]  that have been designed to serve a single [[line of business]].

Since no vendor today offers applications covering all business process requirements of larger organizations, vendors complement their application portfolio through acquisitions or through cooperation with specialized partners.

===Two strategies===
A "coverage through acquisition" strategy is confined to the processes that are entirely under the control of a single organization, while the "coverage through cooperation" approach can also enable and support processes that span the boundaries of multiple organizations like suppliers, customers, banks.

===Foundational processes===
The foundational set of [[business process]]es supported by a business suite includes business support processes to manage financials, build, develop and administer the workforce, run facilities, support the procurement of generic goods and services. Those foundational processes are required to sustain a functional enterprise that complies with all regulatory requirements.

===Value drivers===
The next layer of business processes is sometimes grouped by the main value drivers or differentiators of a company:
* Development, production, sales, and distribution of [[Product (business)|products]]
* Acquisition, operations, and compliance of production [[assets]]
* Management of the production, logistics, and distribution network
* Marketing, sales, production, and service for [[customer]]s
* Cost/performance optimized procurement, production, and operations

===Processes in support of value drivers===
Key processes supporting those value drivers invariably span organizational boundaries and are relevant for multiple [[Line of business|lines of business]]. A typical [[business process]] that connects organizational entities is "order to cash" which can span sales, production, finance, logistics, billing and dispute management and influences important key performance indicators of the involved areas like "[[Free cash flow|free cash-flow]]", "[[customer satisfaction]]", "[[customer profitability]]", "fulfillment cost".

Some business suites offer a layer of deep industry processes - either through industry extensions of the core business suite or through a network of frequently certified 3rd party software providers which adopt compatible or identical process and data models.

===Current status===
Today, no commercial business suite can cover all business process requirements of a large organization. Modern business suites offer an environment in which an organization can develop or modify business processes reusing the supplied standard processes. Some advanced business suites allow the fast composition of new business processes from process fragments or process steps.

Gray later received a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] law school, where he served as Editor-in-Chief of the UNC law review. He graduated in 1968.

==Career==
After graduation, Gray clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]]. In 1968 he joined the firm of [[Wilmer Cutler &amp; Pickering]], and become a partner in 1976. Gray took a leave of absence from the firm in 1981 to serve as legal counsel for Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]]. He also served as Counsel to the Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief, chaired by Vice President Bush. Gray later served as Director of the Office of Transition Counsel for the Bush transition team, and as Counsel to President Bush from 1989 to 1993.  )During this time, Gray became one of the main architects of the 1990 [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] Amendments that suggested market solutions for environmental problems.

He returned to Wilmer Cutler &amp; Pickering in 1993 l, where his practice focused on a range of regulatory matters with an emphasis on environmental issues, including those relating to [[biotechnology]], [[trade]], clean air, and the management of risk. He also served as Chairman of the section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice of the [[American Bar Association]]. Gray also served as co-chairman with former Mjority Leader [[Dick Armey]] of [[FreedomWorks]].

In October 2001 rumors indicated that Gray was considering running for an open [[US Senate]] seat in his native [[North Carolina]], but he passed on the race.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Former [[US Secretary of Labor]] [[Elizabeth Dole]] was elected in November 2002 to replace [[Jesse Helms]], who chose to retire, rather than seek a sixth term.

Gray served on the Bush-Cheney Transition Department of Justice Advisory Committee, and as [[White House Counsel]] to [[US President]] [[George H. W. Bush]]. In 2002, he founded the Committee for Justice, a [[Washington, DC]]-based nonprofit dedicated to screening judicial and [[US Justice Department]] nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.committeeforjustice.org/about|title=The Committee for Justice - Official Site|website=The Committee for Justice - Official Site|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/23/AR2005052301640.html|title=A Moving Force In Fight for Bush's Judicial Nominees|last=Birnbaum|first=Jeffrey H.|date=2005-05-24|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took up the post of [[United States Ambassador to the European Union]] on 17 January 2006, when President [[George W. Bush]] granted him a [[recess appointment]] to the post.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060117-4.html ''Personnel Announcement''] – President George W.

The '''CBS Broadcast Center''' is a television and radio production facility located in [[New York City]]. It is [[CBS]]'s main [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] production center, much as [[CBS Television City]] in [[Los Angeles]] is the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] hub. It is also where the satire show ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'' is recorded.

==Overview==
The nearly block-long facility at 524 West 57th Street, in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] section of [[Manhattan]], serves as the headquarters of [[CBS News]], the [[CBSN]] live streaming news channel and the main broadcast facility for CBS News, [[CBS Sports]], New York City [[Owned-and-operated station|O&amp;O]] flagship station [[WCBS-TV]], and CBS-owned independent station [[WLNY]]. [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] also used the Broadcast Center for then ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'' and other in-studio shows for the network (Both BET and CBS were part of [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]] before being separated by the Viacom/CBS split). [[CBS Television Distribution]]'s nationally syndicated newsmagazine, ''[[Inside Edition]]'', is also taped at the CBS Broadcast Center.

The Broadcast Center is also the production base for the [[CBS Radio News]]. The network's Master Control (aka Central Control) on the first floor also serves as the routing center for other programming distributed by [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] (formerly [[Dial Global]]). The radio network's flagship station, [[WCBS (AM)]], was housed in the Broadcast Center from 2000 (moving from [[CBS Building|Black Rock]], CBS's corporate headquarters at 51 West [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]]) until 2011 when it relocated to 345 Hudson Street in lower Manhattan, billed on-air as "The CBS Hudson Square Broadcast Center."

In addition to the Broadcast Center, CBS has one other major studio in Manhattan — the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] (CBS-TV Studio 50) at 1697 Broadway, the home of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''. The [[General Motors Building (New York)|General Motors Building]] (CBS-TV Studio 58), on [[Fifth Avenue]] and 58th Street, was the home of ''[[The Early Show]]'' until December 31, 2011. ''The Early Show''{{'}}s successor, the second and current incarnation of ''[[CBS This Morning]]'', premiered from newly constructed Studio 57 at the Broadcast Center on January 9, 2012. The ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' moved into Studio 57 from Studio 47 (previously sharing space with the CBS News newsroom) in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A look back at ‘CBS Evening News’ in Studio 47 |url=https://www.newscaststudio.com/2016/12/07/cbs-evening-news-studio-47/ |work=Newscast Studio |date=December 7, 2016 |accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center opened as the CBS Production Center in the late 1950s, when the network's master control, film and videotape facilities, and four studios were located in the [[Grand Central Terminal]] building. Operations moved from Grand Central to the Broadcast Center in stages, ending in late 1964.

From the 1950s to 1970s, another prominent CBS stage in New York was Studio 52 (now the disco-theater [[Studio 54]]) at 254 West [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]], around the corner from Studio 50. CBS also leased the Himan Brown studios at 221 West 26th Street, now [[Chelsea Studios]], for several shows in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

In early 2012, it was announced ''[[The Nate Berkus Show]]'' would not be renewed. After a few months it was announced that [[Anderson Cooper]]'s talk show would move into Studio 42 leaving its home in the [[Time Warner Center]].

Also in 2012, CBS acquired the [[Riverhead, New York|Riverhead]], [[Long Island]]-licensed [[WLNY-TV]] (Channel 55, cable channel 10), setting up a duopoly with WCBS-TV. Following the merger, CBS moved that station's employees to the CBS Broadcast Center, with their former [[Melville, New York|Melville]] facility maintained as the WCBS/WLNY Long Island bureau offices. WLNY currently carries one program from Broadcast Center: a 9pm newscast with WCBS's news personnel from Broadcast Center. ''Live from the Couch'', a morning show airing parallel to ''CBS This Morning'' on WCBS, was broadcast on WLNY from 2012 until early 2014, when it was canceled due to low ratings.

==History==

===CBS takes over the depot===
The building in which the Broadcast Center is located formerly served as a dairy depot for Sheffield Farms. CBS, which had been using studios at [[Grand Central Terminal]] and other theaters throughout Manhattan, purchased the site in 1952 and began using it regularly for TV in 1963. The radio network, with offices at 1 East 53rd Street and studios at 49 East 52nd Street, near the old CBS corporate headquarters at 485 [[Madison Avenue]], moved to the Broadcast Center in July 1964, while the television network's master control moved from Grand Central to the Broadcast Center in late 1964. The company spent $14.5 million to create what was, at the time, "the largest 'self-contained' radio and television production center in the United States and the most modern broadcasting plant of its kind in the world," as the ''New York Tribune'' put it in 1961.&lt;ref name=Montopoli/&gt;

===CBS Broadcast Center and soap operas===
Until January 2000, the Broadcast Center was home to CBS-TV's soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]''. Defunct serials ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Love is a Many Splendored Thing (TV series)|Love is a Many Splendored Thing]]'', and ''[[Where the Heart Is (1969 TV series)|Where the Heart Is]]'' were also produced at the Broadcast Center.

After a 37-year absence, ''[[Guiding Light]]'' returned to the Broadcast Center in September 2005, after 17 years at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] studios, 222 East 44th Street and 20 years at the [[Chelsea Studios|CBS/Himan Brown studios at 221 West 26th Street]]. The show had been produced in Studio 45 at the CBS Broadcast Center from 1965 to 1968 before moving to West 26th Street. ''GL'' used Studios 42 and 45 until its final broadcast on September 18, 2009.

===''"From the ABC Broadcast Center..."''===
In 1996, [[Brillstein-Grey Entertainment]] produced ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'' at the Broadcast Center for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. As a jab at CBS ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s competition), the show's opening credits had a man with a paper version of the [[American Broadcasting Company logos|ABC logo]] on a ladder outside of the Broadcast Center covering over the [[CBS Eye logo]] while the announcer proclaimed "From the ABC Broadcast Center".

== History ==
Originally named the Midwest Center for Labor Research, CLCR was founded in 1982 in order to examine the causes and effects of the sharp decline in manufacturing in the 1970s. The goal of CLCR's early research was to determine whether this rapid [[deindustrialization]] in the United States was an inevitable consequence of globalization and [[Technology|technological development]] or whether it was a trend that could be slowed or reversed by effective policy changes.

After almost two decades of in-depth research, CLCR concluded that 80% of losses in manufacturing could have been averted, avoiding much of the subsequent rise in poverty across manufacturing-dependent communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1389">A '''Certificate of Formula Compliance''' (often abbreviated to COFC) is a document used primarily for Health and Beauty Products in international trade. 

Unlike a [[Certificate of Origin]] (which traditionally states from what country the shipped goods originate, but "originate" in a CO does not mean the country the goods are shipped from, but the country where their goods are actually made.)a COFC is a document that states to the Import Authority that the Products are certified accurate to the Formula that is on record in the Country of Importation. 

Unlike a [[Certificate of Analysis]](a Document used to detail the exact formula of the product being tested) a COFC states that the product in question conforms exactly to the formula of record.

A COFC is a new compliance document that has not been universally adopted as a standard for International Trade.  There is a push to include its use and using it even in a Country that has not formally adopted its use has helped speed the inspection process.  

One of other International Documents used in International trade:

==Explanation==
As business transactions and contractual obligations may cross jurisdictional borders within a nation, as well as international borders, both physically and electronically, [[choice of law]] issues may arise in the event that it is necessary to interpret the terms of a contract or in the event of litigation over a contract dispute. As laws vary between jurisdictions, it is possible that contract terms could be interpreted differently between jurisdictions, or that portions of a contract that are enforceable in one jurisdiction would not be enforceable under the laws of another. The parties may therefore agree in advance to interpret the contract in accord with the laws of a jurisdiction that is identified within their contract.&lt;ref name="col"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodward|first1=William J. Jr.|title=Legal Uncertainty and Aberrant Contracts: The Choice of Law Clause|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Journal|date=2004|volume=89|page=197|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1818&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations a court may find that there are public policy reasons to disregard a choice of law clause, and instead interpret a contract under the laws of the jurisdiction in which a lawsuit is filed. For example, a jurisdiction may find as a matter of public policy, it will apply its own consumer protection laws to a dispute between a consumer and a business even if the contract calls for the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="col"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Homle|first1=Julia|title=Global social media vs local values: Private international law should protect local consumer rights by using the public policy exception?|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|date=2017|volume=33|issue=6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364917302844|accessdate=11 October 2017|doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2017.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Churn and burn''' refers to a tactic used by [[Wal-Mart|large anti-union businesses]] with high turnover in order to bust an already-existent [[labour union|union]] in a given workplace.  "Churning" refers to the management practice of filtering new workers based on their support of unionism.  In a large business with poorly paid, entry-level workers with a high rate of turnover, support for a union can be gradually reduced by making sure during the hiring process that only [[union busting|anti-union workers]] are hired.  Eventually, support drops low enough to "burn" the union through [[NLRB election procedures#Decertification_elections|decertification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chung|first=Andrew|title=Wal-Mart workers hope to show their union the door|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/950705--wal-mart-workers-hope-to-show-their-union-the-door|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sold by [[Princes (company)|Princes Limited]], a British food producer owned by [[Mitsubishi]]. The brand is owned by '''Edible Oils Limited''', a joint venture between [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), an American food processing corporation, and Princes.  The product is produced at a factory in [[Erith]], England.

In October 2006, Cookeen and the other hard vegetable fats manufactured by Edible Oils Limited were reformulated to remove hydrogenated vegetable oils, which contain [[trans fat]], due to health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home baking brands remove hydrogenated vegetable oil|url=http://www.princesgroup.com/news/home-baking-brands-remove-hydrogenated-vegetable-oil/|accessdate=19 November 2013|date=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DVD''' (an abbreviation of "'''digital video disc'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DVD|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dvd?s=t|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''digital versatile disc'''")&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Mechanics'', June 1997, p. 69;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Taylor, ''DVD demystified'', McGraw Hill, 1998, 1st edition, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|storage]] format invented and developed in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using [[DVD player]]s. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than [[compact disc]]s while having the same dimensions.

Prerecorded DVDs are mass-produced using [[Injection molding machine|molding machines]] that physically stamp data onto the DVD. Such discs are a form of DVD-[[read-only memory|ROM]] because data can only be read and not written or erased. Blank recordable DVD discs ([[DVD-R]] and [[DVD+R]]) can be recorded once using a [[Optical disc drive|DVD recorder]] and then function as a DVD-ROM. Rewritable DVDs ([[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], and [[DVD-RAM]]) can be recorded and erased many times.

DVDs are used in [[DVD-Video]] consumer digital video format and in [[DVD-Audio]] consumer digital audio format as well as for authoring DVD discs written in a special [[AVCHD#AVCHD as distribution format|AVCHD]] format to hold [[High-definition video|high definition]] material (often in conjunction with AVCHD format [[camcorder]]s). DVDs containing other types of information may be referred to as DVD data discs.

== Etymology ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' comments that, "In 1995 rival manufacturers of the product initially named digital video disc agreed that, in order to emphasize the flexibility of the format for multimedia applications, the preferred abbreviation DVD would be understood to denote digital versatile disc." The OED also states that in 1995, "The companies said the official name of the format will simply be DVD. Toshiba had been using the name ‘digital video disc’, but that was switched to ‘digital versatile disc’ after computer companies complained that it left out their applications."&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''DVD''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Digital versatile disc" is the explanation provided in a DVD Forum Primer from 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=DVD Primer
|publisher=DVD Forum
|date=September 6, 2000
|url=http://www.dvdforum.org/faq-dvdprimer.htm#1
|accessdate=2013-12-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and in the [[DVD Forum]]'s mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

=== Development ===
[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (tracks not to scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in [[Constant linear velocity#Zoned Constant Linear Velocity|ZCLV]], [[Constant Angular Acceleration|CAA]] or [[constant angular velocity|CAV]] modes, but most work in [[Constant linear velocity]] (CLV) mode.]]

There were several formats developed for recording video on optical discs before the DVD. Optical recording technology was invented by [[David Paul Gregg]] and [[James Russell (inventor)|James Russell]] in 1958 and first patented in 1961. A consumer optical disc data format known as [[LaserDisc]] was developed in the [[United States of America|United States]], and first came to market in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 1978. It used much larger discs than the later formats. Due to the high cost of players and discs, consumer adoption of LaserDisc was very low in both North America and Europe, and was not widely used anywhere outside Japan and the more affluent areas of [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Hong-Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Taiwan]].

[[CD Video]] released in 1987 used analog video encoding on optical discs matching the established standard {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} size of audio CDs. [[Video CD]] (VCD) became one of the first formats for distributing ''digitally'' encoded films in this format, in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Super Video Compact Disc, A Technical Explanation (PDF) | year = 1998 | publisher = [[Philips]] System Standards and Licensing | page = 2 | url = http://www.ip.philips.com/view_attachment/2450/sl00812.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-02-13 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, two new optical disc storage formats were being developed. One was the Multimedia [[Compact Disc]] (MMCD), backed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], and the other was the Super Density (SD) disc, supported by [[Toshiba]], [[Time Warner]], [[Matsushita Electric]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[JVC]]. By the time of the press launches for both formats in January 1995, the MMCD nomenclature had been dropped, and Philips and Sony were referring to their format as Digital Video Disc (DVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=WCES: The Calm Before the Storm |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGen6"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=DVD Plagued by Double Standards |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives from the SD camp asked [[IBM]] for advice on the file system to use for their disc, and sought support for their format for storing computer data. [[Alan E. Bell]], a researcher from IBM's [[Almaden Research Center]], got that request, and also learned of the MMCD development project. Wary of being caught in a repeat of the costly [[videotape format war]] between [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] in the 1980s, he convened a group of computer industry experts, including representatives from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Microsoft]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Dell]], and many others. This group was referred to as the Technical Working Group, or TWG.

On August 14, 1995, an [[ad hoc]] group formed from five computer companies (IBM, Apple, [[Compaq]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and Microsoft) issued a press release stating that they would only accept a single format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Electronic Giants Battle On|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TWG voted to boycott both formats unless the two camps agreed on a single, converged standard. They recruited [[Lou Gerstner]], president of IBM, to pressure the executives of the warring factions. In one significant compromise, the MMCD and SD groups agreed to adopt proposal SD 9, which specified that both layers of the dual-layered disc be read from the same side—instead of proposal SD 10, which would have created a two-sided disc that users would have to turn over.&lt;ref name="Soon"&gt;{{cite journal |page=189 |journal = [[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]] |date=March 1, 1996|volume=16|issue= 3|title=DVD: coming soon to your PC?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the DVD specification provided a storage capacity of 4.7 GB for a single-layered, single-sided disc and 8.5 GB for a dual-layered, single-sided disc.&lt;ref name="Soon"/&gt; The DVD specification ended up similar to Toshiba and Matsushita's Super Density Disc, except for the dual-layer option (MMCD was single-sided and optionally dual-layer, whereas SD was two half-thickness, single-layer discs which were pressed separately and then glued together to form a double-sided disc&lt;ref name="NGen6"/&gt;) and [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFMPlus]] modulation designed by [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]].

Philips and Sony decided that it was in their best interests to end the format war, and agreed to unify with companies backing the Super Density Disc to release a single format, with technologies from both. After other compromises between MMCD and SD, the computer companies through TWG won the day, and a single format was agreed upon. The TWG also collaborated with the [[Optical Storage Technology Association]] (OSTA) on the use of their implementation of the ISO-13346 file system (known as [[Universal Disk Format]]) for use on the new DVDs.

=== Adoption ===
[[Movie]] and [[home video|home entertainment]] distributors adopted the DVD format to replace the ubiquitous [[VHS]] tape as the primary consumer digital video distribution format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3335984/DVD-kills-the-video-show-as-digital-age-takes-over.html|title=DVD kills the video show as digital age takes over|first=Robert|last=Uhlig|date=22 November 2004|accessdate=28 October 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They embraced DVD as it produced higher quality video and sound, provided superior data lifespan, and could be interactive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Interactivity on [[LaserDisc]]s had proven desirable to consumers, especially collectors. When LaserDisc prices dropped from approximately $100 per disc to $20 per disc at retail, this luxury feature became available for mass consumption. Simultaneously, the movie studios decided to change their home entertainment release model from a rental model to a for purchase model,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} and large numbers of DVDs were sold.

At the same time, a demand for interactive design talent and services was created. Movies in the past had uniquely designed title sequences. Suddenly every movie being released required information architecture and interactive design components that matched the film's tone and were at the quality level that Hollywood demanded for its product.

DVD as a format had two qualities at the time that were not available in any other interactive medium: enough capacity and speed to provide high quality, full motion video and sound, and low cost delivery mechanism provided by consumer products retailers. Retailers would quickly move to sell their players for under $200, and eventually for under $50 at retail. In addition, the medium itself was small enough and light enough to mail using general first class postage. Almost overnight, this created a new business opportunity and model for business innovators to re-invent the home entertainment distribution model. It also gave companies an inexpensive way to provide business and product information on full motion video through direct mail.

Immediately following the formal adoption of a unified standard for DVD, two of the four leading [[video game console]] companies ([[Sega]] and [[The 3DO Company]]) said they already had plans to design a gaming console with DVDs as the source medium.&lt;ref name="NGen18"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=DVD Game Consoles? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1996|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sony, despite being one of the developers of the DVD format and eventually the first company to actually release a DVD-based console, stated at the time that they had no plans to use DVD in their gaming systems.&lt;ref name="NGen18"/&gt;) Game consoles such as the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[Xbox 360]] use DVDs as their source medium for games and other software. Contemporary games for Windows were also distributed on DVD.

==Specifications==
The DVD specifications created and updated by the [[DVD Forum]] are published as so-called ''DVD Books'' (e.g. DVD-ROM Book, DVD-Audio Book, DVD-Video Book, DVD-R Book, DVD-RW Book, DVD-RAM Book, [[DVD-AR]] Book, [[DVD-VR]] Book, etc.).&lt;ref name="dvd-book"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_bconst.html|title=DVD FLLC - DVD Format Book|website=Dvdfllc.co.jp|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvd-books"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_histry.html|title=DVD FLLC - DVD Format Book|website=Dvdfllc.co.jp|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvd-books-overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/DVD/General/Books.html|title=BOOKS OVERVIEW|website=Mpeg.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specifications for mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of DVD optical discs can be downloaded as freely available standards from the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] website.&lt;ref name="iso-free"&gt;ISO [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html ISO Freely Available Standards], Retrieved on 2009-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; There are also equivalent [[European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (Ecma) standards for some of these specifications, such as Ecma-267 for DVD-ROMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-267.htm|title=Standard ECMA-267|website=Ecma-international.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[DVD+RW Alliance]] publishes competing recordable DVD specifications such as DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW or [[DVD+RW DL]].

== DVD recordable and rewritable ==
{{Main|DVD recordable}}
[[File:Sony-Internal-PC-DVD-Drive-Opened.jpg|thumb|right|A DVD burner drive for a PC]]
[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] initially developed recordable DVD media from the need to store data for backup and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=James|title=The recordable DVD clinic|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/15/the_recordable_dvd_clinic/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=15 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DVD recordables are now also used for consumer audio and video recording. Three formats were developed: [[DVD-R]]/[[DVD-RW|RW]], [[DVD+R]]/[[DVD+RW|RW]] (plus), and [[DVD-RAM]]. DVD-R is available in two formats, General (650&amp;nbsp;nm) and Authoring (635&amp;nbsp;nm), where Authoring discs may be recorded with [[Content Scramble System|CSS]] encrypted video content but General discs may not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taperesources.com/dvd_media.html#article2 |title=DVD Media / DVD-R Media |publisher=Tape Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727112708/http://www.taperesources.com/dvd_media.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most DVD writers can nowadays write the DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW formats (usually denoted by "DVD±RW" or the existence of both the [[DVD Forum]] logo and the DVD+RW Alliance logo), the "plus" and the "dash" formats use different writing specifications. Most DVD readers and players play both kinds of discs, though older models can have trouble with the "plus" variants.

Some first generation [[DVD player]]s would cause damage to DVD±R/RW/DL when attempting to read them.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The form of the spiral groove that makes up the structure of a recordable DVD encodes unalterable identification data known as [[Media Identification Code]] (MID). The MID contains data such as the manufacturer and model, byte capacity, allowed data rates (also known as speed), etc..{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Dual-layer recording ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[DVD-DL]] --&gt;
[[File:Sony DVD+RW.jpg|thumb|Sony Rewritable DVD]]
Dual-layer recording (sometimes also known as double-layer recording) allows [[DVD-R]] and [[DVD+R]] discs to store significantly more data—up to 8.5 [[gigabyte]]s per disc, compared with 4.7 gigabytes for single-layer discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DVDs|url=http://www.ncte.ie/documents/advicesheets/06DVDNov08.pdf|publisher=PDST Technology in Education|accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with this, DVD-DLs have slower write speeds as compared to ordinary DVDs. When played, a slight transition can sometimes be seen in the playback when the player changes layers. [[DVD-R DL]] was developed for the [[DVD Forum]] by [[Pioneer Corporation]]; [[DVD+R DL]] was developed for the DVD+RW Alliance by [[Mitsubishi Kagaku Media]] (MKM) and [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="Dual-layer-BurnWorld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burnworld.com/howto/articles/intro-to-dual-layer.htm|title=Understanding Dual Layer DVD Recording |publisher=BurnWorld.com |last=DeMoulin |first=Robert |accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dual-layer disc differs from its single layered counterpart by employing a second physical layer within the disc itself. The drive with dual-layer capability accesses the second layer by shining the laser through the first semitransparent layer. In some DVD players, the layer change can exhibit a noticeable pause, up to several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/cgi-bin/shootout.cgi?function=search&amp;articles=all&amp;type=&amp;manufacturer=0&amp;maxprice=0&amp;deInt=0&amp;mpeg=0#SamsungBD-P1000%20Blu-ray/DVD%20Player%20(HDMI) |title=DVD players benchmark |publisher=hometheaterhifi.com |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313232626/http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/cgi-bin/shootout.cgi?function=search&amp;articles=all&amp;type=&amp;manufacturer=0&amp;maxprice=0&amp;deInt=0&amp;mpeg=0 |archivedate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused some viewers to worry that their dual-layer discs were damaged or defective, with the end result that studios began listing a standard message explaining the dual-layer pausing effect on all dual-layer disc packaging.

DVD recordable discs supporting this technology are backward-compatible with some existing DVD players and DVD-ROM drives.&lt;ref name="Dual-layer-BurnWorld" /&gt; Many current [[DVD recorder]]s support dual-layer technology, and the price is now comparable to that of single-layer drives, although the blank media remain more expensive. The recording speeds reached by dual-layer media are still well below those of single-layer media.

Dual layer DVDs are recorded using ''[[Opposite Track Path]]'' (OTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=22&amp;section=10&amp;tasks=true|title=DVD Studio Pro 4 User Manual|website=documentation.apple.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DVD-ROM discs mastered for computer use are produced with track 0 starting at the inside diameter (as is the case with a single layer).  Track 1 then starts at the outside diameter. DVD video discs are mastered slightly differently.  The video is divided between the layers such that layer 1 can be made to start at the same diameter that layer 0 finishes.  This speeds up the transition as the layer changes because although the laser does have to refocus on layer 1, it does not have to skip across the disc to find it.

== Capacity ==
The basic types of DVD (12&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, single-sided or homogeneous double-sided) are referred to by a rough approximation of their capacity in gigabytes. In draft versions of the specification, DVD-5 indeed held five gigabytes, but some parameters were changed later on as explained above, so the capacity decreased. Other [[DVD formats|formats]], those with 8&amp;nbsp;cm diameter and hybrid variants, acquired similar numeric names with even larger deviation.

The 12&amp;nbsp;cm type is a standard DVD, and the 8&amp;nbsp;cm variety is known as a [[MiniDVD]]. These are the same sizes as a standard CD and a [[mini CD|mini-CD]], respectively. The capacity by surface area (MiB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) varies from 6.92 MiB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the DVD-1 to 18.0 MB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the DVD-18.{{clarify|date=May 2018|reason=is this actually MiB for DVD-18?}}

Each DVD sector contains 2,418 bytes of data, 2,048 bytes of which are user data. There is a small difference in storage space between ''+'' and ''-'' (hyphen) formats:

== DVD drives and players ==
{{See also|Optical disc drive|DVD player}}
DVD drives are devices that can read DVD discs on a computer. [[DVD player]]s are a particular type of devices that do not require a computer to work, and can read [[DVD-Video]] and [[DVD-Audio]] discs.

=== Laser and optics ===
[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of various optical storage media&lt;!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (⌀) and wavelength (λ). --&gt;]]

All three common optical disc media ([[Compact disc]], DVD, and [[Blu-ray]]) use light from [[laser diode]]s, for its spectral purity and ability to be focused precisely.  DVD uses light of 650&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength (red), as opposed to 780&amp;nbsp;nm ([[far-red]], commonly called [[infrared]]) for CD. This shorter wavelength allows a smaller pit on the media surface compared to CDs (0.74&amp;nbsp;µm for DVD versus 1.6&amp;nbsp;µm for CD), accounting in part for DVD's increased storage capacity.

In comparison, [[Blu-ray Disc]], the successor to the DVD format, uses a wavelength of
405&amp;nbsp;nm (violet), and one dual-layer disc has a 50&amp;nbsp;GB storage capacity.

=== Transfer rates ===
[[File:Dismdvd.jpg|thumb|right|Internal mechanism of a DVD-ROM Drive. See text for details.]]

Read and write speeds for the first DVD drives and players were 1,385&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]/s (1,353&amp;nbsp;[[kibibyte|KiB]]/s); this speed is usually called "1×". More recent models, at 18× or 20×, have 18 or 20 times that speed. Note that for CD drives, 1× means 153.6&amp;nbsp;kB/s (150&amp;nbsp;KiB/s), about one-ninth as swift.&lt;ref name="DVD Demystified" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osta.org/technology/dvdqa/dvdqa4.htm |title=Understanding DVD -Recording Speed |publisher=Osta.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DVD-Video ==
{{Main|DVD-Video}}

DVD-Video is a standard for distributing video/audio content on DVD media. The format went on sale in Japan in 1995, in the United States, Canada, Central America, and Indonesia in 1997, and in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa in 1998. DVD-Video became the dominant form of home video distribution in Japan when it first went on sale in 1995, but it shared the market for home video distribution in the United States until June 15, 2003, when weekly DVD-Video in the United States rentals began outnumbering weekly VHS cassette rentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anna |last=Bakalis |title=It's unreel: DVD rentals overtake videocassettes |work=[[Washington Times]] |date=2003-06-20 |url=http://washingtontimes.com/business/20030620-113258-1104r.htm|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DVD-Video is still the dominant form of home video distribution worldwide except for in Japan where it was surpassed by [[Blu-ray Disc]] when Blu-ray first went on sale in Japan on March 31, 2006.

=== Security ===
{{Main|Content Scramble System}}
The Content Scramble System (CSS) is a [[digital rights management]] (DRM) and [[encryption]] system employed on almost all commercially produced DVD-video discs. CSS utilizes a [[wikt:proprietary|proprietary]] [[40-bit encryption|40-bit]] [[stream cipher]] algorithm. The system was introduced around 1996 and was first compromised in 1999.

The purpose of CSS is twofold:
# CSS prevents byte-for-byte copies of an [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] (digital video) stream from being playable since such copies do not include the keys that are hidden on the lead-in area of the restricted DVD.
# CSS provides a reason for manufacturers to make their devices compliant with an industry-controlled standard, since CSS scrambled discs cannot in principle be played on noncompliant devices; anyone wishing to build compliant devices must obtain a license, which contains the requirement that the rest of the DRM system ([[DVD region code|region codes]], [[Macrovision]], and [[user operation prohibition]]) be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvd-copy.com/reference/IEEE-doc-copyproc.pdf IEEE - Copy Protection for DVD Video p.2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318151452/http://www.dvd-copy.com/reference/IEEE-doc-copyproc.pdf |date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most CSS-decrypting software is used to play DVD videos, other pieces of software (such as [[DVD Decrypter]], [[AnyDVD]], [[DVD43]], Smartripper, and [[DVD Shrink]]) can copy a DVD to a hard drive and remove [[Macrovision]], CSS encryption, [[DVD region code|region codes]] and [[user operation prohibition]].

=== Consumer restrictions ===
The rise of [[filesharing]] has prompted many copyright holders to display notices on DVD [[Optical disc packaging|packaging]] or displayed on screen when the content is played that warn consumers of the illegality of certain uses of the DVD. It is commonplace to include a 90-second advertisement warning that most forms of copying the contents are illegal. Many DVDs prevent skipping past or fast-forwarding through this warning.

&lt;!--
Add text about...
... the DMCA, CSS encryption, and how making backups of one's own purchased video DVDs is illegal because one would be required to violate the DMCA by cracking the CSS encryption on the DVD;
... how this has impacted free DVD playback software on free computer OSes such as Linux (see article on DeCSS);
... consumer protest of the above (by printing CSS cracking software code on t-shirts, for example)
--&gt;
Arrangements for renting and lending differ by geography. In the U.S., the right to re-sell, rent, or lend out bought DVDs is protected by the [[first-sale doctrine]] under the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. In Europe, rental and lending rights are more limited, under a 1992 European Directive that gives copyright holders broader powers to restrict the commercial renting and public lending of DVD copies of their work. &lt;!-- Add note about the Librarian of Congress's three-year exemption proclamations, and how DVDs have been at the

== DVD-Audio ==
{{Main|DVD-Audio}}

DVD-Audio is a format for delivering high fidelity audio content on a DVD. It offers many channel configuration options (from [[monaural|mono]] to [[5.1 surround sound]]) at various sampling frequencies (up to 24-bits/192&amp;nbsp;kHz versus [[Red Book (CD standard)|CDDA]]'s 16-bits/44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz). Compared with the CD format, the much higher-capacity DVD format enables the inclusion of considerably more music (with respect to total running time and quantity of songs) or far higher audio quality (reflected by higher [[sampling rate]]s, greater sample resolution and additional channels for [[spatial sound]] reproduction).

DVD-Audio briefly formed a niche market, probably due to the very sort of format war with rival standard [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] that [[DVD-Video]] avoided.

=== Security ===
{{Main|Content Protection for Recordable Media}}

DVD-Audio discs employ a [[Digital rights management|DRM]] mechanism, called [[Content Protection for Prerecorded Media]] (CPPM), developed by the 4C group (IBM, Intel, Matsushita, and Toshiba).

Although CPPM was supposed to be much harder to crack than a DVD-Video [[Content Scramble System|CSS]], it too was eventually cracked, in 2007, with the release of the ''dvdcpxm'' tool. The subsequent release of the libdvdcpxm library (based on dvdcpxm) allowed for the development of open source DVD-Audio players and ripping software. As a result, making 1:1 copies of DVD-Audio discs is now possible with relative ease, much like DVD-Video discs.

==Successors and decline==
{{update|date=February 2018}}

In 2006, two new formats called [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] were released as the successor to DVD. HD DVD competed unsuccessfully with Blu-ray Disc in the [[format war]] [[High definition optical disc format war|of 2006–2008]]. A dual layer HD DVD can store up to 30 GB and a dual layer Blu-ray disc can hold up to 50 GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Blu-ray Disc? |publisher=Sony |url=http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;identifier=S_BrandShowcase_Blu-ray|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DVD FAQ: 3.13 – What about the new HD formats? |url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.13 |accessdate=2008-11-25 |date=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, unlike previous format changes, e.g., vinyl to Compact Disc or VHS videotape to DVD, there is no immediate indication that production of the standard DVD will gradually wind down, as they still dominate, with around 75% of video sales and approximately one billion DVD player sales worldwide {{as of|2011|April|3|lc=y}}. In fact, experts claim that the DVD will remain the dominant medium for at least another five years as Blu-ray technology is still in its introductory phase, write and read speeds being poor and necessary hardware being expensive and not readily available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/20/26720.php |title=High-Definition Sales Far Behind Standard DVD's First Two Years |publisher=Movieweb.com |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914030503/http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/20/26720.php |archivedate=2008-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blu-ray takes 25% Market share:|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/MarketShare/index.php |accessdate=2011-06-28 |date=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers initially were also slow to adopt Blu-ray due to the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martorana |first=Robert |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/171207-slow-blu-ray-adoption-a-threat-to-hollywood-s-bottom-line |title=Slow Blu-ray Adoption: A Threat to Hollywood's Bottom Line? |publisher=Seeking Alpha |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, 85% of stores were selling Blu-ray Discs. A high-definition television and appropriate connection cables are also required to take advantage of Blu-ray disc. Some analysts suggest that the biggest obstacle to replacing DVD is due to its installed base; a large majority of consumers are satisfied with DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_16/b3879008_mz001.htm |title=Gates And Ballmer On "Making The Transition" |work=BusinessWeek |date=2004-04-19 |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826072638/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_16/b3879008_mz001.htm |archivedate=2009-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD succeeded because it offered a compelling alternative to VHS. In addition, the uniform media size let manufacturers make Blu-ray players and now defunct format HD DVD players [[backward-compatible]], so they can play older DVDs. This stands in contrast to the change from vinyl to CD, and from tape to DVD, which involved a complete change in physical medium. {{As of|2018}} it is still commonplace for studios to issue major releases in "combo pack" format, including both a DVD and a Blu-ray disc (as well as, a digital copy). Also, some multi-disc sets use Blu-ray for the main feature, but DVDs for supplementary features (examples of this include the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' "Ultimate Edition" collections, the 2009 re-release of the 1967 ''[[The Prisoner]]'' TV series, and a 2007 collection related to ''[[Blade Runner]]''). Another reason cited (July 2011) for the slower transition to Blu-ray from DVD is the necessity of and confusion over "firmware updates" and needing an internet connection to perform updates.

This situation is similar to the changeover from [[78 rpm]] shellac recordings to 45 rpm and 33⅓ rpm vinyl recordings. Because the new and old mediums were virtually the same (a disc on a turntable, played by a needle), [[phonograph]] player manufacturers continued to include the ability to play 78s for decades after the format was discontinued.

Manufacturers continue to release standard DVD titles {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, and the format remains the preferred one for the release of older television programs and films. Some programs, such as ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' must be re-scanned to produce a high definition version from the original film recordings. (Certain special effects were also updated to appear better in high-definition.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=24344 |title=Kirk/Spock STAR TREK To Get All-New HD Spaceships |website=Aintitcool.com |accessdate=2009-08-22}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DVDs are also facing competition from [[video on demand]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/are-dvds-becoming-obsolete.htm|title=Are DVDs becoming obsolete?|date=1 November 2014|website=Electronics.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/forum/movie?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx2E577OZX17PPI&amp;cdThread=TxQZAH1GWRJW8V|title=Amazon.com: Customer Discussions: When will DVDs be obsolete?|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/dvd-sales-decline-study/|title=Is the DVD Becoming Obsolete?|publisher=ScreenCrush|last=Romano|first=Nick|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/DVD-Going-Way-VHS-2016-43349.html|title=DVD Going The Way Of VHS In 2016  - CINEMABLEND|date=6 June 2014|website=Cinemablend.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing numbers of homes having high speed Internet connections, many people now have the option to either rent or buy video from an online service, and view it by streaming it directly from that service's servers, meaning that the customer need not have any form of permanent storage media for video at all. PWC predicts that online streaming revenue will overtake physical media sales revenue by 2018. Globally, the total combined revenue from over-the-top (OTT)/streaming services and broadcasters' video on demand (VOD) services is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.9% to overtake physical home video revenue (the sale and rental of DVDs and Blu-ray discs) in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/segment-insights/filmed-entertainment.jhtml|title=Filmed entertainment segment insights from the Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook: PwC|date=10 December 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=28 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210211334/http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/segment-insights/filmed-entertainment.jhtml|archivedate=10 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017, digital streaming services had overtaken the sales of DVDs and Blu-rays for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/05/film-and-tv-streaming-and-downloads-overtake-dvd-sales-for-first-time-netflix-amazon-uk|title=Film and TV streaming and downloads overtake DVD sales for first time|first=Mark|last=Sweney|date=5 January 2017|accessdate=28 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Longevity ==
DVD longevity is measured by how long the data remains readable from the disc, assuming compatible devices exist that can read it: that is, how long the disc can be stored until data is lost. Numerous factors affect longevity: composition and quality of the media (recording and substrate layers), humidity and light storage conditions, the quality of the initial recording (which is sometimes a matter of mutual compatibility of media and recorder), etc.&lt;ref name="NIST-final"/&gt; According to [[NIST]], "[a] temperature of 64.4&amp;nbsp;°F (18&amp;nbsp;°C) and 40% RH [Relative Humidity] would be considered suitable for long-term storage. A lower temperature and RH is recommended for extended-term storage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Wo|last=Chang |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.05/docs/disccare.html |title=NIST Digital Media Group: docs/disccare |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Optical Storage Technology Association]] (OSTA), "Manufacturers claim lifespans ranging from 30 to 100 years for DVD, DVD-R and DVD+R discs and up to 30 years for DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osta.org/technology/dvdqa/dvdqa11.htm|title=Understanding DVD - Disc Longevity|website=Osta.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a NIST/[[Library of Congress|LoC]] research project conducted in 2005–2007 using [[accelerated life testing]], "There were fifteen DVD products tested, including five DVD-R, five DVD+R, two DVD-RW and three DVD+RW types. There were ninety samples tested for each product. [...] Overall, seven of the products tested had estimated life expectancies in ambient conditions of more than 45 years. Four products had estimated life expectancies of 30–45 years in ambient storage conditions. Two products had an estimated life expectancy of 15–30 years and two products had estimated life expectancies of less than 15 years when stored in ambient conditions." The life expectancies for 95% survival estimated in this project by type of product are tabulated below:&lt;ref name="NIST-final"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rt/NIST_LC_OpticalDiscLongevity.pdf Final Report: NIST/Library of Congress (LC) Optical Disc Longevity Study], Loc.gov, September 2007 (table derived from figure 7)&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|DVD lifetime|date=December 2013}}

'''Datawatch Corporation''' is an American software company that creates and sells self-service data preparation [[solution]]s. The entire platform includes Datawatch Monarch Complete, Monarch Server and Monarch Swarm.

==History==
Datawatch began as a [[Business Intelligence]] (BI) tool, which is defined as the gathering, analysis and dissemination of information in the proper format for accurate and timely decision making.

1985-1991:
Datawatch established as a private company.

In the beginning, Datawatch designed, manufactured, and marketed computer workstations and peripherals that conformed to the U.S. government’s TEMPEST security standard for processing classified information. This security standard was designed to prevent unauthorized access to information in computing devices by limiting their electrical emissions.

1991:
Datawatch acquired Personics Corporation, a producer of network data access and translation software and video enhancement software. Personics’ principal product was [[Monarch (software)|Monarch]], a software program that provided data access, translation, and reporting capabilities to users of networked PCs.

1992:
Datawatch went public with an IPO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=DWCH Bloomberg Business Week, Datawatch Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;

2013:
Datawatch acquired [[Panopticon Software]] AB, a Swedish software company whose primary product was Panopticon Designer, a visual data discovery application that can create visualizations of streaming real-time data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterstechnology.com/inside-market-data/news/2275513/datawatch-buys-visual-analysis-provider-panopticon-for-usd314-million Datawatch Acquires Panopticon, Waters Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

2016:
Datawatch was going back to focus on their principle Monarch software to address the need of self-service data preparation market for data visualization tool and release the new Monarch Data Prep Studio in the 13.0 release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-17J5Y5/0x0x884177/603A234E-AC51-4D72-821D-C9C578E4465C/IR_Presentation_Apr_3_Update.pdf] Datawatch Refocused, Datawatch Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

2018:
Datawatch acquired [[Angoss Software Corporation|Angoss]], a [[Canada]]-based provider of [[predictive analytics]] software and services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/01/30/1314619/0/en/Datawatch-Acquires-Data-Science-Platform-Leader-Angoss-Software.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology Overview==
Datawatch's technology relies on in-memory OLAP ([[Online Analytical Processing]]) cubes, which are displayed through a series of visualizations including treemaps. This allows the user to load data, select variables and hierarchical structures, and navigate through the resultant visualization, filtering, zooming and drilling (sometimes called slicing and dicing), to identify outliers, correlations and trends.

Its streaming [[OLAP]] implementation takes an in-memory OLAP cube and allows data to be streamed through it. This combination makes the company's products attractive to industry verticals that require live streaming data, such as financial market data, utility grid monitoring and telecommunications network traffic analysis. This is very different than the vast majority of [[OLAP]] implementations in which cubes are rebuilt periodically for new batches of data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-06-07/be-your-own-rocket-scientistbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice Be Your Own Rocket Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;

This support for streaming data with its products has allowed financial institutions such as [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Citigroup]], [[Citadel]] , and [[BlackRock]] to implement the Datawatch software within their real-time trading and risk applications. [[Euromoney]] has stated that it provides the trader community with a way of quickly digesting information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.wallstreetandtech.com/regulatory-compliance/datawatch-upgrade-to-ease-fraud-investig/220900743 Wall Street &amp; Technology, "Datawatch Upgrade to Ease Fraud Investigations, Expert Says"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Datawatch offers three main products: Datawatch Designer, Datawatch Server and [[Monarch (software)|Monarch software]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/datawatch-announces-release-fully-integrated-135500236.html Yahoo Finance, "Datawatch Announces Release Of Fully Integrated Datawatch Desktop"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint Ventures==

In December, 2013 Xerox Canada and Datawatch partner to unlock value of data for retail chains, other large enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/xerox-canada-datawatch-partner-unlock-130000776.html Yahoo Finance, "Xerox Canada and Datawatch partner to unlock value of data for retail chains, other large enterprise", 12/3/2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 2014 Datawatch announced a Global Strategic Alliance with MarkLogic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/datawatch-marklogic-announce-global-strategic-135500997.html Yahoo Finance, "Datawatch and MarkLogic Announce a Global Strategic Alliance to Deliver Next Generation Visualization Solutions for Big Data Environments", 2/19/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 2014 Datawatch announced a partnership with Monarch Experts, the leading specialist consultancy in London. Monarch Experts will help existing Datawatch customers transition to the new Visual Data Discovery platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/datawatch-and-monarch-experts-announce-partnership-246522291.html PR Newswire, "Datawatch and Monarch Experts Announce Partnership ", 2/21/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 2014 Datawatch named Carahsoft Technology as its Master Government Aggregator.

In [[accounting]], an '''extended cost''' is the [[unit cost]] multiplied by the number of those items that were purchased.

For example, four apples purchased at a unit cost of $1 have an extended cost of $4 (=$1 × 4 apples).

The way it might work is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2013/&gt;

It was developed by [[Francine Shapiro]] in the 1990s and has been controversial, with some critics calling it [[pseudoscience]] and there have been ongoing concerns over the quality of evidence,&lt;ref name="Lee CW, Cuijpers P 2013 231–239"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bissan2013/&gt; contradictory findings,&lt;ref name=Devilly2002/&gt; significant rates of [[Experimenter's bias|researcher bias]],&lt;ref name=Bissan2013/&gt; and dropout rates in studies.&lt;ref name=Bissan2013/&gt;

== Medical uses ==
The person being treated is asked to recall distressing images while generating one of several types of [[bilateral stimulation|bilateral sensory input]], such as side-to-side [[eye]] movements or hand tapping.&lt;ref name=feske/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schnyder2015/&gt;  The 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline says that "Like [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) with a trauma focus, EMDR aims to reduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive beliefs related to the traumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve (a) detailed descriptions of the event, (b) direct challenging of beliefs, (c) extended exposure, or (d) homework".&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt;

===Evidence===
Two [[meta-analyses]] from 2013 found that EMDR therapy is better than no treatment and similar in efficacy to CBT in chronic PTSD.&lt;ref name=Bissan2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bisson J, Roberts NP, Andrew M, Cooper R, Lewis C |title=Psychological therapies for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2013 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003388.pub4 |pmid=24338345 |volume=12 |pages=CD003388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watt2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watts BV, Schnurr PP, Mayo L, Young-Xu Y, Weeks WB, Friedman MJ |year=2013 |title=Meta-analysis of the efficacy of treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=74 |pages=e541-550 |doi=10.4088/JCP.12r08225 |pmid=23842024 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to "very low" quality of evidence, significant rates of [[Experimenter's bias|researcher bias]], and some participant drop outs, the meta-analysts cautioned against interpreting the results of the studies which were analyzed.&lt;ref name=Bissan2013/&gt;  The other 2013 meta-analysis concluded, 'the eye movements do have an additional value in EMDR treatments'.&lt;ref name="apatraumadivision.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee CW, Cuijpers P 2013 231–239"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee CW, Cuijpers P |year=2013 |title=A meta-analysis of the contribution of eye movements in processing emotional memories |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=231–239 |doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.11.001 |pmid=23266601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authors of this analysis addressed several limitations with this study by stating, "This study has several limitations. The most important one is that the quality of included studies was not optimal. This may have distorted the outcomes of the studies and our meta-analysis. Apart from ensuring adequate checks on treatment quality, there were other serious methodological problems with the studies in the therapy context".&lt;ref name="Lee CW, Cuijpers P 2013 231–239"/&gt;

A 2010 meta-analysis concluded that all "''[[bona fide]]''" treatments were equally effective, but there was some debate regarding the study's selection of which treatments were "''bona fide''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ehlers, A.|author2=Bisson, J.|author3=Clark, D.|author4=Creamer, M.|author5=Pilling, S.|author6=Richards, D.|author7=Schnurr, P.|author8=Turner, S.|author9=Yule, W. |year=2010 |title=Do all psychological treatments really work the same in posttraumatic stress disorder? |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=269–276 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.12.001 |pmc=2852651 |pmid=20051310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review of rape treatment outcomes concluded that EMDR had some efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vickerman, K. A. |author2=Margolin, G. |year=2009 |title=Rape treatment outcome research: Empirical findings and state of the literature |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=431–448 |pmc=2773678 |pmid=19442425 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another 2009 review concluded EMDR to be of similar efficacy to other exposure therapies and more effective than SSRIs, problem-centered therapy, or 'treatment as usual.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cloitre M |title=Effective psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder: a review and critique |journal=CNS Spectrums |volume=14 |issue=1 Suppl 1 |pages=32–43 |date=January 2009  |pmid=19169192 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two meta-analysis in 2006 found EMDR to be at least equivalent in effect size to specific exposure therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee CW, Cuijpers P |year=2013 |title=A meta-analysis of the contribution of eye movements in processing emotional memories |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=231–239 |doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.11.001 |pmid=23266601  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seidler GH, Wagner FE |year=2006 |title=Comparing the efficacy of EMDR and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of PTSD: a meta-analytic study |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1515–1522 |doi=10.1017/S0033291706007963 |pmid=16740177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 and a 2006 meta-analysis each suggested that traditional exposure therapy and EMDR have equivalent effects immediately after treatment and at follow-up.&lt;ref name="pmid15677582"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bradley, R. |author2=Greene, J. |author3=Russ, E. |author4=Dutra, L. |author5=Westen, D. |year=2005 |title=A multidimensional meta-analysis of psychotherapy for PTSD |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=2 |pages=214–227 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.2.214 |pmid=15677582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seidler06"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seidler|first1=GH|last2=Wagner|first2=FE|title=Comparing the efficacy of EMDR and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of PTSD: a meta-analytic study.|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=November 2006|volume=36|issue=11|pages=1515–22|pmid=16740177|doi=10.1017/s0033291706007963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 meta-analysis concluded that EMDR is not as effective, or as long lasting, as traditional [[exposure therapy]].&lt;ref name=Devilly2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Devilly GJ  |title=Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing: a chronology of its development and scientific standing |journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice |date=Fall–Winter 2002 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=132|url=http://devilly.org/Publications/EMDR-review.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EMDR is included in a 2009 practice guideline for helping children who have experienced trauma.&lt;ref name="Foa"&gt;{{cite book |author=Foa B; Keane TM; Friedman MJ Cohen JA (eds.) |year=2009 |title=Effective treatments for PTSD: practice guidelines from the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMDR is often cited as a component in the treatment of [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="Adler-Tapia"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Adler-Tapia R |author2=Settle C |title=EMDR and The Art of Psychotherapy With Children |location=New York |publisher=Springer Publishing Co. |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8261-1117-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7619-2921-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Scott CV |author2=Briere J |title=Principles of trauma therapy : a guide to symptoms, evaluation, and treatment |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, California |year= 2006 |pages= 312 |isbn=0-7619-2921-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 meta-analysis of [[randomized controlled trials]] in children and adolescents with PTSD found that EMDR was at least as efficacious as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and superior to waitlist or placebo.&lt;ref name=MetaNSUE&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1750 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01750 |title= Efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing in Children and Adolescent with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials |year=2017 |last1= Moreno-Alcázar |first1=A. |last2= Treen |first2=D. |last3=Valiente-Gómez |first3=A. |last4=Sio-Eroles |first4=A. |last5=Pérez |first5=V. |last6=Amann |first6=B.L. |last7=Radua |first7=J. |journal= Frontiers in Psychology |volume=8 |pmid=29066991 |pmc=5641384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The proposed mechanisms that underlie eye movements in EMDR therapy are still under investigation and there is as yet no definitive finding. The consensus regarding the underlying biological mechanisms involve the two that have received the most attention and research support: (1) taxing [[working memory]] and (2) [[orienting response]]/[[REM sleep]].&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lee CW|author2=Cuijpers P |year=2013|title=A meta-analysis of the contribution of eye movements in processing emotional memories |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=2|pages=231–239|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.11.001 |pmid=23266601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: "This therapy [EMDR] is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on (a) spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and (b) [[bilateral stimulation]] that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements."&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt;

Salkovskis in 2002 reported that the eye movement is irrelevant, and that the effectiveness of EMDR was solely due to its having properties similar to CBT, such as desensitization and exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salkovskis P |title=Review: eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is not better than exposure therapies for anxiety or trauma |journal=Evidence-based Mental Health |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=13 |date=February 2002  |pmid=11915816 |doi=10.1136/ebmh.5.1.13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and controversy ==
EMDR therapy was first developed by Francine Shapiro upon noticing that certain eye movements reduced the intensity of disturbing thought. She then conducted a scientific study with trauma victims in 1988 and the research was published in the ''[[Journal of Traumatic Stress]]'' in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glaser|first=Tom|title=How was EMDR Developed?|url=http://www.tomglaserlp.com/emdr/emdr-history|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her theory was that when a traumatic or distressing experience occurs, it may overwhelm normal [[coping (psychology)|coping mechanisms]], with the memory and associated stimuli being inadequately processed and stored in an isolated memory network.&lt;ref name=shapiro&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=Francine |first2=Deany |last2=Laliotis |title=EMDR and the adaptive information processing model: Integrative treatment and case conceptualization |journal=Clinical Social Work Journal |date=12 October 2010 |volume=39 |pages=191–200 |doi=10.1007/s10615-010-0300-7 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro noted that, when she was experiencing a disturbing thought, her eyes were involuntarily moving rapidly. She noticed further that, when she brought her eye movements under voluntary control while thinking a traumatic thought, anxiety was reduced.&lt;ref name="article1989"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shapiro, F |year=1989 |title=Efficacy of the eye movement desensitization procedure in the treatment of traumatic memories |journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |volume=2 |pages=199–223 |doi=10.1002/jts.2490020207 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro developed EMDR therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. She speculated that traumatic events "upset the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain, causing a pathological change in the neural elements".&lt;ref name="article1989" /&gt;

As early as 1999, EMDR was controversial within the psychological community, and Shapiro was criticized for repeatedly increasing the length and expense of training and certification, allegedly in response to the results of controlled trials that cast doubt on EMDR's efficacy.&lt;ref name="1999 Skeptic"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Eye Movement Magic: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing|journal=Skeptic|volume=7|issue=4|year=1999|last1=Rosen|first1=Gerald M|last2=Mcnally |first2=Richard J|last3=Lilienfeld|first3=Scott O|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/14-05-21/#feature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbert"/&gt; This included requiring the completion of an EMDR training program in order to be qualified to administer EMDR properly, after researchers using the initial written instructions found no difference between control no-eye-movement control groups and EMDR-as-written experimental groups. Further changes in training requirements and/or the definition of EMDR included requiring level II training when researchers with level I training still found no difference between eye-movement experimental groups and no-eye-movement controls and deeming "alternate forms of bilateral stimulation" (such as finger-tapping) as variants of EMDR by the time a study found no difference between EMDR and a finger-tapping control group.&lt;ref name="1999 Skeptic" /&gt; Such changes in definition and training for EMDR have been described as “ad hoc moves [made] when confronted by embarrassing data” &lt;ref name ="McNally2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNally | first1 = R. J. |title=The demise of pseudoscience |journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice |year=2003| volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=97–101|url=https://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 review argued that the eye movements did not play a central role, that the mechanisms of eye movements were speculative, and that the theory leading to the practice was not falsifiable and therefore not amenable to scientific inquiry. It went on to refer to EMDR as “pseudoscience”, citing non-falsifiability as one of several hallmarks of pseudoscience that EMDR met.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herbert JD, Lilienfeld SO, Lohr JM, Montgomery RW, O'Donohue WT, Rosen GM, Tolin DF |title=Science and pseudoscience in the development of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing: implications for clinical psychology |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=945–71 |date=November 2000  |pmid=11098395 |doi= 10.1016/s0272-7358(99)00017-3|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As discussed in 2013 by [[Richard McNally]], one of the earliest and foremost critics: "Shapiro’s (1995) Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) provoked lively debate when it first appeared on the scene in the late 1980s.... Skeptics questioned whether the defining ingredient, bilateral eye movement, possessed any therapeutic efficacy beyond the imaginal exposure component of EMDR.... A 2001 meta-analysis suggested that EMDR with the eye movements was no more efficacious than EMDR without the eye movements (Davidson &amp; Parker, 2001), implying that "''what is effective in EMDR is not new, and what is new is not effective''" (McNally, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;619).&lt;ref name="apatraumadivision.org"&gt;McNally, R.

Although controlled research has concentrated on the application of EMDR to PTSD, a number of studies have investigated EMDR therapy’s efficacy with other disorders, such as [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=EMDR in the treatment of borderline personality disorder |vauthors=Brown S, Shapiro F | journal=Clinical Case Studies |date=October 2006 | volume=5 | issue=5 | pages=403–420 | doi=10.1177/1534650104271773 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and somatic disorders such as [[phantom limb pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Roos C, Veenstra AC, De Jongh A, den Hollander-Gijsman ME, van der Wee NJ, Zitman FG, van Rood YR |year=2010 |title=Treatment of chronic phantom limb pain using a trauma-focused psychological approach |journal=Pain Research &amp; Management |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=65–71 |pmc=2886995 |pmid=20458374 |doi=10.1155/2010/981634}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilensky M |year=2006 |title=Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) as a treatment for phantom limb pain |journal=Journal of Brief Therapy |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=31–44 |url=http://emdrtraining.com/files/EMDRforPhantomLimbPain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignaz Glaser''' (May 5, 1853 &amp;ndash; August 11, 1916) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] businessman from [[Prague]] and the founder of one of the biggest sheet glass factories in the [[k.u.k.]] monarchy.

==Biography==
In 1881 in [[Bürmoos]] near [[Salzburg]] he used the legal estate of a former [[glassworks]] company that went bankrupt four years earlier and he bought a giant [[moorland|moor]] area. He expanded the factory with four glass ovens, which worked with turf.
He also founded a brickyard, which was very successful and which existed throughout the 1970s. Bit by bit he then bought further moor areas in the neighboring [[Weidmoos]] and at [[Ibmer]] moor, where he also started to cultivate [[hops]]. In the middle of the Ibmer area, in [[Hackenbuch]], [[Upper Austria]], he established another glass factory. The turf factory was very unstable because it depended on the weather a lot and the turf supplies drew to a close. Thus Glaser bought a closed sugar factory in [[North Bohemia]]n [[Bruex]] and established a new glass factory. In that factory ovens were heated with coal from an open pit, which made the company independent from weather conditions. After Glaser’s death in 1916, his son Dr. '''Hermann Glaser,''' born on August 18, 1889, took over the glass factory, which experienced a short economic boom after [[World War I]]. But then the company missed the update to mechanical flat glass fabrication and the Glaser empire broke down in 1926. In Bürmoos, flat glass was produced by a company named Stiassny until the end of 1929, which then bought the holdings. At this point glass fabrication was shut down totally. Eighty percent of the population there was unemployed.

Glaser’s grave is in the Jewish cemetery in Salzburg–Aigen. His son survived the [[Holocaust]] in [[Shanghai]] and died on January 10, 1956 in [[Vienna]].

In 2006 the first [[Ignaz-Glaser-Symposium]] organized by [[Andreas Maislinger]] with a focus on [[Racial integration|integration]] took place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">'''Jørgen von Ansbach''' (ca. 1510 – ca. 1590) was a Norwegian timber merchant and [[mayor]] of [[Skien]].

He immigrated from [[Germany]] to [[Skien]] around 1540. He came as a [[mining]] administrator at a time when King [[Christian III of Denmark]] tried without success to establish a mining industry in [[Telemark|Bratsberg]] (now Telemark). He subsequently became a pioneer in the timber industry in the district as an owner of several sawmills and a major timber merchant. He organized efforts to make water flows from the Hjellevannet on the lower waterbasin in the Skien watercourse (''Skiensvassdraget'') to the Skien River (''Skienselva'') so that water could drive recovery saws. He established sawmills and the timber trade rose sharply in Skien.  He was cited as mayor of Skien in 1568, 1570 and 1578. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Skienselva/Porsgrunnselva|title=Skienselva/Porsgrunnselva|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author=  Svein-Gunnar Selland|accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Skiensvassdraget|title= Skiensvassdraget|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author=  Svein-Gunnar Selland
|accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His considerable fortune was largely derived from the number of properties he owned in the city and district. These properties were divided between his five daughters whose descendants dominated the commercial life in Skien into the 17th century as timber merchants and estate owners. Among his descendants were [[Anne Clausdatter]] (1659–1713) who owned [[Borgestad Manor]] and [[Christian Cornelius Paus]] (1800–1879) who was Governor of Bratsberg. Among his more notable descendants was the playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]].

'''KFNN''' (1510&amp;nbsp;kHz) is a commercial business news formatted [[radio station]] licensed to [[Mesa, Arizona]], broadcasting from studios located in North [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], on 1510 [[Amplitude Modulation|AM]], and simulcast on 105.3 [[Frequency Modulation|FM]].  KFNN is owned by CRC Broadcasting Company, Inc., headed by Ronald Cohen and Brian DuBose, which also owns [[KPSF]] and [[KXPS]], both located in the [[Palm Springs, California]] area, and a financial expo company called Financial Fest. KFNN began airing primarily nationally syndicated content, and now has an extensive lineup of local and national money related programs.  They have been serving the greater Phoenix community as a business/financial station since 1988. They are distinguished as the first full-time financial format of its kind in the U.S.

[[1510 AM]] is a United States [[clear-channel]] frequency.  [[WLAC]] in Nashville, Tennessee is the dominant [[list of broadcast station classes|Class A]] station on this frequency.  KFNN must reduce nighttime power in order to prevent interference to WLAC's nighttime [[skywave]] signal.

==History==
In the 1960s the station was known as '''KMND''' ("Command Radio"), simulcasting an [[easy listening]] music format with [[KDKB|KMND-FM]]. By 1971 both stations were known as '''KDKB''', playing an [[Album Oriented Rock]] format.

In 1978, the simulcast was broken and 1510 [[kilohertz|kHz]] changed formats to [[oldies]].  The call letters were changed to '''KDJQ'''. In 1980, the format at AM KDJQ changed to [[new wave music]] for a brief time.

The station became '''KNTS''' on November 6, 1984. On August 23, 1986, the station changed its call sign to '''KJAA''', then on December 12, 1988 to the current KFNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=14382&amp;Callsign=KFNN |title=KFNN Call Sign History |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Station Signal==
The station's transmitter and towers at the time of the change of call letters were located in Mesa, Arizona, its FCC listed city of license to this day. It was originally a 10,000-watt daytime signal until 1991, when the station towers were relocated to North Phoenix.  From there the signal was authorized to increase to 22,000 watts daytime, and was broadcasting day and night. In 2013, they began simulcasting on FM, through translator K257CD on 99.3&amp;nbsp;MHz. In 2017, CRC changed K257CD's signal source to its new [[KQFN]] sports station, with a new translator, K287BX on 105.3&amp;nbsp;MHz, replacing it as KFNN's FM outlet.

==Business and Financial Format==
Along with two other original partners, Ronald Cohen began the station's format with largely syndicated format from [[WBBR (AM)|Bloomberg]] and other radio networks, but soon developed a large group of live, local programming throughout the week. Don McDonald's financial planning program was one of the first major national shows broadcast on the station, along with [[The Dolans|Ken and Daria Dolan]], who featured a money and investment related program syndicated from the [[WOR Radio Network]]. KFNN introduced a live morning show titled ''Business for Breakfast'' with Ken Morgan as its host. Morgan has been a long time morning show host and station manager, with much of his career spent in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. They currently feature a mix of live, local financial, business, and real estate content, along with syndicated radio hosts like [[Clark Howard]], [[Gary Kaltbaum]], and [[Ray Lucia]], all of whom have had a long presence on the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyradio1510.com/Program-Schedule/Phoenix |title=MoneyRadio 1510 &amp; 99.3 Program Schedule }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Format Changes==
As of the first quarter of 2011, KFNN re-branded its station name from 1510 KFNN, Financial Newsradio, to Money Radio 1510 &amp; 99.3 FM. The station's brand was changed to reflect the broader nature of program content that relates to all matters money. Expansion of the Money Radio brand has moved into Palm Springs, California, as of March 2012 under the call letters KPSF (1200 AM).

A '''marketing plan''' may be part of an overall [[business plan]]. Solid [[marketing strategy]] is the foundation of a well-written marketing plan. While a marketing plan contains a list of actions, without a sound strategic foundation, it is of little use to a business.

==Definition==
A marketing plan is a comprehensive document or blueprint that outlines a business advertising and marketing efforts for the coming year. It describes business activities involved in accomplishing specific marketing objectives within a set time frame. A marketing plan also includes a description of the current marketing position of a business, a discussion of the target market and a description of the marketing mix that a business will use to achieve their marketing goals. A marketing plan has a formal structure, but can be used as a formal or informal document which makes it very flexible. It contains some historical data, future predictions,  and methods or strategies to achieve the marketing objectives. Marketing plans start with the identification of customer needs through a market research and how the business can satisfy these needs while generating an acceptable return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/marketing-plan.html|title=What is a marketing plan? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes processes such as market situation analysis, action programs, budgets, sales forecasts, strategies and projected financial statements. A marketing plan can also be described as a technique that helps a business to decide on the best use of its resources to achieve corporate objectives. It can also contain a full analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of a company, its organization and its products.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq3pytURoEwC|title=The Marketing Plan: A Step-by-step Guide|last=Westwood|first=John|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Kogan PagePublishers|isbn=9780749437480|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marketing plan shows the step or actions that will be utilized in order to achieve the plan goals. For example, a marketing plan may include a strategy to increase the business's market share by fifteen percent. The marketing plan would then outline the objectives that need to be achieved in order to reach the fifteen percent increase in the business market share.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The marketing plan can be used to describe the methods of applying a company's marketing resources to fulfill marketing objectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marketing planning segments the markets, identifies the market position, forecast the market size, and plans a viable market share within each market segment. Marketing planning can also be used to prepare a detailed case for introducing a new product, revamping current marketing strategies for an existing product or put together a company marketing plan to be included in the company corporate or business plan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Outline===

A marketing plan should be based on where a company needs to be at some point in the future. These are some of the most important things that companies need when developing a marketing plan:
* ''Market research'': Gathering and classifying data about the market the organization is currently in. Examining the market dynamics, patterns, customers, and the current sales volume for the industry as a whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-a-marketing-plan-definition-sample-quiz.html|title=What is a Marketing Plan? - Definition &amp; Sample - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=Study.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Competition'': The marketing plan should identify the organization's competition. The plan should describe how the organization will stick out from its competition and what it will do to become a market leader.
* ''Market plan strategies'': Developing the marketing and promotion strategies that the organization will use. Such strategies may include advertising, direct marketing, training programs, trade shows, website, etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* ''Marketing plan budget'': Strategies identified in the marketing plan should be within the budget. Top managers need to revise what they hope to accomplish with the marketing plan, review their current financial situation, and then allocate funding for the marketing plan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* ''Marketing goals'': The marketing plan should include attainable marketing goals. For example, one goal might be to increase the current client base by 100 over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* ''Monitoring of the marketing plan results'': The marketing plan should include the process of analyzing the current position of the organization. The organization needs to identify the strategies that are working and those that are not working.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Purpose===

One of the main purposes of developing a marketing plan is to set the company on a specific path in marketing. The marketing goals normally aligns itself to the broader company objectives. For example, a new company looking to grow their business will generally have a marketing plan that emphasizes strategies to increase their customer base.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/purposes-marketing-plan-61663.html|title=Purposes of a Marketing Plan|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring marketing share, increasing customer awareness, and building a favorable business image are some of the objectives that can be related to marketing planning. The marketing plan also helps layout the necessary budget and resources needed to achieve the goals stated in the marketing plan. The marketing plan shows what the company is intended to accomplish within the budget and also to make it possible for company executives to assess potential return on the investment of marketing dollars. Different aspects of the marketing plan relate to accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The marketing plan is a general responsibility from company leaders and the marketing staff to take the company in a specific direction. After the strategies are laid out and the tasks are developed, each task is assigned to a person or a team for implementation. The assigned roles allows companies to keep track of their milestones and communicate with the teams during the implementation process. Having a marketing plan helps company leaders to develop and keep an eye on the expectations for their functional areas. For example, if a company's marketing plan goal is to increase sales growth then the company leaders may have to increase their sales staff in stores to help generate more sales.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The marketing plan offers a unique opportunity for a productive discussion between employees and leaders of an organization. It provides good communication within the company. The marketing plan also allows the marketing team to examine their past decisions and understand their results in order to better prepare for the future. It also lets the marketing team to observe and study the environment that they are operating in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/marketing/textbooks/boundless-marketing-textbook/marketing-strategies-and-planning-2/introducing-the-marketing-plan-26/purpose-of-the-marketing-plan-146-576/|title=Purpose of the Marketing Plan - Boundless Open Textbook|website=Boundless|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing planning aims and objectives==
Though it's not clear, behind the corporate objectives, which in themselves offer the main context for the marketing plan, will lie the "corporate mission,"  in turn provides the context for these corporate objectives. In a sales-oriented organization, the marketing planning function designs incentive pay plans to not only motivate and reward frontline staff fairly but also to align marketing activities with corporate mission.  The marketing plan basically aims to make the business provide the solution with the awareness with the expected customers.

This "corporate mission" can be thought of as a definition of what the organization is, or what it does: "Our business is ...". This definition should not be too narrow, or it will constrict the development of the organization; a too rigorous concentration on the view that "We are in the business of making meat-scales," as IBM was during the early 1900s, might have limited its subsequent development into other areas. On the other hand, it should not be too wide or it will become meaningless; "We want to make a profit" is not too helpful in developing specific plans.

Jacob Zimmerem suggested that the definition should cover three dimensions: "customer groups" to be served, "customer needs" to be served, and "technologies" to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Abell, "Defining the Business: The Starting Point of Strategic Planning"&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the definition of IBM's "corporate mission" in the 1940s might well have been: "We are in the business of handling accounting information [customer need] for the larger US organizations [customer group] by means of [[punched cards]] [technology]."

Perhaps the most important factor in successful marketing is the "corporate vision." Surprisingly, it is largely neglected by marketing textbooks, although not by the popular exponents of corporate strategy &amp;nbsp;— indeed, it was perhaps the main theme of the book by Peters and Waterman, in the form of their "Superordinate Goals." "In Search of Excellence" said: "Nothing drives progress like the imagination. The idea precedes the deed." &lt;ref&gt;"The Marketing Imagination"&lt;/ref&gt; If the organization in general, and its chief executive in particular, has a strong vision of where its future lies, then there is a good chance that the organization will achieve a strong position in its markets (and attain that future). This will be not least because its strategies will be consistent and will be supported by its staff at all levels. In this context, all of IBM's marketing activities were underpinned by its philosophy of "customer service," a vision originally promoted by the charismatic Watson dynasty. The emphasis at this stage is on obtaining a complete and accurate picture.

A "traditional" — albeit product-based&amp;nbsp;— format for a "brand reference book" (or, indeed, a "marketing facts book") was suggested by Godley more than three decades ago:
# Financial data—Facts for this section will come from [[management accounting]], costing and finance sections.
# Product data—From production, research and development.
# Sales and distribution data&amp;nbsp;— Sales, packaging, distribution sections.
# Advertising, [[sales promotion]], merchandising data&amp;nbsp;— Information from these departments.
# Market data and miscellany&amp;nbsp;— From [[market research]], who would in most cases act as a source for this information. His sources of data, however, assume the resources of a very large organization. In most organizations they would be obtained from a much smaller set of people (and not a few of them would be generated by the marketing manager alone).
&lt;br /&gt;It is apparent that a marketing audit can be a complex process, but the aim is simple: ''"it is only to identify those existing (external and internal) factors which will have a significant impact on the future plans of the company."'' It is clear that the '''basic''' material to be input to the marketing audit should be comprehensive. &lt;br /&gt;
Accordingly, the best approach is to accumulate this material continuously, as and when it becomes available; since this avoids the otherwise heavy workload involved in collecting it as part of the regular, typically annual, planning process itself&amp;nbsp;— when time is usually at a premium.
&lt;br /&gt;Even so, the first task of this ''annual'' process should be to check that the material held in the current ''facts book'' or ''facts files'' actually ''is'' comprehensive and accurate, and can form a sound basis for the marketing audit itself.
&lt;br /&gt;The structure of the facts book will be designed to match the specific needs of the organization, but one simple format&amp;nbsp;— suggested by Malcolm McDonald&amp;nbsp;— may be applicable in many cases. This splits the material into three groups:
# '''Review of the marketing environment.''' A study of the organization's markets, customers, competitors and the overall economic, political, cultural and technical environment; covering developing trends, as well as the current situation.
# '''Review of the detailed marketing activity.''' A study of the company's [[marketing mix]]; in terms of the 7 Ps - (see below)
# '''Review of the marketing system.''' A study of the marketing organization, [[marketing research]] systems and the current marketing objectives and strategies. The last of these is too frequently ignored. The marketing system itself needs to be regularly questioned, because the validity of the whole marketing plan is reliant upon the accuracy of the input from this system, and `garbage in, garbage out' applies with a vengeance.
#: * '''Portfolio planning.''' In addition, the coordinated planning of the individual products and services can contribute towards the balanced portfolio.
#: * '''80:20 rule.''' To achieve the maximum impact, the marketing plan must be clear, concise and simple. It needs to concentrate on the 20 percent of products or services, and on the 20 percent of customers, that will account for 80 percent of the volume and 80 percent of the profit.
#: * '''7 Ps''': Product, Place, Price and Promotion, Physical Environment, People, Process. The 7 Ps can sometimes divert attention from the customer, but the framework they offer can be very useful in building the action plans.

It is only at this stage (of deciding the marketing objectives) that the active part of the marketing planning process begins. This next stage in marketing planning is indeed the key to the whole marketing process.
&lt;br /&gt;The "marketing objectives" state just where the company intends to be at some specific time in the future. &lt;br /&gt;
James Quinn succinctly defined objectives in general as: ''Goals (or objectives) state '''what''' is to be achieved and '''when''' results are to be accomplished, but they do not state "how" the results are to be achieved.''&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;J. B. Quinn, "Strategies for Change: Logical Incrementalism" (Richard D. Irwin, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; They typically relate to what products (or services) will be where in what markets (and must be realistically based on customer behavior in those markets). They are essentially about the match between those "products" and "markets." Objectives for pricing, distribution, advertising and so on are at a lower level, and should not be confused with marketing objectives. They are part of the marketing strategy needed to achieve marketing objectives. To be most effective, objectives should be capable of measurement and therefore "quantifiable." This measurement may be in terms of sales volume, money value, [[market share]], percentage penetration of distribution outlets and so on. An example of such a measurable marketing objective might be "to enter the market with product Y and capture 10 percent of the market by value within one year." As it is quantified it can, within limits, be unequivocally monitored, and [[Corrective Action|corrective action]] taken as necessary.

The marketing objectives must usually be based, above all, on the organization's financial objectives; converting these financial measurements into the related marketing measurements. He went on to explain his view of the role of "policies," with which strategy is most often confused: "Policies are rules or guidelines that express the 'limits' within which action should occur. "Simplifying somewhat, [[marketing strategies]] can be seen as the means, or "game plan," by which marketing objectives will be achieved and, in the framework that appears here, are generally concerned with the 8 P's. Examples are:
# Price&amp;nbsp;— The amount of money needed to buy products
# Product&amp;nbsp;— The actual product
# Promotion (advertising)- Getting the product known
# Placement&amp;nbsp;— Where the product is sold
# People&amp;nbsp;— Represent the business
# Physical environment&amp;nbsp;— The ambiance, mood, or tone of the environment
# Process&amp;nbsp;— The Value-added services that differentiate the product from the competition (e.g. after-sales service, warranties)
# Packaging&amp;nbsp;— How the product will be protected

&lt;br /&gt;In principle, these strategies describe how the objectives will be achieved. The 7 Ps are a useful framework for deciding how a company's resources will be manipulated (strategically) to achieve its objectives. However, the 7 Ps are not the only framework, and may divert attention from other real issues. The focus of a business's strategies must be the objectives of the business— not the process of planning itself. If the 7 Ps fit the business's strategies, then the 7 Ps may be an acceptable framework for that business.&lt;br /&gt;
The strategy statement can take the form of a purely verbal description of the strategic options which have been chosen. Alternatively, and perhaps more positively, it might include a structured list of the major options chosen.

One aspect of strategy which is often overlooked is that of "timing." The timing of each element of the strategy is critical. Taking the right action at the wrong time can sometimes be almost as bad as taking the wrong action at the right time. Timing is, therefore, an essential part of any plan; and should normally appear as a schedule of planned activities. Having completed this crucial stage of the planning process, to re-check the feasibility of objectives and strategies in terms of the market share, sales, costs, profits and so on which these demand in practice. As in the rest of the marketing discipline, employ judgment, experience, market research or anything else which helps for conclusions to be seen from all possible angles.

At this stage, overall marketing strategies will need to be developed into detailed plans and program. Although these detailed plans may cover each of the 7 Ps (marketing mix), the focus will vary, depending upon the organization's specific strategies. A product-oriented company will focus its plans for the 7 Ps around each of its products. A market or geographically oriented company will concentrate on each market or geographical area. Each will base its plans upon the detailed needs of its customers, and on the strategies chosen to satisfy these needs. Brochures and Websites are used effectively.

Again, the most important element is, the detailed plans, which spell out exactly what programs and individual activities will carry at the period of the plan (usually over the next year). Without these activities the plan cannot be monitored. These plans must therefore be:
* '''Clear''' - They should be an unambiguous statement of 'exactly' what is to be done.
* '''Quantified''' - The predicted outcome of each activity should be, as far as possible, quantified, so that its performance can be monitored.
* '''Focused''' - The temptation to proliferate activities beyond the numbers which can be realistically controlled should be avoided. The [[Pareto principle|80:20 Rule]] applies in this context too.
* '''Realistic''' - They should be achievable.
* '''Agreed''' - Those who are to implement them should be committed to them, and agree that they are achievable. The resulting plans should become a working document which will guide the campaigns taking place throughout the organization over the period of the plan. If the marketing plan is to work, every exception to it (throughout the year) must be questioned; and the lessons learnt, to be incorporated in the next year's .

==Measurement of progress==

The final stage of any marketing planning process is to establish targets (or standards) so that progress can be monitored. Accordingly, it is important to put both quantities and timescales into the marketing objectives (for example, to capture 20 percent by value of the market within two years) and into the corresponding strategies. Marketers must be ready to update and adapt marketing plans at any time. The marketing plan should define how progress towards objectives will be measured. Managers typically use budgets, schedules  and marketing metrics for monitoring and evaluating results. With budget, they can compare planned expenditures with actual expenditures for given period. Schedules allow management to see when tasks were supposed to be completed and when they actually were. Marketing metrics tracks actual outcomes of marketing programs to see whether the company is moving forward towards its objectives (P. Kotler, K.L. Keller).

Changes in the environment mean that the forecasts often have to be changed. Along with these, the related plans may well also need to be changed. Continuous monitoring of performance, against predetermined targets, represents a most important aspect of this. However, perhaps even more important is the enforced discipline of a regular formal review. Again, as with forecasts, in many cases the best (most realistic) planning cycle will revolve around a quarterly review. Best of all, at least in terms of the quantifiable aspects of the plans, if not the wealth of backing detail, is probably a quarterly rolling review&amp;nbsp;— planning one full year ahead each new quarter. Of course, this does absorb more planning resource; but it also ensures that the plans embody the latest information, and&amp;nbsp;— with attention focused on them so regularly&amp;nbsp;— forces both the plans and their implementation to be realistic.

Plans only have validity if they are actually used to control the progress of a company: their success lies in their implementation, not in the writing'.

==Performance analysis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
The most important elements of marketing performance, which are normally tracked, are:

===Sales analysis===

Most organizations track their sales results; or, in non-profit organizations for example, the number of clients. The more sophisticated track them in terms of 'sales variance' - the deviation from the target figures&amp;nbsp;— which allows a more immediate picture of deviations to become evident.

`Micro-analysis', which is simply the normal management process of investigating detailed problems, then investigates the individual elements (individual products, sales territories, customers and so on) which are failing to meet targets

===Market share analysis===

Few organizations track market share though it is often an important metric. Though absolute sales might grow in an expanding market, a firm's share of the market can decrease which bodes ill for future sales when the market starts to drop. Where such market share is tracked, there may be a number of aspects which will be followed:
* overall market share
* segment share&amp;nbsp;— that in the specific, targeted segment
* relative share

===Expense analysis===

The key ratio to watch in this area is usually the `marketing expense to sales ratio'; although this may be broken down into other elements (advertising to sales, sales administration to sales, and so on).

Expense analysis can be defined as a detailed report of all the expenses that a business incurs. It is produced on a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis. It can be dissected into small business subsets to determine how much money each area is costing the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/conduct-revenue-expense-account-analysis-50499.html|title=How to Conduct a Revenue &amp; Expense Account Analysis|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In marketing, the marketing expense-to-sales ratio plays an important part in expense analysis because it is used to align marketing spend with industry norms. Marketing expense-to-sales ratio helps the company drive its marketing spend productivity. Marketing expense-to-sales analysis is also included with the sales analysis, market share analysis, financial analysis and market-based scorecard analysis as one of the five analysis tools marketers used to control and drive spending productivity. The marketing expense-to-sales ratio allows companies to track actual spending that is relative to the accepted budget and relative to sales goals as stated in the marketing plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/marketing-expensetosales-analysis-73246.html|title=Marketing Expense-to-Sales Analysis|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial analysis===

The "bottom line" of marketing activities should at least in theory, be the net profit (for all except non-profit organizations, where the comparable emphasis may be on remaining within budgeted costs). There are a number of separate performance figures and key ratios which need to be tracked:
* [[gross contribution]]&lt;&gt;[[net profit]]
* [[gross profit]]&lt;&gt;[[return on investment]]
* [[net contribution]]&lt;&gt;[[profit on sales]]

There can be considerable benefit in comparing these figures with those achieved by other organizations (especially those in the same industry); using, for instance, the figures which can be obtained (in the UK) from `The Centre for Interfirm Comparison'. The most sophisticated use of this approach, however, is typically by those making use of PIMS (Profit Impact of Management Strategies), initiated by the General Electric Company and then developed by Harvard Business School, but now run by the Strategic Planning Institute.

The above performance analyses concentrate on the quantitative measures which are directly related to short-term performance. But there are a number of indirect measures, essentially tracking customer attitudes, which can also indicate the organization's performance in terms of its longer-term marketing strengths and may accordingly be even more important indicators. Some useful measures are:
* market research&amp;nbsp;— including customer panels (which are used to track changes over time)
* lost business&amp;nbsp;— the orders which were lost because, for example, the stock was not available or the product did not meet the customer's exact requirements
* customer complaints&amp;nbsp;— how many customers complain about the products or services, or the organization itself, and about what

===Use of marketing plans===

A formal, written marketing plan is essential; in that it provides an unambiguous reference point for activities throughout the planning period. However, perhaps the most important benefit of these plans is the planning process itself. This typically offers a unique opportunity, a forum, for information-rich and productively focused discussions between the various managers involved. The plan, together with the associated discussions, then provides an agreed context for their subsequent management activities, even for those not described in the plan itself. Additionally, marketing plans are included in business plans, offering data showing investors how the company will grow and most importantly, how they will get a return on investment.

==Budgets as managerial tools==

The classic quantification of a marketing plan appears in the form of budgets. Because these are so rigorously quantified, they are particularly important. They should, thus, represent an unequivocal projection of actions and expected results. What is more, they should be capable of being monitored accurately; and, indeed, performance against budget is the main (regular) management review process.

The purpose of a marketing budget is to pull together all the revenues and costs involved in marketing into one comprehensive document. The budget is a managerial tool that balances what is needed to be spent against what can be afforded, and helps make choices about priorities. A budget can further be used to measure a business's performance in the general trends of a business's spending.

The marketing budget is usually the most powerful tool by which one can determine the relationship between desired results and available means. Its starting point should be the marketing strategies and plans, which have already been formulated in the marketing plan itself; although, in practice, the two will run in parallel and will interact. At the very least, a thorough budget may cause a change in the more optimistic elements of a company's business plans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7130">The '''MaxDiff''' is a long-established academic mathematical theory with very specific assumptions about how people make choices:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some probabilistic models of best, worst, and best–worst choices|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249605000441|journal = Journal of Mathematical Psychology|date = 2005-01-01|pages = 464–480|volume = 49|issue = 6|first = Anthony AJ|last = Marley|first2 = Jordan J.|last2 = Louviere|doi=10.1016/j.jmp.2005.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; it assumes that respondents evaluate all possible pairs of items within the displayed set and choose the pair that reflects the maximum difference in preference or importance. It may be thought of as a variation of the method of [[Pairwise comparison|Paired Comparisons]]. Consider a set in which a respondent evaluates four items: A, B, C and D. If the respondent says that A is best and D is worst, these two responses inform us on five of six possible implied paired comparisons:
: A &gt; B, A &gt; C, A &gt; D, B &gt; D, C &gt; D

The only paired comparison that cannot be inferred is B vs. C. In a choice among five items, MaxDiff questioning informs on seven of ten implied paired comparisons.

== Overview ==
In 1938 Richardson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multimensional psychophysics|journal = Psychological Bulletin |date = 1938|pages = 659–660|volume = 35|first = MW|last = Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a choice method in which subjects reported the most alike pair of a triad and the most different pair. The component of this method involving the most different pair may be properly called “MaxDiff” in contrast to a “most-least” or “best-worst” method where both the most different pair and the direction of difference are obtained. Ennis, Mullen and Frijters (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Variants of the method of triads: Unidimensional Thursonian models|journal = British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology|date = 1988|pages = 25–36|volume = 41|first = Daniel M|last = Ennis|first2 = Kenneth|last2 = Mullen|first3 = Jan ER|last3 = Frijters}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived a unidimensional Thurstonian scaling model for Richardson’s method of triads so that the results could be scaled under normality assumptions about the item percepts.

It should be noted that MaxDiff may involve multidimensional percepts, unlike most-least models that assume a unidimensional representation. MaxDiff and most-least methods belong to a class of methods that do not require the estimation of a cognitive parameter as occurs in the analysis of ratings data. This is one of the reasons for their popularity in applications.  Other methods in this class include the 2- and 3-alternative forced choice methods, the triangular method which is a special case of Richardson's method, the duo-trio method and the specified and unspecified methods of tetrads. All of these methods have well developed Thurstonian scaling models as discussed recently in Ennis (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ennis|first1=Daniel M|title=Thurstonian Models:  Categorical Decision Making in the Presence of Noise|date=June 2016|publisher=The Institute for Perception|isbn=9780990644606|ref=bws}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also includes a Thurstonian model for first-last or most-least choice and ranks with rank-induced dependencies. There are a number of possible processes through which subjects may make a most-least decision, including paired comparisons and ranking, but it is typically not known how the decision is reached.

== Relationship to best–worst scaling ==
Maxdiff and [[best–worst scaling]] (BWS) have erroneously been considered synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Louviere|first1=Jordan J|last2=Flynn|first2=Terry N|last3=Marley|first3=A A J|title=Best-Worst Scaling: Theory, Methods and Applications|date=September 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107043152|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/economics/econometrics-statistics-and-mathematical-economics/best-worst-scaling-theory-methods-and-applications|accessdate=2 October 2015|ref=bws}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents can produce best-worst data in any of a number of ways, with a maxdiff process being but one. Instead of evaluating all possible pairs (the maxdiff model), they might choose the best from n items, the worst from the remaining n-1, or vice versa (sequential models). Or indeed they may use another method entirely. Thus it should be clear that maxdiff is a subset of BWS; maxdiff is BWS, but BWS is not necessarily maxdiff. Indeed, maxdiff might not be considered an attractive model on psychological and intuitive grounds: as the number of items increases, the number of possible pairs increases in a multiplicative fashion: n items produces n(n-1) pairs (where best-worst order matters). Assuming respondents do evaluate all possible pairs is a strong assumption. Early work did use the term maxdiff to refer to BWS, but with Marley's return to the field,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some probabilistic models of best, worst, and best–worst choices|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249605000441|journal = Journal of Mathematical Psychology|date = 2005-12-01|pages = 464–480|volume = 49|series = Special Issue Honoring Jean-Claude Falmagne: Part 1|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.jmp.2005.05.003|first = A. A. J.|last = Marley|first2 = J. J.|last2 = Louviere}}&lt;/ref&gt; correct academic terminology has been disseminated throughout Europe and Asia-Pacific.

== Commercial software named maxdiff ==
In North America the term maxdiff continues to be used for studies that are in fact BWS studies. This probably reflects the fact that [[Sawtooth Software]] in the United States implements a procedure it has named maxdiff. Indeed, it is unclear whether this procedure implements maxdiff procedures in estimating parameters of their models, or whether the simpler, sequential BWS model is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimating preferences for a dermatology consultation using Best-Worst Scaling: Comparison of various methods of analysis|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/8/76/abstract|journal = BMC Medical Research Methodology|date = 2008-11-18|issn = 1471-2288|pmc = 2600822|pmid = 19017376|pages = 76|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1471-2288-8-76|language = en|first = Terry N.|last = Flynn|first2 = Jordan J.|last2 = Louviere|first3 = Tim J.|last3 = Peters|first4 = Joanna|last4 = Coast}}  {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Datagame]] has implemented an application called MaxDiff Rankifier which uses [[gamification]] techniques and interactive visuals to streamline the data collection process.

==Conduct and analysis of a maxdiff survey==
A maxdiff survey may be designed and analysed in two ways:
# Through manual design and researcher-led analysis using standard statistical software procedures (see [[Best-Worst Scaling|BWS]]) or
# By utilising a commercial survey company which supports this type of discrete choice model.

==History==
[[Image:Mills Building (San Francisco).jpg|thumb|left|Mills Building]]
The original 10-[[storey|story]], {{convert|47|m|abbr=on}} structure was designed by [[Burnham and Root]]/[[D.H. Burnham &amp; Company]] completed 1892; and after surviving the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]], was restored by [[Willis Polk]] in 1908, who oversaw subsequent additions in 1914 and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Robert Mix | title=Willis Polk in San Francisco (1907-1913) | url=http://www.verlang.com/sfbay0004ref_slideshow_wp_sf_03.html#220_montgomery | work=Vernacular Language North | date=2 September 2005 | accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named for early San Francisco financial tycoon, [[Darius Ogden Mills]], it is regarded as the city's second skyscraper, after the [[Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences|Chronicle Building]] (1890).&lt;ref name="Cerny2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Dinkelspiel Cerny|title=An Architectural Guidebook to San Francisco and the Bay Area|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkVQx6MWa8MC&amp;pg=RA1-PR1|date=January 2007|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=978-1-58685-432-4|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed in 1931 at 220 Bush Street, '''Mills Tower''' is a 22-story, {{convert|92|m|abbr=on}} annex designed by [[George W. Kelham]] and [[Lewis Parsons Hobart]].

'''Nemir A. Kirdar''' is an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] [[businessman]] and [[financier]]. He was the founding CEO of [[Investcorp]], a [[private equity]] investment group operating out of [[New York City]], [[London]] and [[Bahrain]].  After serving 23 years as CEO of Investcorp, Kirdar retired from the position in 2015 and became the company's Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investcorp.com/news-and-media/article/investcorp-announces-election-of-nemir-kirdar-as-chairman-of-the-board&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in London.

== Career ==
Kirdar began his banking career in New York in 1969. Following two years of credit training, he worked in [[South East Asia]] and [[Japan]] for [[Allied Bank International]]. In 1974, he joined [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] in [[New York City]], as vice president. Between 1976 and 1981, Kirdar worked in the [[Persian Gulf]] overseeing and directing Chase’s banking network in the region.

In 1982, he founded [[Investcorp]], a firm specializing in global investment offerings including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, technology investments and Persian Gulf growth capital.

== Early life ==
Kirdar was born in [[Kirkuk]], Iraq, to a [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]] family prominent in the politics of the late Ottoman Empire and interwar Iraq. After a military coup overthrew the Iraqi monarchy in 1958, Kirdar fled to the United States to study. During his escape from Iraq in 1958, he reportedly hid in a rolled-up carpet in the back of a truck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/richlist/person/0,,37980,00.html The Sunday Times Rich List]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Iraq in 1960 but soon after the Baathist coup, which produced the regime of Saddam Hussein, Kirdar left the country again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/power100/2007/profile/611 The power hundred list 2007, 61# Nemir Kirdar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirdar graduated from the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] in [[California]] with a degree in [[economics]]. He also holds an [[MBA]] from [[Fordham University]] in New York, and completed Harvard Business School’s senior management program.

== Academic Awards ==

The '''Pacific Salmon Commission''' is a regulatory body run jointly by the [[Canadian government|Canadian]] and [[United States government]]s. Its mandate is to protect stocks of the five species of [[Pacific salmon]]. Its precursor was the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, which operated from 1937 to 1985. The PSC enforces the Pacific Salmon Treaty, ratified by Canada and the U.S. in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/pacific-salmon/|title=Pacific Salmon|last=Lane|first=E.D.|author2=W. Pennell|year=2011|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Seining salmon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Seining]] salmon on the [[Columbia River]], 1914]]
[[File:Falsepass ak SharonJeanWarjackAmandaDawn.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Salmon seiners docked at [[False Pass]], [[Alaska]]]]
Pacific salmon have been an important food source and trade commodity for Northwest First Nations peoples for millenia. After European explorers arrived, the first large-scale commercial salmon fisheries were started in the early 1800s. Lucrative fisheries were established on the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Fraser River|Fraser]] rivers, including [[canneries]] geared for export. Harvests increased year-to-year until the 1910s. The abundance of the resource had precluded any disagreements between the Canadian and American governments until this point.&lt;ref name="Roos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=John F.|title=Restoring Fraser River salmon : a history of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, 1937-1985 |year=1991|publisher=Pacific Salmon Commission|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-9694947-0-X |pages=10–13, 14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from the 1920s onward, stocks began to decline, a result of [[over-fishing]] and the degradation and obstruction of migratory rivers. Competition between American and Canadian fisheries for the dwindling resource led to conflict. Disputes were complicated by the fact that the salmon crossed several international borders during their lifespan. In 1930, the governments met and proposed the Fraser River Convention to regulate fishing and mitigate environmental damage to salmon habitats. The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission was formally founded in 1937.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y4652e/y4652e09.htm|title=North American Pacific Salmon: A Case of Fragile Cooperation|last=Miller|first=Kathleen A.|publisher=United Nations Fisheries and Aquaculture Organisation|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IPSFC==
The early focus of the IPSFC was to restore the Fraser runs of [[sockeye salmon]]. Three obstacles were identified - the [[Hells Gate, British Columbia|Hells Gate]] portion of the [[Fraser Canyon]] (where a landslide in 1913 caused by railway engineers had partially blocked the river), the [[Quesnel River]] splash dam, and the [[Adams River (British Columbia)|Adams River]] splash dam. During the 1940s, fish ladders and spillways were constructed by the Commission at Hell's Gate. The splash dams on the Quesnel and Adams were dynamited and removed.&lt;ref name="Roos" /&gt;

==Pacific Salmon Treaty==
By the 1970s, cooperation between the two governments in setting fishing quotas had faltered. In 1982, a comprehensive treaty was signed and was fully ratified in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/pacificsalmontreaty.asp|title=Pacific Salmon Treaty|last=Harrison|first=John|year=2010|work=Columbia River History|publisher=Northwest Power and Conservation Council|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It limited catches of Alaska, Fraser, and Columbia salmon to pre-set quotas and committed the governments to improving the spawning capacities of the region's rivers. The treaty was amended in 1999.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

==Structure==
The PSC is divided into five panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Panels| work = | publisher = Pacific Salmon Commission| date = | url = http://www.psc.org/about-us/structure/panels/| format = | doi = | accessdate = 28 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Panel covers Alaska and northern British Columbia stocks. The Fraser River Panel covers the Fraser, while the Southern Panel is responsible for the Columbia and other U.S. stocks. The Yukon and Transboundary Panels monitor stock in the Yukon River, and stock in rivers crossing through British Columbia and the Alaska panhandle respectively. Each panel monitors harvesting, spawning, and habitat quality in its respective region, then makes recommendations to the Commission. These recommendations determine seasonal fishing quotas and openings.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

The '''Penguin Group''' is a trade book publisher and part of [[Penguin Random House]]. It is owned by [[Pearson PLC]], the global education and publishing company, and [[Bertelsmann]], the German media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. The new company was created by a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] that was finalised on 1 July 2013, with Bertelsmann owning 53% of the joint venture, and Pearson controlling the remaining 47%.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/29/penguin-random-house-book-publisher "Penguin and Random House merger to create biggest book publisher ever seen"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Penguin Books]] has its registered office in [[City of Westminster]], London.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/index.html#question1 26.

[[City of Westminster]]. Retrieved 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its British division is ''[[Penguin Books]] Ltd.'' Other separate divisions can be found in the United States, Ireland, New Zealand, India, Australia, Canada, China, Brazil and South Africa.

==History==
[[Penguin Books]] Ltd. (est. 1935) of the United Kingdom was bought over by [[Longman|Pearson Longman]] in 1970. In 1975, Penguin acquired the American hardcover firm [[Viking Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/11/archives/viking-press-is-sold-to-penguin-books.html|title=Viking Press Is Sold to Penguin Books|last=Whitman|first=Alden|date=1975-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Penguin acquired the [[New American Library]], a mass-market paperback publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McDowell| first = Edwin| title = PENGUIN AGREES TO BUY NEW AMERICAN LIBRARY| accessdate = 2018-12-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/garden/penguin-agrees-to-buy-new-american-library.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penguin Group (USA) Inc. was formed in 1996 as a result of the merger between Penguin Books USA and the [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam Berkley Group]] after Penguin acquired Putnam Berkley from [[MCA Inc.|MCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Lyall| first = Sarah| title = Penguin Is Buying MCA's Putnam Berkley for $336 Million| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-12-02| date = 1996-11-27| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/penguin-is-buying-mca-s-putnam-berkley-for-336-million.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/5618/index1.html|title=Now for the Grann Finale|website=NYMag.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed company was originally called Penguin Putnam Inc., but, in 2003, it changed its name to Penguin Group (USA) Inc. to reflect the parent Pearson PLC's grouping of all the Penguin companies worldwide under the supervisory umbrella of Pearson's own Penguin Group division.

The different Penguin companies use many [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s, many of which used to be independent publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/index.html|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penguin Group (USA) Inc. also operates its own [[speaker's bureau]] that books speaking engagements for many of the publisher's authors. In 2011, the online writing and publishing community [[Book Country]] was launched as a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcountry.com/AboutUs/Penguin.aspx |title=What's the Penguin About? |publisher=Bookcountry.com |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] filed ''[[United States v. Apple Inc.]]'', naming [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Penguin, and four other major publishers as defendants.  The suit alleged that they conspired to [[price-fixing|fix prices]] for [[e-books]] and weaken [[Amazon.com]]'s position in the market in violation of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]].&lt;ref name="washington post DOJ sues"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/justice-department-files-suit-against-apple-publishers-report-says/2012/04/11/gIQAzyXSAT_story.html | title=Justice Department sues Apple, publishers over e-book prices | work=The Washington Post | date=11 April 2012 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Mui, Ylan Q. and Hayley Tsukayama}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Penguin and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.&lt;ref name="usatoday settlements rolling out"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/03/25/amazon-settlements-ebooks/6869033/ | title=E-book price fixing settlements rolling out | work=USA Today | date=25 March 2014 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Molina, Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate [[Bertelsmann]], over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and [[Random House]]. The houses were considered two of the Big-Six publishing companies, prior to the merger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edgecliffe |first=Andrew |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/eaf8eaaa-1eac-11e2-be82-00144feabdc0.html |title=Penguin and Random House in deal talks |work=Financial Times |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the Big-Five publishing houses upon completion of the combination. The [[European Union]] approved of the [[Penguin Random House]] merger on 5 April 2013; Pearson controls 47% of the publisher.

The '''[https://pcaobus.org/ Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]''' ('''PCAOB''') is a private-sector, nonprofit corporation created by the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 to oversee the audits of public companies and other issuers in order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate and independent audit reports. The PCAOB also oversees the audits of broker-dealers, including compliance reports filed pursuant to federal securities laws, to promote investor protection. All PCAOB rules and standards must be approved by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC).

In creating the PCAOB, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required that auditors of U.S. public companies be subject to external and independent oversight for the first time in history. Previously, the profession was self-regulated. Congress vested the PCAOB with expanded oversight authority over the audits of brokers and dealers registered with the SEC in 2010 through the [https://pcaobus.org/About/History/Documents/PDFs/Dodd_Frank_Title_IX.pdf Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act].

The PCAOB has four primary functions in overseeing these auditors: registration, inspection, standard setting and enforcement.

Registered accounting firms that issue audit reports for more than 100 issuers (primarily public companies) are required to be inspected annually. This is usually around 10 firms.  Registered firms that issue audit reports for 100 or fewer issuers are generally inspected at least once every three years. Many of these firms are international non-U.S. firms. In addition, the PCAOB annually inspects at least 5 percent of all registered firms that play a substantial role in the audit of an issuer but that do not issue audit reports for issuers themselves. In 2011, the Board adopted [https://pcaobus.org/Pages/BrokerDealers.aspx an interim inspection program] for the audits of broker-dealers, while the Board considers the scope and other elements of a permanent inspection program.

In 2017, auditors began filing information on the names of engagement partners and other audit firms that participate in the audits of U.S. public companies. The PCAOB created a searchable database called [https://pcaobus.org/Pages/AuditorSearch.aspx AuditorSearch] for [https://pcaobus.org/News/Releases/Pages/PCAOB-adopts-disclosure-rules-Form-AP-12-15-15.aspx investors and others to know more] about who is leading and participating in audits through these filings, adding more specific data points to the mix of information that can be used when evaluating audit quality.

The PCAOB also adopted a new standard in 2017 [https://pcaobus.org/News/Releases/Pages/auditors-report-standard-adoption-6-1-17.aspx to enhance the usefulness of the standard auditor's report] by providing additional and important information to investors, such as the critical audit matters (CAMs) that auditors communicate to the audit committees of the public companies they are auditing.  These are matters that are related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements, and involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex auditor judgment. The CAMs requirement goes into effect in 2019 and 2020. Beginning in 2017, the updated auditor's report also includes the tenure of the auditor with that company.

==Organizational overview==
The PCAOB has five Board members, including a Chairman, each of whom is appointed by the SEC, after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the Treasury.  Two Board members must be Certified Public Accountants.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/soa2002.pdf (Section 101(e)(2))&lt;/ref&gt;  If the PCAOB Chairman is one of them, he or she may not have been a practicing CPA for at least five years prior to being appointed to the board.  Each member serves full-time, for staggered five-year terms.  The Board's budget, approved by the SEC each year, is funded by fees paid by the companies and broker-dealers who rely on the audit firms overseen by the Board. The organization has a staff of about 800 and offices in 11 states in addition to its headquarters in Washington.

The PCAOB's current Chairman is William D. Duhnke III, who was [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-230 sworn in on January 2, 2018], by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Previously, he served as Staff Director and General Counsel to three Senate Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pcaobus.org/About/Board/Pages/WilliamDDuhnke.aspx|title=William D. Duhnke III|website=pcaobus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011-2017, James R. Doty served as Chairman, a former SEC General Counsel and a former partner at the law firm of Baker Botts LLP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pcaobus.org/About/Board/Former/Pages/JamesRDoty.aspx|title=James R. Doty|website=pcaobus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was preceded by [[Mark W. Olson]], a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  The first Chairman in place at the PCAOB was former President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, [[William Joseph McDonough]].  The SEC first appointed William H. Webster to the position, a prominent lawyer and former Director of both the FBI and CIA. He resigned after several weeks and prior to the Board's first official meeting (as explained below). 

==Powers==
Under Section 101 of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], the PCAOB has the power to:
* register public accounting firms that prepare audit reports for issuers and broker-dealers;
* set auditing, quality control, ethics, independence and other standards relating to the preparation of audit reports of issuers;
* conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms;
* conduct investigations and disciplinary proceedings, and impose sanctions, against registered public accounting firms and associated persons of such firms (including fines of up to $100,000 against individual auditors, and $2 million against audit firms);
* perform such other duties or functions as the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to promote high professional standards among, and improve the quality of audit services offered by, registered public accounting firms and their employees;
* sue and be sued, complain and defend, in its corporate name and through its own counsel, with the approval of the SEC, in any Federal, State or other court;
* conduct its operations, maintain offices, and exercise all of its rights and powers in any part of the United States, without regard to any qualification, licensing or other provision of state or [municipal] law;
* hire staff, accountants, attorneys and other agents as may be necessary or appropriate to the PCAOB's mission (with salaries set at a level comparable to private-sector self-regulatory, accounting, technical, supervisory, or other staff or management positions, as set out by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attract the highly skilled and experienced professionals needed to oversee global accounting firms);
* allocate, assess, and collect accounting support fees that fund the Board; and
* enter into contracts, execute instruments, incur liabilities, and do any and all other acts and things necessary, appropriate, or incidental to the conduct of its operations and the exercise of its powers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Auditors of public companies are prohibited by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to provide non-audit services, such as consulting, to their audit clients. Congress made certain exceptions for tax services, which are therefore overseen by the PCAOB. This prohibition was made as a result of allegations, in cases such as Enron and WorldCom, that auditors' independence from their clients' managers had been compromised because of the large fees that audit firms were earning from these ancillary services.

In addition, as part of the PCAOB's investigative powers, the Board may require that audit firms, or any person associated with an audit firm, provide testimony or documents in its (or his or her) possession.  If the firm or person refuses to provide this testimony or these documents, the PCAOB may suspend or bar that person or entity from the public audit industry.  The PCAOB may also seek the SEC's assistance in issuing subpoenas for testimony or documents from individuals or entities not registered with the PCAOB.

The Board's Office of the Chief Auditor advises the Board on the establishment of auditing and related professional practice standards.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pcaobus.org/standards/Pages/default.aspx|title=Standards|website=pcaobus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government oversight==
Each of these powers is subject to approval and oversight by the SEC.  Individuals and audit firms subject to PCAOB oversight may appeal PCAOB decisions (including any disciplinary actions) to the SEC and the SEC has the power to modify or overturn PCAOB rules.

==Inspection reports==
The PCAOB periodically issues Inspection Reports of registered public accounting firms. While a large part of these reports is made public (called "Part I"), portions of the inspection reports that deal with criticisms of, or potential defects in, the audit firm's quality control systems are not made public if the firm addresses those matters to the Board's satisfaction within 12 months after the report date. Those portions are made public (called "Part II"), however, if (1) the Board determines that a firm's efforts to address the criticisms or potential defects were not satisfactory, or (2) the firm makes no submission evidencing any such efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Reports/Pages/default.aspx|title=Firm Inspection Reports|website=pcaobus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The PCAOB was created in response to an ever increasing number of accounting "restatements" (corrections of past financial statements) by public companies during the 1990s, and a series of high-profile [[accounting scandals]] and record-setting bankruptcies by large public companies, notably those in 2002 involving [[WorldCom]] and [[Enron]], and the audit firm for both companies, Arthur Andersen.  Prior to the creation of the PCAOB, the audit profession was  self-regulated through its trade group, the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA).  The AICPA's Public Oversight Board was formally dissolved on March 31, 2002, though its members had resigned en masse in January 2002 to protest then-SEC Chairman [[Harvey Pitt]]'s proposal for a new private auditor oversight body to regulate the profession (a proposal which would evolve into the PCAOB).

===Appointment of Chairman Webster===
The SEC named [[William H. Webster]], to be the first PCAOB Chairman. He was a prominent lawyer and former director of both the [[FBI]] and [[CIA]].  This appointment was controversial, however, for while Webster was widely recognized for his integrity and intellect, two of the SEC's five Commissioners believed that SEC Chairman [[Harvey Pitt]] had not properly vetted the candidates or consulted with them on the appointment (and had previously agreed with them to appoint [[TIAA-CREF]] Chairman John Biggs as PCAOB Chairman).  In one of the most contentious SEC public hearings, these two Commissioners ([[Harvey Goldschmid]] and [[Roel Campos]]) publicly criticized the process of the appointment (though not Webster himself).  Webster nonetheless was approved by the SEC by a 3-2 vote to become the PCAOB's first Chairman.  An audio recording of this contentious October 25, 2002 SEC public hearing at which Webster's nomination was approved (and debated) can be heard at [http://www.connectlive.com/events/secopenmeetings/sec-102502-archive.asx here].

Just a few weeks after Webster was appointed to the PCAOB, however, another controversy erupted when newspapers reported that Webster had served on the board [[audit committee]] of [[U.S. Technologies]], a high-technology company being investigated for [[accounting irregularities]].  Pitt, whose tenure as SEC Chair had already proven controversial, found himself in an untenable position.  One of the claims made by Goldschmid during the rancorous October SEC hearing was that the candidates put forward by Pitt had not been properly vetted.  Goldschmid's criticisms seemed prescient, and this, combined with other pressures, led Pitt to announce his resignation from the SEC on election day (Nov. 4, 2002).  Webster himself announced his resignation from the PCAOB a week later -– less than three weeks after the PCAOB was set up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/12/business/12CND-ACCOUNT.html "Webster Ends His Brief Stint on S.E.C. Oversight Board"], DAVID STOUT, November 12, 2002, NY Times&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional challenge==
In February 2006, the [[Free Enterprise Fund]] and [[Beckstead and Watts, LLP]] (a small [[Nevada]]-based accounting firm) filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the PCAOB.  According to the lawsuit, the provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishing the PCAOB violated the "[[Appointments Clause]]" of the [[U.S. Constitution]], since PCAOB Board members should be viewed as "officers of the United States" because of the public purposes PCAOB serves, and, as such, must either be appointed by the [[President of the United States]], with the advice and consent of the [[U.S. Senate]], or by the "head" of a "department", whereas PCAOB's board is appointed by the SEC, rather than by the Chairman of the SEC.  The lawsuit also challenged the PCAOB as violating the Constitution's separation of powers clause, since the organization has quasi-executive, -legislative and -judicial functions.

On Aug. 22, 2008, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] upheld the PCAOB as constitutional.  The Court found that Board members are inferior officers not required to be appointed by the President, and that the President retains sufficient control of the Board via the SEC that the Board does not violate the separation of powers clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Hilzenrath | coauthors= | title=Sarbanes-Oxley Upheld By Court as Constitutional | date=2008-12-23 | publisher= | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/22/AR2008082202997.html?hpid=sec-business | work =The Washington Post | pages =D01 | accessdate = 2008-08-24 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] granted ''[[certiorari]]'' on May 18, 2009, to consider three questions:

:# Whether the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 violates the Constitution's separation of powers by vesting members of the [PCAOB] with far-reaching executive power while completely stripping the President of all authority to appoint or remove those members or otherwise supervise or control their exercise of that power, or whether, as the court of appeals held, the Act is constitutional because Congress can restrict the President's removal authority in any way it "deems best for the public interest."
:# Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that, under the Appointments Clause, PCAOB members are "inferior officers" directed and supervised by the [SEC], where the SEC lacks any authority to supervise those members personally, to remove the members for any policy-related reason or to influence the members' key investigative functions, merely because the SEC may review some of the members' work product.
:# If PCAOB members are inferior officers, whether the Act's provision for their appointment by the SEC violates the Appointments Clause either because the SEC is not a "Department" or because the five commissioners, acting collectively, are not the "Head" of the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = United States Supreme Court | url = http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/qp/08-00861qp.pdf | title = 08-861 FREE ENTERPRISE FUND V.

[[Free Enterprise Fund and Beckstead and Watts, LLP v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, et al.]], was argued on Dec. 7, 2009.  In addition to the PCAOB, the United States (represented by [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Elena Kagan]]) also appeared as a respondent in the case and argued separately, defending the constitutionality of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Thirteen ''[[amicus curiae|amici]]'', ranging from [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think-tanks like the [[Cato Institute]] to managers of state public-employee pension funds, filed briefs in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United States Supreme Court |title=Docket for 08-861 |url=http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-861.htm |accessdate=2009-11-28 |date=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006063003/http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-861.htm |archivedate=October 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2010, in a five-justice majority opinion written by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John G. Roberts]], the Supreme Court found the appointment provisions of the Act to be constitutional, but struck down the for-cause removal provision.  The Court did not accept petitioners' argument that the constitutional infirmity made all of the Board's prior activity unconstitutional; rather, it simply [[severability|severed]] the for-cause removal clause from the rest of Sarbanes-Oxley, leaving the Board itself intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Provision of Sarbanes-Oxley unconstitutionally interferes with presidential authority | last = Russell | first = Kevin | publisher = SCOTUSblog | date = June 28, 2010 | accessdate = 2010-07-05 | url = http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/06/provision-of-sarbanes-oxley-unconstitutionally-interferes-with-presidential-authority/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway''' is a [[linear park]] located in several [[Downtown Boston]] neighborhoods.  It consists of landscaped gardens, promenades, plazas, fountains, art, and specialty lighting systems that stretch over one mile through the [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]], Waterfront, and [[North End, Boston|North End]] neighborhoods.  Officially opened in October 2008, the 17-acre Greenway sits on land created from demolition of the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway]] under the [[Big Dig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/TheBigDig.aspx |title=The Big Dig - Highway Division |publisher=Massdot.state.ma.us |date=2006-01-13 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway is named after [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy]], the matriarch of the Kennedy Family who was born in the neighboring North End neighborhood. Her son, Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], played an important role in establishing the Greenway.

The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Conservancy was established as an independently incorporated non-profit organization in 2004 to guide the emerging park system and raise funds for an endowment and operations. In 2008, the State Legislature confirmed the Conservancy as the designated steward of the Rose Kennedy Greenway;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2008/Chapter306 |title=Session Laws: Chapter 306 of the Acts of 2008 |publisher=Malegislature.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Conservancy operates with a lease from the [[Massachusetts Turnpike Authority]] (now Massachusetts Department of Transportation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/files/2913/0073/6165/Lease_with_MassTurnpike_-_Execution_Copy_-_2-10-09.pdf |format=PDF |title=Lease Between the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority and the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Conservancy, Inc. |publisher=Rosekennedygreenway.org |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since February 2009, the Conservancy has operated the park, leading the maturation of this new civic space, strengthening its physical beauty, and encouraging a sense of a shared community in Boston.

The 2008 legislation established a 50%-50% public/private funding model. Through a multi-party funding agreement announced in June 2017, public funds from the State and City will represent ~20% of the operating budget, a new Greenway Business Improvement District will supply ~20% of the operating budget, and the Greenway Conservancy will generate ~60%. 

==History==
In the 1940s, planning began for a "Highway in the Skies" that would alleviate traffic congestion and provide a direct route for moving goods in and out of Boston. Construction of the elevated Central Artery began in 1951 and was completed in 1959, displacing more than 10,000 residents and demolishing some 1,000 buildings. The limitations of the [[Central Artery]] soon became painfully clear, however. In 1991, after almost a decade of planning, construction began on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, more widely known as the "[[Big Dig]]", which was recognized as one of the largest, most complex, and technologically challenging highway projects in the history of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/beyond_bigdig/ |title=/ Beyond The Big Dig |publisher=Boston.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the elevated highway to be relocated underground, Boston would be rich in prime urban land. Community and political leaders seized the opportunity to enhance Boston's city life by providing additional parks and gardens to connect some of its oldest, most diverse, and vibrant neighborhoods. The creation of the [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]] – a joint effort of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA), the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the City of Boston, and various civic groups.

On October 4, 2008, tens of thousands of visitors came together for the parks’ Inaugural Celebration with the Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/10/greenway_inaugu.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007054214/http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/10/greenway_inaugu.html |archivedate=2008-10-07 |title=A beautiful day on the Greenway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSymXt5GpgQ&amp;feature=youtu.be |title=Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Inaugural Celebration |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, on February 23, 2009 the Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy assumed operational responsibility for the parks. Today, the Greenway encompasses gardens, plazas, and tree-lined promenades. The Greenway is a key feature of the modern reinvention of Boston, Boston Harbor, the South Boston Waterfront, and the Harbor Islands.  MassDOT's obligation under state law to provide 50% of the funding for the greenway ended in 2012, and was replaced by year-to-year agreements until a proposed six-year agreement in 2017.  This would create a Business Improvement District, and also receive funding from the City of Boston (from a fund established with proceeds from the sale of the Winthrop Square garage) and MassDOT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/news/2017/06/19/greenway-funding-deal Partnership Seeks To Put The Greenway On Firmer Financial Footing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks==

===Chinatown Park===
[[File:Chinatown Park, Boston.JPG|thumb|Chinatown Park]]
Located at the southern end of the Greenway, this one-acre linear park contains design elements drawn from Asian traditions and art work. Designed by Carol R. Johnson and Associates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crja.com/project/chinatown-park/ |title=Chinatown |publisher=Crja.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[May Sun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Southworth|first1=Susan and Michael|title=AIA Guide to Boston|date=2008|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-0-7627-4337-7|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinatown Park has a serpentine walkway edged by bamboo within bright red sculptural elements and a fountain that suggests a waterfall and shallow riverbed.

In 2011, the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Conservancy partnered with local community groups, residents, and abutters to add the plaza tables, chairs and shade umbrellas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/downtown/2011/10/new_seating_shade_for_chinatow.html |title=New seating, shade for Chinatown Park |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the City of Boston renovated neighboring Mary Soo Hoo Park to the south. Large festivals, such as the Chinatown Main Street Festival, the August Moon Festival, and Films at the Gate, are hosted in the plaza. In 2016, the PlayCubes children's climbing structure was added to the plaza temporarily as part of the Design Museum Boston's Extraordinary Playscapes exhibit.

===Dewey Square Park===
[[File:Dewey Square Farmers Market Boston.jpg|thumb|Farmers market in Dewey Square]]
Located between Congress and Summer Streets along Atlantic Avenue, [[Dewey Square|Dewey Square Park]] joins the major transportation hub of [[South Station]] to the Financial District. The park has gardens, lawn areas, and the adjacent plaza, which was designed to draw in commuters and nearby workers and residents. The tables, chairs, and cluster of food trucks have made Dewey Square Park a popular lunch destination, especially in the warm seasons when the plaza features the twice-weekly Boston Public Market Association’s farmers market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/downtown/2011/10/dewey_square_market_vendors_sh.html |title=Dewey Square Market vendors share park with Occupy Boston |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food truck and other major festivals are hosted here.

In 2011, Dewey Square was the site of the [[Occupy Boston]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2011/10/13/occupy_boston_a_view_of_life_inside_the_tent_city/ |title=Occupy Boston: A view of life inside the tent city - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/downtown/2011/10/at_bostons_dewey_square_a_prot.html |title=At Boston's Dewey Square, a protest of varied voices |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/downtown/2011/10/occupy_bostons_signs_get_the_m.html |title=Occupy Boston's signs get the message across |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/downtown/2011/11/with_winter_closing_in_occupy.html |title=With winter closing in, Occupy Boston protesters debate next moves |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent redesign of the planting includes pollinator garden, raised beds planted with edibles, a [[rain garden]], and a small orchard; produce harvested from the edible garden is donated to hunger-relief charities.

===Fort Point Channel Parks===
The Fort Point Channel Parks are located between Oliver and Congress Streets along Atlantic Avenue, they are often referred to as the "New American Gardens" for their wide variety of trees and flowers that are often found in gardens of typical New England homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tobiaswolflandscape.wordpress.com/607-2/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023010632/http://tobiaswolflandscape.wordpress.com/607-2/ |archivedate=2012-10-23 |title=Fort Point Channel Parks and Dewey Square Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tobiaswolflandscape.wordpress.com/594-2/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023011026/http://tobiaswolflandscape.wordpress.com/594-2/ |archivedate=2012-10-23 |title=Urban Arboretum, Rose Kennedy Greenway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wharf District Parks===
[[File:Wharf District Park fountain, Boston.jpg|thumb|Rings Fountain in the Wharf District Parks]]
The Wharf District Parks connect [[Faneuil Hall]] and the Financial District with Boston Harbor.

During the warmer months, the Wharf District Parks host the Greenway Open Market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwayopenmarket.com/ |title=greenwayopenmarket.com |publisher=greenwayopenmarket.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; food vendors, concerts and fitness classes. Large events also occur across the Wharf District Parks, such as the Boston Local Food Fest and the FIGMENT participatory art festival. The Wharf District Parks are home to the Mothers’ Walk, a curving pathway that consists of pavers engraved with names and personal messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/donate/mothers_walk/ |title=Mothers’ Walk - Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy |publisher=Rosekennedygreenway.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greenway Carousel at the Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation Grove, inspired by the imaginations of Boston’s school children, opened on August 31, 2013.

===Armenian Heritage Park===
[[File:Greenway Armenian Heritage Park 2012.JPG|thumb|Armenian Heritage Park]]
The [[Armenian Heritage Park]] is dedicated to the victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]] and acknowledges the history of Boston as a port of entry for immigrants worldwide, and celebrates those who have migrated to Massachusetts shores and contributed to American life and culture. The Park consists of two key features surrounded by seating, brick paving and landscaping. The Abstract Sculpture, a split dodecahedron, is mounted on a Reflecting Pool, represents the immigrant experience.  [[:File:Boston Armenian Heritage Park panorama view 2015.jpg|The Labyrinth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stapleton|first1=John Paul|title=What to know about the Greenway labyrinth|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/04/28/what-know-about-greenway-labyrinth/jk797WgQTV84z803AKTePK/story.html|accessdate=1 May 2016|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; a circular winding path paved in granite and set in lawn, celebrates life's journey.

===North End Parks===
[[File:2008 Greenway Boston 2739303146.jpg|thumb|North End Parks]]
The [[North End Parks]] reflect the scale of the adjacent North End neighborhood. Designed by Crosby, Schlessinger, Smallridge LLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North End Parks|url=http://www.cssboston.com/portfolio/nep/|website=Crosby, Schlessinger, Smallridge|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gustafson Guthrie Nichol Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ggnltd.com/north-end-parks |title=Gustafson Guthrie Nichol |publisher=Ggnltd.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  lawns surrounded by densely planted perimeter beds are designed to evoke a formal feel of past European style gardens with boxwood hedges enclosing an array of perennials. Along the eastern edge, a pergola covers a long "front porch" that provides both a place for sitting and an overlook for the lawn and the historic architecture beyond.  A shallow water "canal" runs the length with vertical water jets adding a fountain like scene.  This fountain reflects a period approximately a century ago when a canal connected the harbor to now defunct industrial operations. During the warmer months, the North End Parks host numerous free fitness classes and other events.

==Land use==
[[File:Quincy Market and Parcel 12, Boston.JPG|thumb|Greenway open space and development parcels]]
Big Dig planners debated the mix between open space and buildings on the land to be freed up by the removal of the elevated highway. Proposals in 1985 by the state and in 1988 by the [[Boston Society of Architects]] suggested that most of the land should be used for mid-rise buildings.&lt;ref name="Luberoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luberoff|first1=David|title=Civic Leadership and the Big Dig|journal=Rappaport Institute Working Papers|date=3 May 2004|page=9|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/68572/1247098/version/1/file/abc_1.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1991, the [[Boston Redevelopment Authority|Boston Redevelopment Authority's]] "Boston 2000" plan called for 75% of the land "to be developed as a series of parks and urban plazas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston 2000: A Plan for the Central Artery|url=https://archive.org/details/boston2000planfo00bost|publisher=Boston Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991 environmental certificate for the project adopted this idea, mandating that not more than 25% of the surface could be developed, with the rest maintained as public open space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Central Artery Environmental Oversight Committee|url=https://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/artery/artery_4.asp|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlassAct" /&gt; The certificate specifically required that three parcels near South Station, encompassing about four acres of land, be turned over to the [[Massachusetts Horticultural Society|Massachusetts Horticultural Society (MassHort)]] for outdoor gardens and an enclosed winter garden.&lt;ref name="Luberoff" /&gt; And the certificate required that the three ramps at Parcels 6, 12, and 18 be covered "to mitigate their impacts on the surface environment."&lt;ref name="Luberoff" /&gt;

The 2001 Central Artery Corridor Master Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Massachusetts Turnpike Authority|title=Boston Central Artery Corridor Master Plan|url=https://bark.cwmars.org/eg/opac/record/590303?loc=111;qtype=identifier%7Coclc;query=47936437|website=C/W MARS|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed the 1991 mandate by designating specific parcels for open space or for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Economic Development Research Group|title=Real Estate Impacts of the  Massachusetts Turnpike Authority  and the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project, Volume II|date=February 2006|publisher=Massachusetts Turnpike Authority|page=17|url=http://www.edrgroup.com/pdf/mta-economic-v2.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCown|first1=James|title=Boston Reconnecting|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2001/0926/building_2-1.html|accessdate=6 May 2016|work=Architecture Week|date=26 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A map showed the location of each open space and development parcel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parcel Land Use|url=https://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Portals/8/Images/bigdig/parcelmap.gif|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parcels 19, 21, and 22 were assigned to MassHort. The three parcels containing highway ramps were designated for development.  All of the other parcels directly above the underground highway from Parcel 17 north to Parcel 7 were designated as parkland.  All of the parcels not located directly above the new tunnel were designated for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Parcels|url=http://archive.boston.com/beyond_bigdig/parcels/|website=Beyond The Big Dig|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A surface road carrying local traffic existed underneath most of the length of the elevated Central Artery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=City of Boston|title=Central Artery|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/cityofbostonarchives/22335996018/in/photolist-eahGhu-eahGib-fTYAVJ-Ai9K47-A2KPrC|website=Flickr|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Big Dig plans called for the creation of a pair of one-way surface roads extending the length of the Greenway, to handle local traffic. Greenway parks and development sites would be bordered by these surface roads as well as by cross streets separating each parcel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parcel map|url=http://wp.streetwise.co/wp-content/uploads//2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-02-at-8.32.47-AM.png|publisher=BostInno|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts Horticultural Society parcels===

In 1991, the Turnpike Authority authorized the [[Massachusetts Horticultural Society|Massachusetts Horticultural Society (MassHort)]] to develop gardens and an indoor "Garden Under Glass" on Big Dig Parcels 19, 21, and 22, near [[Dewey Square]].&lt;ref name="GlassAct"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Robert L.|title=Glass Act|url=http://archive.boston.com/beyond_bigdig/news/artery_033003_magazine_1.htm|accessdate=1 May 2016|work=Boston Globe|date=30 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Thomas|title=Pike authority tries to help garden grow|url=http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2006/06/28/pike_authority_tries_to_help_garden_grow/|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=Boston Globe|date=28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But MassHort was unable to raise sufficient funds for the $100 million project, and cancelled it in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thoughts While Planting Daffodils Along the Greenway|url=http://theprincipalundergardener.blogspot.com/2012/11/thoughts-while-planting-daffodils-along.html|website=The Principal Undergardener|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parcels were then turned over to the Greenway Conservancy, which created Dewey Square Park (Parcel 22) and Fort Point Channel Parks (Parcels 19 &amp; 21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photo of Parcels 19, 21, and 22|url=http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/getattachment/b1fbbdf9-feda-4909-98c4-958f1165a5de|accessdate=8 May 2016|work=Boston Redevelopment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other park parcels===
Parcels 8 and 10 became the [[North End Parks]].  Parcel 13 became the [[Armenian Heritage Park]].  Parcels 14 through 17 became the Wharf District Parks.  Parcel 23D became the Chinatown Park.

===Ramp parcels===
At three locations along the Greenway, ramps to and from the underground highway occupy some of the surface.  The Big Dig's 1991 environmental approval certificate committed the state to cover the ramps.&lt;ref name="Luberoff" /&gt; Nonprofit organizations were designated to develop buildings on the three sites, and the Massachusetts Legislature authorized $31 million to help pay the costs of building on top of the ramps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Casey|title=Finishing touches eyed for the Greenway|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/11/02/finishing-touches-eyed-for-greenway/lA4YhGY0t7zBGIXyUkPlqI/story.html|work=Boston Globe|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all three proposals were abandoned due to high costs between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref name=Conti&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conti|first1=Matt|title=YMCA Withdraws from Plans to Build on Greenway|url=http://northendwaterfront.com/2011/02/ymca-withdraws-from-plans-to-build-on-greenway/|publisher=North End Waterfront News|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the Boston Redevelopment Authority initiated a review of the three parcels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Artery Ramp Parcel Study|url=http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/planning/planning-initiatives/greenway-ramp-parcel-study|publisher=Boston Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary studies have proposed landscaping and partial coverage of some of the ramps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose Kennedy Greenway Ramp Parcels Study|url=http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/getattachment/b6dbd0c9-7e18-4d9b-a085-9b07e5a05498|publisher=Boston Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeLuca|first1=Nick|title=New Greenway Design Could Be a Boston Version of NY's High Line|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/01/19/rose-kennedy-greenway-massdot-concepts-for-ramp-parcel-coverings/|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=BostInno|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissions by the Greenway Conservancy have won 7 awards from Americans for the Arts’ Public Art Network, among the most in the country since 2012. Annually, PAN recognizes the best 50 new public art installations and has recognized Os Gemeos, “The Giant of Boston” (2012); Shinique Smith, “Seven Moon Junction” (2014); Kyu Seok Oh, “Wandering Sheep” (2015); Matthew Hoffman, “MAY THIS NEVER END” (2016); Mehdi Ghadyanloo, “Spaces Of Hope” (2017); Meredith James, “Far from this setting in which I now find myself” (2017); and Mark Reigelman, “The Meeting House” (2017).

A series of temporary murals are rotated each fall on the 70' x 76' wall of the air intake structure overlooking Dewey Square Park. In 2012, Brazilian twin brothers Otavio and Gustavo Pandolfo ([[Os Gêmeos]]) painted a mural on the wall, in conjunction with their first solo exhibition in the United States at Boston’s [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston|Institute of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Os Gemeos|url=https://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/os-gemeos|website=icaboston.org|publisher=Institute of Contemporary Art Boston|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/downtown/2012/08/greenway_visitors_speak_out_on.html |title=Greenway visitors speak out on mural controversy |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmidt |first=Christopher |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2121063,00.html |title=Writing on the Wall |publisher=TIME |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2013, a new mural, "Remanence: Salt and Light (Part II)" by [[Matthew Ritchie]] replaced the Os Gemeos mural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/visit/public-art/matthew-ritchie-mural/ |title=Matthew Ritchie Mural |publisher=rosekennedygreenway.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third mural on the Greenway Wall was "Seven Moon Junction"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shinique Smith|url=http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/visit/public-art/past-exhibitions/shinique-smith-mural/|website=rosekennedygreenway.org|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Shinique Smith]], installed in 2014.

Shara Hughes’ “Carving Out Fresh Options” was installed on the Greenway Wall.

In 2015, the Conservancy commissioned the installation of a work called "As If It Were Already Here"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As If It Were Already Here, Boston, MA, 2015|url=http://www.echelman.com/project/boston-greenway/|website=echelman.com|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Janet Echelman]].

==Sustainable horticulture==
The Conservancy uses organic and sustainable landscape management programs to maintain the parks and features of the Greenway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organic Turf Maintenance on a Large Scale at the Rose Kennedy Greenway|url=http://www.ecolandscaping.org/12/uncategorized/organic-turf-maintenance-large-scale-rose-kennedy-greenway/|website=Ecological Landscape Alliance|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greenway is Boston’s only organically maintained Public Park and one of a handful of organically maintained urban parks in the United States. Organic maintenance means no expenditures for toxic chemicals, and lower expenditures for watering. Plants are healthier, more resilient, and better able to withstand the wear of public use. The Conservancy’s practice of using composting and compost tea instead of herbicides and toxins also ensures that run-off from the parks will not pollute Boston Harbor or harm the delicate marine life. Children and pets can freely and safely play on the park lawns without the worry of pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organic Park Care|url=http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/about-us/organics/|publisher=Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his three terms as congressman, he ran for [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] in the [[2010 Philippine general election|May 2010 elections]]; then-Representative [[Liza Maza]] of the women's partylist group [[GABRIELA]] and Ocampo were fielded by the Makabayan coalition and were included as guest senatorial candidates of the [[Nacionalista Party]], a mainstream Philippine political party whose presidential standard bearer, Senator [[Manny Villar]], they supported.

After the elections, on August 21, 2010, Ocampo started a weekly opinion column in the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' titled "At Ground Level".

==Activism==

Ocampo was a business editor of the pre-martial law ''Manila Times'' and was the founder of the Business and Economic Reporters Association of the Philippines. He is a lifetime member of the National Press Club.

[[List of Presidents of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared [[Proclamation No. 1081|martial law on September 21, 1972]] and Ocampo, among others, went underground. In 1973, Ocampo co-founded the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)]], seeking to unite various anti-dictatorship forces.

In 1976, he was arrested and incarcerated as a political prisoner. For the next nine years he was severely tortured in various prison camps. At one point, he shared a cell with detained ''[[Philippine Collegian]]'' editor-in-chief [[Abraham Sarmiento, Jr.]] Though tried by a military court for rebellion,  he was never found guilty. In 1985, while on pass to vote at the National Press Club annual elections, he escaped from the soldiers guarding him and rejoined the underground revolutionary movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11011936_10152938486483412_2594452212084457849_n.jpg?oh=e464cee33902250c7325a908043966fd&amp;oe=55C52EB2&amp;__gda__=1438625188_bdec3f451aaaeeb6ab587d2edef292e0 RP alarm for newsman]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Manila Evening Post'', May 7, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dictatorship fell in 1986, President [[Corazon Aquino]] called for peace talks with the communists. Ocampo headed the peace negotiating panel of the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|NDF]], which represents the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and the [[New People's Army]]. When the talks collapsed due to the killing of 18 farmers at a rally near the [[Malacañan Palace]] on January 22, 1987, Ocampo returned to the underground.

In 1989, he was rearrested together with his wife, Carolina Malay,  Three years later in 1992, a year after his wife was released, he was freed. Neither was found guilty of any crime.

November 28, 2018 Mr. Satur Ocampo together with ACT Teacher Rep. France Castro and over 70 others was arrested for kidnapping and human trafficking charges over the transport of Lumad minors from the town of Talaingod, Davao Del Norte. Ocampo's group was released after posting bail amounting of PHP 80,000.00 each.

{{Update|reason=Uniform Guidance in 2 CFR 200 Subpart F has superseded OMB Circular A-133|date=February 2018}}
In the United States, the '''Single Audit''', Subpart F of the '''OMB Uniform Guidance''', is a rigorous, organization-wide [[audit]] or examination of an entity that expends $750,000 or more of [[administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance]] (commonly known as [[federal funds]], [[federal grant]]s, or federal awards) received for its operations.&lt;ref name="OFFM"&gt;OMB Office of Federal Financial Management, [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial/fin_single_audit.html The Single Audit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507211049/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial/fin_single_audit.html |date=2009-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_200"&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/a133/a133_revised_2007.pdf OMB Circular A-133]; Subpart B – ''Audits''; §___.200 – ''Audit requirements'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;[http://www.tgci.com/magazine/02fall/audit1.asp ''Understanding Single Audits''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920140654/http://www.tgci.com/magazine/02fall/audit1.asp |date=2006-09-20 }} by Henry Flood, Grantsmanship Center Magazine, Fall 2002, retrieved on June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Usually performed annually,&lt;ref name="a133_220"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart B – ''Audits''; §___.220 – ''Frequency of audits''&lt;/ref&gt; the Single Audit's objective is to provide [[Assurance (accounting)|assurance]] to the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] as to the management and use of such funds by [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States#Recipients|recipients]] such as states, cities, universities, non-profit organizations, and Indian Tribes. The audit is typically performed by an independent [[certified public accountant]] (CPA) and encompasses both financial and [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] components. The Single Audits must be submitted to the [[Federal Audit Clearinghouse]] along with a data collection form, Form SF-SAC.

==History==
Before implementing the Single Audit, the federal government relied on numerous audits carried out on individual federally funded programs to ensure these funds were spent properly. Because the government had numerous agencies awarding hundreds of different programs, the task of auditing all programs became increasingly difficult and time consuming. To improve this situation, the Single Audit Act of 1984 standardized audit requirements for States, local governments, and Indian tribal governments that receive and use federal financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Background; pg. 1-1, par. 1 through 4 and pg. 1–2, par. 1 through 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) issued OMB Circular A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," to help recipients and auditors implement the new Single Audit. In 1990, OMB administratively extended the Single Audit process to non-profit organizations by issuing OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Organizations" which superseded OMB A-128. These new guides and provisions standardized the Single Audit in the United States to include all states, local governments, non-profit organizations, and institutions that receive federal funds from the US government.&lt;ref name="a133_200"&gt;OMB Circular A-133 Subpart A – ''General''; §___.100 – ''Purpose''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_200(1)"&gt;OMB Circular A-133 Title 1 – ''Purpose''&lt;/ref&gt; On December 26, 2013, OMB issued the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, which standardized compliance and audit requirements for government entities, non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education.&lt;ref name="Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/26/2013-30465/uniform-administrative-requirements-cost-principles-and-audit-requirements-for-federal-awards|title=Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards|date=26 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These consolidated requirements are codified in Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 200 with the single audit requirements in Subpart F of this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ab9ff8f4b35e7a1839a52514e2e69c34&amp;mc=true&amp;node=sp2.1.200.f&amp;rgn=div6|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|website=www.ecfr.gov|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms 2 CFR 200 and Uniform Guidance can be used interchangeably.

==Purpose and components==
The federal government provides an extensive array of federal assistance to recipients reaching over $400 billion annually.&lt;ref name="OFFM"/&gt; This assistance is provided through thousands of individual grants and awards annually for the purpose of benefiting the general public in the areas of education, health, public safety, welfare, and public works, among others. However, as a condition of receiving this assistance recipients must comply with applicable federal and state [[United States law|laws and regulations]], as well as any particular provisions tied with the specific assistance.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro3"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part I: Background, Purpose and Applicability; Overview of this Supplement; Internal Control; pg. 1–6, par. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Single Audit provides the Federal government with assurance that these recipients comply with such directives by having an independent external source (the CPA) report on such compliance. However, it only applies to state, local government, and nonprofit recipients that expend $750,000 or more of such assistance in one year.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070621150845/http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/financial/fin_single_audit.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041012/http://www.aicpa.org/audcommctr/toolkitsnpo/Single_Audit_Act.htm|title=Single Audits Circular No. A-133: Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations|date=27 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Single Audit encompasses an examination of a recipient's financial records, [[financial statements]], federal award transactions and [[expenditure]]s, the general management of its operations, internal control systems, and federal assistance it received during the audit period (the time period of recipient operations examined in the Single Audit, which is usually covers a natural or fiscal year).&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_500"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of Audit''&lt;/ref&gt; The Single Audit is divided into two areas: Compliance and Financial.

The compliance component of a Single Audit covers the study and understanding (planning stage) as well as the testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="a133_500"/&gt; The financial component is exactly like a [[financial audit]] of a non-federal entity which includes the audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Depending on the recipient, the Single Audit can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This is because there are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating. Therefore, the Single Audit differs from recipient to recipient and from federal program to program.

For these reasons, the federal government requires auditors to perform the compliance audit of a recipient with a planning stage and an exam stage. During the first stage, or planning stage, the auditor must study the recipient, determine whether there is a high or low risk that the recipient does not comply with laws and regulations, identify federal programs, and evaluate such programs. The second stage, or exam or audit stage, is where the auditor actually audits the federal assistance and programs.&lt;ref name="a133_500"/&gt; The planning stage is considered an integral part of the Single Audit because it allows the auditor to design and perform the audit based on the qualities, characteristics and needs of the recipient to be audited.

==Compliance audit: planning stage==

===Low- or high-risk auditee===
Before determining which federal programs to examine, the auditor must first determine, based on specific criteria, whether the recipient is a '''high-risk''' auditee or a '''low-risk''' auditee. A high-risk auditee is a recipient which has a high risk of not complying with federal laws and regulations, while a low-risk auditee is the exact opposite. The Uniform Guidance has set certain requirements a recipient must meet to be considered a low-risk auditee. This includes the following to be evaluated for each of the preceding two audit periods:&lt;ref name="a133_530"&gt;2 CFR 200.520&lt;/ref&gt;

* Single audits have been performed on an annual basis in prior years.
* The auditor's opinions on the [[financial statements]] and the Schedule of Federal Expenditures (discussed later) were unmodified.
* There are no material weaknesses identified.
* The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.
*None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs:
**Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs;
**A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs; or
**Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the audit period.

The Uniform Guidance uses the high and low risk determination to regulate the dollar amount of federal expenditures to be audited. Although the actual work necessary for a Single Audit is established by the auditor, the OMB has set a limit for auditing high-risk and low-risk auditees. For high-risk auditees, the auditor is required to audit not less than 40% of all the federal assistance received during the year. For low-risk auditees, that limit is decreased to 20%.&lt;ref name="a133_520f"&gt;2 CFR 200.518(f)&lt;/ref&gt;

This determination affects the entire Single Audit because the auditor adjusts the scope of the audit accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion to the federal government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient procedures to confirm the opinion is correct.&lt;ref name="a133_500d4"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (d)(4) – ''Compliance''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification of major programs===

==== Step 1: Type A or Type B ====
To determine which federal programs to audit under the compliance audit, federal assistance expended by the recipient (also called '''federal expenditures''') during one year is identified by federal program name, Federal agency and [[Federal assistance in the United States#Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance#CFDA number|CFDA number]]. These federal expenditures are then combined to determine the total amount expended during the year. Any recipient whose total federal expenditures during a year equal or exceed $750,000 requires a Single Audit.&lt;ref&gt;2 CFR 200.501&lt;/ref&gt; If the recipient does not meet this threshold, a Single Audit is not required, although the recipient may elect to have a program-specific audit (an audit of a single federal program, without auditing the entire entity). Once this determination is performed, 2 CFR 200.518 requires that federal programs be categorized in two groups: Type A programs and Type B programs.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"&gt;2 CFR 200.518&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Type A program''' – a Type A program is any federal program within a recipient that meets the following criteria:
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than or equal to $750,000 and less than or equal to $25 million, then any program that expends more than $750,000 is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $25 million and less than or equal to $100 million, then any program that expends more than 3% of total federal awards is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $100 million and less than or equal to $1 billion, then any program that expends more than $3 million is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $1 billion and less than or equal to $10 billion, then any program that expends more than 0.3% of total federal awards is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $10 billion and less than or equal to $20 billion, then any program that expends more than $30 million is Type A.
** If total federal awards expended during the audit period are greater than $20 billion, then any program that expends more than 0.15% of total federal awards is Type A.
In other words, if a recipient expended a total of $25 million or less in federal assistance, then any single program which expended $750,000 or more is considered a Type A. If a recipient expended $30 million in federal assistance, then any single program which expended $900,000 or more (3% × $30,000,000) is considered a Type A program.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt; Special consideration must be given to large loan programs in determining the Type A threshold.
* '''Type B program''' – A Type B program is any single program which does not meet the Type A requirements.&lt;ref name="a133_520b2"&gt;2 CFR 200.518(b)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
Example 1 – The City of Example operates a Section 8 program, and expended $950,000 in Section 8 funds and $5,000,000 of total federal assistance during the year. Since this amount does not exceed $25,000,000, the Section 8 program is considered a Type A program because $950,000 exceeds the $750,000 threshold.

Example 2 – Using the same data in Example 1 with the exception that the City of Example now expended a total of $30,000,000 in federal assistance, the Section 8 program would meet the Type A threshold because $950,000 is greater than $30,000,000 x 3% ($900,000).

Example 3 – Using the same data in Example 1 with the exception that the City of Example now expended a total of $100,000,000 in federal assistance, the Section 8 program would not meet the Type A threshold because $950,000 is less than $3 million, and would be considered a Type B program.

====Step 2 &amp; 3: Risk assessment====
{{main|Risk assessment}}

After determining which programs are Type A and Type B, the Uniform Guidance requires that the auditor study and understand the operations and internal controls of such programs within the entity, and perform&lt;ref name="a133_520c"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (c) – ''Step 2''&lt;/ref&gt; and document&lt;ref name="a133_520g"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (g) – ''Documentation of risk''&lt;/ref&gt; a [[risk assessment]] based on such study to determine whether each program has either a high or low risk of not complying with laws and regulations. Auditor may consider numerous factors including current and prior audit experience, good or poor internal controls over Federal programs, many or no prior audit findings, continuous or lack of oversight exercised by the federal government over the recipient, evidence or knowledge of fraud, and the inherent risk of the Federal program.&lt;ref name="a133_525"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.525 – ''Criteria for Federal program risk''&lt;/ref&gt;

For a Type A program to be considered low risk according to 2 CFR 200.518, it must have been audited as a major program at least once in the past two years and must not have had:&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;
* Material weaknesses in internal control
* A modified opinion in the audit report
* Known or likely questioned costs exceeding 5% of total federal award expenditures

For any Type A program considered to be a high risk of not complying, the Uniform Guidance requires that the auditor to perform a compliance audit on that program.&lt;ref name="a133_520e"&gt;OMB Circular A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.520 – ''Major program determination''; section (e) – ''Step 4''&lt;/ref&gt; For a Type A program that is considered to be of low risk, then the auditor is not required to perform a compliance audit, although the Uniform Guidance allows the auditor to do so if he/she chooses to.&lt;ref name="a133_520e" /&gt; Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment,&lt;ref name="a133_525" /&gt; the Uniform Guidance does have two requirements for a program to be considered low risk.

In assessing the risk of Type B programs, auditors should use professional judgement and criteria established in the Uniform Guidance. According to 2 CFR 200.518, a minimum number of Type B programs must be identified as high risk, calculated as 25% of the number of low-risk Type A programs (rounded up). In assessing risk, auditors are encouraged to use an approach that allows different programs to be identified as high risk over time. The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on smaller Type B programs with expenditures that do not exceed 25% of the Type A threshold determined in step 1. Type B programs which have a low risk of not complying are not required to be audited.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;

==== Step 4: Major program determination &amp; percentage of coverage ====
High-risk Type A and high-risk Type B programs are considered major programs and must be audited. The auditor then totals all of the federal award expenditures for the identified major programs and divides by the total federal award expenditures for the entity as a whole. For low-risk auditees, major program expenditures as a percentage of total award expenditures must be at least 20%. For high-risk auditees, the required coverage percentage is increased to 40%. If the identified major programs do not meet the required coverage percentage, then the auditor must select additional programs to audit until the required coverage percentage is met.&lt;ref name="a133_520b"/&gt;

==Compliance audit: exam stage==
After the auditor determines which federal programs to audit, the auditor performs a compliance audit that scrutinizes operations of the program—examining files, documents, contracts, checks, etc. The auditor investigates, to some degree, transactions between the federal program and other parties. These functions are compared with the laws and regulations applicable to a program to see if they complied or not. The examination does not require observing every single document and every single process generated by the program, nevertheless the auditor is required to perform enough procedures to form an opinion on whether the program (as a whole) complied with laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="a133_500d"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (d) – ''Compliance''&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the amount of federal regulations, the federal government has provided certain guides and literature to assist the auditor in the examination, which includes the OMB Compliance Supplement and the Compliance requirements:&lt;ref name="a133_500d"/&gt;

===OMB compliance supplement===
The OMB Compliance Supplement is a large and extensive guide created by the OMB for Single Audits, and is considered the most important tool of both the auditor and the recipient when performing, or being subject to, a Single Audit.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt; It was created following amendments in 1996 to the Single Audit Act and serves to identify existing important compliance requirements that the Federal Government expects to be considered as part of a Single Audit. Without it, auditors would need to research thousands of laws and regulations for each single program of a recipient to determine which compliance requirements are important to the Federal Government. For Single Audits, the Supplement replaces any agency audit guides and other audit requirement documents for individual Federal programs.&lt;ref name="OMB_intro"/&gt;

===Compliance requirements===
{{main|Compliance requirements}}

Compliance requirements are series of directives provided by Federal agencies that summarize hundreds of laws and regulations applicable to federal assistance and are important to the successful management of such assistance. The OMB created 14 basic and standard compliance requirements for which recipients must always comply with when receiving and using federal assistance, and provided detailed explanations, discussions, and guidance about them in the OMB Compliance Supplement.&lt;ref name="OMB_cr"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part III: Compliance Requirements&lt;/ref&gt; These compliance requirements only serve as guidelines for compliance with the specific laws and regulations applicable to the assistance and their objectives are designed to be generic in nature, because of the amount of different federal programs provided by the government. For example, many federal programs have eligibility requirements for individuals or organizations to participate in such programs because they have been established by either laws, regulations, or contract provisions. However, while the criterion for determining eligibility varies from program to program, the objective of the Eligibility compliance requirement that "only eligible and qualified individuals or organizations participate" is consistent and universal across all federal assistance programs. This eligibility universal criteria is called the '''Eligibility''' compliance requirement.&lt;ref name="OMB_E"&gt;OMB Circular A-133: Compliance Supplement; Part III: Compliance Requirements, pg. 3-E-1, Eligibility&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial audit==
{{main|Financial audit}}

The Single Audit requires that a recipient prepare [[financial statements]] that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited.&lt;ref name="a133_310a"&gt;2 CFR 200.510(a)&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires that a [[financial audit]] be performed on the recipient, which includes the federal assistance operations as well as the non-federal assistance operations. Tests of transactions and account balances are performed to ensure that the information presented in the financial statements, and [[notes to the financial statements|notes]] thereof, are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&lt;ref name="a133_500b"&gt;2 CFR 200.514(b)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the recipient must prepare a Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA), which is supplementary information to the financial statements unique to recipients of federal assistance that details all the federal assistance expended by the recipient during the year, categorized by federal program.&lt;ref name="a133_310b"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.310 – ''Financial Statements''; section (b) – ''Schedule of Federal Expenditures''&lt;/ref&gt; The auditor must then audit and report on this Schedule "in relation to" the financial statements as a whole.

==Data Collection and Reporting Package==
After the Single Audit is concluded, the recipient prepares two documents: a "Data Collection Form and a "Reporting Package". The data collection form, Form SF-SAC, is a standard form which is basically a summary of the Single Audit. It includes details of the auditor, a list of the federal programs audited, and a summary of any audit findings reported by the auditor. The Reporting Package includes all the auditor's final reports along with the recipient's financial statements. It includes:&lt;ref name="a133_320c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''; section (c) – ''Reporting Package''&lt;/ref&gt;

* Auditor's reports
* Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) – This serves as an introduction to the recipient's financial statements where the recipient's management (e.g., Governors, in the case of states; Mayors, in the case of cities; President, in the case of non-profit organizations, etc.) discusses the results of operations and other financial information, offering insight and detailed description about the recipient itself.
* Recipient's financial statements – This contains the financial statements required by the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB), which includes the Government-wide statements as well as the Fund Financial Statements.
* Recipient's [[notes to the financial statements]] – This includes any notes and disclosures for the financial statements as required by [[US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP).
* Supplemental Information – This section includes both financial and non-financial information relative to the recipient which is not covered in the MD&amp;A or the financial statements and their respective notes.
* Schedule of Federal Award Expenditures – This document details all federal assistance expenditures made by the recipient during the audit period, categorized by the federal program and federal agency.
* Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs – If the auditor finds situations where the recipient did not comply with laws and regulations, where internal controls are deficient, or a situation of illegal acts or fraud, the auditor is required to report such situations to the federal government in this section, as well as any questioned costs. Questioned costs are amounts that the recipient expended, but which the auditor has determined that they were not permitted and must be returned to the federal government.&lt;ref name="a133_505"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.505 – ''Audit reporting''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schedule of Prior Audit Findings – In this section, the auditor is required to follow up and report about the recipient's corrective action on any audit findings reported in prior years.

Both the Data Collection and the Reporting Package are kept by the recipient with copies submitted to the [[Federal Audit Clearinghouse]] (FAC), and to any Federal agency who specifically requests it.&lt;ref name="a133_320c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''; section (d) – Submission to clearinghouse''&lt;/ref&gt; Federal guidelines require recipients to submit the documents no more than 30 days after the auditor submits his reports or 9 months after the final day of the audit period, whichever comes first.&lt;ref name="a133_320"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart C – ''Auditees''; §___.320 – ''Report submission''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditor responsibility==
The auditor is responsible for conducting the actual audit of the recipient in accordance with [[Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards]] (GAGAS)&lt;ref name="a133_500a"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (a) – ''General''&lt;/ref&gt; and using the guidance provided by the OMB Circular A-133 and its Compliance Supplement, all of which establish certain rules to follow during the Single Audit. The auditor must establish audit objectives that determine whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations. They must research the recipient's federal assistance awards and programs to determine applicability of specific laws and regulations. They must understand the recipient, its organization, operations, internal control systems, and ability to responsibly manage federal assistance. They must perform audit procedures (some of which are suggested by the Compliance Supplement) to meet these audit objectives.

The auditor must understand the recipient's internal control system to determine if the recipient has proper safeguards that help manage federal assistance responsibly. After obtaining sufficient knowledge of that system, the auditor must perform audit procedures to verify the recipient's internal control system works properly, and the recipient's federal program operations comply with laws and regulations (e.g., the compliance audit portion of the Single Audit).&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a133_500c"&gt;OMB A-133; Subpart E – ''Auditors''; §___.500 – ''Scope of audit''; section (c) – ''Internal control''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AICPA"&gt;''The Single Audit Act'', AICPA&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Single Audit, the auditor must prepare and submit three individual reports to the recipient and to the federal government. The first report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on whether the recipient's financial statements are presented in conformity with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, identical to a financial audit's report on a non-recipient entity. The second report is about the status of internal controls relative to the financial statements and major programs. The third report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on the degree to which the recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal assistance awards. Following the last two reports, if the Single Audit produced audit findings, the auditor must prepare the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs discussed earlier.&lt;ref name="a133_505"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AICPA"/&gt;

The auditor's judgment is necessary to determine which audit procedures are sufficient to achieve the audit objectives, and whether additional or alternative audit procedures are needed to achieve such objectives. The auditor is responsible for determining the nature, timing, and extent of the audit procedures necessary to meet the audit objectives (i.e., it is the auditor who determines the necessary amount of his/her audit work needed to form an opinion on whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations).

[[File:Waldorf Hotel 1893.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Waldorf Hotel (1893)]]
The '''Waldorf–Astoria''' originated as two hotels, built side-by-side by feuding relatives on [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]].  Built in 1893 and expanded in 1897, the Waldorf–Astoria was razed in 1929 to make way for construction of the [[Empire State Building]]. Its successor, the current [[Waldorf Astoria New York]], was built on [[Park Avenue]] in 1931.

The original Waldorf Hotel opened on March 13, 1893, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer [[William Waldorf Astor]] had previously built his mansion. Constructed in the German Renaissance style by [[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]], it stood {{convert|225|ft}} high, with 15 public rooms and 450 guest rooms, and a further 100 rooms allocated to servants, with laundry facilities on the upper floors. It was heavily furnished with European antiques brought back by founding proprietor [[George Boldt]] and his wife from a 1892 visit to Europe. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling ''[[Delmonico's]]'' and ''[[The Sherry-Netherland|Sherry's]]''.

[[File:The Waldorf and The Astoria Hotels, New York City c1915.jpg|thumb|left|Engraved vignettes of the original hotels c1915]]The Astoria Hotel opened in 1897 on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street, next door to the Waldorf. It was also designed in the German Renaissance style by Hardenbergh, at a height of about {{convert|270|ft}}, with 16 stories, 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms. The ballroom, in the [[French Baroque architecture|Louis XIV]] style, has been described as the "[[pièce de résistance]]" of the hotel, with a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1,200 at concerts. The Astor Dining Room was faithfully reproduced from the original dining room of the mansion which once stood on the site.

Connected by the {{convert|300|m}} long corridor, known as "Peacock Alley" after the merger in 1897, the hotel had 1,300 bedrooms, making it the largest hotel in the world at the time. It was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent "wealthy upper crust" of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. It was the first hotel to offer electricity and private bathrooms throughout. The Waldorf gained world renown for its fundraising dinners and balls, as did its celebrity ''[[maître d'hôtel]]'', [[Oscar Tschirky]], known as "Oscar of the Waldorf". Tschirky authored ''The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf'' (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the recipes of the day, including his own, such as [[Waldorf salad]], [[Eggs Benedict]] and [[Thousand Island dressing]], which remain popular worldwide today.

===Opening and early years of the Waldorf===
In 1799, John Thompson bought a {{convert|20|acre|0|adj=on}} tract of land roughly bounded by Madison Avenue, 36th Street, Sixth Avenue, and 33rd Street, immediately north of the [[Caspar Samler farm]], for (US $2400) £482 10s.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|p=5}} In 1826, [[John Jacob Astor]] purchased Thompson's parcel, as well as one from Mary and John Murray who owned a farm on Murray Hill, in the area which is now [[Madison Avenue]] to [[Lexington Avenue]], between 34th and 38th streets.{{sfn|Craven|2009|p=35}}{{efn|During the Revolutionary War, shots rang out on what is now Fifth Avenue from "the battle of the cornfield". Some 3,500 of George Washington's troops were in the city and in danger of being trapped by the British Army. Mary Murray invited the British officers into her home for food and drink.  She offered such a repast that [[Israel Putnam|General Putnam]] was able to lead the 3,500 men out of the city and into [[Battle of Harlem Heights|Harlem heights]].{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|pp=6, 7}}}}  In 1827, [[William Backhouse Astor, Sr.|William B.

He built an unpretentious square red brick house on the southwest corner of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, while John Jacob Astor erected a home at the northwest corner of 33rd Street.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=20}}

William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt [[Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor]], built the  Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street.{{efn|The feud centered on whether Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, the wife of John Jacob Astor III, or William's wife, Mary Dahlgren Paul Astor, would be known in society as "the" Mrs. Astor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2308009/astor_feud/|title=Astor Families Bury Hatchet|date=July 4, 1905|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|page=1|accessdate=April 28, 2015| via = [[Newspapers.com]]|location=San Francisco, California}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} His father was the millionaire developer, [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|William Waldorf Astor]].{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=20}}&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/about-the-waldorf/hotel-history.html|title=Hotel history|publisher=Waldorfnewyork.com|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|After Astor's decision to leave the United States, he also decided to demolish his father's home and build a hotel on the property.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|p=13}} When the 1870 Astor home was demolished, there was no idea that Astor would build a hotel on the property.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|p=20}} Astor did not stay in his own hotel when visiting the United States.  He stayed elsewhere and is known to have visited the Waldorf-Astoria only once; his guide was [[Oscar Tschirky]] {{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|pp=17-18}}}} The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor [[George Boldt]], who owned and operated the [[Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]], an elite boutique hotel in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], with his wife [[Louise Kehrer Boldt]]. The original plans for the Waldorf were for a hotel with 11 stories.  Boldt's wife, Louise, believed that 13 was a lucky number.

Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood.  Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children the day after the Waldorf opened.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|p=23}}  The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register.  Despite rain the night of the ball, the ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid $5.00 ($141 in 2017) for the concert and dinner.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|pp=23-28}}{{efn|There were also prominent social families who had come from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia for the charity event.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|p=24}}}} Mrs. William K.

This brought the hotel's ballroom down to the main floor; the move brought many parties and dinners which were formerly held in private homes, into the Waldorf.  Adjacent to the new ballroom was the Oak Room, where one could sit by large fireplaces where there were always logs on the hearth.  In winter, waiters would offer patrons complimentary baked potatoes with butter.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|pp=75-76}}

===Opening of the Astoria and consolidation===
When a decision was made to build a second hotel next to the Waldorf, truce provisions were developed between the Astors which reserved some proprietary rights. The plan design used corridors to join the two buildings and there was even a bond provision for bricking up the corridors should the need arise.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=114}} On November 1, 1897, Waldorf's cousin, [[John Jacob Astor IV]], opened the 16 story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|p=77}} The Astoria, named after [[Astoria, Oregon]] which was founded by John Jacob Astor in 1811, stood on the site of William B.

The two hotels, under one management, were renamed the Waldorf–Astoria.{{sfn|Biggs|1897|p=29}}{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=7}} Situated on Fifth Avenue in what is now [[Midtown Manhattan]], it was surrounded by streets on all sides. The Waldorf–Astoria had a frontage of {{convert|200|feet}} on Fifth Avenue, {{convert|350|feet}} on 33rd Street, {{convert|350|feet}} on 34th Street, and {{convert|200|feet}} on Astor Court, with 13 entrances opening directly from these thoroughfares. Below, extending to a depth {{convert|42|feet}} beneath the sidewalk, and occupying an additional area of {{convert|75|x|242|feet}} running toward Broadway, were the basements, which contained the engine room, laundries, and kitchens.

Altman and Company]] site.{{sfn|Biggs|1897|p=10}} The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, "a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family".{{sfn|Cashman|1988|p=373}}

The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the [[Hotel Astor (New York City)|Hotel Astor]] (1904), perceived as a successor to the Waldorf-Astoria; [[The St. Regis Hotel|The St. Regis]] (1904), built by John Jacob Astor IV as a companion to the Waldorf-Astoria; [[The Knickerbocker Hotel (Manhattan)|The Knickerbocker]] (1906), and the [[Savoy-Plaza Hotel]] (1927).{{Sfn|Blanke|2002|p=121}} By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family sold the hotel to the developers of the [[Empire State Building]] and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929; it was demolished soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The Waldorf–Astoria Hotel records of 1893–1929 are held by the [[New York Public Library]]'s Archives &amp; Manuscripts division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waldorf–Astoria Hotel records 1893-1929|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/3203|publisher=New York Public Library Archives &amp; Manuscripts|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inception, the Waldorf was always a "must stay" hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, [[Li Hung-Chang]] stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred-year-old eggs which he brought with him.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=21}} Mr. Li also brought his own stoves, chefs and servants with him to prepare and serve his meals.  Upon his departure from the Waldorf, he ordered a basket of roses to be sent to every female guest at the hotel, and was very generous in the gifts and gratuities he provided for the hotel's staff.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|pp=117-120}} In 1902, a lavish dinner was organized for [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Prince Henry of Prussia]]; in addition, the hotel built a private door on its 33rd Street side and installed a private elevator.

The Waldorf–Astoria gained significant renown for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as [[Andrew Carnegie]] who became a fixture.{{Sfn|Nasaw|2007|p=841}} Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. On February 11, 1899, Oscar of the Waldorf hosted a lavish dinner reception which the ''New York Herald Tribune'' cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time.

The hotel was also influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. Boldt's wife, Louise, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events, or just to be seen in the Peacock Alley.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=21}} The combined hotel was the first to do away with a ladies-only parlor and provided women with a place to play [[Cue sports|billiards]] and [[Table tennis|ping-pong]].  It was the first New York hotel to allocate an entire room for afternoon tea.  The teas began in the Waldorf Garden with attendance eventually being so large, both the Empire Room and at times, the Rose Room, had to be opened during the hours of four and six pm to accommodate the number of guests.  Men were admitted to the teas only if they were in the company of a woman.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|pp=94-95}}

The [[United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']] was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912 and continued there for some time in the Myrtle Room,{{sfn|Kuntz|Smith|1998|p=77}} before moving on to [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/six-degrees-of-titanic|title=Six Degrees of Titanic|work=History.com|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Jacob Astor IV was one of the people who perished on its ill-fated journey.

The Waldorf Hotel, built at a reported cost of about $5 million ($141,000,000 in 2017), opened on March 13, 1893 at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|William Waldorf Astor]] had previously built his mansion.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=20}}&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The hotel stood {{convert|225|ft}} high, about {{convert|50|ft}} lower than the Astoria, with a frontage of about {{convert|100|ft}} on Fifth Avenue, and a total area of {{convert|69475|ft2}}.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=132}}  It was a German Renaissance structure, designed by [[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]], with 15 public rooms and 450 guest rooms, and a further 100 rooms allocated to servants, with laundry facilities on the upper floors.{{sfn|King|1893|p=218}}{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=13}} ''The New York Times'' proclaimed the hotel a palace after it opened in 1893.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=11}}

The exterior featured loggias, balconies, gables, groups of chimneys, and tiled roofs.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} One of the chief features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes and stained glass. The main entrance to the hotel was "sheltered by an elaborate frosted-glass-and-wrought-iron marquee", and the entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=13}} The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=13}}

Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with an alcove containing elevators and a grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which was used as a reception room for women. It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of [[Marie Antoinette]], and an antique clock which was once owned by the queen. The ceiling featured frescoes by [[Will Hicok Low]], the central of which was called ''The Birth of Venus''.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=14}} The Gentleman's Cafe was furnished with "robust black oak paneling, hunting murals, and stag-horn chandaliers".{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=16}}

The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling ''[[Delmonico's]]'' and ''[[The Sherry-Netherland|Sherry's]]''.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=15}} It was modelled after the grand salon in [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|King Ludwig]]'s [[Nymphenburg Palace|palace]] at [[Munich]], with satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and [[Frank Crowninshield|Crowninshield]]'s frescoes.&lt;ref name=nationalacademy.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick Crowninshield1845 - 1918|url=http://www.nationalacademy.org/collections/artists/detail/1388/|publisher=National Academy Museum|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empire style|Empire]] in style, the Waldorf's restaurant  featured feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that were opposite were of [[mahogany]], with [[ormolu]] work in the panels.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The caps and bases of both columns and pilasters were gilded. This treatment occupied most of the wall space. The ceiling was divided by heavy beams running from column to column, and between these the flat space was divided into oval and other shaped panels with light mouldings.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The color scheme was in tints of pale-green and cream. The panels of the ceiling were frescoed with figures in pinkish-red on a blue sky or field. The walls were principally mahogany and gold, with a little color in the comparatively small wall-spaces left between openings.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=20}}  Among the other rooms were the Turkish [[smoking room]], with low divans and ancient Moorish armor, and the ballroom, in white and gold, with Louis XIV decorations.{{sfn|King|1893|p=218}}

The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, featured 16th and 17th century French and Italian antiques which Boldt and his wife had brought back from Europe.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=20}} Francois V Bedroom was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, and over the years was occupied by the likes of Li Hung-Chang of China, Chowfa Maha Rajiravuth, Prince of Siam, and Albert of Saxe-Coburg.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=21}} The apartments had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 [[Sevres]] plates with European portraits.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=22}} There were about 6,000 lights in the hotel, with as many as 1,000 small candelabra lamps mounted in specially designed fixtures.{{sfn|Electrical Engineer|1893|p=591}} The electric fixtures were all furnished by the [[Archer &amp; Pancoast Manufacturing Company]], of New York, while the contract for the general installation work was carried out by the [[Edison Illuminating Company|Edison Electric Illuminating Company]], of New York, the actual work of wiring being done by the Eastern District of the [[General Electric|General Electric Company]].

The Astoria Hotel, opened in 1897, was situated on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. Like the Waldorf, it was designed in the German Renaissance style by Henry J. Hardenbergh, the same architect who designed the Waldorf.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} With dimensions of {{convert|99|x|350|ft}}, its height, from the floor of the sub-basement, which was {{convert|33|ft}} below the street level, to the roof-line, was about {{convert|270|ft}}, or about {{convert|240|ft}} above the street-level. It was 16 stories in height, including the four stories in the roof.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The building was constructed of stone, marble and brick, with a steel skeleton frame and modern fireproof interior construction, and was embellished with "French Second Empire Mansard-roofed towers with iron-work cresting as well as Austrian Baroque onion-domes over corners turrets".{{Sfn|Lashley|Lynch|Morrison|2007|p=102}}{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} There were 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms, with miles of corridors, vestibules and balls.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} The entrance featured a double set of plate glass doors to give protection in cold weather, and a U-shaped driveway for horse and carriages.{{Sfn|Morrison|2014|p=31}}

The main corridor was nicknamed "Peacock Alley" by the New York press.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=53}} The corridor and foyer were treated with pilasters and columns of Sienna marble and a color scheme on the walls and ceilings of salmon-pink, with cream-color and pale-green. The capitals of the columns and pilasters were guilded of solid brass or lacquered. The main corridor ran the entire length of the building from east to west.{{efn|The first Peacock Alley was a corridor in the Waldorf which was the way to the Empire Room and Palm Court.  Neither hotel had planned they would be anything more than entries into various public rooms.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|pp=60-64}}}}  To the left of it was the Astor Dining Room, fronting on Fifth Avenue, which measured {{convert|50|x|92|ft}}. Great care was taken with it to faithfully reproduce the original dining room of the mansion, three floors above where the original dining room had stood,{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=24}} including all of the original dining room's paneling, carpeting, drapery and fireplace mantel; Italian Renaissance pilasters and columns, carved of marble from northern Russia. The panels of silk hangings were of rose pompadour, and a series of [[Charles Yardley Turner]] mural paintings filled arches and panels at the south end of the room.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}}{{efn|The Astor family requested that their complete dining room be preserved and made part of the hotel.  It was dismanteled piece by piece and stored until the completion of the hotel.  It was then reconstructed there.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|p=106}}}} On the right of the main corridor was the Garden Court of Palms, {{convert|88|x|57|ft}}, rising three stories to a dome-like roof of amber glass {{convert|56|ft}} above the floor. This, too, was used as a dining room. It was decorated in the Italian style, finished in gray, terracotta and Pavonazzo marble.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} On the 34th Street side of the corridor was the cafe, {{convert|40|x|95|ft}}, finished in English oak in the style of the German Renaissance, with Flemish decoration. The bar formed another room {{convert|40|x|50|ft}}.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}}

On the first floor, at the head-of the east main staircase, was the Astor Gallery, {{convert|87|x|102|ft}}, looking out on 34th Street. The gallery, with seven French windows reaching {{convert|26|ft}} from floor to ceiling, opened onto a terrace over the entrance to the hotel. The interior was finished in the style of the [[Hôtel de Soubise]], with a blue, gray and gold color scheme. There was a parquet floor, and on the south side, opposite the street windows, were other windows which opened into the main corridor on the second floor. The musicians' balcony, upheld by two caryatids, was at the east end. All the balcony railings were of gilded metal work. The mural paintings were notable: four panels, two at either end of the room, and twelve pendentive panels, six on either side and painted by [[Edward Simmons (painter)|Edward Simmons]] depicted the four seasons and the twelve months of the year.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}}  The "Colonial Room" was decorated in red, contrasting with white woodwork.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner, with large drawing rooms, dining room, butler's pantry, hallway, three bedrooms, three maids' bedrooms and five bathrooms, all finished in old English oak. All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor. There was a bath for nearly every room, and every bathroom had windows opening to the air, not into shafts. In every room, there was a large trunk closet.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=55}}

The ballroom, in the Louis XIV style, has been described as the "pièce de résistance" of the hotel, measuring {{convert|65|ft}} by {{convert|95|ft}} and {{convert|40|ft}} (three stories) in height.{{Sfn|Lashley|Lynch|Morrison|2007|p=102}} It had a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1,200 at concerts, and featured tints of ivory-gray and cream in its design.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} Noted vocalists such as [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Nellie Melba]] performed in the ballroom, with conductor [[Anton Seidl]] leading a series of concerts there in the year the combined hotels opened for business. It was possible to buy season tickets for the musical offerings; a box for a season was US$350 and a seat for a season on the ballroom floor was priced at US$60.{{sfn|McCarthy and Rutherford|1931|pp=80-82}}

On the hotel's top floor was the roof-garden, enclosed on all sides by glass, with a glass roof over. It was furnished with rattan chairs and lounges in pale-green and pink, hung across with gauzy fabric.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} On the roof on the 34th Street side was the grand promenade, {{convert|90|x|200|ft}}, on solid footing high in the air, with a band stand, fountains, and trellises of columns. The roof garden restaurant occupied a space {{convert|75|x|84|ft}}, and was roofed in. The ceiling was {{convert|24|ft}} high. At the northeast and northwest corners of the roof garden were towers, with spiral stairways within, leading up to the copper covered roofs of the pavilions, which were {{convert|250|ft}} above the sidewalk.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} The palm gardens, used as cafes, rose to a height of two and three stories respectively and were roofed-over with domes of tinted glass. Balconies at the various floor levels opened on to these courts to overlook them. The materials used were cream-colored brick and terracotta, and were Italian Renaissance in style.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}

In the sub-basement were the Sprague screw machines for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, and the six Babcock &amp; Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}

[[File:William Waldorf Astor.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|right|[[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|William Waldorf Astor]]]]
'''[[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|William Waldorf Astor]]''' (1848–1919) was a wealthy American attorney, politician, businessman, and newspaper publisher of the [[Astor family]]. He was the only child of financier/philanthropist [[John Jacob Astor III]] (1822–1890) and Charlotte Augusta Gibbes (1825–1887).
Described as being a "very prickly sort of person", he had a background in Europe and earned wealth buying and selling country estates in England including [[Cliveden]] and [[Hever Castle]].{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=12}} In his early adult years, Astor returned to the United States and began studies at [[Columbia Law School]]. He was called to the United States Bar in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia of the World's Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0VSAAAAYAAJ|year=1912|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls company|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for a short time in law practice and in the management of his father's estate of financial and real estate holdings. On his death in 1919, he was reputed to have been worth £200 million, which he left in trust for his two sons Waldorf and John Jacob. His half share of the Waldorf Astoria and the [[Hotel Astor (New York City)|Astor Hotel]] at the time were reported to have been worth £10 million.{{Sfn|Klein|2005|p=25}}

[[File:GeorgeCBoldt (cropped) LOC23338v.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[George Boldt]]]]
'''[[George Boldt]]''' (1851–1916), the founding proprietor, was a Prussian-born American hotelier and self-made millionaire who influenced the development of the urban hotel as a civic social center and luxury destination. His motto was "the guest is always right",{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=18}} and he became a wealthy and prominent figure internationally. The hotel was built to his specifications. He served as president and director of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel Company, as well as the Waldorf–Astoria Segar Company and the Waldorf Importation Company.{{sfn|Leonard|1908|p=81}} He also owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, an elite boutique hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, with his wife, Louise. Boldt was described as "Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming", resembling "a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez glasses on a black silk cord".{{sfn|Seifer|1998|p=204}} Boldt retained his contacts with the European elite and he and his wife made frequent trips to Europe, bringing back with them many antiques, a characteristic of the Waldorf Astoria. Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=18}}

[[File:Lucius Boomer 1930.jpg|thumb|upright|right|100px|[[Lucius M. Boomer]]]]
'''[[Lucius M. Boomer]]''' (1878–1947) was an American hotelier and businessman, responsible for the general management of the hotel for many years.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=40}}  Physically impressive and brassy, he displayed total dedication to his job and great discipline and care towards his staff, becoming one of the most famous hoteliers of his time.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=40}} Boomer became interested in the hotel after the death of Boldt in 1916 and purchased it, before buying the Bellevue-Stratford two years later. Following the retirement of Louis Sherry in 1920, he became directing head of the Louis Sherry Ice Cream and Chocolate Company, and was later president of restaurant chain Savarin, Inc.&lt;ref name=boomerdeath&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1563944/lucius_boomer_dies_in_norway_1947/|title=Lucius Boomer, 68, Waldorf Director, is Dead in Norway|date=July 26, 1947|newspaper= The Kingston Daily Freeman|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|location=Kingston, New York}}

[[File:Henry Janeway Hardenbergh.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]]]]
'''[[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh|Henry J. Hardenbergh]]''' (1847–1918) was an American architect who designed both hotels in the German Renaissance style. Apprenticed in New York from 1865 to 1870 under [[Detlef Lienau]], in 1870, opened his own practice there. He obtained his first contracts for three buildings at [[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]—the expansion of Alexander Johnston Hall (1871), designing and building Geology Hall (1872) and the [[Kirkpatrick Chapel]] (1873)—through family connections.
Hardenbergh designed the [[Dakota Apartments]] in 1884, and after building the Waldorf he went on to have an illustrious career as "America's premiere architect of grand hotels", designing the [[Manhattan Hotel]] (1896), the [[Plaza Hotel]] (1907), the [[Radisson Hotel Martinique|Martinique Hotel]] (1911) and numerous other hotels in cities such as Boston and Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=31}}

[[File:Louis Sherry 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|150px|[[Louis Sherry]]]]
'''[[Louis Sherry]]''' (1855–1926) was an American restaurateur, caterer, confectioner and hotelier during the [[Gilded Age]] and early 20th century, who was of considerable renown in the business. His name is typically associated with an upscale brand of candy and ice cream, and [[The Sherry-Netherland]] hotel in [[New York City]]. In 1919, Sherry announced an "alliance" with the Waldorf–Astoria that involved both his candies and catering services.&lt;ref name="NYT19"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06E3DE1338EE32A25754C0A9639C946896D6CF|title=Sherry's To Move May 17; Fifty-Eighth Street Plan Modified by 'Prohibition and Bolshevism'|work=The New York Times |date=May 17, 1919|page=28|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not disclosed at that time, at some point ownership of [[Louis Sherry Inc.]] was significantly vested in "Boomer-duPont interests", a reference to Lucius M. Boomer, then chairman of the Waldorf–Astoria, and [[T. Coleman du Pont]].&lt;ref name="NYT19"/&gt;

[[File:Oscar-Tschirky.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|[[Oscar Tschirky]]]]
'''[[Oscar Tschirky]]''' (1866–1950), known as "Oscar of the Waldorf", was a Swiss chef, ''[[maître d'hôtel]]'' from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland ten years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf and over the years grew to possess an encyclopedic-like knowledge of cuisine and the special trimmings and preferences that the regular diners desired.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} He authored ''The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf'' (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the recipes of the day, including his own, such as [[Waldorf salad]], [[Eggs Benedict]] and [[Thousand Island dressing]],{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book ''Peacock Alley'' that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who "composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees".{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} In 1902 Tschirky published ''Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf–Astoria'', a booklet which explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} Tschirky continued to work for the Waldorf Astoria after the original hotel was demolished until his retirement in 1943.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}}

'''Wong Shing''', alias '''Wong Pin Po''' (1827 – 5 August 1902), was a Hong Kong and Chinese journalist, publisher, businessman and member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]].

== Early life and education ==
Wong was born in a poor family in the [[Heungshan]] District of [[Kwangtung Province]]. He entered the first class of the Morrison Educational Society School in [[Macao]] in 1841 with two other Chinese boys, [[Yung Wing]] and Wong Foon.&lt;ref name="Unofficial"&gt;{{cite journal| journal =Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|volume=9|year=1969|pages=11–12|title=Chinese Unofficial members of the Legislative and Executive Councils in Hong Kong up to 1941|first=T. C.|last=Cheng}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elite"&gt;{{cite journal| journal =Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|volume=11|year=1971|title=The Emergence of a Chinese Elite in Hong Kong|first=Carl T.|last=Smith|pages=74–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later transferred to Hong Kong.

Wong became one of the first Chinese to study abroad when in 1847, Dr. [[Samuel Robbins Brown]], an American teacher in the Morrison School, had to leave China due to his ill health. He offered to take a few of his old pupils back to the United States for further education. Yung Wing, Wong Foon, and Wong Shing signified their desire to go, and expenses for the three for two years were paid by Dr. Brown and the Morrison Education Society. They embarked at [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]] on the ship ''Huntress'' and started the journey of more than three months during which they passed the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and proceeded to the United States. Upon their arrival, they were admitted to the [[Monson Academy]] at [[Monson, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Unofficial"/&gt;

== Career ==
=== Journalistic career ===
As a result of ill health, Wong Shing did not manage to acquire any academic honours during his study in the United States and had to return to Hong Kong after two years.When he studied abroad he was baptised and became a member of the Chinese congregation of the [[London Missionary Society]].&lt;ref name="Elite"/&gt; 

He worked for the ''[[China Mail]]'' owned and published by Andrew Shortrede for about two years after he returned from the United States. In 1864, Wong Shing published ''Daily General Price Current''. He also served as an interpreter for the Hong Kong government. In 1853 he became the manager of the printing establishment of the [[Ying Wa College|Anglo-Chinese College]] operated by the London Mission under Dr. [[James Legge]] for some ten years.&lt;ref name="Elite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unofficial"/&gt; He was also the first Chinese name to appear on the Juror Lists in Hong Kong in 1858.&lt;ref name="Elite"/&gt;

=== Chinese foreign ministry ===
He left Hong Kong to join the staff of the Chinese Government School being established in Shanghai to teach foreign languages to Chinese students for a short period of time and returned to Hong Kong and resumed the management of the Mission press.&lt;ref name="Elite"/&gt;

In 1872 Wong was offered an appointment in the [[Tsung Li Yamen]] in Peking, to set up a printing office with moveable type for the foreign ministry.&lt;ref name="Elite"/&gt; He served with Viceroy [[Li Hung-chang]] and Marquis [[Tseng Chi-tze]] and was a member of the Chinese legation staff in Washington.&lt;ref name="Unofficial"/&gt; During his service at the Qing government, Wong took the second group of students in Yung Wing's Educational Mission scheme to the United States.

=== Return to Hong Kong ===
After his retirement from the Chinese diplomatic service, he became a prominent merchant and property owner in Hong Kong. He was praised being frugal. He bought land in Hong Kong before it increased ten times in value. Although he had the opportunity to raise rent, he did not do so.&lt;ref name="Elite"/&gt; He was also a member of the organising committee for the [[Tung Wah Hospital]] and founding director when it was opened in 1870.&lt;ref name="Elite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unofficial"/&gt;

Wong was naturalised in December 1883 and became the second Chinese to be appointed to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] in 1884 after [[Ng Choy]]. He was described as a man of property, much-travelled, speaking good English and fully qualified to "look at Chinese affairs with English eyes and at English affairs with Chinese eyes." He was also noted for his cooperative attitude towards the colonial government's policies. When his six-year term expired in 1890, he asked not to be reappointed. He was succeeded by Dr. [[Ho Kai]].&lt;ref name="Unofficial"/&gt; 

== Death and family ==
He died on 5 August 1902 evening at his residence No. 55, [[Peel Street, Hong Kong|Peel Street]]. His remains were transferred to the steamer ''Heungshan'', and conveyed to the burying ground of his ancestors at Heungshan. His coffin was escorted by a police sergeant and four [[Sikhs]].&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite news|page=4|newspaper=The China Mail|date=7 August 1902|title=Death of a Well-known Chinaman.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong was among the first Chinese to send their children abroad for education.&lt;ref name="Elite"/&gt; One of his sons was educated at a university in Scotland, one worked as a civil servant at the Registrar General's office, another worked in the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]]. Other members of family were also in government service.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; A daughter of Wong Shing married to [[Wei Yuk]], later Sir Boshan Wei Yuk who became a prominent businessman and member of the Legislative Council.
