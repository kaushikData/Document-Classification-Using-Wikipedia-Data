[[File:Al Qudra Lakes at Al Marmoom Desert Conservation Reserve.jpg|thumb|Al Qudra Lakes at Al Marmoom Desert Conservation Reserve.]]
The Reserve spans over 40 hectares of desert shrub land and 10km of lakes and is home to 26 identified species of reptiles, nine of mammals and 39 species of plants. It provides a sanctuary for 19 animal species considered endangered, as well as flocks of between 300 to 500 flamingos and over 360 other bird species, of which 158 are migratory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rare species observed at Al Marmoom include the Egyptian Nightjar and the butterfly ''Coeliades Anchises Jucunda'', which is native to the island of [[Socotra]], off [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/environment/egyptian-bird-species-seen-thriving-in-dubai-1.2065431|title=Egyptian bird species seen thriving in Dubai|last=Reporter|first=Paul Crompton, Staff|date=2017-07-28|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its announcement, in January 2018,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; followed public concern regarding the fouling of the area by tourists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/your-say/your-reports/al-qudra-lake-from-campsite-to-dumping-ground-1.1963985|title=Al Qudra Lake — from campsite to dumping ground|last=Editor|first=Rabab Khan, Community Interactivity|date=2017-01-18|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of deaths of wildlife in the lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/society/what-killed-fish-and-birds-in-al-qudra-lake-during-eid-holidays-1.2089152|title=What killed fish and birds in Al Qudra Lake during Eid holidays?|last=Reporter|first=Sajila Saseendran, Senior|date=2017-09-13|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Marmoom is managed by [[Dubai Municipality]], The formalisation of the reserve has introduced some restrictions to human leisure activity in the area, long a popular visiting place for residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/environment/clarification-on-ban-on-barbecues-near-al-qudra-lake-1.2148503|title=Clarification on ‘ban’ on barbecues near Al Qudra lake|last=Editor|first=Huda Tabrez, Community Web|date=2017-12-28|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to regulate camping, barbecuing and picnicking was welcomed by the [[Emirates Environmental Group]] (EEG),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/environment/eco-group-backs-al-qudra-camping-ban-1.2140370|title=Eco-group backs Al Qudra camping ban|last=Reporter|first=Derek Baldwin, Chief|date=2017-12-13|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organisation that had organised cleanup campaigns in the area in the past.

The Marmoom Biosphere Centre is intended as a facility for studying the sustainable development and management of the Reserve, as well as serving as a centre for sustainable ecotourism, and will aim to be the main source of specialized ecosystem management practices in the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Leisure activities ==
The Reserve currently has a number of animal and bird observation platforms, star and sunset observation decks and an 84km cycling track, one of the world's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whatson.ae/dubai/2015/04/al-qudra-lakes-quick-guide/|title=Al Qudra Lakes - quick guide - What's On|date=2015-04-30|work=What's On Dubai|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing development program for the reserve, including bird breeding programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/environment/al-marmoum-reserve-breeding-programme-outlined-1.2251850|title=Al Marmoum Reserve breeding programme outlined|last=Report|first=Staff|date=2018-07-15|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the development of an outdoor theatre and other facilities intended to be powered by a 5,000 megawatt solar power plant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Al Marmoom is served by one of Dubai's distinctive 'Last Exit' food truck parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/news/75428-second-last-exit-opens-in-al-qudra|title=Second Last Exit opens in Al Qudra|website=Time Out Dubai|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Star gazing events are often held at Al Marmoom by Dubai Astronomy Group as the area has little to no light pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whatson.ae/dubai/2017/12/eyes-skies-theres-going-meteor-shower-dubai-week/|title=There's going to be a meteor shower in Dubai this week|date=2017-12-13|work=What's On Dubai|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20 sporting and social events have taken place in the Reserve since its launch, including a junior fun day organised [[Pink Caravan]], the UAE-based breast cancer awareness initiative. 

A 270km desert ultramarathon has been announced, to take place at Al Marmoom between December 11-15 2018, with some 400 runners competing for $80,000 in prizes over distances of 50 km, 100 km, and 270 km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/join-the-worlds-longest-270km-desert-ultramarathon-in-uae|title=Join the world's longest 270km desert ultramarathon in UAE|last=Zakaria|first=Sherouk|website=www.khaleejtimes.com|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological site ==
The [[Saruq Al Hadid|Saruq Al Hadid Archaeological Site]] is situated within the Reserve. It was discovered in 2002 by the Ruler of Dubai, [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], who noticed unusual dune formations when flying over the site in his helicopter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.saruqalhadid.ae//|title=Saruq Al-Hadid Archaeological Museum Official Website|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation revealed an extensive [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron age]] metallurgical centre, with signs of occupation since the Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic eras. Artefacts unearthed at Saruq Al Hadid include bronze, copper and iron work, including bronze and iron tools and weapons, gold jewellery, beads, pottery, stoneware and seals. Metalworker's tools and unfinished items show that the site was formerly a production centre.

A collection of artefacts from the site is housed at the Saruq Al-Hadid Archaeology Museum in the Shindaga Heritage area in a traditional '[[barjeel]]' building, which was built in 1928, and which belonged to Sheikh [[Juma bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum|Juma bin Maktoum Al Maktoum]]{{when|date=August 2018}}.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ann Hunt and Elizabeth Hamel''' (born 28 February 1936) are twin sisters who were reunited after almost 78 years apart.  The period of separation is a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for twins.  Both women were born in [[Aldershot]], England, in 1936. Their mother could not afford to keep both of them since she was a domestic servant.  Elizabeth was kept because she had [[Scoliosis|curvature of the spine]] and her mother thought that it would be difficult for her to be adopted.  Ann was adopted and raised as an only child.  As an adult, Elizabeth met an American and moved to the United States. On 1 May 2014, the sisters were reunited again in [[Fullerton, California]], United States.  The women spent the next day undergoing testing at the Twin Studies Center at [[California State University]] in Fullerton, which does research into how [[gene]]s and [[Natural environment|environment]] affect [[Developmental biology|development]]. The research was published in a 2015 paper in the journal Personality and Individual Differences (Segal et al.. Genetic and experiential influences on behavior: Twins reunited at seventy-eight years. Personality and Individual Differences, 73, 110-117.). Additional material on twins raised apart is available in Segal, N.L.  (2012). Born Together-Reared Apart: The Landmark Minnesota Twin Study, Harvard University Press.

==Early years==
The [[Fraternal twins#Fraternal (sororal; dizygotic) twins|fraternal twins]]' mother's name was Alice Alexandra Patience Lamb and their father's last name was Peters.  They were born Patricia Susan Lamb (Ann Hunt) and Elizabeth Ann Lamb (Elizabeth Hamel). Their mother was unmarried and a domestic cook.  Their father was in the Army and stationed in Aldershot, UK, but he never saw his daughters.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;

Their mother could not afford to raise both of them, so she gave Patricia Susan Lamb up for adoption when she was five months old.&lt;ref name=Janele/&gt; She was adopted by Hector and Gladys Wilson who also lived in Aldershot.&lt;ref name=Janele/&gt; They renamed her Ann Patricia Wilson. When Ann was 14, her aunt told her that she was adopted.  When she asked her mother if she was adopted, her mother told Ann that she was adopted because her birth mother could not care for her and that Ann's birth mother allowed her (Gladys) to care for Ann.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

==Search for the other twin==
In 2001, Gladys died and Ann went to the register office to get a copy of her own birth certificate.  She discovered that her birth mother's name was Alice Lamb and that her occupation was a domestic cook.  There was, however, no information about other children, the age of her birth mother, nor the address where she lived. Ann's youngest daughter, Samantha Stacey, was interested in [[genealogy]], so Ann asked her to look into it.  It turned out to be a long process because they had so little information to work with and they assumed that Ann's birth mother Alice was very young when she had Ann, when, in fact, she had been 33. Samantha put ads in the local newspaper, searched electoral rolls and online forums. She made little headway.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

In 2013, a breakthrough came. Samantha said she was exhausted doing the research and taking care of her child at the same time. Her husband asked her what he could do for her, and she asked him to find Alice's death certificate.&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt; He did, and they discovered that Alice married George Burton when she was 49; they had married in 1951 in the Parish Church of St Bridget with St Martin in [[Chester]].&lt;ref name="Chester Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Lucia |first1=Carmella |title=World's longest-ever separated twins reunited for first time |url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/twins-whose-mother-lived-chester-7193588 |accessdate=3 June 2014 |publisher=''[[Chester Chronicle]]'' |date=30 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q3pGRKxP?url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/twins-whose-mother-lived-chester-7193588 |archivedate=3 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also knew that the couple married in [[Chester]], England, and that Alice had a stepson named Albert.  Albert died by this time, but they were able to track down his son, who told them, "Oh, yes, Alice has a daughter in the US."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Samantha later told her mother Ann that not only did she have a sister, but that her sister was her twin.  Samantha was apprehensive about telling her mother that she had a twin because her mother was the twin that was adopted; but when Samantha told her mother, she was just happy to find out that she had a sister.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==First contact==
On 22 April 2013, Elizabeth was going through her mail when she spotted a letter (sent by Samantha) from Aldershot, UK, where she was born.&lt;ref name=Janele/&gt; When she opened it she saw that the letter began with "I am writing to you as I am searching for a family connection" and she immediately knew what it was about. She shared the letter with her two sons Quinton and Jeff.&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt; A few minutes later she called her long-lost sister Ann in the UK.  After their first phone conversation Elizabeth wrote a letter to Ann to explain what had happened. Elizabeth wrote to Ann that their mother planned to have both of her twins adopted, but that when she found out that Elizabeth had curvature of the spine, which back then made her harder to adopt, she decided to keep Elizabeth.  In 1936, it was difficult for an unmarried woman in domestic service to keep a child.  Alice was a live-in servant and live-in servants were almost never allowed to keep any children with them.  Moreover, she had the stigma of an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate child]], which back then could have resulted in her losing her job.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==Years of separation==
Because of Alice's situation, Elizabeth did not live with her for a number of years.  An aunt took care of Elizabeth until she was about three or four years old when her mother moved to [[Berkhamsted]] where she worked for Captain Hallam.  A woman in Berkhamsted then took care of Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Alice would visit Elizabeth every week on her half-day off, but one week she was unable to visit at her usual time because of a dinner party at the Hallam's estate.  When she did arrive unexpectedly, Alice found Elizabeth dressed in rags.  Alice had made many dresses for Elizabeth to wear. She immediately took Elizabeth to the Hallam's estate and they lived in the servants quarters, which occurred during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

Both Alice and Elizabeth moved to London where Alice earned £2 a week with room and board.  When Elizabeth was 15 her mother got married.  It was at about this time that Alice told Elizabeth that she had a twin sister.  She saw Ann's adoption papers but they were lost in 1980 when Alice died. At the time, Elizabeth wished that she had asked her mother more questions because her cousins told her two conflicting stories about the reason for the adoption.  One story was that when her father found out she was pregnant, he completely rejected her.  The other story was that he wanted the twins but by the time his message got to Alice, it was too late.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

Both Elizabeth and Ann married in their mid-20s. After Ann left school, she worked as a printer until she was 25 when she married Jim Hunt, whom she had met at school. They lived in Aldershot and had three daughters.&lt;ref name=Janele/&gt; After Elizabeth left school, she worked in a [[Confectionery store|sweet shop]], but wanted to join the [[Royal Navy|Navy]].  She went to night school and was later able to join the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] in [[Portsmouth]]. She was then stationed in [[Malta]] where she met Jim Hammel, an American, on a [[blind date]]. Elizabeth married Jim when she was 28. They moved to [[Oregon]], had two sons,&lt;ref name=Janele/&gt; and were married for 48 years until Jim died in 2012.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla/&gt;

==Reunion==
After the initial call, the sisters got to know each other using [[Skype]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;

Finally, on 1 May 2014, over a year after the first phone call, Ann and Elizabeth reunited after 78 years apart. They met in a hotel room in Fullerton, California, which is near Los Angeles. They went to Fullerton to meet because Dr. [[Nancy Segal]] invited them to participate her twins research program, which has been going on for over 20 years.  After meeting Elizabeth, Ann said "I feel like I've known Liz all my life now."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; After two days of testing they went to Elizabeth's home in [[Albany, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuruvilla/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC UK"&gt;

They found that the hardest part of meeting was the international spotlight they found themselves in. The BBC interviewed them in their room and they also had many requests for interviews from other media outlets. Hamel said that "We've gotten a taste of what it's like to be a famous film star or royalty" as she reportedly wrinkled her face up in disgust.&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt; They exchanged gifts as Dr. Segal reports separated twins often do when they reunite.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Elizabeth gave Ann a [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] that had been passed down from her grandmother to her mother to her.&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt;

==Twin research==
The twins were invited to the Twin Studies Center at California State University, Fullerton, California, to participate in an ongoing study of twins who have been raised separately most of their lives to investigate the effects of genes on behaviour. During the two-day study, Dr. Segal assessed similarities and differences between the twins and conducted [[DNA]] analyses.  In particular, she aimed to get a comprehensive assessment of their abilities, interests, and lives since they are the world's longest separated twins.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

In the [[Minnesota Twin Family Study|Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart]], researchers found that 44.5% of twins separated at or near birth were separated because of birth out of marriage.  Almost all twins separated for this reason are both adopted, but Ann and Elizabeth's case is unusual because one baby was kept by the natural mother. Dr. Segal has found that twins separated for even long periods of time, have surprising similarities. For example, Bridget and Dorothy, a pair of separated twins were wearing the same jewellery when they were reunited: "seven rings, three bracelets and a watch."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Where these similarities come from is a complicated question, but Dr. Segal suspects that genes associated with intelligence, temperament, and personality may explain some of the similarities between separated twins.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Ann and Elizabeth have a number of similarities.  They both married men named "Jim." Both are widowed, grandmothers, and religious.  After talking on Skype many times during the year before they met, they believe they shared many mannerisms in common.  There are also major differences in their lives. Ann married and remained in her birth town.  Elizabeth joined the navy, married an American, and ended up moving to the US and becoming an American citizen.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Guinness World Record==
Both twins were born on 28 February 1936 and they were separated at five months of age. They were reunited 1 May 2014. The length of their separation was 77 years and 289 days, which is a Guinness World Record for longest separated twins.&lt;ref name=Janele/&gt; The previous record was held by Philip and Barbara McAuley also from the United Kingdom.  They had been separated for 69 years and 364 days.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;

'''''Apogevmatini''''' was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[newspaper]] that was published nationally for decades until its last owners, the Sarantopoulos family, declared its bankruptcy in November 2010. It was at 12 [[Feidiou Street]] in the downtown area of the capital city of [[Athens]]. The newspaper was founded by the Botsis family in the 20th century. It had a semi-[[economic liberalism|liberal]] approach to the economy and traditionally had [[right-wing]] sympathies.

[[File:Blue Bird K3.jpg|thumb|Campbell and the K3, Italy, 1937]]
'''''Blue Bird K3''''' is a [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]] [[powerboat]] commissioned in 1937 by [[Malcolm Campbell|Sir Malcolm Campbell]], to rival the Americans' efforts in the fight for the world [[water speed record]]. She set three world [[water speed record]]s, first on [[Lake Maggiore]] in September 1937, then later twice raising her own record.

The name "K3" was derived from its [[Lloyd's unlimited rating#K3|Lloyd's unlimited rating]], and was carried in a prominent circular badge on the forward hull.

== Construction ==
After Campbell's achievement of the 300 mph [[land speed record]] with [[Campbell-Railton Blue Bird|Blue Bird]] in 1935 he retired from the land speed record. Shortly afterwards he switched his attentions to the [[water speed record]], at that time dominated by the American [[Gar Wood]].&lt;ref name="Harris, Skimming the Surface" &gt;[[#Harris, Skimming the Surface|Harris, Skimming the Surface]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Cooper of [[Saunders Roe]] was commissioned to design a small hydroplane powered by the same [[Rolls Royce R]] engine used in [[Campbell-Railton Blue Bird|Blue Bird]], and also in pairs in [[Henry Segrave|Segrave]] and [[Kaye Don]]'s [[Miss England]] boats. Of the three individual R engines used by K3, one had previously run in [[Campbell-Railton Blue Bird|Blue Bird]] and one in [[Miss England]]. 

Unlike Gar Wood's multi-engined monsters, Blue Bird was designed for a single engine, and the smallest possible craft to carry it. She was 23&amp;nbsp;feet long, compared to 38&amp;nbsp;feet for [[Miss America X]]. Her estimated top speed on paper was to be 130&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="Harris, Skimming the Surface" /&gt; It was usual at this time for English hydroplanes to have their engines mounted as far astern as possible (Gar Wood disagreed, and had pointed this out to Segrave). K3 took this a step further and had a narrow central nacelle that overhung the transom of the stern. This rearward weight distribution encouraged planing, but could lead to some peculiar attitudes when setting off at slow speeds, as the whole boat appeared to be sinking by the stern.

== Records ==
On 1 September 1937, at [[Lake Maggiore]] on the border between Switzerland and Italy, K3 set a record of 126.32&amp;nbsp;mph,&lt;ref name="Knowles 2001" &gt;{{cite book
  |title=The Bluebird Years
  |last=Knowles |first=Arthur
  |publisher=Sigma Leisure
  |date=2001
  |isbn=978-1-85058-766-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; breaking Gar Wood's previous 5-year-old record.&lt;ref name="Harris, Skimming the Surface" /&gt; The next day she improved this to 129.5&amp;nbsp;mph. 

Breaking the design speed of 130 would require another year, when on 17 August 1938 at [[Lake Hallwyl]] in Switzerland at 130.91&amp;nbsp;mph(210.63 km/h).

== Ventnor "three pointer" ==
Despite these records, Campbell was dissatisfied with their small margin over the previous record (6&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name="Harris, Skimming the Surface" /&gt; K3's hull was a single-step [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]], as already used for Miss England. This lifted half of the hull clear of the water, reducing drag upon it. A new idea from America was the "three point" hydroplane, where the forward hull is divided into two sponsons and the boat rides at speed on just these and the propellor. This reduces the wetted area (and drag) still further. It was not possible to convert K3 to this hull form, so Campbell began work on a whole new boat, [[Blue Bird K4|K4]], re-using the same engine.

== Restoration ==
The original boat was restored at [[Willingdon_and_Jevington#Filching|Filching Manor]] in East Sussex and is now in working order. The boat was stripped down and fully rebuilt using parts to the original standard. (http://www.k3bluebird.com)

She ran on the regatta course at Henley-on-Thames during the Traditional Boat Festival on 18-19 July 2015. (http://www.tradboatfestival.com/#!bluebird-k3/c9ig)

Among the changes were the establishment of independent states of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia (right of centre)]]

'''Border states''' or [[Europe]]an '''buffer states''' was a political term used in the West before World War II, and referring to the European nations that won their independence from the [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution of 1917]], the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], and ultimately the defeat of the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] in [[World War I]]. During the [[interwar period|20th century interwar period]] the nations of [[Western Europe]] implemented a '''border states policy'''&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;{{cite book |first=D. G. |last=Kirby |title=Finland in the Twentieth Century: A History and an Interpretation |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1980 |page=111 |isbn=0-8166-5802-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed at uniting these nations in defense against the [[Soviet Union]] and [[communism|communist]] expansionism. The border states were interchangeably [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and, until their annexation into the Soviet Union, short-lived [[Belarusian People's Republic|Belarus]] and [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]].

The policy tended to see the border states as a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]''&lt;ref name="Salzmann"/&gt;, or [[buffer states]], separating Western Europe from the newly formed Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Salzmann"&gt;Stephanie C. Salzmann, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qi1PaTweRz0C  Great Britain, Germany and the Soviet Union]'',  Boydell Press 2013.  Page 91. "Both countries regarded eastern Europe as a potential future troublespot due to the numerous conflicting interests ... The border states were now regarded as a cordon sanitaire against the spread of communism beyond Soviet Russia, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;  This policy was very successful. [[Soviet Union]] was at the time driven by [[Trotskyism|trotskyist]] ideology whose goal was the [[permanent revolution]] aiming not to cease until spreading [[communism]] all over the world. This plan was shattered by [[Poland]] which stopped [[Bolschevik]] [[Red Army]] invasion by successfully winning [[Polish–Soviet War]]. After the end of the war Poland's leader [[Pilsudski]], despite an option having had opened, has refrained from taking over Moscow and toppling the communists, as he feared the comeback of [[White_movement|white]] tsarist [[Russian Empire|imperial Russia]]. Poland wanted to unify its core region with surrounding states as [[Intermarium]], but disputes and different allegiances between and within the group of states hindered unity. The matter was further complicated by the rise of the expansionist [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with a secret clause, which effectively divided the territory of the border states between those two totalitarian regimes. Immediately afterwards, Nazi Germany and Soviet Union jointly attacked Poland from two sides thus beginning [[World War II]] in Europe. After the end of the war, all border states with the exception of Finland, were transferred under Soviet occupation as a result of the [[Western betrayal]].

[[Sarajevo]] is the capital and largest city.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is an almost [[landlocked country]] – it has a narrow coast at the [[Adriatic Sea]], about {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} long surrounding the town of [[Neum]]. It is bordered by [[Croatia]] to the north, west and south, [[Serbia]] to the east, and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, [[Herzegovina]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and plain topography.

Bosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], it was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence of the Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995]].

==Etymology==
The first preserved widely acknowledged mention of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] is in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', a politico-geographical handbook written by the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] in the mid-10th century (between 948 and 952) describing the "small land" (χωρίον in [[Greek language|Greek]]) of "Bosona" (Βοσώνα).&lt;ref name="Moravcsik-153"&gt;{{cite book|edition=Moravcsik, Gyula|author=Constantine VII''Porphyrogenitus''|authorlink=Constantine VII|date=1993|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies|title=[[De Administrando Imperio]]|location=Washington D.C.|pages=153–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is believed to have derived from the [[hydronym]] of the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] coursing through the Bosnian heartland. According to philologist Anton Mayer the name ''Bosna'' could derive from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] *"Bass-an-as"), which would derive from the Proto-Indo-European root "bos" or "bogh"—meaning "the running water".{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} According to English medievalist [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]] the Slavic settlers in Bosnia "adapted the Latin designation [...] Basante, to their own idiom by calling the stream Bosna and themselves ''Bosniaks'' [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]]|title=Essays on the Latin Orient|volume=|page=464|location= Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wpEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA464|date=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Herzegovina'' ("herzog's [land]", from German word for "duke"){{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} originates from Bosnian magnate [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača]]'s title, "Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast" (1448).{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=578}} Hum, formerly [[Zahumlje]], was an early medieval principality that was conquered by the Bosnian Banate in the first half of the 14th century. The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (''Hersek'') within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] up until the formation of the short-lived [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] in the 1830s, which remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the official name was changed to Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Mogorjelo Villa Rustica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mogorjelo]], ancient Roman suburban Villa Rustica from the 4th century, near [[Čapljina]]]]
{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia has been inhabited since at least the [[Neolithic]] age. The earliest Neolithic population became known in the [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] as the [[Illyrians]]. [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations in the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC were also notable. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different people speaking distinct languages. Conflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&amp;nbsp;BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&amp;nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as ''[[Bellum Batonianum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Norma. Tacitus: Annals I, 2002, {{ISBN|1-85399-358-1}}. It had originally been joined to Illyricum, but after the great Illyrian/Pannonian revolt of AD 6 it was made a separate province with its own governor&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict arose after an attempt to recruit Illyrians, and a revolt spanned for four years (6–9 AD), after which they were subdued.&lt;ref&gt;Stipčević, Aleksandar, ''The Illyrians: History and Culture'', 1974, Noyess Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from the entire [[Roman Empire]] settled among the Illyrians, and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}
Following the split of the Empire between 337 and 395 AD, Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Some claim the region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. Illyrian cultural traits were adopted by the South Slavs, as evidenced in certain customs and traditions, placenames, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ardian, Adzanela (Axhanela) |title=Illyrian Bosnia and Herzegovina-an overview of a cultural legacy |date=2004 |publisher=Centre for Balkan Studies, Online Balkan Centre |url=https://www.academia.edu/2490281/Illyrian_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina-an_Overview_of_a_Cultural_Legacy_Ancient_Illyrians_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Timothy Gregory explains:

===Illyrian period===
The bronze culture of the [[Illyrians]], an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and parts of northern [[Greece]].
[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from the 2nd century]]

From 8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in [[Illyria]] (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC.[7] The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom.[8] The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC.[9] The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom.[10] Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.

From the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Hallstatt]] cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different.
A very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high. ''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).

In the 4th century BC, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to [[Greece]], so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.

In the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic]] influence of the Illyrian [[Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in Ošanići near [[Stolac]], the main center of ancient culture in B&amp;H. Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze [[coins]] and sculptures.

===Middle Ages===
 {{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Hvalov zbornik1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hval's Codex]], illustrated Slavic manuscript from medieval Bosnia.]]
The [[Early Slavs]] raided the Western Balkans, including Bosnia, in the 6th and early 7th century (amid the [[Migration Period]]), and were composed of small tribal units drawn from a single Slavic confederation known to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] as the ''[[Sclaveni]]'' (whilst the related ''[[Antes people|Antes]]'', roughly speaking, colonized the eastern portions of the Balkans).&lt;ref name="Columbia University Press"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed|authors= Robert J.

Palgrave Macmillan (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
Tribes recorded by the ethnonyms of "Serb" and "Croat" are described as a second, latter, migration of different people during the second quarter of the 7th century who do not seem to have been particularly numerous;&lt;ref name="Columbia University Press"/&gt;{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53}} these early "Serb" and "Croat" tribes, whose exact identity is subject to scholarly debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbUlnaHlHS0C&amp;pg=PA404|title=''Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe''|author=Heather, Peter |date=2010 |work= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=}}, pp. 404–406&lt;/ref&gt; came to predominate over the Slavs in the neighbouring regions. The bulk of Bosnia proper, however, appears to have been a territory between Serb and Croat rule and is not enumerated as one of the regions settled by those tribes.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53}}

Bosnia is first mentioned ''as a land (horion Bosona)'' in Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' in the mid 10th century, at the end of a chapter (Chap. 32) entitled ''Of the Serbs and the country in which they now dwell''.{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123}} This has been scholarly interpreted in several ways and used especially by the Serb national ideologists to prove Bosnia as originally a "Serb" land. Other scholars have asserted the inclusion of Bosnia into Chapter 32 to merely be the result of Serbian Grand Duke [[Časlav]]'s temporary rule over Bosnia at the time, while also pointing out Porphyrogenitus does not say anywhere explicitly that Bosnia is a "Serb land".{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123-28}} In fact, the very translation of the critical sentence where the word ''Bosona'' (Bosnia) appears is subject to varying interpretation.{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123}}

In time, Bosnia formed a unit under its own ruler, who called himself Bosnian.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53}} Bosnia, along with other territories, became part of [[Duklja]] in the 11th century, although it retained its own nobility and institutions.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=223}}
 [[File:Medieval Bosnian State Expansion-en.svg|thumb|right|Bosnia in the Middle Ages spanning the [[Banate of Bosnia]] and the succeeding [[Kingdom of Bosnia]]. ]]
In the [[High Middle Ages]] political circumstance led to the area being contested between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century, Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as the [[Banate of Bosnia]] (under the rule of local ''[[Ban (title)|bans]]'').{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Paul Mojzes.

In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254. During this time the population was called ''[[Dobri Bošnjani]]'' ("Good Bosnians").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0rIGA0rluO0C&amp;pg=PA71|title=''Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed''|author=Robert J.

Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the [[Šubić]] and [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromanić]] became ''Ban''. By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his ambitious nephew [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. By the year 1377, Bosnia was elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of Tvrtko as the first [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Bosnian King]] in Mile near [[Visoko during the Middle Ages|Visoko]] in the Bosnian heartland.&lt;ref name=Mile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&amp;lang=1&amp;action=view&amp;id=1341|title=Declared as national monument |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116053150/http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&amp;lang=1&amp;action=view&amp;id=1341 |archivedate=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=An&gt;Anđelić Pavao, Krunidbena i grobna crkva bosanskih vladara u Milima (Arnautovićima) kod Visokog.

Following his death in 1391 however, Bosnia fell into a long period of decline. The [[Ottoman Empire]] had started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463 after its conquest by the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and [[cultural landscape]]. The Ottomans allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity&amp;nbsp;— a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Riedlmayer"&gt;Riedlmayer, Andras (1993). [http://www.kakarigi.net/manu/briefhis.htm A Brief History of Bosnia–Herzegovina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618040332/http://www.kakarigi.net/manu/briefhis.htm |date=18 June 2006 }}. The Bosnian Manuscript Ingathering Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Bosnia the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

The four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to lack of strong Christian church organizations and continuous rivalry between the Orthodox and Catholic churches, while the indigenous [[Bosnian Church]] disappeared altogether (ostensibly by conversion of its members to Islam). The Ottomans referred to them as ''kristianlar'' while the Orthodox and Catholics were called ''gebir'' or ''kafir'', meaning "unbeliever".{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|pp=29–30}}  The Bosnian [[Franciscan]]s (and the Catholic population as a whole) were protected by official imperial decrees and in accordance and full extent of Ottoman laws, however in effect, these often merely affected arbitrary rule and behavior of powerful local elite.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

As the Ottoman Empire continued their rule in the [[Balkans]] ([[Rumelia]]), Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province, and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into regional centers of trade and [[urban culture]] and were then visited by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian architecture]] such as the country's first library in [[Sarajevo]], [[madrassa]]s, a school of [[Sufi philosophy]], and a [[clock tower]] (''Sahat Kula''), bridges such as the [[Stari Most]], the [[Tsar's Mosque]] and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Furthermore, several Bosnian Muslims played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and [[political history]] during this time.&lt;ref name="Riedlmayer"/&gt; Bosnian recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] and [[Battle of Krbava field|Krbava field]], while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals such as [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]; generals such as [[Isa-Beg Isaković]], [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] and [[Hasan Predojević]] and [[Sarı Süleyman Paşa]]; administrators such as [[Ferhat-paša Sokolović]] and [[Osman Gradaščević]]; and [[Vizier|Grand Viziers]] such as the influential [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović]] and [[Damad Ibrahim Pasha]]. Some Bosnians emerged as [[Sufi]] mystics, scholars such as [[Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi Bosnevi]], [[Ali Džabič]]; and poets in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic]], and [[Persian language]]s.&lt;ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1996"&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996).

[[File:Sarajevo 1878..jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian troops [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|enter Sarajevo]], 1878]]
However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the end of the [[Great Turkish War]] with the [[treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 again made Bosnia the Empire's westernmost province. The following century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague. The Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

This, combined with frustrations over territorial, political concessions in the north-east, and the plight of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Muslim]] refugees arriving from the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] into [[Bosnia Eyalet]], culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]], who endorsed a multicultural [[Bosnia Eyalet]] autonomous from the authoritarian rule of the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]], who persecuted, executed and abolished the [[Janissaries]] and reduced the role of autonomous [[Pasha]]s in [[Rumelia]]. Mahmud II sent his [[Grand Vizier]] to subdue Bosnia Eyalet and succeeded only with the reluctant assistance of [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]].&lt;ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1996"/&gt;

Related rebellions were extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate. Later agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation that led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration until 1908, when the Austro-Hungarian troops withdrew from the Sanjak.

Although Austro-Hungarian officials quickly came to an agreement with Bosnians, tensions remained and a mass emigration of Bosnians occurred.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms they intended would make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a "model" colony.
 [[File:Sarajevo Tram (1901).png|thumb|right|[[Sarajevo Tramway]] in 1901]]
With the aim of establishing the province as a stable [[political spectrum|political model]] that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism, Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and to provide for modernisation.

Austria–Hungary began to plan annexation of Bosnia and consulted German and Russian diplomats about that prospect since the 1880s, but the issue was not resolved until the annexation crisis of 1908.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=94}} Several external matters affected status of Bosnia and its relationship with Austria–Hungary. A bloody coup occurred in Serbia in 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in Belgrade.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=140}} Then in 1908, the revolt in the [[Ottoman Empire]] raised concerns the Istanbul government might seek the outright return of Bosnia-Herzegovina. These factors caused the Austro-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question sooner, rather than later.

Taking advantage of turmoil in the Ottoman Empire, Austro-Hungarian diplomacy tried to obtain provisional Russian approval for changes over the status of Bosnia Herzegovina and published the annexation proclamation on 6 October 1908.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=227}} Despite international furor and objections to the Austro-Hungarian annexation, Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909.

In 1910, Habsburg Emperor Franz Joseph proclaimed the first constitution in Bosnia, which led to relaxation of earlier laws, elections and formation of the Bosnian parliament, and growth of new political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keil|first1=Soeren|title=Multinational Federalism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1941)===
{{main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1918–1941)}}
Following World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over [[redistribution (economics)|property redistribution]], and formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.&lt;ref name="Riedlmayer"/&gt;

The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major [[ethnic group]]s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslavian kingdom saw few benefits for the Bosniaks; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in Austro-Hungary, Muslims (Bosniaks) owned 91.1%, Orthodox Serbians owned 6.0%, Croatian Catholics owned 2.6% and others, 0.3% of the property. Following the reforms Bosnian Muslims were dispossessed of a total of 1,175,305 hectares of agricultural and forest land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj|url=http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm|title=An International Symposium "Southeastern Europe 1918–1995"|publisher=Hic.hr|accessdate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as [[Mehmed Spaho]] ensured the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Subdivisions|banates]] or ''[[banovina (region)|banovinas]]'' that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration.

The [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|Cvetković-Maček Agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of Croatia|Croatian banate]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a [[partition of Bosnia]] between Croatia and Serbia.&lt;ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1996"/&gt; However the rising threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]] forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention. Following a period that saw attempts at [[appeasement]], the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact|Tripartite Treaty]], and a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]], Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

Once the kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by Nazi forces in World War II, all of Bosnia was ceded to the Nazi puppet regime, the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH). The NDH leaders embarked on a [[World War II persecution of Serbs|campaign of extermination]] of Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people|Romani]] as well as dissident Croats, and, later, [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] by setting up a number of [[Jasenovac concentration camp|death camps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4479837.stm|title=Balkan 'Auschwitz' haunts Croatia|publisher=BBC News|date=25 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Serbs themselves took up arms and joined the [[Chetniks]], a Serb nationalist movement with the aim of establishing an ethnically homogeneous '[[Greater Serbia]]n' state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|date=2006|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-34656-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 1941, a group of 108 prominent Sarajevan Muslims signed the [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] by which they condemned the persecution of Serbs organized by the [[Ustaše]], made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and the Muslim population as a whole, presented information about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs, and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hadžijahić|first=Muhamed|title=Istorija Naroda Bosne i Hercegovine|date=1973|publisher=Institut za istoriju radničkog pokreta|location=Sarajevo|language=Serbo-Croatian|page=277|chapter=Muslimanske rezolucije iz 1941 godine [Muslim resolutions of 1941]|chapterurl=https://www.scribd.com/doc/47323922/Muhamed-Hadzijahic-Muslimanske-rezolucije-1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]] organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]], who fought against both Axis and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943 the [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Habsburg borders.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans, resulting in the successful [[Maclean Mission]], but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead. All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in Bosnia–Herzegovina and its peoples bore the brunt of fighting.

Due to its central geographic position within the Yugoslavian federation, post-war Bosnia was selected as a base for the development of the [[Defense (military)|military defense]] industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in [[Bosnian War|the war that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was a peaceful and very prosperous country, with high employment, a strong industrial and export oriented economy, good education system and social and medical security for every citizen of S. R. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Several international corporations operated in Bosnia— [[Volkswagen]] (car factory in Sarajevo, from 1972), [[Coca-Cola]] (from 1975), SKF Sweden (from 1967), Marlboro, (a tobacco factory in Sarajevo), and [[Holiday Inn]] hotels.  Sarajevo was the site of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].

During the 1950s and 1960s Bosnia was a political backwater of the Republic of Yugoslavia.  In the 1970s a strong Bosnian political elite arose, fueled in part by Tito's leadership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia's [[diplomatic corps]]. While working within the Socialist system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name="Stojic"&gt;Stojic, Mile (2005).

[[BH Dani]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic did not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time. With the fall of communism and the start of the break-up of Yugoslavia, doctrine of tolerance began to lose its potency, creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

On 18 November 1990, multi-party parliamentary elections were held throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Serb members of parliament, consisting mainly of the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska|Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990. This Assembly established the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, which was renamed [[Republika Srpska (1992&amp;ndash;95)|Republika Srpska]] in August 1992. On 18 November 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the ruling party in the Republic of Croatia, the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), proclaimed the existence of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]], with the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) as its military branch.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Prlić et al.

The Bosniak-Croat conflict ended in March 1994, with the signing of the [[Washington Agreement]], leading to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which amalgamated HVO-held territory with that held by the ARBiH.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Following the Srebrenica massacre, [[NATO]] launched a [[Operation Deliberate Force|bombing campaign]] against Republika Srpska in August 1995. The bombing, together with a joint HV/HVO/ARBiH ground offensive in western Bosnia, convinced the Bosnian Serb leadership to consider a negotiated settlement, which manifested itself in the [[Dayton Agreement]] of December 1995. It brought an end to active combat and roughly established the basic political structure of the present-day state. A [[IFOR|NATO-led peacekeeping force]] was immediately dispatched to the country to enforce the agreement. An estimated 100,000 people were killed in the war, about two-thirds of whom were Bosniak.&lt;ref name="idc.org.ba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idc.org.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=126&amp;lang=bs|title=Research and Documentation Center: Rezultati istraživanja "Ljudski gubici '91–'95"|author=|date=|work=idc.org.ba|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203232759/http://www.idc.org.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=126&amp;lang=bs|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 2.2 million citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina of all ethnicities were displaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0c58.pdf|title=The humanitarian operation in Bosnia, 1992–95: the dilemmas of negotiating humanitarian access |date=May 1999 |publisher=United Nations High Commission for Refugees |accessdate=24 June 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) has ruled the conflict involved the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (subsequently [[Serbia and Montenegro]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882595 |title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882594 |title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Croatia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of Bosnian Serb officials and soldiers have been convicted for their role in war crimes and crimes against humanity during the conflict, as well as for the genocide in Srebrenica.

The country's name comes from the two alleged regions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] whose border was never defined. Historically, Bosnia's official name never included any of its many regions until the Austria-Hungarian occupation.

The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central [[Dinaric Alps]]. The northeastern parts reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]], while in the south it borders the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. The Dinaric Alps generally run in a southeast-northwest direction, and get higher towards the south. The highest point of the country is the peak of [[Maglić (mountain)|Maglić]] at {{convert|2,386|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, on the Montenegrin border. Major mountains include [[Kozara]], [[Grmeč]], [[Vlašić (Bosnian mountain)|Vlašić]], [[Čvrsnica Mountain|Čvrsnica]], [[Prenj]], [[Romanija]], [[Jahorina]], [[Bjelašnica Mountain|Bjelašnica]] and [[Treskavica]]. The geological composition of the Dinaric chain of mountains in Bosnia consists primarily of [[limestone]] (including [[Mesozoic]] limestone), with deposits of [[iron]], [[coal]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[bauxite]], [[lead]], and [[salt]] present in some areas, especially in central and northern Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cuvalo|first1=Ante|title=The A to Z of Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Plymouth, UK|isbn=0810876477|page=lxxi, 154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in the centre, east and west parts of Bosnia. Herzegovina has drier Mediterranean climate, with dominant [[karst]] topography. Northern Bosnia ([[Posavina]]) contains very fertile agricultural land along the River Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Pannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The country has only {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} of coastline,&lt;ref name="coastline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neum coastline"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/place/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina Bosnia-and-Herzegovina Neum britannica.com], ''britannica.com'', 9 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; around the town of [[Neum]] in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by international law, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[right of passage]] to the outer sea.

[[Sarajevo]] is the capital&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccbh.ba/public/down/USTAV_BOSNE_I_HERCEGOVINE_engl.pdf|title=Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and largest city.{{sfn|CIA}} Other major cities are [[Banja Luka]] and [[Bihać]] in the northwest region known as [[Bosanska Krajina]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Tuzla]] in the northeast, [[Zenica]] in the central part of Bosnia and [[Mostar]], the largest city in [[Herzegovina]].

There are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina:&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web |title=Watershed Management in Mountain Regions in Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0269e/A0269E05.pdf |publisher=FAO |page=113 |author=Izet Čengić, Azra Čabaravdić |accessdate=16 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014093452/ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0269e/A0269E05.pdf |archivedate=2017-10-14 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Sava]] is the largest river of the country, and forms its northern [[natural border]] with Croatia. It drains 76%&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; of the country's territory into the Danube and then the Black Sea. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a member of the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]] (ICPDR).
* The [[Una (Sava)|Una]], [[Sana River|Sana]] and [[Vrbas River|Vrbas]] are right tributaries of Sava river. They are in the northwestern region of Bosanska Krajina.
* The [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river gave its name to the country, and is the longest river fully contained within it. It stretches through central Bosnia, from its source near [[Sarajevo]] to Sava in the north.
* The [[Drina]] flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, and for the most part it forms a natural border with Serbia.
* The [[Neretva]] is the major river of Herzegovina and the only major river that flows south, into the Adriatic Sea.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the Pannonian [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian [[deciduous|deciduous forests]].

{{main|Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Map Bih entities.png|thumb|right|Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (FBiH); [[Republika Srpska]] (RS); and [[Brčko District]] (BD).]]

The Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby [[executive power]] is exercised by the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Council of Ministers and the [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Members of the Parliamentary Assembly are chosen according to a [[proportional representation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parlament.ba/Content/Read/182?title=ParlamentarizamuBosniiHercegoviniuperiodu1945.%E2%80%931990.&amp;lang=en|title=Parliamentarism in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the period 1945 – 1990|website=www.parlament.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ccbh.ba/public/down/USTAV_BOSNE_I_HERCEGOVINE_engl.pdf|title=Open and transparent budget process in Western Balkan countries|author=Marjan Nikolov and Borce Trenovski and Gabriela Dimovska|publisher=MPRA Paper No. 76299|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a [[liberal democracy]]. It has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton accord]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996, the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves.

The [[Brčko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000, out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Brčko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Brčko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.&lt;ref name="OHR"&gt;OHR Bulletin 66 (3 February 1998).

}}

The third level of Bosnia and Herzegovina's political subdivision is manifested in [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. Each has a cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws to ensure the equality of all constituent people.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipality. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska into 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Besides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four "official" cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Istočno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).

As a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state. The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.

The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.

The Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of [[proportional representation]] (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

However, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country and is selected by the [[European Union]]. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |title='The Contradictions of "Democracy" without Consent', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517144513/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |archivedate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.

===Military===
{{one source|section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:AFBiH OLS2018.jpg|thumb|Ground troops of AFBiH during an excessive training course in October 2018.|right]]
The [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (OSBiH) were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] was founded in 2004.

The Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 14,725 active and 7,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces have 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPADS]] hand-held missiles, [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. The Army has recently adopted remodeled [[MARPAT]] uniforms, used by Bosnian soldiers serving with [[ISAF]] in [[Afghanistan]]. A domestic production program is now underway to ensure that army units are equipped with the correct ammunition.

Beginning in 2007, the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] undertook the army's first ever international assistance mission, enlisting the military to serve with [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] peace missions to [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2007. Five officers, acting as officers/advisors, served in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. 45 soldiers, mostly acting as base security and medical assistants, served in [[Afghanistan]]. 85 Bosnian soldiers served as base security in [[Iraq]], occasionally conducting infantry patrols there as well. All three deployed groups have been commended by their respective international forces as well as the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The international assistance operations are still ongoing.

The Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] were merged in 2006. The [[Air Force]] has seen improvements in the last few years with added funds for aircraft repairs and improved cooperation with the [[Ground Forces]] as well as to the citizens of the country.  The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is pursuing the acquisition of new aircraft including helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|title=Bosnia breaks through ethnic divide by merging Serb, Muslim-Croat forces|publisher=Stars and Stripes|date=11 January 2006|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|EU integration]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it initiated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] in 2007. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, Member States of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm|title=European Commission&amp;nbsp;– Enlargement&amp;nbsp;– Bosnia and Herzegovina&amp;nbsp;– Relations with the EU|work=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=3 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126024355/http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm|archivedate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, relations with its neighbors of [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] have been fairly stable since the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995. On 23 April 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina received the [[Membership Action Plan]] from [[NATO]], which is the last step before full membership in the alliance. Full membership was expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The equal status of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian was verified by the Constitutional Court in 2000.&lt;ref name=Footitt/&gt; It ruled the provisions of the Federation and Republika Srpska constitutions on language were incompatible with the state constitution, since they only recognised "Bosniak" and Croatian (in the case of the Federation) and Serbian (in the case of Republika Srpska) as official languages at the entity level. As a result, the wording of the entity constitutions was changed and all three languages were made official in both entities.&lt;ref name=Footitt/&gt; The three [[standard languages]] are fully [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] and are known collectively under the appellation of [[Serbo-Croatian]], despite this term not being formally recognized in the country. Use of one of the three languages has become a marker of ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Identity in the Balkans: Serbo-Croatian and its Disintegration|last=Greenberg|first=Robert David|date=2004|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925815-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kelly and Catherine Baker argue: "The three official languages of today's Bosnian state...represent the symbolic assertion of national identity over the pragmatism of mutual intelligibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpreting the Peace: Peace Operations, Conflict and Language in Bosnia–Herzegovina|first1=Michael|last1=Kelly|first2=Catherine|last2=Baker|location=Basingstoke|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|date=2013|page=10|isbn=1137029838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1992 [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the following minority languages: [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and Jewish ([[Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]).&lt;ref name="charter-ratifications"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reservations and Declarations for Treaty No.148 – European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/148/declarations?p_auth=63PpH3zN|website=Council of Europe|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mostly remnants of [[Donauschwaben]] (Danube Swabians), who settled in the area after the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg monarchy]] claimed the Balkans from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Due to [[Flight and expulsion of Germans|expulsions]] and [[Organised persecution of ethnic Germans|(forced) assimilation]] after the two [[World War]]s, the number of ethnic Germans in Bosnia and Herzegovina was drastically diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agdm.fuen.org/mitglied-102/bosnia-and-herzegovina/ |title=Deutsche Minderheit in Bosnien-Herzegowina – German minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina |author=Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutscher Minderheiten |work=fuen.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925092959/http://agdm.fuen.org/mitglied-102/bosnia-and-herzegovina/ |archivedate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia faces the dual-problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing transitional liberal market reforms to its formerly mixed economy. One legacy of the previous era is a strong industry; under former republic president [[Džemal Bijedić]] and SFRY President [[Josip Broz Tito]], metal industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's plants; S.R. Bosnia and Herzegovina had a very strong industrial export oriented economy in the 1970s and 1980s, with large scale exports worth millions of [[US$]].

For most of Bosnia's history, agriculture has been conducted on privately owned farms; Fresh food has traditionally been exported from the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/225/t225-4.htm |title=A Divided Bosnia, January 29, 1996 |first=Aleksandar |last=Ciric |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war in the 1990s, caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy.&lt;ref&gt;Daclon, Corrado Maria (1997). Bosnia. Maggioli.

Figures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004; this and Bosnia's shrinking [[Government debt|national debt]] being negative trends, and high unemployment 38.7% and a large [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]] remain cause for concern.

The national currency is the (Euro-pegged) [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark|Convertible Mark]] (KM), controlled by the [[currency board]]. Annual inflation is the lowest relative to other countries in the region at 1.9% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|title=[[The World Factbook|World Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international debt was $5.1&amp;nbsp;billion (as on 31 December 2014)&amp;nbsp;. [[Gross domestic product|Real GDP]] growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Central Bank of BiH]] and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has displayed positive progress in the previous years, which decisively moved its place from the lowest income equality rank of [[List of countries by income equality|income equality rankings]] fourteen out of 193 nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/HDR06-complete.pdf#page=335 |title=Table 15: Inequality in income or expenditure |accessdate=9 January 2007 |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |date=2006 |format=PDF |work=Human Development Report 2006|page=335 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206223646/http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/HDR06-complete.pdf#page=335 |archivedate=6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Bosnia and Herzegovina's PPS GDP per capita stood at 29 per cent of the EU average in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114 |title=GDP per capita in PPS |publisher=Eurostat |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{main|Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Sarajevo University building.JPG|thumb|right|The [[University of Sarajevo]]'s [[Sarajevo Law School|Faculty of Law]] ]]

Higher education has a long and rich tradition in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first bespoke higher-education institution was a school of [[Sufism|Sufi]] philosophy established by [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] in 1531. Numerous other religious schools then followed. In 1887, under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a [[Sharia]] law school began a five-year program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=145 University of Sarajevo] on Sarajevo official web site&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s the [[University of Sarajevo]] became the city's first secular higher education institute. In the 1950s post-bachelaurate graduate degrees became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unsa.ba/eng/ouni.php |publisher=University of Sarajevo |title=About University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110445/http://www.unsa.ba/eng/ouni.php |archivedate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severely damaged during the war, it was recently rebuilt in partnership with more than 40 other universities. There are various other institutions of higher education, including: [[University "Džemal Bijedić" of Mostar]], [[University of Banja Luka]], [[University of Mostar]], [[University of East Sarajevo]], [[University of Tuzla]], [[American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which is held in high regard as one of the most prestigious creative arts academies in the region.

Also, Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to several private and international higher education institutions, some of which are:

* [[Sarajevo School of Science and Technology]]
* [[International University of Sarajevo]]
* [[American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
* [[Sarajevo Graduate School of Business]]
* [[International Burch University]]

Primary schooling lasts for nine years. Secondary education is provided by general and technical secondary schools (typically [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasiums]]) where studies typically last for four years. All forms of secondary schooling include an element of [[vocational education|vocational training]]. Pupils graduating from general secondary schools obtain the [[Matura]] and can enroll in any tertiary educational institution or academy by passing a qualification examination prescribed by the governing body or institution. Students graduating technical subjects obtain a [[Diploma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/boherco.htm |title=Education System in Bosnia and Herzegovina |website=EuroEducation.net – The European Education Directory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

The architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely influenced by four major periods where political and social changes influenced the creation of distinct cultural and architectural habits of the population. Each period made its influence felt and contributed to a greater diversity of cultures and architectural language in this region.

=== Media ===
{{Main|Media of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

[[File:Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BHRT) building, Sarajevo.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|The [[Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] headquarter in [[Sarajevo]].]]

Some television, magazines, and newspapers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are state-owned, and some are for-profit corporations funded by [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]].

As a [[country in transition]] with a post-war legacy and a [[politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|complex domestic political structure]] Bosnia and Herzegovina's media system is under transformation. In the early post-war period (1995–2005), media development was guided mainly by international donors and cooperation agencies, who invested to help reconstruct, diversify, democratize and professionalize media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;Hozić, 2008; Thompson &amp; De Luce, 2002; Kurspahić, 2003; Jusić, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EJC&gt;Tarik Jusić, "[http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053605/http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina |date=4 March 2016 }}", EJC Media Landscapes&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war developments included the establishment of an independent Communication Regulatory Agency, the adoption of a Press Code, the establishment of the Press Council, the decriminalization of label and defamation, the introduction of a rather advanced Freedom of Access to Information Law, and the creation of a Public Service Broadcasting System from the formerly state-owned broadcaster.
Yet, internationally backed positive developments have been often obstructed by domestic elites, and the professionalisation of media and journalists has proceeded only slowly. High levels of partisanship and linkages between the media and the political systems hinder the adherence to professional code of conducts.&lt;ref name=EJC/&gt;

===Literature===
{{main|Literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literature, including the [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Ivo Andrić]] and poets such as Croat [[Antun Branko Šimić]], [[Aleksa Šantić]], [[Jovan Dučić]] and [[Mak Dizdar]], writers such as [[Zlatko Topčić]], [[Meša Selimović]], [[Semezdin Mehmedinović]], [[Miljenko Jergović]], [[Isak Samokovlija]], [[Safvet beg Bašagić]], [[Abdulah Sidran]], [[Petar Kočić]], [[Aleksandar Hemon]], and Nedžad Ibrišimović. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was the dramatist [[Branislav Nušić]].
Magazines such as ''[[Novi Plamen]]'' or ''[http://sveske.ba/en Sarajevske sveske]'' are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.

[[File:Bosniangraves bosniska gravar februari 2007 stecak stecci5.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|Stećci from Radimlja, near [[Stolac]] (13th century)]]

The art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Stećci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], [[Petar Šain]], [[Roman Petrović]] and [[Lazar Drljača]].

After World War II artists like [[Mersad Berber]] and [[Safet Zec]] rose in popularity.

In 2007, [[Ars Aevi]], a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}

[[File:MayaSar 2018 BL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maya Sar]], born in [[Tuzla]] is just one of the well-known musicians who participated in [[Eurovision]] 2012.]]
Typical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zonić]], [[Goran Bregović]], [[Davorin Popović]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Elvir Laković]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Hari Mata Hari]] and [[Dino Merlin]]. Other composers such as [[Đorđe Novković]], [[Al' Dino]], [[Haris Džinović]], [[Kornelije Kovač]], and many pop and [[Rock bands|rock band]]s, for example, [[Bijelo dugme|Bijelo Dugme]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Divlje Jagode]], [[Indexi]], [[Plavi orkestar|Plavi Orkestar]], [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Ambasadori]], [[Dubioza kolektiv]], who were among the leading ones in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia is home to the composer [[Dušan Šestić]], the creator of the [[national anthem]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer [[Marija Šestić]], to the world known jazz musician, educator and Bosnian jazz ambassador [[Sinan Alimanović]], composer [[Saša Lošić]] and pianist [[Saša Toperić]]. In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient ''[[Gusle]]''. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.

Probably the most distinctive and identifiably "Bosnian" of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[saz (musical instrument)|saz]], a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.

{{main|Bosnian root music}}
Rural folk traditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina include the shouted, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[ganga (music)|ganga]] and "ravne pjesme" (''flat song'') styles, as well as instruments like a droneless [[bagpipe]], wooden [[flute]] and [[šargija]]. The [[gusle]], an instrument found throughout the [[Balkans]], is also used to accompany ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[epic poetry|epic]] [[poems]]. There are also Bosnian folk songs in the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, derived from the area's Jewish population.

''Bosnian roots music'' came from [[Central Bosnia Canton|Middle Bosnia]], [[Posavina]], the [[Drina]] valley and [[Kalesija]]. It is usually performed by singers with two violinists and a [[sargija|šargija]] player. These bands first appeared around [[World War I]] and became popular in the 1960s. This is the third oldest music following after the [[sevdalinka]] and ilahija. Self-taught people, mostly in two or three members of the different choices of old instruments, mostly in the violin, sacking, [[Bağlama|saz]], drums, flutes (zurle) or wooden flute, as others have already called, the original performers of Bosnian music that can not be written notes, transmitted by ear from generation to generation, family is usually hereditary. It is thought to be brought from Persia-Kalesi tribe that settled in the area of present Sprecanski valleys and hence probably the name Kalesija. In this part of Bosnia it is the most common. Again, it became the leader of First World War onwards, as well as 60 years in the field Sprecanski doline. This kind of music was enjoyed by all three peoples in Bosnia, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and it contributed a lot to reconcile people socializing, entertainment and other organizations through festivala. In Kalesija it's maintained each year with the Bosnian Festival Original music.

Studio Kemix firm Dzemal Dzihanovic from [[Živinice]] together with his artists brought this kind of music to perfection at the end 20th century. With its entirely new form of modernity, it is most common in the [[Tuzla Canton]] and the cradle of this music city [[Živinice]] was named Bosnian town of original music. Songs are performed preferably in a [[diphthong]], the first and second voice which is a special secret performance of this music and some performers sing in troglasju as they do Kalesijski triple that was recorded in 1968, as the first written record of the tone on the album, along with Higurashi no naku.

Sarajevo is internationally renowned for its eclectic and diverse selection of festivals. The [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] was established in 1995, during the Bosnian War and has become the premier and largest film festival in the Balkans and South-East Europe.

Bosnia has a rich cinematic and film heritage, dating back to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]; many Bosnian filmmakers have achieved international prominence and some have won international awards ranging from the [[Academy Awards]] to multiple [[Palme d'Or]]s and [[Golden Bear]]s. Some notable Bosnian filmmakers, screenwriters and cinematographers are [[Danis Tanović]] (known for the Academy Award– and [[Golden Globe Award]]–winning 2001 film ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'' and [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize]]–winning 2016 film ''[[Death in Sarajevo]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Home Festival Awards &amp; Juries: International Jury "Prizes Of The International Jury |website=www.berlinale.de/en |date=2016 |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emir Kusturica]] (won two [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes), [[Jasmila Žbanić]] (won Golden Bear), [[Zlatko Topčić]], [[Ademir Kenović]], Dino Mustafić, [[Benjamin Filipović]], [[Jasmin Dizdar]], [[Pjer Žalica]], [[Srđan Vuletić]], [[Aida Begić]] etc.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}
[[File:Bosnian meat platter.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Bosnian meat platter]]
Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. Some local specialties are [[Ćevapčići|ćevapi]], [[burek]], [[dolma]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[pilav]], [[goulash]], [[ajvar]] and a whole range of Eastern sweets. Ćevapi is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of [[kebab]], popular in former Yugoslavia and considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2009|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 July 2009|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/700826/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aoVUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=cevapcici|title=The new Encyclopædia Britannica: A-ak&amp;nbsp;– Bayes, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pssZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=cevapcici|title=Countries and Their Cultures: Saint Kitts and Nevis to Zimbabwe|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=TravelSerbia.Info&amp;nbsp;– Your travel guide for Serbia|accessdate=9 August 2010|url=http://www.travelserbia.info/serbian-cuisine.php|title=Serbian cuisine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local wines come from [[Herzegovina]] where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Herzegovinian ''loza'' (similar to Italian [[Grappa]] but less sweet) is very popular. Plum (''rakija'') or apple (''jabukovača'') alcohol beverages are produced in the north. In the south, distilleries used to produce vast quantities of [[brandy]] and supply all of ex-Yugoslav alcohol factories (brandy is the base of most [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]]).

===Leisure activities===
Coffeehouses, where [[Bosnian coffee]] is served in [[cezve|džezva]] with [[Turkish Delight|rahat lokum]] and sugar cubes, proliferate [[Sarajevo]] and every city in the country. Coffee drinking is a favorite Bosnian pastime and part of the culture. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the ninth country in the entire world by per capita coffee consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Croatian|Cetinska kultura|topic=culture|date=August 2017}}
The '''Cetina culture''' is the name for the culture of the inhabitants of the Middle [[Dalmatian coast]], and especially its hinterland, during the early [[Bronze Age]] (1900 to 1600 BC), or, according to [[Paul Reineck]]'s chronology, Br A1-A2/B1 (2200 BC).{{cn|date=September 2017}} It is named after the numerous sites along the [[Cetina]] river in Central Dalmatia and [[Herzegovina]]. people of this culture were present in caves ([[Skarin Samograd]] near [[Drniš]], Gudnja near [[Ston]], Ravlić cave in [[Drinovci]]) or in open settlements (Gradac in [[Kotorac]] and Krstina near [[Posušje]]). The graves are in rocky colonies. In the case of [[burial|inhumation]], they have the shape of a stone chest, while incinerated remains of the deceased are laid in clay pots. 

==Origin==
Cetina culture emerged early in the early Bronze Age on the [[eneolite]] substrate (Adriatic culture); its people belonged to the old Mediterranean population, which was partially Indoeuropeanized but was not [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]].

==Area of diffusion==
The largest number of well-known sites of Cetina culture is located in the interior of Dalmatia, primarily between the upper stream of the Cetina river and the lower [[Neretva]] river. Individual finds are documented on Central Dalmatian islands, [[Palagruz]], Northern Adriatic, deep in the interior of the Western [[Balkans]], [[Albania]], [[Southern Italy]], and [[Greece]].

==Settlements==
Settlements are the least known aspect of Cetina culture. The most significant deposits of Cetina culture were discovered in the Škarin Samograd cave located at the foot of the [[Mogli brdo]], six kilometers northwest of [[Unešić]]. The amount of findings collected in other researched settlements, mostly caves, suggests mainly temporary inhabitation. The stratigraphy of Škarin Samograd enabled Ivan Marovic and Borivoj Covic to produce a three-phase periodization of Cetina culture, which is still used.

==Early life and education==
Denise Mueller was born into a family of daredevils. Her father, Myron Mueller, was an ultra-distance cyclist; he celebrated his 70th birthday by pedaling the entire perimeter of the continental United States, a distance of more than {{convert|12,000|miles|km}}. He is in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the oldest person to bicycle that perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-myron-mueller-passes-at-age-74-2006apr12-story.html|title=Myron Mueller passes at age 74|last=Morrow|first=Tom|date=April 12, 2006|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Anna Dement, raced midget demolition-derby cars. "In our family, crazy is our sort of normal," Denise said.&lt;ref name = aims/&gt; She graduated from [[San Dieguito High School]].&lt;ref name = "aims"/&gt;

==Career==
Mueller competed as a junior cyclist in her teens and finished in the top three in national and world competitions more than a dozen times.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/09/18/649221471/woman-rides-bicycle-to-183-9-mph-a-new-world-record|title=Woman Rides Bicycle To 183.9 MPH — A World Record|last=Chappell|first=Bill|date=September 18, 2018|work=NPR|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won national championships in road, track and mountain biking 15 times.&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag_092018"/&gt; She retired in 1992 at age 19.&lt;ref name="record" /&gt; She went to work for her family's security company, eventually becoming president and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://durangoherald.com/articles/241987|title=American woman smashes cycling record held by men for more than a decade|work=Durango Herald|access-date=September 25, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mueller-Korenek resumed bicycling and running, competing in marathons and [[Ironman Triathlon]] competitions. Her trainer, both in her teens and later, is [[John Howard (cyclist)|John Howard]], a three-time Olympian and holder of the world speed record before Rompelberg.&lt;ref name = "aims"/&gt; Mueller-Korenek decided to go for the speed record when Howard told her no woman had ever attempted it. She began seriously training to set a new bicycle speed record in 2012. Along the way she won two national titles for her age group.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/denise-mueller-korenek-bike-speed-record-168-mph/|title=The Exquisite, Intricate Insanity of Riding a Bike at 184 mph|last=Lindsey|first=Joe|date=September 13, 2018|work=Wired|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she made her first run at the record at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]]. Her speed of {{convert|147.7|mph|abbr=on}} established the women's world record.&lt;ref name = "Wired"/&gt;

In paced bicycle racing, the cyclist follows immediately behind a pace car equipped with a wind shield, so that they are pedaling in the car's slipstream. Riding at that speed just inches behind a pace car is so dangerous that most world-class cyclists don't attempt it.&lt;ref name = "aims"/&gt; The custom bicycle is geared so high that it has to be towed by the pace car until it reaches {{convert|90|to|100|mph}}; the cyclist then casts off the towrope and pedals under their own power.&lt;ref name = "Wired"/&gt; Rompelberg, whose record she was trying to break, encouraged her efforts and allowed her to use as a pace car the same custom {{convert|1000|hp|adj=on}} dragster he had used in setting the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/9/a-history-of-cycling-speed-records-as-denise-mueller-koronek-reaches-183-mph-541481|title=A history of cycling speed records as Denise Mueller-Koronek reaches 183 mph|last=Hollingum|first=Ben|date=September 21, 2018|work=guinnessworldrecords.com|accessdate=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2018 attempt, Mueller-Korenek circled the track {{frac|3|1|2}} times after casting off the tow rope, breaking the world record on her final mile. Her goal had been to break the previous record of {{convert|167|mph|abbr=on}}; she was surprised to learn she had reached {{convert|183.9|mph|abbr=on}}, breaking Rompelberg's record by almost {{convert|17|mph|abbr=on}}. "We weren't supposed to go more than 175," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45572277|title=Cycling land speed: Denise Mueller-Korenek breaks world record|date=September 19, 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Mueller-Korenek is married to Chris Korenek and has three adult sons. At the time of her world record performance, she was 45 years old and lived in [[Valley Center, California]].&lt;ref name = record/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2368">'''Dükkanlar Önü Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Dükkanlar Önü Camii}}) is a mosque in the [[Karamanzade]] quarter of [[North Nicosia]].

According to George Jeffery, who called it the "Tevfik Masjid", the mosque is originally a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] building, most probably built as an inn due its resemblance to the 16th century inns of [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;"A description of the historic monuments of Cyprus. Studies in the archaeology and architecture of the island" by George Jeffery, Nicosia 1918&lt;/ref&gt; The building had [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arches and engravings from the 14th century, which Muzaffer Haşmet Gürkan described as "ornate". After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of Cyprus, the building was converted into a mosque. In the beginning of the 18th century, the building was renovated by Said Mehmed Agha.&lt;ref name=gurkan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gürkan|first1=Haşmet Muzaffer|title=Dünkü ve Bugünkü Lefkoşa|publisher=Galeri Kültür|isbn=9963660037|pages=114–5|edition=3rd|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[minaret]] of the mosque was demolished in 1952 as it was considered dangerous.&lt;ref name=gurkan/&gt; On 6 September 1962, a large part of the mosque collapsed, killing a [[Greek Cypriot]] woman passing by. The incident caused criticism of the newly founded [[Nicosia Turkish Municipality]], whose response was deemed insufficient. The newspaper ''Bozkurt'' described the mosque at the time as "a building with no architectural or artistic significance, which rather served to meet the religious needs of a commercial neighborhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dlükkânlar önü Camii Yıkıldı, Bir Kadın öldü|publisher=Bozkurt|date=7 September 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse destroyed the entrance arch and other architectural elements of the mosque.&lt;ref name=gurkan/&gt;

In 2011, the Turkish Evkaf Department, in collaboration with the local [[Evkaf Administration]], announced that the mosque would be restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuzey Kıbrıs'ın yarısı vakıf malı|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2011/11/21/kuzey-kibrisin-yarisi-vakif-mali|publisher=Sabah|accessdate=14 March 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aqua rwanda 05jun04 250m.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Image of the region between [[Lake Victoria]] (on the right) and Lakes [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Albert]], [[Lake Kivu|Kivu]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]] (from north to south) showing dense vegetation (bright green) and fires (red).]]

Some parts of East Africa have been renowned for their concentrations of wild animals, such as the "[[Big Five Game|big five]]": the [[African elephant|elephant]], [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]], [[black rhinoceros]],&lt;ref name="IUCN, Black rhinoceros"&gt;Emslie, R. (2012). ''Diceros bicornis''. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species {{doi|10.2305/IUCN.UK.2012.RLTS.T6557A16980917.en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[leopard]], though populations have been declining under increased stress in recent times, particularly those of the rhino and elephant.

The geography of East Africa is often stunning and scenic. Shaped by global plate tectonic forces that have created the [[East African Rift]], East Africa is the site of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and [[Mount Kenya]], the two tallest peaks in Africa. It also includes the world's second largest freshwater lake, [[Lake Victoria]], and the world's second deepest lake, [[Lake Tanganyika]].

The climate of East Africa is rather atypical of equatorial regions. Because of a combination of the region's generally high [[altitude]] and the [[rain shadow]] of the westerly [[monsoon]] winds created by the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands]], East Africa is surprisingly cool and dry for its latitude. In fact, on the coast of Somalia, many years can go by without any rain whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Wallis | first2 = James R | year = 1999| title = Geographical patterning in interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach | url = | journal = Journal of Climate | volume = 12 | issue = 12| pages = 3457–3466 | doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012&lt;3457:gpoirv&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode = 1999JCli...12.3457D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere the annual rainfall generally increases towards the south and with altitude, being around {{convert|400|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at [[Mogadishu]] and {{convert|1200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at [[Mombasa]] on the coast, whilst inland it increases from around {{convert|130|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at [[Garoowe]] to over {{convert|1100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at [[Moshi, Kilimanjaro|Moshi]] near Kilimanjaro. Unusually, most of the rain falls in ''two'' distinct [[wet season]]s, one centred on April and the other in October or November. This is usually attributed to the passage of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] across the region in those months, but it may also be analogous to the autumn monsoon rains of parts of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Vietnam]] and the Brazilian [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Nordeste]].

West of the Rwenzoris and [[Ethiopian highlands]], the rainfall pattern is more typically tropical, with rain throughout the year near the equator and a single wet season in most of the Ethiopian Highlands from June to September – contracting to July and August around [[Asmara]]. Annual rainfall here ranges from over {{convert|1600|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} on the western slopes to around {{convert|1250|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at [[Addis Ababa]] and {{convert|550|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at Asmara. In the high mountains rainfall can be over {{convert|2500|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}.

Rainfall in East Africa is influenced by [[El Niño]] events, which tend to increase rainfall except in the northern and western parts of the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands, where they produce drought and poor [[Nile River|Nile floods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Mike|title=Late Victorian Holocausts: El Niño Famines and the Making of the Third World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IrKEzgkQkMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=263–266|isbn=978-1-85984-382-6|date=July 2002|publisher=Verso}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures in East Africa, except on the hot and generally humid coastal belt, are moderate, with maxima of around {{convert|25|C|F}} and minima of {{convert|15|C|F}} at an altitude of {{convert|1500|m|ft|0}}. At altitudes of above {{convert|2500|m|ft|0}}, [[frost]]s are common during the dry season and maxima typically about {{convert|21|C|F}} or less.

The unique geography and apparent suitability for [[farming]] made East Africa a target for [[Europe]]an [[exploration]], [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] and [[colonialism|colonialization]] in the nineteenth century. Today, [[tourism]] is an important part of the economies of Kenya, Tanzania, Seychelles, and Uganda. The easternmost point of the continent, that is [[Ras Hafun]] in Somalia, is of [[Archaeology|archaeological]], [[History|historical]] and [[Economy|economical]] importance.&lt;ref name="Ncaaroth1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chittick |first=Neville |title=An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition |year=1975 |pages=117–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gssir"&gt;{{cite news |title=Somalia salt industry revives |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/page/show/post/1948/somalia-salt-industry-revives |accessdate=8 March 2015 |agency=Garowe Online|date=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Prehistory===
{{Main article|Recent African origin of modern humans}}
According to the theory of the [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the predominantly held belief among most archaeologists, East Africa is the area where [[anatomically modern humans]] first appeared.&lt;ref name="Agegmowhsh"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu H, Prugnolle F, Manica A, Balloux F | title = A geographically explicit genetic model of worldwide human-settlement history | journal = Am.

The major competing hypothesis is the [[multiregional origin of modern humans]], which envisions a wave of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' migrating earlier from Africa and interbreeding with local ''[[Homo erectus]]'' populations in multiple regions of the globe. Most multiregionalists still view Africa as a major wellspring of human genetic diversity, but allow a much greater role for hybridization.&lt;ref name="JurmainKilgore2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Jurmain |author2=Lynn Kilgore |author3=Wenda Trevathan |title=Essentials of Physical Anthropology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSaSPza9LMYC&amp;pg=PA266 |date=2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-50939-4 |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10766948 | doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(200005)112:1&lt;129::AID-AJPA11&gt;3.0.CO;2-K | volume=112 | issue=1 | title=Multiregional, not multiple origins |date=May 2000 | journal=Am.

Some of the earliest [[hominin]] skeletal remains have been found in the wider region, including fossils discovered in the [[Awash Valley]] of [[Ethiopia]], as well as in the [[Koobi Fora]] in Kenya and [[Olduvai Gorge]] in Tanzania.

The southern part of East Africa was occupied until recent times by [[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s, whereas in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] the [[donkey]] and such crop plants as [[teff]] allowed the beginning of [[agriculture]] around 7,000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]]; ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies]]''; p. 103; {{ISBN|0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowland barriers and diseases carried by the [[tsetse fly]], however, prevented the donkey and agriculture from spreading southwards. Only in quite recent times has agriculture spread to the more humid regions south of the equator, through the spread of [[cattle]], [[sheep]] and crops such as [[millet]]. Language distributions suggest that this most likely occurred from Sudan into the African Great Lakes region, since the [[Nilotic languages]] spoken by these pre-Bantu farmers have their closest relatives in the middle Nile basin.

===Ancient history===
{{Main article|Horn of Africa}}
[[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], northern [[Somalia]], and the [[Red Sea]] coast of [[Sudan]] are considered the most likely location of the land known to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians as ''[[Land of Punt|Punt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andebrhan Welde Giorgis|title=Eritrea at a Crossroads: A Narrative of Triumph, Betrayal and Hope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzlEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|year=2014|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|isbn=978-1-62857-331-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old kingdom's first mention dates to the 25th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Najovits, Simson (2004) ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', Algora Publishing, p. 258, {{ISBN|087586256X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic Egypt]] during the times of [[Pharaoh]] [[Sahure]] and [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Hatshepsut]].

The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|edition=Second|date=1 November 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=48|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=xeJMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Aksum+eritrea&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hh7NUozMMKb07AaFmYCADQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Aksum%20eritrea&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology|author=David Phillipson: revised by Michael DiBlasi|editor=Neil Asher Silberman}}&lt;/ref&gt; It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite [[Iron Age]] period c. 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD. The kingdom is mentioned in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' as an important market place for [[Ivory trade|ivory]], which was exported throughout the ancient world. Aksum was at the time ruled by [[Zoskales]], who also governed the port of [[Adulis]].&lt;ref name="Periplusme"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html ''Periplus of the Erythreaean Sea''], chs. 4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own [[Aksumite currency]]. The state also established its [[hegemony]] over the declining [[Kingdom of Kush]] and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the [[Arabian peninsula]], eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]].

====Bantu expansion====
{{Main article|Bantu expansion}}
Between 2500–3000 years ago, [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples began a millennia-long series of migrations eastward from their homeland around southern Cameroon. This [[Bantu expansion]] introduced agriculture into much of the African Great Lakes region. During the following fifteen centuries, the Bantu slowly intensified farming and grazing over all suitable regions of East Africa, in the process making contact with [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]- and [[Arabic]]-speaking settlers on southern coastal areas. The latter also spread [[Islam]] to the coastal belt, but most Bantu remained [[African Traditional Religion]] adherents.
[[File:East and southern africa early iron age.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Early Iron Age findings in East and Southern Africa]]
Over a period of many centuries, most hunting-foraging peoples were displaced and absorbed by incoming Bantu communities, as well as by later [[Nilotic]] communities.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The [[Bantu expansion]] was a long series of physical migrations, a diffusion of language and knowledge out into and in from neighboring populations, and a creation of new societal groups involving inter-marriage among communities and small groups moving to communities and small groups moving to new areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

After their movements from their original homeland in [[West Africa]], Bantus also encountered in central east Africa peoples of [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] origin. As cattle terminology in use amongst the few modern Bantu [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] groups suggests, the Bantu migrants would acquire [[cattle]] from their new Cushitic neighbors. Linguistic evidence also indicates that Bantus most likely borrowed the custom of milking cattle directly from Cushitic peoples in the area.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Fage, A history of Africa, Routledge, 2002, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

On the coastal section of the African Great Lakes region, another mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili Origins: Swahili Culture &amp; the Shungwaya Phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vURD_nkQGQoC|year=1993|publisher=James Currey Publishers|isbn=978-0-85255-075-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swahili culture]] that emerged from these exchanges evinces many Arab and Islamic influences not seen in traditional Bantu culture, as do the many [[Afro-Arab]] members of the Bantu [[Swahili people]]. With its original speech community centered on the coastal parts of [[Tanzania]] (particularly [[Zanzibar]]) and [[Kenya]]—a seaboard referred to as the [[Swahili Coast]]—the Bantu [[Swahili language]] contains many [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[loan-words]] as a consequence of these interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Don Nanjira, African Foreign Policy and Diplomacy: From Antiquity to the 21st Century, ABC-CLIO, 2010, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===

====Arab and Portuguese eras====
{{Main article|Portuguese East Africa|History of Oman}}
The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first Europeans to explore the region of current-day [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Mozambique]] by sea. [[Vasco da Gama]] visited [[Mombasa]] in 1498. Da Gama's voyage was successful in reaching [[India]], which permitted the Portuguese to trade with the [[Far East]] directly by sea. This in turn challenged the older trading networks of mixed land and sea routes, such as the [[spice trade]] routes which utilized the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Red Sea]] and [[camel train|camel caravans]] to reach the eastern Mediterranean.

The [[Republic of Venice]] had gained control over much of the trade routes between Europe and Asia. After traditional land routes to India had been closed by the [[Ottoman Turk]]s, Portugal hoped to use the sea route pioneered by da Gama to break the once Venetian trading monopoly. Portuguese rule in the African Great Lakes region focused mainly on a coastal strip centered around Mombasa. The Portuguese presence in the area officially began after 1505, when flagships under the command of [[Francisco de Almeida|Don Francisco de Almeida]] conquered [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], an island located in what is now southern [[Tanzania]].

In March 1505, having received from [[Manuel I of Portugal]] the appointment of viceroy of the newly conquered [[Portuguese India|territory in India]], he set sail from [[Lisbon]] in command of a large and powerful fleet, and arrived in July at Quiloa ([[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]]), which yielded to him almost without a struggle. A much more vigorous resistance was offered by the [[Moors]] of Mombasa. However, the town was taken and destroyed, and its large treasures went to strengthen the resources of Almeida. Attacks followed on Hoja (now known as Ungwana, located at the mouth of the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]]), Barawa, Angoche, [[Pate Island|Pate]] and other coastal towns until the western [[Indian Ocean]] was a safe haven for Portuguese commercial interests. At other places on his way, such as the island of Angediva, near [[Goa]], and [[Kannur|Cannanore]], the Portuguese built forts, and adopted measures to secure the Portuguese supremacy.

Portugal's main goal on the Swahili coast was to take control of the spice trade from the [[Arabs]]. At this stage, the Portuguese presence in East Africa served the purposes of controlling trade within the Indian Ocean and securing the sea routes linking Europe to Asia. Portuguese naval vessels were very disruptive to the commerce of Portugal's enemies within the western Indian Ocean and were able to demand high tariffs on items transported through the sea due to their strategic control of ports and shipping lanes. The construction of [[Fort Jesus]] in Mombasa in 1593 was meant to solidify Portuguese hegemony in the region, but their influence was clipped by the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[Oman]]i [[Arab]] incursions into the Great Lakes region during the 17th century.

The Omani Arabs posed the most direct challenge to Portuguese influence in the African Great Lakes regigon. They besieged Portuguese fortresses, openly attacked naval vessels and expelled the Portuguese from the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts by 1730. By this time, the [[Portuguese Empire]] had already lost its interest on the spice trade sea route due to the decreasing profitability of that business. The Arabs reclaimed much of the [[Indian Ocean trade]], forcing the Portuguese to retreat south where they remained in [[Portuguese East Africa]] (Mozambique) as sole rulers until the 1975 independence of Mozambique.

Omani Arab [[colonization]] of the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts brought the once independent [[city-states]] under closer foreign scrutiny and domination than was experienced during the Portuguese period. Like their predecessors, the Omani Arabs were primarily able only to control the coastal areas, not the interior. However, the creation of clove [[plantations]], intensification of the [[slave trade]] and relocation of the Omani capital to [[Zanzibar]] in 1839 by [[Seyyid Said]] had the effect of consolidating the Omani power in the region.

Arab governance of all the major ports along the Swahili coast continued until British interests aimed particularly at ending the slave trade and creation of a [[wage-labour]] system began to put pressure on Omani rule. By the late nineteenth century, the slave trade on the open seas had been completely outlawed by the British and the Omani Arabs had little ability to resist the British navy's ability to enforce the directive. The Omani presence continued in Zanzibar and [[Pemba, Tanzania|Pemba]] until the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] in 1964. However, the official Omani Arab presence in Kenya was checked by German and British seizure of key ports and creation of crucial trade alliances with influential local leaders in the 1880s.

====Period of European imperialism====
[[File:Britisheastafrica 1.png|thumb|Map of British East Africa in 1911]]
Between the 19th and 20th century, East Africa became a theatre of competition between the major imperialistic European nations of the time. The three main colors of the African country were beige, red, and blue. The red stood for the English, blue stood for the French, and the beige stood for Germany during the period of colonialism. During the period of the [[Scramble for Africa]], almost every country in the larger region to varying degrees became part of a European [[Colony|colonial]] empire.

[[Portugal]] had first established a strong presence in southern [[Mozambique]] and the Indian Ocean since the 15th century, while during this period their possessions increasingly grew including parts from the present northern Mozambique country, up to [[Mombasa]] in present-day Kenya. At [[Lake Malawi]], they finally met the recently created British [[Protectorate]] of [[Nyasaland]] (nowadays [[Malawi]]), which surrounded the homonymous lake on three sides, leaving the Portuguese the control of lake's eastern coast. The [[British Empire]] set foot in the region's most exploitable and promising lands acquiring what is today [[Uganda]], and [[Kenya]]. The Protectorate of [[Uganda]] and the Colony of [[Kenya]] were located in a rich farmland area mostly appropriate for the cultivation of [[cash crops]] like [[coffee]] and [[tea]], as well as for animal husbandry with products produced from cattle and goats, such as [[Domestic goat|goat meat]], [[beef]] and [[milk]]. Moreover, this area had the potential for a significant residential expansion, being suitable for the relocation of a large number of British nationals to the region. Prevailing climatic conditions and the regions' [[geomorphology]] allowed the establishment of flourishing European style settlements like [[Nairobi]], [[Vila Pery]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Porto Amélia]], [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]] and [[Entebbe]].

The [[France|French]] settled the largest island of the Indian Ocean (and the fourth-largest globally), [[Madagascar]], along with a group of smaller islands nearby, namely [[Réunion]] and the [[Comoros]]. Madagascar [[French Madagascar|became part]] of the [[French colonial empires|French colonial empire]] following [[Second Madagascar expedition|two military campaigns]] against the [[Kingdom of Madagascar]], which it initiated after persuading Britain to relinquish its interests in the island in exchange for control of [[Zanzibar]] off the coast of [[Tanganyika]], an important island hub of the [[spice]]s trade. The British also held a number of island colonies in the region, including the extended [[archipelago]] of [[Seychelles]] and the rich farming island of [[Mauritius]], previously under the French [[sovereignty]].

The [[German Empire]] gained control of a large area named [[German East Africa]], comprising present-day [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]] and the mainland part of [[Tanzania]] named Tanganyika. In 1922, the British gained a [[League of Nations mandate]] over Tanganyika which it administered until Independence was granted to Tanganyika in 1961. Following the Zanzibar Revolution of 1965, the independent state of Tanganyika formed the [[United Republic of Tanzania]] by creating a union between the mainland, and the island chain of Zanzibar. Zanzibar is now a semi-autonomous state in a union with the mainland which is collectively and commonly referred to as [[Tanzania]]. German East Africa, though very extensive, was not of such strategic importance as the [[British monarchy|British Crown's]] colonies to the north: the inhabitation of these lands was difficult and thus limited, mainly due to climatic conditions and the local geomorphology. Italy gained control of various parts of [[Somalia]] in the 1880s. The southern three-fourths of Somalia became an Italian [[protectorate]] ([[Italian Somaliland]]).

Meanwhile, in 1884, a narrow coastal strip of northern Somalia came under British control ([[British Somaliland]]). This northern protectorate was just opposite the British colony of [[Aden]] on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. With these territories secured, Britain was able to serve as gatekeeper of the [[sea lane]] leading to [[British Raj|British India]]. In 1890, beginning with the purchase of the small port town of ([[Asseb]]) from a local sultan in [[Eritrea]], the Italians colonized all of Eritrea.

In 1895, from bases in Somalia and Eritrea, the Italians launched the [[First Italo–Ethiopian War]] against the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Empire of [[Ethiopia]]. By 1896, the war had become a total disaster for the Italians and Ethiopia was able to retain its independence. Ethiopia remained independent until 1936 when, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], it became part of [[Italian East Africa]]. The Italian occupation of Ethiopia ended in 1941 during [[World War II]] as part of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].The French also staked out an East African outpost on the route to [[French Indochina]]. Starting in the 1850s, the small protectorate of [[Djibouti]] became [[French Somaliland]] in 1897.

==Languages==
{{see|Afroasiatic languages|Niger-Congo languages|Nilo-Saharan languages|Indo-European languages}}
In the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Nile Valley]], [[Afroasiatic languages]] predominate, including languages of the family's [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] (such as [[Beja language|Beja]], [[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Somali language|Somali]]), [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] (such as [[Amharic]], [[Arabic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]), and [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] (such as [[Wolaytta language|Wolaytta]]) branches.

In the [[African Great Lakes]] region, [[Niger-Congo languages]] of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branch are most widely spoken. Among these languages are [[Gikuyu language|Kikuyu]], [[Kinyarwanda]], [[Kirundi]], [[Runyakitara]] and [[Luganda]]. [[Swahili language|Swahili]], with at least 80 million speakers as a first or second language, is an important trade language in the Great Lakes area. It has official status in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. 

[[Nilo-Saharan languages]], such as [[Luo languages|Luo]], [[Nandi–Markweta languages|Kalenjin]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]] and [[Nuer language|Nuer]], are spoken in lesser numbers, primarily in the African Great Lakes and Nile Valley. 

[[Indo-European languages]], such as [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], remain important in higher institutions in some parts of the larger region.

==Demographics==
{{see|Demographics of Africa|List of African countries by population|List of African ethnic groups|Nilotic expansion}}
Eastern Africa had an estimated population of 260 million in 2000. This was projected to reach 890 million by 2050, with an average growth rate of 2.5% per annum. The 2000 population is expected to quintuple over the course of the 21st century, to 1.6 billion as of 2100 (UN estimates as of 2017).&lt;ref name=UN2017&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=esa.un.org|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Demographics of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]], there is an estimated population of 102 million as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=n4ff2muj8bh2a_#ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=POP&amp;fdim_y=scenario:1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:ET&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en|title=IFs Forecast – Version 7.00 – Google Public Data Explorer|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts==
Until recently, several East African countries were riven with political coups, ethnic violence and oppressive dictators. Since the end of colonialism, the region has endured the following conflicts:

;Northern East Africa (Horn of Africa)
* [[Ethiopian Civil War]] 1974–1991
* [[Eritrean War of Independence]] 1961–1991
* [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] 1998–2000
* [[Ogaden War]] 1977–1978
* [[Somali Civil War]] 1991–2009
;South Sudan
* [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] 1983–2005
* [[Ethnic violence in South Sudan (2011–present)|Internal Political-ethnic Conflict]] 2011-ongoing
* [[South Sudanese Civil War]] 2013–2015
;Southern East Africa (Southeast Africa)
* [[Burundi Civil War]] 1993–2005 and the [[Burundi Genocide|Genocide of Hutus in 1972 and genocide of Tutsis in 1993]]
* [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] 1978–1979
* [[Ugandan Bush War]] 1981–1986
* [[Lord's Resistance Army]] insurgency in [[Uganda]], [[South Sudan]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] ongoing
* [[Rwandan Civil War]] 1990–1993 and the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwandan Genocide of Tutsis]]
* [[Zanzibar Revolution]] 1964
;Outside Southeast Africa with Southeast African participation
* [[First Congo War]] 1996–1997 and [[Second Congo War]] 1998–2003
* [[Kivu Conflict]] (Laurent Nkunda Rebellion)

[[Kenya]] has enjoyed relatively stable governance. However, politics have been turbulent at times, including the [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d’état in 1982]] and the [[Clashes in Kenya (2007-present)|2007 election riots]].

[[Tanzania]] has known stable government since independence although there are significant political and religious tensions resulting from the political union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964. Zanzibar is now a semi-autonomous state in the [[United Republic of Tanzania]].

Tanzania and [[Uganda]] fought the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1978–1979, which led to the removal of Uganda's despotic leader [[Idi Amin]].

[[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]] and [[Burundi]] have each faced instability and ethnic conflict since independence, most notably the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] and the 1993 [[Burundi Genocide]] and subsequent [[Burundi Civil War]]. [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] continue to be involved in related conflicts outside the region.

[[Djibouti]], as well as the [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]] regions of Somalia, have also seen relative stability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUKL2112773120080521 Canada's Africa Oil starts Somalia seismic survey] – ''[[Reuters]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/cpr/content/economic_recovery/PCER_Chapt5.rev.pdf Economic Recovery and the Role of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Somaliland_appeals_for_cooperation_with_Puntland_a_second_time.shtml Somalia: Somaliland appeals for 'cooperation with Puntland' a second time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131003947/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Somaliland_appeals_for_cooperation_with_Puntland_a_second_time.shtml |date=31 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Sudan]] peacefully seceded from [[Sudan]] in 2011, six and a half years after a [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement|peace agreement]] ended the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]]. South Sudanese independence was nearly derailed by the [[South Kordofan conflict]], particularly a dispute over the status of the [[Abyei Area]], and both Abyei and South Kordofan's [[Nuba Hills]] remain a source of tension between [[Juba, South Sudan|Juba]] and [[Khartoum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9534941.stm|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=11 July 2011|title=Sudan's Omar Bashir warning over Abyei|agency=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elysian Airlines''' is a cargo [[airline]] based at [[Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport]] in [[Yaoundé]], [[Cameroon]], and had additional significant operations at [[Spriggs Payne Airport]] in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]], and at [[Conakry International Airport]] in [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]]. According to the airline's website, it was founded in January 2006 as a public limited company, with 51% of shares held by a Cameroonian consortium and the remainder owned by a British/South African group. Elysian's scheduled operations stopped in 2010, but resumed in 2015.

Elysian Airlines began with a domestic network in Cameroon, but has since expanded rapidly westward. As of November 2008, the airline offered an extensive network of international services across [[West Africa]], as well as a spread of domestic flights within several countries. The airline also offers [[Charter flight|charter services]]. Services restarted in 2015, using a [[Bae 146]] for schedule routes as well as charter. An [[Airbus A310]]F was purchased in 2015 and is used for Cargo services in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

The '''Finnish general strike of 1956''' is the latest of the three [[General strike|general strikes]] in Finnish history; there have also been general strikes in [[Finnish general strike of 1905|1905]] and [[Finnish general strike of 1917|1917]]. The 1956 strike occurred from March 1 to March 20, 1956. About 500,000 Finnish citizens took part in the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seura.fi/asiat/historia/vuoden-1956-suurlakko-suistaa-suomen-kaaokseen-poliisien-konepistoolit-jo-tulivalmiina/|title=Vuoden 1956 suurlakko oli suistaa Suomen kaaokseen – Poliisien konepistoolit olivat jo tulivalmiina|date=2017-03-11|work=Seura.fi|access-date=2018-03-24|language=fi-FI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Following the end of post-war price control measures by [[Finnish Government|the government]] in 1955, the prices of many goods and services was on the rise. The cost of living in Finland increased by 7% in two months. The [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]] (SAK) attempted to raise the overall level of wages to account for the rise in the price level. Though internally conflicted on the fine print, the SAK was demanding a raise of 12 [[Finnish markka|mk]] per hour, which would raise the wages of Finnish workers by 6–10 percent.

The [[Finnish presidential election, 1956|1956 presidential election]] coincided with the industrial negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nakoislehti.hs.fi/a0ffd388-3770-427b-bbb7-06d7fecc942f/1|title=Äänestys alkaa tänään kello 12|last=|first=|date=16 January 1956|work=Helsingin Sanomat|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the candidates was then-[[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] [[Urho Kekkonen]], who didn't want to risk losing the presidential electoral college vote by accepting the SAK's proposal.

On February 16, the SAK's leadership decided to go forth and launch a general strike. Following the fall-through of emergency negotiations between the SAK and then [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|Speaker of the Parliament]] [[Karl-August Fagerholm]], the industrial action was started at 06:00 on March 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nakoislehti.hs.fi/21fbb7f8-1b33-4c53-9c3d-3c615e3181ab/6|title=Yleislakko puhkesi tänä aamuna kello 6|last=|first=|date=1 March 1956|work=Helsingin Sanomat|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day [[President of Finland|President]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] assumed office for his first term.

The general strike, which concluded on 20 March, resulted in a nationwide wage increase of 6–10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyovaenliike.fi/tyovaenliikkeen-vaiheita/alasivu-6/235-2/|title=Yleislakko 1956|website=www.tyovaenliike.fi|language=fi|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general strike intensified the internal conflicts of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] and resulted in a leftist faction centred around [[Emil Skog]] leaving the party shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Jukka Tarkka ja Allan Tiitta: ''Itsenäinen Suomi – seitsemän vuosikymmentä kansakunnan elämästä'', s. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FOB Gibraltar''' was a British-manned [[Forward Operating Base]] in [[Helmand Province]], [[Afghanistan]] next to the [[Helmand River]], near the town of [[Sangin]]. It was named after the port of [[Gibraltar]], which was the lynchpin of British Naval dominance in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelyon-online.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2045:death-in-the-corn-part-i-of-iii&amp;catid=34:dispatches&amp;Itemid=55|title=Death in the Corn: Part I of III|last=Yon|first=Michael|date=15 September 08|accessdate=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission for FOB Gibraltar was to train and support Afghan soldiers and take [[Taliban]] pressure off the Sangin area, so that the soldiers and the [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] (PRT) could try to secure the population while improving their quality of life.

Taliban fighters who attacked FOB Gibaltar during the summer of 2008 referred to the base as the 'mouth of hell' or 'devil's place'.&lt;ref name="mouthofhell"/&gt; Of the 160 men of [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (2 PARA) who manned the base, almost one in three were killed or wounded, a higher casualty rate than that suffered by British soldiers during the Second World War: Five killed in action, 14 seriously injured, and another 30 wounded.&lt;ref name="mouthofhell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/26/military-afghanistan|title=Survivors of the 'mouth of hell' back with tales of a deadly tour of duty|last=Townsend|first=Mark|date=26 October 2008|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Base was last occupied by C Coy 2 Rifles prior to the closure of the FOB in June 2009. C Coy 2 RIFLES moved to [[Forward Operating Base Wishtan|FOB Wishtan]] near [[Sangin]].

The '''G8''', reformatted as '''[[Group of Seven|G7]]''' from 2014 due to the suspension of [[Russia]]'s participation,&lt;ref name="russia-suspension"/&gt; was an inter-governmental political forum from 1997 until 2014.&lt;ref name="cfr" /&gt;

The forum originated with a [[1st G6 summit|1975 summit]] hosted by [[France]] that brought together representatives of six governments: France, [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]], thus leading to the name '''Group of Six''' or '''G6'''. The summit came to be known as the '''Group of Seven''', or '''G7''', in 1976 with the addition of [[Canada]].

Collectively, in 2012 the G8 nations comprised [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|50.1 percent of 2012 global nominal GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|40.9 percent of global GDP (PPP)]].

"G7" can refer to the member states in aggregate or to the annual [[summit meeting]] of the G7 [[heads of government]]. G7 ministers also meet throughout the year, such as the [[G7 (finance ministers)|G7 finance ministers]] (who meet four times a year), G7 foreign ministers, or G7 environment ministers.

Each calendar year, the responsibility of hosting the G8 was rotated through the member states in the following order: France, United States, United Kingdom, Russia (suspended), Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada. The holder of the [[presidency]] sets the agenda, hosts the summit for that year, and determines which ministerial meetings will take place.

In 2005, the UK government initiated the practice of inviting five leading emerging markets — [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], and [[South Africa]] — to participate in the G8 meetings that came to be known as [[G8+5]], but this practice was short-lived.&lt;ref name="cfr" /&gt; With the [[G20|G20 major economies]] growing in stature since the [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|2008 Washington summit]], world leaders from the group announced at their [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit|Pittsburgh summit]] in September 2009 that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/24/us.g.twenty.summit/index.html|title=Officials: G-20 to supplant G-8 as international economic council |publisher=CNN|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1099172/G20-to-replace-the-G8 |title=G20 to replace the G8 |publisher=SBS |date=26 September 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927054722/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1099172/G20-to-replace-the-G8 |archivedate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the G7 retains its relevance as a "steering group for the [[Western world|West]]",&lt;ref name="cfr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/global-governance/group-eight-g8-industrialized-nations/p10647|title=The Group of Eight (G8) Industrialized Nations|publisher=CFR}}&lt;/ref&gt; with special significance appointed to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/02/12/japan-and-the-g20-ambivalence-and-the-china-factor/|title=Japan and the G20: Ambivalence and the China factor|date=11 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Group of Seven#History}}

Following [[20th G7 summit|1994's G7 summit in Naples]], Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7 after the group's summits. This informal arrangement was dubbed the Political 8 (P8)—or, colloquially, the G7+1. At the invitation of UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/storyid.aspx?StoryId=5151 "Russia&amp;nbsp;— Odd Man Out in the G-8", Mark Medish, ''The Globalist'', 02-24-2006].Accessed: 7 December 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305052221/http://www.theglobalist.com/storyid.aspx?StoryId=5151 |date=5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Boris Yeltsin]] was invited first as a guest observer, later as a full participant. It was seen as a way to encourage Yeltsin with his capitalist reforms. Russia formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight, or G8.

===Food===
{{Update|section|date=July 2017}}
A major focus of the G8 since 2009 has been the global [[food security|supply of food]].&lt;ref name="Reuters 5May"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cash-strapped G8 looks to private sector in hunger fight|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/g8-food-idUSL1E8GHE3520120518|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 [[L'Aquila]] summit, the G8's members promised to contribute $22 billion to the issue. By 2015, 93% of funds had been disbursed.&lt;ref name="The Chicago Council on Global Affairs 15Mar"&gt;{{cite news|last=DoCampo|first=Isabel|title=A Food-Secure Future: G7 and G20 Action on Agriculture and Food|url=https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/blog/global-food-thought/food-secure-future-g7-and-g20-action-agriculture-and-food|accessdate=16 April 2018|newspaper=The Chicago Council on Global Affairs|date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 summit, President Barack Obama asked G8 leaders to adopt the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition initiative to "help the rural poor produce more food and sell it in thriving local and regional markets as well as on the global market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tandon |first=Shaun |title=Obama turns to private sector to feed world's poor |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jUyBu2GrB9ESl2EeXWyJQWwR0f-g?docId=CNG.3fbd5b32739e3209c58578b8a8480023.521 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |newspaper=Agence France-Presse |date=18 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131045725/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jUyBu2GrB9ESl2EeXWyJQWwR0f-g?docId=CNG.3fbd5b32739e3209c58578b8a8480023.521 |archivedate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patrick|first=Stewart M.|title=Why This Year's G8 Summit Matters|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/05/why-this-years-g8-summit-matters/257249/|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia′s participation suspension (2014)===
On 24 March 2014, the G7 members cancelled the planned [[40th G7 summit|G8 summit]] that was to be held in June that year in the Russian city of Sochi, and suspended Russia's membership of the group, due to [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia's annexation of Crimea]]; nevertheless, they stopped short of outright permanent expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukraine crisis: Russia scathing about G8 suspension as fears grow |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-crisis-g-7-leaders-cancel-g-8-summit-in-sochi-until-russia-changes-course-9213000.html|date=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian foreign minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] downplayed the importance of the decision by the U.S. and its allies, and pointed up that major international decisions were taken by the [[G20]] countries.&lt;ref name="Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-temporarily-kicked-out-of-g8-club-of-rich-countries-2014-3 |title=Russia Temporarily Kicked Out Of G8 Club Of Rich Countries|publisher=Business Insider |date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN.com" /&gt;

Later on, the Italian Foreign Affairs minister [[Federica Mogherini]] and other Italian authorities,&lt;ref name="TASS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ANSA"/&gt; along with the [[EastWest Institute]] board member [[Wolfgang Ischinger]],&lt;ref name="Ischinger"/&gt; suggested that Russia may restore its membership in the group. In April 2015, the German foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] said that Russia would be welcomed to return to G8 provided the [[Minsk Protocol]] was implemented.&lt;ref name="Steinmeier"/&gt; In 2016, he added that "none of the major international conflicts can be solved without Russia", and the G7 countries will consider Russia's return to the group in 2017. The same year, Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] called for Russia's return to G8, stating that Russia's involvement is "crucial to tackling multiple crises in the Middle East".&lt;ref name="Abe"/&gt; In January 2017, the Italian foreign minister [[Angelino Alfano]] said that Italy hopes for "resuming the G8 format with Russia and ending the atmosphere of the Cold War".&lt;ref name="Alfano"/&gt; On 13 January 2017, Russia announced that it would permanently leave the G8 grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/russia-g8-kremlin-crimea-ukraine-vladimir-putin-g7-g20-a7525836.html|title=Russia announces plan to permanently leave G8 group of industrialised nations after suspension for Crimea annexation|author=Tom Batchelor|date=13 January 2017|publisher=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[Christian Lindner]], the leader of [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] and member of the [[Bundestag]], said that Putin should be "asked to join the table of the G7" so that one could "talk with him and not about him", and "we cannot make all things dependent on the situation in Crimea".&lt;ref name="Lindner"/&gt; In April 2018, the German politicians and members of the [[Bundestag]] [[Sahra Wagenknecht]] and [[Alexander Graf Lambsdorff]] said that Russia should be invited back to the group and attend the [[44th G7 summit|2018 summit in Canada]]: "Russia should again be at the table during the [June] summit at the latest" because "peace in Europe and also in the Middle East is only possible with Russia".&lt;ref name="Bundestag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagenknecht"/&gt; The President of US [[Donald Trump]] also stated that Russia should be returned to G8; his appeal was supported by the Italian Prime Minister [[Giuseppe Conte]].&lt;ref name="Trump"/&gt;Later the 4 EU members of G7, Canada and Japan anyway didn't agree about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d102f1fa-6b21-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/european-members-of-g7-reject-donald-trumps-call-to-reinstate-russia-11399207|title=G7 leaders reject Donald Trump's call for Russia to be reinstated to group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several G7 members quickly rejected US President Trump suggestion to accept again Russian Federation in the G8, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said Russian Federation isn't interested to rejoin the political forum G8.

==Structure and activities==
[[File:Ten leaders at G8 summit, 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Leaders of the G8 on 18 June 2013, in [[Lough Erne]], Northern Ireland, United Kingdom]]
By design, the G8 deliberately lacked an administrative structure like those for international organizations, such as the [[United Nations]] or the [[World Bank]]. The group does not have a permanent secretariat, or offices for its members.

The presidency of the group rotates annually among member countries, with each new term beginning on 1 January of the year. The rotation order is: France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia (suspended), Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/what_is_g8.html|title=What is the G8?|author=G8 Research Group|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country holding the presidency is responsible for planning and hosting a series of ministerial-level meetings, leading up to a mid-year summit attended by the heads of government. The president of the European Commission participates as an equal in all summit events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)]]: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2000/past_summit/table_e/index.html Summit Meetings in the Past;] [[European Union]]: [http://www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.external.g8.php "EU and the G8"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226165606/http://www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.external.g8.php |date=26 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministerial meetings bring together ministers responsible for various portfolios to discuss issues of mutual or global concern. The range of topics include health, law enforcement, labor, economic and social development, energy, environment, foreign affairs, justice and interior, terrorism, and trade. There are also a separate set of meetings known as the [[G8+5]], created during the 2005 [[Gleneagles, Scotland|Gleneagles]], Scotland summit, that is attended by finance and energy ministers from all eight member countries in addition to the five "outreach countries" which are also known as the [[Group of Five]]—[[Brazil]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groupoffive.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710013008/http://www.groupoffive.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-10 |title=G5 Overview; Evolución del Grupo de los Cinco |publisher=Groupoffive.org |accessdate=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, justice ministers and interior ministers from the G8 countries agreed to launch an international database on [[pedophile]]s.&lt;ref name=pedophile&gt;[http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,,1509107,00.html "G8 to launch international pedophile database"] David Batty 18 June 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The G8 officials also agreed to pool data on [[terrorism]], subject to restrictions by privacy and security laws in individual countries.&lt;ref name=terrorismdata&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1509218,00.html "G8 to pool data on terrorism]" Martin Wainwright, 18 June 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G8 leaders confer together.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|G8 leaders confer during the [[35th G8 summit|2009 summit]] in [[L'Aquila]] ([[Abruzzo]], Italy).]]

At the [[33rd G8 summit|Heiligendamm Summit]] in 2007, the G8 acknowledged a proposal from the EU for a worldwide initiative on [[efficient energy use]]. They agreed to explore, along with the [[International Energy Agency]], the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 along with China, India, South Korea and the [[European Community]] established the [[International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation]], at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan holding 2008 G8 Presidency, in [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/380&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=e The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC).] 8 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

G8 Finance Ministers, whilst in preparation for the [[34th G8 summit|34th Summit of the G8 Heads of State and Government]] in [[Toyako, Hokkaido]], met on the 13 and 14 June 2008, in [[Osaka, Japan]]. They agreed to the "G8 Action Plan for Climate Change to Enhance the Engagement of Private and Public Financial Institutions." In closing, Ministers supported the launch of new [[Climate Investment Funds]] (CIFs) by the [[World Bank]], which will help existing efforts until a new framework under the [[UNFCCC]] is implemented after 2012. The UNFCCC is not on track to meeting any of its stated goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=G8 Finance Ministers Support Climate Investment Funds|url=http://climate-l.iisd.org/news/g8-finance-ministers-support-climate-investment-funds/|newspaper=IISD - Climate Change Policy &amp; Practice|date=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annual summit===
{{Main|Group of Seven#List of summits}}

The [[23rd G8 summit|first G8 summit]] was held in 1997 after Russia formally joined the G7 group, and the [[39th G8 summit|last one]] was held in 2013. The [[40th G7 summit|2014 summit]] was scheduled to be held in Russia. However, due to the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]], the other seven countries decided to hold a separate meeting without Russia as a G7 summit in Brussels, Belgium.

Some criticism centres on the assertion that members of G8 do not do enough to help global problems, due to strict [[patent]] policy and other issues related to [[Economic globalization|globalization]]. In ''Unraveling Global Apartheid'', political analyst Titus Alexander described the G7, as it was in 1996, as the 'cabinet' of global minority rule, with a coordinating role in world affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Titus|title=Unraveling Global Apartheid: An overview of world politics|publisher=Polity Press|year=1996|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] has criticized the G8 for advocating food security without making room for economic freedom.&lt;ref name=HF17May&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Terry|title=G8 Food Security Agenda Should Encourage Greater Privatisation|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/05/g8-food-security-agenda-should-encourage-greater-economic-freedom|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance==
The G8's relevance has been subject to debate from 2008 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Don|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/06/world/fg-summit6|title=On eve of summit, G-8's relevance is unclear|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represented the major [[industrialized countries]] but critics argued that the G8 no longer represented the world's most powerful economies, as China [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|has surpassed]] every economy but the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/16/news/international/japan_china/index.htm?hpt=T2 |publisher=CNN |title=China marches towards world's No. 2 economy |date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimir Putin did not attend the 2012 G8 summit at Camp David, causing ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' (''FP'') magazine to remark that the summit has generally outlived its usefulness as a viable international gathering of foreign leaders.&lt;ref name=FN&gt;{{cite news| url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/14/welcome_to_the_new_world_order| title=Welcome to the New World Disorder| work=[[Foreign Policy]]| first=Ian| last=Bremmer| date=14 May 2012| accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Russia was suspended from the G8, then chose to leave permanently in January 2017.

The [[G20]] major economies leaders' summit has had an increased level of international prestige and influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bosco.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/05/16/three_cheers_for_homogeneity| title=Three cheers for homogeneity| work=[[Foreign Policy]]| first=David| last=Bosco| date=16 May 2012| accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] said of the G8 in 2012:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horgan |first=Colin |url=http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/11/21/the-g8-still-matters-david-camero/ |title=The G8 still matters: David Cameron|publisher=Ipolitics.ca |date=21 November 2012 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people ask, does the G8 still matter, when we have a Group of 20? My answer is, yes. The G8 is a group of like-minded countries that share a belief in free enterprise as the best route to growth.

The Y8 Summit or simply Y8, formerly known as the G8 Youth Summit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bogott, Nicole|title=Global gerechte Handelspolitik|work=The European|date=June 2010|url=http://www.theeuropean.de/nicole-bogott/3581-g8-g20-youth-summit|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the youth counterpart to the G8 summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1 =Dobson, Hugo|chapter=The G8, the G20, and Civil Society|editor1=avona, Paolo |editor2=Kirton, John J. |editor3=Oldani, Chiara |title=Global Financial Crisis: Global Impact and Solutions|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|pages=247, 251|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r63ZtJEJ7x0C&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=140940272X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summits were organized from 2006 to 2013. The first summit to use the name Y8 took place in May 2012 in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]], alongside the Youth G8 that took place in [[Washington, D.C.]] the same year. From 2016 onwards, similar youth conferences were organized under the name Y7 Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Y7/Y8 and Y20 Summits|url=http://www.younglead.eu/activities/y7-y20-summits/#y20-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Y8 Summit brings together young leaders from G8 nations and the [[European Union]] to facilitate discussions of [[international affairs]], promote cross-cultural understanding, and build global friendships. The conference closely follows the formal negotiation procedures of the G8 Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brun, Martine|title=Camille Grossetete, une Claixoise au Youth 8|work=Dauphiné Libéré|date=July 2013|url=http://bayimg.com/iaPNHAaeP|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Y8 Summit represents the innovative voice of young adults between the age of 18 and 35.

The Y8 Summit was organized annually by a global network of youth-led organizations called The IDEA (The International Diplomatic Engagement Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The President and CEO's Notebook: What is The IDEA?|url=http://yadlusa.org/2013/04/22/the-president-and-ceos-notebook-what-is-the-idea/|publisher=Young Americans for Diplomatic Leadership|accessdate=21 December 2015|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizations undertake the selection processes for their respective national delegations, while the hosting country is responsible for organizing the summit. An example of such a youth-led organization is the [[Young European Leadership]] association, which recruits and sends EU Delegates.

The goal of the Y8 Summit is to bring together young people from around the world to allow the voices and opinions of young generations to be heard and to encourage them to take part in global decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.teraz.sk|title=ladý Slovák zastupoval Slovensko a EÚ na mládežníckom summite G20 |date= June 2012|url=http://www.teraz.sk/ekonomika/mlady-slovak-zastupoval-slovensko-a-e/12769-clanok.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Enenkel|first= Kathrin|title= G8 Youth Summit and Europe's Voice 2009: Results and Reflexions|year= 2009|url= https://books.google.com/?id=pHyHmwEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''joulutorttu''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] lit. "Christmas tart", [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''jultårta''; sometimes known as ''tähtitorttu'' "star tart") is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Christmas]] [[pastry]]. It is  traditionally made from [[puff pastry]] in the shape of a [[Star polygon|star]] or [[Pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]] and filled with [[prune]] [[jam]] and often dusted with [[icing sugar]]. The pastries can be in other shapes and [[apple]] used in place of the prune jam.

Joulutorttus are mostly made in [[Finland]] but also in [[Sweden]]. The Swedish media has accused the pastries of being "[[swastika]]-shaped".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/ulkomaat/a1384657817495|title=Ruotsalaiset hämmästelevät hakaristin muotoisia joulutorttuja|publisher=HS.fi|author=Ämmälä, Antti|date=2013-11-17|accessdate=2014-11-14|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/sverige/ett-hakkors-till-kaffet-nagon|title=Ett hakkors till kaffet, någon?|author=Nildén, Magnus|publisher=SVT.se|date=2013-11-17|accessdate=2014-11-14|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KPH''' is a [[coast radio station|public coast radio station]] on the West Coast of the United States.  For most of the 20th century, it provided ship to shore communications including [[telegram]]s (using [[Morse code]]) and marine [[telex]] service (using [[radioteletype]]).  The station discontinued commercial operation in 1998, but is operated occasionally as a historic service  - its signal can be tuned in throughout a large portion of the western hemisphere.  

(Ship to shore [[Marine and mobile radio telephony|telephone calls]] were not handled by KPH but by other stations such as the nearby [[AT&amp;T]] high seas station KMI.)

==Revenue service and preservation==

KPH would broadcast regular bulletins of news, weather and other general information to the shipping community, then relay business and personal messages to and from individual ships.  Station operators also monitored the [[International distress frequency|international distress frequencies]] for [[Distress_call#Maritime_distress_signals|calls from ships in trouble]].

With the decline of [[Morse code]] the station was retired, but volunteers have preserved it in operating condition so that it can still be heard on the air on weekends and special occasions, sometimes using the alternative callsign KSM and the [[amateur radio]] club callsign [http://www.qrz.com/db/K6KPH K6KPH].  KPH is located within the [[Point Reyes National Seashore]] in [[Marin County, California]], north of the [[San Francisco Bay]].

==History==

The station dates back to the dawn of the radio era in the early years of the twentieth century when it began operations at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]] in San Francisco, California, using the callsign "PH".  Forced out by the 1906 [[San Francisco earthquake and fire]], the station moved from one temporary site to another until it was acquired by the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) and relocated to Marin County.  Subsequently it was owned by [[MCI Communications]] and finally [[Globe Wireless]], who still own the KPH operating license.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;Stephen Barrett (June 26, 1997). "[http://www.ptreyeslight.com/stories/june26/kph.html Ship-to-shore radio station KPH to close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218085402/http://www.ptreyeslight.com/stories/june26/kph.html |date=2009-02-18 }}", ''Point Reyes Light''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SPI /&gt;

==Physical plant==

The receiving station and control point now occupy a classic white 1920s' [[Art Deco]] building on [[Sir Francis Drake Boulevard]] in the Point Reyes National Seashore whereas the similarly styled&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiomarine.org/gallery/show?keyword=kphtoday&amp;panel=pab1_1 &lt;/ref&gt; transmitter buildings are about 20 miles south at {{Coord|37|54|52.32|N|122|43|30.26|W|type:landmark_region:US-CA|display=inline,title|name=transmitter building near Bolinas|notes=&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coastradio.intco.biz/usa/kph.htm|accessdate=25 June 2011|title=KPH/WCC - Coast Radio Stations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}, near the town of [[Bolinas, California|Bolinas]]. The reason for siting the transmitters so far away from the receivers is that their powerful outgoing signals would make it difficult to hear weak incoming signals from faraway ships on the same [[frequency]] (or channel).  Operators at the receiving site remotely control and key the transmitters by means of landlines connecting the two sites.

==Radio operations==

KPH has always been mainly a Morse code station.  [[International Morse code]] is used on the air, but American Morse code was once used on the telegraph lines ("land lines"), so operators at the station had to learn both varieties until the landline telegraph was replaced by the [[teleprinter]].

In the beginning, all traffic was sent by Morse code ("CW") using hand-operated Morse keys. Devices were introduced to allow messages to be typed or "punched" onto a paper tape so that they could be sent automatically at any time. Station IDs and other repeated announcements pre-recorded by this method are called "wheels".

In the 1930s, landline teleprinter operation was adapted for radio use (radioteletype or "[[RTTY]]") which allowed for faster, more efficient messaging. This did not replace Morse code entirely, because many vessels had no teleprinter equipment and because Morse was the most reliable transmission mode available: when faced with bad atmospheric conditions and weak signals, dots and dashes are easier to pick up than teleprinter or the human voice, and all the coding and decoding are done in the brain.

Over the years radioteletype was improved and computerized, giving rise to new digital transmission modes such as [[CLOVER2000|Clover]] and [[PACTOR]]. Satellite communications became a technically and commercially viable alternative to terrestrial radio links. Ship radio equipment became more advanced and automated, requiring fewer radio officers - or none.  By the 1990s few ship stations were equipped for Morse code or had any use for it, so coast stations re-allocated their Morse frequencies to other uses. Some stations disappeared from the airwaves altogether, as did KPH after being acquired by Globe Wireless in 1997.&lt;ref name=SPI&gt;"[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64629556.html MARITIME RADIO KPH CLOSES IN AGE OF WIRELESS]", ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' (July 2, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Its Morse code traffic was then diverted to other stations such as KFS in [[Half Moon Bay, California]], another Globe Wireless station. KFS continued to handle Morse code traffic until July 13, 1999 ([[Universal time]]; actually July 12 in the [[Pacific time zone]]) when it made its "last ever" Morse transmission, ceremonially marking the supposed end of commercial Morse code usage in America (as distinct from [[amateur radio|amateur]] Morse code usage, which continues).  This anniversary is commemorated on the air every July as the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090713015805/http://www.radiomarine.org/non10.html Night of Nights]" by KPH and other coast radio stations, along with radio amateurs who participate on their own frequencies.&lt;ref name=Woodward&gt;Calvin Woodward; AP (July 19, 1999). "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_19990719/ai_n11726102 Morse code falls from regular use]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", ''The Topeka Capital-Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/events_nightofnights.htm Night of Nights]", ''Point Reyes National Seashore''. [[National Park Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survival and preservation==

KPH is now a part of the  [[Point Reyes National Seashore]] and is maintained and operated by former KPH employees and volunteers of the [http://www.radiomarine.org Maritime Radio Historical Society].  There are several reasons that the station was able to survive decommissioning and make a comeback.  First, the equipment was old and not suitable for resale, so much of it was left where it was, with connections to power, antennas and land lines still intact.  Second, the [[real estate]] taken up by buildings and [[antenna farm]]s, while desirable, was also unsuitable for resale (especially to the extent that it lay within the [[Point Reyes National Seashore]]), meaning that the properties were not bought and redeveloped the way some other stations were.  The KPH license and the frequencies assigned to it are made available to the MHRS by the license holder, [[Globe Wireless]].  In addition, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has granted the MHRS a new [[coast radio station|coast station]] license with the callsign '''KSM''', as well as the [[amateur radio]] club callsign '''K6KPH''' for communicating with radio hams on amateur frequencies.  K6KPH is unusually powerful and well-equipped for an amateur station, with its professional grade transmitters, antennas and operators.  Operating in amateur radio mode means following a different set of rules (using different frequencies and lower transmitter power levels), but amateurs are not limited in their choice of equipment as long as they stick to these rules.

==Special events==

July 12-13, 2009: Tenth annual '''Night of Nights''': Historic coast stations, ships and radio amateurs on the air commemorating the anniversary of the "end of Morse code in America".  KPH, KSM and amateur station K6KPH were due to be on air at the KPH site.  Coast stations scheduled to be on air included KFS in [[Half Moon Bay]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20180408164737/http://www.wloradio.com/ WLO] in Alabama and [http://www.shipcom.com KLB] in [[Seattle, WA]].

==Early life==
Kailash Mehra Sadhu, also known as Malika-e-Ghazal, was born in [[Dogra]], [[Nainital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indianherald.com.au/events/visit-by-malika-e-ghazal-kailash-mehra/1334/ |title=2012 Australian visit by ‘Malika-e-Ghazal’ Kailash Mehra |date= 6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} She earned Master's degrees from Panjab University, Chandigarh and Prayag Sangeet Samiti, Allahabad (1975), the latter degree focusing on vocal music. She became a music lecturer at the Women's College in Anantnag in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://koausa.org/music/kailashmehra/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

She earned fame singing [[Kashmiri music|Kashmiri]] [[ghazals]] and [[songs]], and has recorded in [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Urdu]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Bhaderwahi]], [[Pahari language (disambiguation)|Pahari]] and the [[Kannad]] languages. Kailash participated in music competitions organised by the state cultural academy. Her stage performances were organised in [[Patna]], [[Lucknow]], [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], [[Trivandrum]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Delhi]].

Having married in 1980,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} she took part in the fourth Festival of Music organised by the Kashmiri Overseas Association of Britain in 1985. She also sang for the film Aarnimall.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Work after Kashmir conflict==
Kailash Mehra Sadhu sang for the album 'Poozai Posh'.&lt;ref&gt;http://koshur.org/music/albums/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside fellow [[Kashmiri music|Kashmiri]] singer Vijay Malla, and produced by the Kashmir Overseas Association of the United States of America, this album, containing several sacred [[bhajans]] and [[hymns]] native to Kashmir, and as a movement to preserve [[Kashmir]]'s 5000-year-old culture, history and sanctity, this album became highly popular with the millions of Kashmiris in the diaspora worldwide.

==Works==
Before the [[Kashmir conflict]], Kailash Mehra Sadhu used to be a reasonably well-known singer known for her [[bhajans]] and hymns. These hymns gained popularity after the [[exodus of Kashmiri Pandits]], after her collaboration with the Kashmir Overseas Association of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;http://koausa.org/music/kailashmehra/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the name is imported, the dish is a Turkish version of a cabbage stew common in [[Russia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. Kapuska is widely known and consumed in the [[Eastern Thrace|Thrace]] and [[Black Sea]] regions of [[Turkey]].

Kapuska is cooked in different ways in Turkey: with [[garbanzo bean]]s, [[bulgur]], rice, ground meat, lamb, beef, or vegetarian.

It is known to be a dish for the poor. Turkish poet [[Fethi Naci]] writes in his [[memoirs]] that during World War II the dish they most ate was kapuska.&lt;ref name="Naci1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fethi Naci|title=Dönüp baktığımda ...: anılar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkhkAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Adam Yayınları|isbn=978-975-418-559-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Dormition des amants''''' is a Belgian [[novel]] written by [[Jacqueline Harpman]].  It was first published through [[Éditions Grasset]] in 2002.  It won the Prix triennal du roman of the [[French Community of Belgium]] in 2003.

==Plot==
This is an historical novel set in the seventeenth-century. Maria Concepcion (queen presumptive) is the daughter of King Carlos of Spain Carlos. While she is trained for ascendency, Maria treats her small castrated slave, Girolamo, with great compassion and he gradually becomes her playmate and confidant. Together, they learn to read and write, and science.
 
In 1610, [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] was assassinated by [[Ravaillac]]. Édouard (a fictional king invented by the author) ascends the throne. Maria is to marry Édouard and become the queen of France. Girolamo comes with Maria to France and are inseparable; he even sleeps in a room next to that of the Queen. But their love is only platonic and can never become carnal.

Here we find a little myth of Tristan and Isolde.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3209">This page lists [[Austrian nobility|baronial families]] in the territories of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], whether extant or extinct. They held no style, but were normally addressed as ''Gnädiger Herr'' (Gracious Lord), ''Gnädige Frau'', or ''Gnädiges Fräulein'' (Gracious Lady). Please note that nobility as such was formally abolished in Austria in 1919.

The German forms of the titles are ''Freiherr'' (baron), ''Freifrau'' (baroness, wife of a baron) and ''Freiin'' (baroness, daughter of a baron).

A '''Nomadic bag''' is a bag woven by various [[nomadic]] tribes of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] for utilitarian and decorative purposes.

The nomadic tribes of the Middle East and Central Asia are perhaps more known for the hand knotted [[carpets]] and hand woven [[kilim]]s (flatwoven textiles) that they made. These tribes include but are not limited to the [[Baloch people|Baloch]], the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], the [[Afshar tribe|Afshars]], the [[Bakhtyari]], the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], the [[Kurds]] and many others. The bags that they wove were done in the same techniques as the larger rugs they also made. The most common technique is [[Persian Carpet|hand-knotted pile]], but many tribal bags were also done in the various flat woven techniques including [[plain weave]] ([[kilim]] weave), soumac technique and other less common techniques.

These bags were used for various purposes. Often they were used for transporting goods while on migration. They also served as storage containers to be used in the tent or [[yurt]]. There are also specialized bags such as bags for carrying mirrors, bags for carrying the [[Qur'an]], bags for carrying tent stakes and more. Often the bags are known by specific names based on the function they served.  Some common bag names are "cuval" ([[camel]] bag), "khorjin" (double-sided [[donkey]] bags) and "mafrash" (bedding bag) to name just a few.

Often, the back panel of a bag will have little or no design. Generally on bags with knotted pile faces, the back of the bag will be executed in a plain woven [[kilim]] technique.

Although there are still some tribal weavers weaving nice bags, it is the antique bags and bag faces that are the most prized and the most collected.

==Bag face==
From the [[collecting|collector]]s point of view, the front or the ''face'' of the bag is much more interesting and more collectible. Often, with antique bags, the backs of the bag have been separated and discarded at some point and only the bagface remains.

'''''Pasărea Colibri''''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈpasəre̯a koliˈbri}}, "The [[Hummingbird]]") is a [[Romanian music|Romanian]] [[Folk music|folk]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]].  Aside from typical Romanian folk instruments and acoustic/electric guitars, the band also made use of digital and analogue synthesizers, pedal steel guitars and [[fretless bass]].

The band formed in [[1992 in music|1992]] while [[Mircea Baniciu]], who, after conflicts with [[Transsylvania Phoenix]] leader [[Nicu Covaci]] had left the group, was performing in [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]]. At the end of Baniciu's set, actor [[Florian Pittiş]] and folk musician Mircea Vintila, together with Compact keyboardist Vlady Cnejevici, joined him for an improvised performance after which Pittiş announced the project was to be named Pasărea Colibri, as a reference to Baniciu's on and off collaboration with [[Transsylvania Phoenix]]. The four musicians started performing together and released their first album, ''În căutarea cuibului pierdut'' (Seeking The Lost Nest) in 1995. A [[live album]] containing no new work, as most of the songs the group performed were [[Music cover|covers]] of [[Transsylvania Phoenix]]'s old hits or Baniciu and Vintila's own compositions, it catapulted the group to superstardom in [[Romania]] making them widely popular as Pasărea Colibri. Florian Pittiş left the group in 2001 to focus on other personal projects, such as [[Radio3Net]], and to work for football club [[Rapid Bucureşti]] of which he was longtime fan of. Folk songwriter Marius Baţu replaced him in the group and Pasărea Colibri released one more album before disbanding in 2003. Pittiş died in 2007.

As of 2009, the remaining members are on good terms and still perform together occasionally under the "Pasărea Colibri" name. Cnejevici also worked extensively with Baniciu on various other projects, such as producing his 2009 "Best-Of" album and performing with him live in concerts throughout [[Romania]].

On 25 November 2011, Pasărea Colibri released an anniversary album named entitled ''"19 ani"'' (''19 years''). On this occasion, Mircea Baniciu and Mircea Vintilă held a concert at [[Sala Palatului]], with a band consisting of Vlady Cnejevici, Teo Boar, Cristi Iorga and Marian Mihăilescu.&lt;ref name=mediafax&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/life-inedit/pasarea-colibri-va-lansa-un-nou-album-la-concertul-de-vineri-de-la-sala-palatului-9003910/|title=Pasărea Colibri va lansa un nou album la concertul de vineri, de la Sala Palatului|language=ro|publisher=[[Mediafax]]|date=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Odessa-Simferopol''' ({{lang-la|Odesensis-Sympheropolitanus}}) is a [[diocese]] of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in southern [[Ukraine]] and it includes Russian-annexed Crimea.&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt; It covers an area about one-third the size of Poland including areas impacted by [[2014 Crimean crisis]], and the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt; There is now a de facto and hostile border splitting the diocese.

[[Bronislaw Bernacki]] is the current bishop of the [[diocese]]. He was appointed to the [[Episcopal see|See]] of Odessa-Simferopol in May 2002 and is based in [[Odessa]].  Jacek Pyl is an auxiliary bishop and is based in [[Simferopol]].&lt;ref name=CNA2014&gt;{{cite news|title=Catholics in Ukrainian border diocese face suffering, uncertainty|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/ukrainian-catholics-in-border-diocese-face-future-of-suffering-uncertainty-26543/|accessdate=11 September 2014|agency=Catholic News Agency|date=Sep 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the diocese begins in 2002, when the diocese of Odessa-Simferopol was erected from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kamyanets-Podilskyi|Diocese of Kamyanets-Podilskyi]]. The diocese's "basic work" began about the time of the [[Fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt;

Auxiliary bishop Pyl described the diocese in 2014 as “missionary territory” with “many challenges.”&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt;  He reported that there were about 64 priests and 3,000 faithful in the diocese.&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt; In 2014, in Crimea there were seven parishes and 13 priests and masses were celebrated mainly in Russian but also in English, Spanish, Ukrainian, and Polish.&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt;

As of 2014, Simferopol does not have a [[co-cathedral]].&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt; “We have been waiting for the last 20 years to get permission to build a church,” Bishop Pyl is quoted as saying.&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt; Plans for a co-cathedral had been underway but were put on hold following Russian annexation of Crimea.&lt;ref name=CNA2014 /&gt;


==Geography==
The diocese is a suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Archdiocese of Lviv of the Latins]].

==Leadership==
* Bishops (Roman rite)
** Bishop [[Bronislaw Bernacki]] (4 May 2002 – )

The '''Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition''' ('''RARE''') was an expedition from 1947&amp;ndash;1948 which researched the area surrounding the head of the [[Weddell Sea]] in [[Antarctica]].

==Background==
[[Finn Ronne]] led the RARE which was the final privately sponsored expedition from the [[United States]] and explored and mapped the last unknown coastline on earth and determined that the [[Weddell Sea]] and the [[Ross Sea]] were not connected.  The expedition included [[Isaac Schlossbach]], as second in command, who was to have [[Cape Schlossbach]] named after him. The expedition, based out of [[Stonington Island]] was the first to take women to over-winter. Ronne's wife, [[Edith Ronne]] was correspondent for the North American Newspaper Alliance for expedition and the chief pilot Darlington took his wife.

It was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] in 1715 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=The Order's 18th Century Fortifications|journal=Civilization|date=1984|volume=1|page=170|publisher=PEG Ltd|location=[[Ħamrun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery formed part of a chain of fortifications built to defend Marsalforn and nearby bays from Ottoman or Barbary attacks. Although the area was fortified by a number of [[Marsalforn Tower|towers]], batteries, redoubts and entrenchments, all of these have been destroyed except for [[Qolla l-Bajda Battery]] between Qbajjar and Xwejni Bays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bezzina|first1=Joseph|title=Marsalforn Culture &amp; History|url=http://www.zebbuggozo.com/history-marsalforn.php|website=Żebbuġ Local Council|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery consisted of a semi-circular gun platform ringed by a parapet, and two blockhouses joined together by a wall. It has been demolished and no remains can be seen.

'''''Sloboden Pechat''''' (Macedonian [[Cyrillic]]: ''Слободен Печат'') is a daily newspaper in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. ''Sloboden Pechat'' translated in English means ''Free Press''.&lt;ref&gt;http://slobodenpecat.mk/&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily newspaper Sloboden Pechat was founded in October 2013, with the first number dated October 19. 

In November 2016, the company "Sloboden Pechat doo" became a part of the "[http://www.adriamediagroup.com/en/ Adria Media Group DOO]" from Serbia.

== History and profile ==

[[File:Adria Media Group logo.png|thumb|150px|Adria Media Group owner of [[Adria Media Balkan]]]]

The founders were a group of journalists with open minded and democratic tradition, like [[Branko Geroski]] (in 90s founder of the most popular daily newspaper [[Dnevnik (Skopje)|Dnevnik]], later sold to [[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|WAZ]]) and Gradimir Jovanovic (Radio Skopje brand journalist, chief editor and commentator, retired), with significant technical and logistic help of the advertising agency [[Media House Skopje|Media House]] from Skopje.

Capital founders of the newspaper were Vlatko Kosevaliski, at the time also a General manager, and Gradimir Jovanovic. [[Branko Geroski]] was appointed as Editor in Chief.

After taking over the share in "Sloboden Pechat doo", "Adria Media Group DOO" from Belgrade gives full support to the newspaper. As a result of that support, Sloboden Pechat grew to by far the largest print media and distribution house in the part of printed media, with a largest daily print run in Macedonia.

The timing of the beginning of the newspaper was a result of the actual social and political situation in Macedonia. The motto of Sloboden Pechat is “Always on the side of people”.

The printing started on a leased printing machine in own printing plant, with personal distribution, because the existing printing and distribution houses refused to print and distribute it. Hence, with few used vehicles, old PCs and outdated software, together with few courageous professionals, Sloboden Pechat grew up to be the leading daily newspaper, with largest circulation in the market, with a distribution fleet of 13 vehicles. As of July 2018, Sloboden Pechat DOO had around 50 employees, 19 in the newsroom (chief editor, deputies, journalists, reporters, photo reporters, technical editors, web designers, lectors etc.), 5 in Marketing department, 5 in Printing house, 13 in Distribution department, 4 in Finance and Administration department. The company has contracts with free-lance journalists, reporters from other cities in Macedonia and abroad, columnists, internet portals, as well as cooperation with the State Information Agency MIA and foreign news services.

The newspaper Sloboden Pechat in January 2017 launched the digital edition [https://www.slobodenpecat.mk/ slobodenpecat.mk]. The portal has been modernized and redesigned in order to offer new level of communication of the bestselling daily newspaper.

The now defunct '''United Nations Centre for Urgent Environmental Assistance''' (UNEP/UNCUEA) worked to coordinate international response to [[man-made hazard|man-made disasters]]. It was administrated by the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]].

==Background==
UNCUELA operations were initially run by a small staff located in a [[Swiss government]] office in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].  Later, it was relocated to offices inside the [[International Environment House]], found in [[Châtelaine, Switzerland|Châtelaine]].

The short-lived Centre was created to respond to an initiative proposed by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the late 1980s. However, it never received necessary support due to criticism that it overlapped with already-existing agencies, like the [[International Maritime Organization]] and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].

'''Warrenton Training Center''' ('''WTC''') is a classified United States government communication complex located in the state of [[Virginia]]. Established in 1951, it comprises four discrete stations located in [[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier]] and [[Culpeper County, Virginia|Culpeper]] counties.

WTC has served multiple roles, most notably as a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) [[signals intelligence]] facility, [[numbers station]], and communications laboratory. The center also houses at least one underground "relocation" bunker that serves U.S. [[continuity of government]] purposes, and is a communications and signals intelligence training school for various federal departments and agencies, including the CIA, [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Additionally, it is a relay facility for the Department of State's [[Diplomatic Telecommunications Service]]. The [[United States Army]] administers WTC on behalf of the U.S. government.

==History==
Warrenton Training Center was established on June 1, 1951, as part of a "[[Federal Relocation Arc]]" of hardened underground bunkers built to support continuity of government in the event of a nuclear attack on [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=fasB&gt;{{cite web |last=Pike |first=John |title=Warrenton Station B |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |year=2001 |url=https://fas.org/irp/facility/warrenton_b.htm |access-date=March 18, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605143410/https://fas.org/irp/facility/warrenton_b.htm |archivedate=June 5, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite book |last=Ceruzzi |first=Paul E. |authorlink=Paul E.

Initially, the United States Army served as the executive agent for the administration and management of the center on behalf of the Department of Defense. In 1973, the center was transferred to the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] under the administration of  its signals intelligence branch, the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]], a subordinate to the NSA, and the base was renamed U.S. Army Training Group, Warrenton Training Center. In 1982, the center was restored its original name and reverted to Department of Defense control with the Army as the executive agent for administration on behalf of the [[National Communications System]] (NCS).&lt;ref name=fasB /&gt;

Under the NCS (dissolved and functions transferred to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] in 2012&lt;ref&gt;In 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] dissolved the NCS and transferred oversight of NCS programs to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Cybersecurity and Communications.

In 1986, the [[KGB]] threw U.S. investigators off the trail of CIA officer and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] mole [[Aldrich Ames]] by constructing an elaborate diversion whereby a Soviet case officer told a CIA contact that the mole was stationed at Warrenton Training Center. Ames was stationed in [[Rome]] at the time. U.S. mole hunters investigated 90 employees at WTC for almost a year and came up with ten suspects, although the lead investigator noted that "there are so many problem personalities that no one stands out."&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news |last=Pincus |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Pincus |title=CIA: Ames Betrayed 55 Operations; Inspector General's Draft Report Blames Supervisors for Failure to Plug Leak |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 24, 1994 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiner |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Weiner |title=Senate Report Faults C.I.A. for Ineptitude in Spy Case |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 2, 1994 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Warrenton Training Center is spread across four separate facilities in two different counties. Station&amp;nbsp;A, Station&amp;nbsp;B and Station&amp;nbsp;C are located in [[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier County]], while Station&amp;nbsp;D is located in [[Culpeper County, Virginia|Culpeper County]].&lt;ref name=epa&gt;{{cite web |title=Warrenton Training Center: Current Site Information |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=May 2010 |url=http://www.epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/VAD988189312.htm |access-date=March 18, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625154357/http://www.epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/VAD988189312.htm |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Station&amp;nbsp;A, near [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]], is an administrative, training and residential compound. Numerous structures on site include both residential and office buildings.&lt;ref name=clui /&gt; Station&amp;nbsp;A is used as a training facility by multiple agencies, including the Department of State and the CIA's [[Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Intelligence|Directorate of Intelligence]] and [[Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Support|Directorate of Support]].&lt;ref name=fasA &gt;{{cite web |last=Pike |first=John |title=Warrenton Station A |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=April 6, 1998 |url=https://fas.org/irp/facility/warrenton_a.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010803055504/https://fas.org/irp/facility/warrenton_a.htm |archivedate=August 3, 2001 |deadurl=yes |access-date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Station&amp;nbsp;B, also near Warrenton, houses the headquarters of WTC and, at {{convert|346|acre}}, is the largest of the four facilities. It consists of several multi-story buildings concealed atop the heavily forested View Tree Mountain, as well as underground bunkers that house communications infrastructure.&lt;ref name=fasB/&gt;&lt;ref name=clui /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Del Rosso |first=Don |title="Cloud" computing giant coming to Vint Hill  |newspaper=FauquierNow.com |date=October 6, 2016 |url=http://www.fauquiernow.com/index.php/fauquier_news/article/fauquier-cloud-computing-giant-coming-to-vint-hill-2016 |access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations at Station&amp;nbsp;B include a communications laboratory, communications training, electronics testing, and equipment maintenance.&lt;ref name=fasB2/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa /&gt; The facility is a node on a fiber-optic cable that runs from Stations C and D, and which also connects WTC with other facilities in the Washington, D.C. area, such as the [[Tysons Corner Communications Tower]]. Station&amp;nbsp;B also houses the Brushwood conference facility, constructed in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=fasB /&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] classifies Station&amp;nbsp;B as a [[superfund]] site due to the presence of an inactive landfill and two chemical pits that have released [[trichloroethylene]] into nearby residential drinking water wells.&lt;ref name=epa /&gt;

Station&amp;nbsp;C was at one time a CIA [[numbers station]], which transmitted coded signals to U.S. embassies overseas and [[espionage|intelligence agents]] in the field.&lt;ref name=clui /&gt;&lt;ref name=n&amp;o/&gt;&lt;ref name=fasC&gt;{{cite web |last=Pike |first=John |title=Warrenton Station C |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=April 6, 1998 |url=https://fas.org/irp/facility/warrenton_c.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010803055706/https://fas.org/irp/facility/warrenton_c.htm |archivedate=August 3, 2001 |access-date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmissions carried a female voice, dubbed "Cynthia" by radio hobbyists, that would recite groups of numbers in English.
