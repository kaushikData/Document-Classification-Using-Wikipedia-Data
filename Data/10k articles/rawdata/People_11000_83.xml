'''Arthur L. "Gat" Howard''' (1846 &amp;ndash; February 17, 1901), was an American and Canadian expert in the use of the early [[machine gun]]. He is best known for his use of a [[Gatling gun]] in support of the [[Canadian militia]] in the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885.

==Life==
Howard served for five years in the regular [[United States Cavalry]]. After leaving the regular army, he lived in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], where he was employed by Winchester Arms. Howard then formed a cartridge-making firm of his own called A.L. Howard &amp; Co., but his business premises were destroyed by fire in 1883. On July 18, 1884, Howard was placed in command of the Machine Gun Platoon, [[Connecticut National Guard]], with the rank of Second Lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;Article, "The Man with the Gatling Gun," in ''The New York Times'', May 18, 1885&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[North-West Rebellion]] of [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] and Indians broke out in western [[Canada]], in March 1885, the Canadian militia commander, Major General [[Frederick Middleton]], suggested that two Gatling guns be procured from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Bob, and Macleod, Rod, ''Prairie Fire'', McClelland and Stewart, Toronto, 1994, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. [[Richard J. Gatling]], the gun's inventor, began searching for a man who was an expert in the use of the Gatling, and selected Lieutenant Howard. Howard agreed to go to Canada with the two Gatlings. He was granted a month's leave of absence from the Guard (later extended). The Connecticut Guard later made it plain that they had "no hand" in Howard's planned expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Article, "The Man with the Gatling Gun"&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard left his wife and four children and a comfortable middle class life to travel to the [[North-West Territories]] with the Gatlings. His fascination with the Gatling gun, and scientific determination to test it under arduous battle conditions seem to have motivated his undertaking a dangerous mission which completely lacked U.S. government sanction – although this did not deter him from wearing his blue American officer's uniform in Canada, even on the battlefield. Howard's unofficial status was made even plainer when Dr. Gatling said that the lieutenant was not working for the Gatling manufacturer. He was travelling to Canada, Dr. Gatling said, merely as "a friend of the gun."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Joseph Kinsey, ''Strange Empire: A Narrative of the Northwest'', William Morrow and Company, New York, 1952, pp. 451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard journeyed, partly by rail, partly overland, to [[Swift Current]], North-West Territories. There he gave a demonstration of the weapon to some fascinated Canadian militiamen and Mounted Police, one of whom wrote:

"These curious instruments of destruction we inspect with interest, and their trial is watched eagerly. A few rounds are fired at some duck on a distant pond – no execution is done apparently, but the rapidity of fire shows us how very deadly a weapon of this kind might be on proper occasions. We want now to see one tried on the Indians..."&lt;ref&gt;Beal and Macleod, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Gatlings was used at the [[Battle of Cut Knife]] on May 2, 1885. However eyewitness accounts make it clear that Howard was not present; rather, the gun was operated by Canadian gunners.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvany, Charles Pelham, ''The History of the North-West Rebellion of 1885'', Hovey &amp; Co., Toronto, 1886, pp. 156-185&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard himself and one Gatling embarked on the [[South Saskatchewan River]] aboard the steamboat ''Northcote'', by which he travelled to Fish Creek, arriving on May 5, 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;  There he formed part of a Canadian militia column, which then moved on [[Louis Riel]]'s capital at [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]]. On May 9, 1885, the first day of the [[Battle of Batoche]], Howard fired some of the first shots from the militia side, aiming some rounds at the Roman Catholic rectory (the bullet holes may still be seen). He distinguished himself in action later that day, when his prompt and courageous actions prevented a group of the Métis from capturing one or more Canadian field guns. He was shifted that day from place to place so that the Gatling's firepower could be used to beat off significant enemy attacks. On May 12, 1885, the final day of the battle, Howard and his Gatling were again in the thick of the fighting, being brought up to defeat the last resistance near the village of Batoche.&lt;ref&gt;Beal and Macleod, pp. 265-266 and p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the militia victory, Howard stayed in Canada, and became a wealthy cartridge manufacturer. On the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]], he became a machine gun officer in the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police#Service in wartime|Canadian Mounted Rifles]]. He then organized a unit called the Canadian Scouts, with the rank of major. Arthur Howard was killed in action on February 17, 1901.&lt;ref&gt;http://angloboerwarmuseum.com/Boer70p_hero17_howard.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Personalities  Major Arthur L. "Gat" Howard'', Canadian War Museum, at [http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/boer/gathoward_e.html "Canadian Personalities  Major Arthur L. “Gat” Howard"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard was given the nickname "Gat" by the Canadian popular press during the campaign of 1885.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Personalities''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society holds an annual meeting, and offers numerous prizes for literature and other work. The Society also sponsors talks in conjunction with the [[American Philosophical Association]] ([https://www.apaonline.org/default.aspx APA]) and the Society for the Study of the History of Analytical Philosophy ([http://sshap.org/ SSHAP]).

==Aims and Motto==
[[File:Bust Of Bertrand Russell-Red Lion Square-London.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Bertrand Russell]] in [[Red Lion Square]]]]

# to bring together persons interested in any aspect of the foregoing; 
# to promote causes that Russell championed.

The BRS motto is: "The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge."
-Bertrand Russell (1925) "What I Believe"; cited from p.&amp;nbsp;349 in [http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-Basic-Writings-of-Bertrand-Russell.pdf ''The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell''] (Routledge Classics, New York: 2009).

==About==
[[File:Russell in 1924 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bertrand Russell]] in 1924, pipe in hand]]
Founded in 1974, the Bertrand Russell Society seeks to foster a better understanding of the life, work, and writings of Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) and how his contributions relate to today's world. The Society has a regular annual meeting featuring scholarly and popular presentations about Russell and related subjects, a business meeting, a banquet, and good fellowship. Usually in June, most often in a university setting, annual meetings have taken place at wide variety of [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/past-meetings/ locations].

The Society publishes the ''Bertrand Russell Society [http://bertrandrussellsociety.org/join/bulletin/ Bulletin]'', which is free to all members. Interested persons are invited to submit papers to the editor, William Bruneau. Members also receive the scholarly journal [https://escarpmentpress.org/russelljournal ''Russell''].

The [http://bertrandrussell.org/html/Stanley_Library/library.html Bertrand Russell Society Library] has a collection of Russell-related books and papers that members can borrow and a large selection of television and radio interviews of Russell online in the members area of the Library. Members of the Bertrand Russell Society may [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/contact/ contact us] for access.

The Society awards annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/student-paper-prize/ student-paper-prizes] for the best new papers about Russell by undergraduate and graduate students. Prize-winners present their papers at our annual meeting, receive $200, free registration, lodging and banquet at the meeting, and a 1-year membership in the BRS.

The Society also awards an annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/book-award/ BRS Book Award] for the best new book on Russell, an annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/brs-award/ BRS Award] to an individual or an organization whose work best furthers the interests and commitments of Bertrand Russell, and the [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/lee-eisler-service-award/ Lee Eisler Service Award] for service to the Russell Society.

The Society sponsors sessions of talks on Russell and early analytic philosophy more generally at meetings of the [[American Philosophical Association]] ([https://www.apaonline.org/default.aspx APA]), often in conjunction with the Society for the Study of the History of Analytical Philosophy ([http://sshap.org/ SSHAP]).

The Society helps support Russell scholarship, for example, the scholarly journal ''Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', which all BRS members receive as part of their membership, and maintains these web pages to provide information on Russell and related subjects and to further our shared interests and values.

'''Edward Uhler Condon''' (March 2, 1902 &amp;ndash; March 26, 1974) was a distinguished American [[nuclear physicist]], a pioneer in [[quantum mechanics]], and a participant in the development of [[radar]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s during World War II as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Branscomb, Lewis M.|authorlink=Lewis M. Branscomb|title=Edward Uhler Condon|journal=Physics Today|date=June 1974|volume=27|issue=6|pages=68–70|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v27/i6/p68_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3128661|bibcode=1974PhT....27f..68B|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927175050/http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v27/i6/p68_s1?bypassSSO=1|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Franck–Condon principle]] and the [[Slater–Condon rules]] are co-named after him.

He was the director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] (now NIST) from 1945 to 1951. In 1946, Condon was president of the [[American Physical Society]], and in 1953 was president of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

During the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy period]], when efforts were being made to root out communist sympathizers in the United States, Edward Condon was a target of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] on the grounds that he was a 'follower' of a 'new revolutionary movement', [[quantum mechanics]]; Condon defended himself with a famous commitment to physics and science.

Condon became widely known in 1968 as principal author of the ''[[Condon Committee|Condon Report]]'', an official review funded by the [[United States Air Force]] that concluded that [[unidentified flying object]]s (UFOs) have prosaic explanations. The lunar crater [[Condon (crater)|Condon]] is named for him.

==Background==
[[Image:Franck Condon Diagram.svg|thumb|right|'''Figure 1.''' [[Franck–Condon principle]] energy diagram. Since electronic transitions are very fast compared with nuclear motions, vibrational levels are favored when they correspond to a minimal change in the nuclear coordinates. The [[potential well]]s are shown favoring transitions between ''v'' = 0 and ''v'' = 2]]
Edward Uhler Condon was born on March 2, 1902, in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]], to William Edward Condon and Carolyn Uhler. His father was supervising the construction of a narrow-gauge railroad,&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=morse125&gt;[[#Morse|Morse, 125]]&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were built in the area by logging companies. After graduating from high school in [[Oakland, California]] in 1918, he worked as a journalist for three years at the ''Oakland Inquirer'' and other papers.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;

He then attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], initially joining the College of Chemistry; when he learned that his high school physics teacher had joined the faculty, he switched majors to take classes in theoretical physics.&lt;ref name=morse126&gt;[[#Morse|Morse, 126]]&lt;/ref&gt; Condon earned his bachelor's degree in three years and his doctorate in two.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; His Ph.D. thesis combined work by [[Raymond Thayer Birge]] on measuring and analyzing band spectral intensities and a suggestion by [[James Franck]].&lt;ref name=morse127&gt;[[#Morse|Morse, 127]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] fellowship, Condon studied at Göttingen under [[Max Born]] and at Munich under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]. Under the latter, Condon rewrote his Ph.D. thesis using [[quantum mechanics]], creating the [[Franck–Condon principle]].&lt;ref name=morse127/&gt; After seeing an ad in ''[[Physical Review]]'', Condon worked in public relations at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in fall 1927, in particular promoting their discovery of [[electron diffraction]].&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=morse128&gt;[[#Morse|Morse, 128]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:Sommerfeld1897.gif|thumb|right|[[Arnold Sommerfeld]], [[German people|German]] [[theoretical physicist]].]]
Condon taught briefly at [[Columbia University]] and was associate professor of physics at [[Princeton University]] from 1928 to 1937,&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; except for a year at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=wang242&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 242]]&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Philip M. Morse]], he wrote ''Quantum Mechanics'', the first English-language text on the subject in 1929. With G.H. Shortley, he wrote the ''Theory of Atomic Spectra'', "a bible on the subject from the moment of its 1935 publication".&lt;ref name=wheel112&gt;[[#Wheel|Wheeler, ''Geons'', 112]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wu /&gt;&lt;ref name=wang241 /&gt;{{#tag:ref|Some sources date ''The Theory of Atomic Spectra'' to 1936, but facsimile editions establish 1935 as the correct copyright date, along with Wheeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hPyD-Nc_YmgC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=The Theory of Atomic Spectra|authors=Condon, E. U. and Shortley, G. H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1935|isbn=978-0521092098}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

He was associate director of research at the [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] in Pittsburgh, beginning in 1937, where he established research programs in [[nuclear physics]], [[solid-state physics]], and [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectroscopy]]. He then headed the company's research on [[radar|microwave radar]] development.&lt;ref name=wang242 /&gt; He also worked on the equipment used to isolate [[uranium]] for use in [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; He served as a consultant to the National Defense Research Committee during World War II and helped organize [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s Radiation Laboratory.&lt;ref name=wang242 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wu /&gt; On May 11, 1940, Condon showcased his machine called the Nimatron at the 1940 New York World Fair. Condon filed for the patent on April 26, 1940 and got it on September 24, 1940 for his innovating machine, Nimatron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platinumpiotr.blogspot.com/2016/01/1940-nimatron.html|title=1940: Nimatron|author=|date=|website=platinumpiotr.blogspot.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government service===
[[File:JROppenheimer-LosAlamos.jpg|thumb|right|[[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] (circa 1944)]]
In 1943, Condon joined the [[Manhattan Project]]. Within six weeks, he resigned as a result of conflicts about security with [[Leslie Groves|General Leslie R. Groves]], the project's military leader. General Groves had objected when Condon's superior [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] held a discussion with the director of the project's Metallurgical Lab at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=bird223&gt;[[#Bird|Bird and Sherwin, 223-224]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Condon was upset that Oppenheimer did not stand up to Groves, but he did not know that Oppenheimer had yet to receive his own security clearance.&lt;ref name="bird223"/&gt;|group=Note}} 

In his resignation letter, he explained:  {{quote|The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy....I do not feel qualified to question the wisdom of this since I am totally unaware of the extent of enemy espionage and sabotage activities. I only want to say that in my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly depressing--especially the discussion about censoring mail and telephone calls.|author=Edward Condon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kelly, Cynthia C.|title=The Manhattan Project: The Birth of the Atomic Bomb in the Words of its Creators, Eyewitnesses, and Historians|publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation|year=2007|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  From August 1943 to February 1945, Condon worked as a part-time consultant at Berkeley on the separation of [[Isotopes of uranium|U-235 and U-238]].&lt;ref name=wang243&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 243]]&lt;/ref&gt; Condon was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=wang241&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 241]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, Condon played a leading role in organizing scientists to lobby for civilian control of atomic energy rather than military control under strict security.&lt;ref name=wang2434&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 243-4]]&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as science adviser to Senator [[Brien McMahon]], chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy, which wrote the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946|McMahon-Douglas Act]], enacted in August 1946, that created the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], placing atomic energy under civilian control.&lt;ref name =nytobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=wu /&gt;&lt;ref name=wang2434 /&gt; Adopting an internationalist viewpoint, Condon favored international scientific cooperation and joined the American-Soviet Science Society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 244, 244n15]]&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Harry S. Truman]] nominated Condon to be director of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] (now known as NIST) in 1945. He was confirmed by the Senate without opposition and served until 1951.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=wang243 /&gt; He was also president of the [[American Physical Society]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=wu&gt;{{cite web|first=Lewis M |last=Branscomb |authorlink=Lewis M.

===Attacks during 1940s===
[[File:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|[[J. Edgar Hoover]].]]
During the 1940s, Condon's security clearance status was repeatedly questioned, reviewed, and re-established. 

On May 29, 1946, FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] wrote a letter intended for President Truman that named several senior government officials as part of a Soviet network. It described Condon as "nothing more or less than an espionage agent in disguise." (Decades later Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] called it "baseless corridor talk.") The Truman administration ignored Hoover's charges.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moy|Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 63-8]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

On March 21, 1947, Truman signed United States [[Executive Order 9835]] AKA the "Loyalty Order."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/1947.html Harry S. Truman, Executive Orders] ''The Federal Register'', U.S. National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:390124-thomas-j-parnell.jpg|thumb|right|[[J. Parnell Thomas]] (1939)]]
Congressman [[J. Parnell Thomas]], head of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), furnished information to the ''Washington Times-Herald'' that denigrated his loyalty in two articles published in March 1947.&lt;ref name=corning /&gt;&lt;ref name=wang246&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 246]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas had several reasons to make a prominent case of Condon. He had no sympathy for the scientific community's international spirit in the first place and could use the ongoing controversy to argue for an increase in his committee's appropriation, to bolster opposition to the Condon-supported McMahon Act, and to attract favorable coverage during election season.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 252-5]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Commerce cleared Condon of disloyalty charges on February 24, 1948. A HUAC report dated March 2, 1948 said that "It appears that Dr. Condon is one of the weakest links in our atomic security".&lt;ref name=wang246 /&gt; Condon responded: "If it is true that I am one of the weakest links in atomic security that is very gratifying and the country can feel absolutely safe for I am completely reliable, loyal, conscientious and devoted to the interests of my country, as my whole life and career clearly reveal".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 248-9]]&lt;/ref&gt;  When U.S. Secretary of Commerce [[W. Averell Harriman]] refused to turn over loyalty files to the U.S. Atomic Energy Committee, on March 6, 1948, the ''Washington Post'' ran an editorial stating, "There is an abundance of precedent for the Secretary's refusal to turn over his department's loyalty board files on Dr. Edward U. Condon." The ''Post'' also objected to an alternative proposal to send files on the Condon case to the top-level "Loyalty Review Board" in the Civil Service Commission.  The Commerce Department's own loyalty board had already cleared Condon, and the ''Post'' argued that this decision should stand.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]] (1947)]]
Those who defended him included [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Harold Urey]]. The entire physics department of Harvard and numerous professional organizations wrote Truman on Condon's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 249]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists held a dinner on April 12, 1948, to demonstrate support, with nine Nobel Prize winners among the sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 249-50]]&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences, by contrast, considered only a statement criticizing HUAC's procedures rather than defending Condon. Despite widespread support among its members (275 to 35), the National Academy of Sciences' leadership did not release a statement, and instead opted to speak privately with Rep. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 251]]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 1948, the Atomic Energy Commission granted Condon a security clearance, allowing him to access classified information at NIST.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 255]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1948, at the Annual Meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS), President Truman, with Condon sitting nearby on the dais, denounced Rep. Thomas and HUAC on the grounds that vital scientific research "may be made impossible by the creation of an atmosphere in which no man feels safe against the public airing of unfounded rumors, gossip and vilification". He called HUAC's activities "the most un-American thing we have to contend with today. It is the climate of a totalitarian country".&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;   {{quote|I have lost a good deal of sleep trying to figure out how you could have talked this way about a man whom you have known for so long, and of whom you know so well what a good physicist and good citizen he is.|Edward Condon, June 1949.&lt;ref name=bird398&gt;[[#Bird|Bird and Sherwin, 398.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Condon opposed any cooperation with Congressional attempts to identify security risks within the scientific community. In June 1949, in a sharply critical letter to Oppenheimer, who had provided information to HUAC about a colleague, he wrote: "I have lost a good deal of sleep trying to figure out how you could have talked this way about a man whom you have known for so long, and of whom you know so well what a good physicist and good citizen he is."&lt;ref name=bird398/&gt; In July 1949, he testified before a Senate subcommittee that was considering rules governing the operation of Senate committees. He criticized Thomas and the HUAC for holding closed hearings and then leaking information that denigrated his loyalty and that of other scientists. He said that the committee denied his and his colleagues' requests for public hearings so they could respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/07/21/archives/condon-hits-leaks-in-house-inquiries-scientist-at-a-senate-hearing.html |title=Condon Hits 'Leaks' in House Inquiries|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Clayton|last=Knowles|authorlink=Clayton Knowles|date=1949-07-21|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks during 1950s===
[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] (here, signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency and authorizing U.S. entry into the [[Korean War]])]]
With his record finally cleared in 1951, Condon left government to become head of research and development for the [[Corning Glass|Corning Glass Works]]. He said his $14,000 annual government salary was his reason for the move. President Truman issued a statement of praise: "You have served in a most critical position with continued and loyal attention to your duties as director, and by reason of your standing among scientists and the supervision you have given to the bureau's activities, you have made of it a more important agency than it has ever been before". Two Republican Congressmen asserted that Condon was being investigated as a security risk and was leaving "under fire", a charge the Secretary of Commerce [[Charles W. Sawyer|Charles Sawyer]] denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0714FB345C107A93C3A81783D85F458585F9&amp;|title=Dr. Condon Resigns for Larger Salary|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1951-08-11|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 1951, Condon was elected to head the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="headsci"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1951/12/28/archives/dr-condon-chosen-to-head-scientists-target-in-atomic-security-case.html|title=Dr. Condon Chosen to Head Scientists|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1951-12-28|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wang265&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 265]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|''[[The New York Times]]'' says he was to be president of the organization in 1954, but Wang, "Security" 265, establishes that the term was 1953.&lt;ref name="headsci"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wang265/&gt;|group=Note}} In September 1952, Condon, in testimony before a Congressional committee, had his first opportunity to deny under oath all charges of disloyalty that had been made against him.&lt;ref name=corning /&gt; The HUAC concluded in its annual report for 1952 that Condon was unsuited for a security clearance because of his "propensity for associating with persons disloyal or of questionable loyalty and his contempt for necessary security regulations".&lt;ref name=wang264&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 264-5]]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 30, 1952, Condon assumed the presidency of the AAAS at its annual meeting, where, according to the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'', "The tremendous ovation by his fellow members accompanying his induction was a further affirmation of their faith in his loyalty and integrity".&lt;ref name=wang265/&gt;

Five months later Condon's clearance was revoked as was standard when someone left government service.&lt;ref name=corning /&gt;&lt;ref name=wang265 /&gt; He was granted a security clearance once more on July 12, 1954. It was announced on October 19 and then suspended by Secretary of the Navy [[Charles Thomas (Secretary of the Navy)|Charles S. Thomas]] on October 21.&lt;ref name=corning /&gt; Vice President Nixon took credit for the suspension, and the Atomic Scientists of Chicago charged "political abuse of the national security system", though Secretary Thomas denied Nixon had played a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/10/23/archives/nixon-warns-foes-of-reds-in-party-tells-montana-rally-that.html|title=Nixon Warns Foes of Reds in Party|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1954-10-23|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/12/17/archives/nixon-remarks-cited-on-condon-case-role.html|title=Nixon Remarks Cited on Condon Case Role|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1954-12-17|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condon withdrew his application for clearance and in December resigned from Corning because the company was seeking government research contracts and he lacked the clearance necessary for participating in military research. After citing the security reviews he had passed over the years, he said: "I am unwilling to continue a potentially indefinite series of reviews and re-reviews".&lt;ref name=corning&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/12/14/archives/condon-abandons-clearance-fight-quits-post-at-corning-glassobjects.html|title=Condon Abandons Clearance Fight|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1954-12-14|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corning had paid Condon's clearance-related legal expenses while he worked there.&lt;ref name=bird460&gt;[[#Bird|Bird and Sherwin, 460]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Condon wrote that his decision reflected his belief that the [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration "was committed by policy to the persecution of scientists, or, at the very least, to a callous indifference toward what others were doing to attack and discredit them. I decided the situation was hopeless, and that I had done all that could be reasonably expected of me in having resisted these forces for seven long years".&lt;ref name=wang266&gt;[[#Wang|Wang, "Security," 266]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|thumb|right|[[Carl Sagan]].]]
Years later, [[Carl Sagan]] reported how Condon described one encounter with a loyalty review board. A board member stated his concern: "Dr. Condon, it says here that you have been at the forefront of a revolutionary movement in physics called...quantum mechanics. It strikes this hearing that if you could be at the forefront of one revolutionary movement...you could be at the forefront of another". Condon said he replied: "I believe in Archimedes' Principle, formulated in the third century B.C. I believe in Kepler's laws of planetary motion, discovered in the seventeenth century. I believe in Newton's laws...." and continued with a catalog of scientists from earlier centuries, including the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoulli]], [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]], [[André-Marie Ampère|Ampère]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]], and [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]].&lt;ref name=sagan248&gt;[[#Sagan|Sagan, ''Demon-Haunted'', 248-9]]&lt;/ref&gt; He once said privately: "I join every organization that seems to have noble goals. I don't ask whether it contains Communists".&lt;ref name=wheel113&gt;[[#Wheel|Wheeler, ''Geons'', 113]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===

Condon was professor of physics at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 1956 to 1963 and then at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] from 1963, where he was also a fellow of the [[JILA|Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics]], until retiring in 1970.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;

From 1966 to 1968, Condon directed Boulder's UFO Project, known as the [[Condon Committee]]. He was chosen for his eminence and his lack of any stated position on UFOs. He later wrote that he agreed to head the project "on the basis of appeals to duty to do a needed public service" on the part of the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dick|Dick, ''Biological, 293]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its final report concluded that [[unidentified flying object]]s had prosaic explanations. It has been cited as a key factor in the generally low levels of interest in UFOs among mainstream scientists and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ufoskeptic.org/sturrock/1.html|title=An Analysis of the Condon Report on the Colorado UFO Project|first=Peter A|last=Sturrock|authorlink=Peter A.

==Personal and death==

Condon married Emilie Honzik. They had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name="nj.com"/&gt; The son, Joseph Henry Condon (15 February 1935 — 2 January 2012) was a physicist (Ph.D., [[Northwestern University]]) and engineer, who worked at [[Bell Labs]] on [[Telephone exchange#Digital switches|digital telephone switches]] and co-invented the [[Belle (chess machine)|Belle]] chess computer.&lt;ref name="nj.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/independentpress/index.ssf/2012/03/creator_of_belle_computer_ches.html |title=Creator of Belle computer chess dies at 76 |date=2 March 2012 |website=NJ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Creutz'''   (January 23, 1913&amp;nbsp;–  June 27, 2009) was an American physicist who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] and the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Laboratory]] during [[World War II]]. After the war he became a professor of physics at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]]. He was Vice President of Research at [[General Atomics]] from 1955 to 1970. He published over 65 papers on [[botany]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[metallurgy]] and science policy, and held 18 patents relating to [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]].

A graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], Creutz helped  [[Princeton University]] build its first [[cyclotron]]. During World War II he worked on [[nuclear reactor]] design under [[Eugene Wigner]] at the Metallurgical Laboratory, designing the cooling system for the first water-cooled reactors. He led a group that studied the metallurgy of uranium and other elements used in reactor designs. In October 1944, he moved to the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he became a group leader.

After the war ended, Creutz accepted an offer to come to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he became the head of its Physics Department and its Nuclear Research Center in 1948. In 1955 he returned to Los Alamos to evaluate its [[thermonuclear fusion]] program for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]. While there he accepted an offer to become Vice President for Research and Development and the Director of its John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science at General Atomics. Under his leadership, General Atomics developed [[TRIGA]], a nuclear reactor for universities and laboratories.

Creutz served as an assistant director of the [[National Science Foundation]] from 1970 to 1977, and then as Director of the [[Bishop Museum|Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum]] in [[Honolulu]], where he took particular interest in the museum's preparation of a ''Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii''.

== Early life ==
Edward Chester Creutz was born on January 23, 1913, in [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]], the son of Lester Creutz, a high school history teacher, and Grace Smith Creutz, a general science teacher. He had two older brothers, John and Jim, and a younger sister, Edith.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite book |title=Edward Chester Creutz 1913–2009 |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/Creutz_Edward.pdf |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2010 |location=Washington, D.C. |first=George |last=Hinman |first2=David |last2=Rose |series=Biographical Memoirs |accessdate=September 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in 1916, [[Monroe, Wisconsin]], in 1920, and to [[Janesville, Wisconsin]], in 1927.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Creutz |title=Obituary |date=January 23, 1996 |url=http://www.latticeguy.net/Ed_Creutz/Ed.pdf |accessdate=September 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a number of musical instruments, including the [[mandolin]], [[ukulele]] and [[trombone]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He played in the school bands at [[Joseph A. Craig High School|Janesville High School]] and [[Monroe High School (Wisconsin)|Monroe High School]]. At Janesville he played [[Banjo|tenor banjo]] in a dance orchestra called Rosie's Ragadors, and [[timpani]] with the school orchestra at Monroe. He also played [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|left guard]] on the [[American football]] teams at Janesville  and Monroe. He expressed an interest in chemistry, biology, geology and photography.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

After graduating from Janesville High School in 1929, he took a job as a [[Bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] at a local bank. In 1932, his brother John, who had graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with a degree in electrical engineering, persuaded him to go to college as well. John suggested that "if you aren’t sure what part of science you want, take physics, because that's basic to all of them."&lt;ref name="oral" /&gt; Creutz later recalled that this was the best advice he ever got.&lt;ref name="oral"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/33710_1.html |title=Oral History Transcript — Dr. Edward Creutz |date=January 9, 2006 |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |accessdate=September 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the University of Wisconsin and studied mathematics and physics.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Money was scarce during the [[Great Depression]], especially after his father died in 1935. To pay his bills, Creutz worked as a dishwasher and short order cook, and took a job taking care of the physics laboratory equipment. In 1936, his [[Senior (education)|senior year]], he taught physics laboratory classes.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

Creutz encountered several members of the faculty at the University of Wisconsin, including Julian Mack, Ragnar Rollefson, [[Raymond Herb]], [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[Gregory Breit]]. Mack gave Creutz a research project to do in his [[Junior (education)|junior year]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Creutz remained at Wisconsin as a graduate student after receiving his [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S.) degree in 1936, working for Herb upgrading the departmental [[Van de Graaff generator]] from 300 to 600 [[Electronvolt|keV]]. With this done, the question became what to do with it, and Breit suggested that it had previously been observed that high-energy [[gamma ray]]s were produced when [[lithium]] was bombarded with protons at 440 keV.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Creutz therefore wrote his 1939 [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.)  thesis on ''Resonance Scattering of Protons by Lithium'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.55.819  |first=Edward |last=Creutz |title=Resonance Scattering of Protons by Lithium | journal = [[Physical Review]] |volume = 55 |issue=9  |pages=819–824 |date=May 1939  |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.55.819 |bibcode=1939PhRv...55..819C }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Raman|Panarella|2009|p=353}} under Breit's supervision.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Creutz married Lela Rollefson, a mathematics student at Wisconsin, and the sister of Ragnar Rollefson, on September 13, 1937. The couple had three children, two sons, [[Michael Creutz|Michael]] and Carl, and a daughter, Ann Jo.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Wigner moved to [[Princeton University]] in 1938, and soon after Creutz received an offer as well. Princeton had been given a {{convert|36|in|adj=on}} magnet by the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], which had been used to build an 8 MeV [[cyclotron]]. They wanted Creutz to help get it operational.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He later recalled:
{{quote|On my third day in Princeton I was invited to give a short report on my thesis work. There were usually two or three speakers at these "Journal Club" meetings. This time the speakers were [[Niels Bohr]], [[Albert Einstein]], and Ed Creutz. To be on the same program with these two giants of scientific accomplishments was breathtaking. Just before the meeting began, my sponsor, Delsasso, asked me, "Say, Creutz, have you met Einstein yet?" I had not. Delsasso took me over to where Einstein was sitting in sweatshirt and tennis shoes, and said, "Professor Einstein, this is Creutz who has come to work on our cyclotron." The great man held out his hand, which seemed as big as a dinner plate, and said in an accented voice, "I’m glad to meet you, Dr. Creutz." I managed to wheeze out, "I’m glad to meet you, too, Dr. Einstein."&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; }}

But it was Bohr who electrified the audience with his news from Europe of the discovery by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch|Otto Frisch]] of [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Physicists rushed to confirm the results. Creutz built an [[ionization chamber]] and a [[linear amplifier]] out of radio [[vacuum tube]]s, coffee cans and motorcycle batteries, and with this apparatus the physicists at Princeton were able to confirm the results.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

== World War II ==
In the early years of [[World War II]] between 1939 and 1941, Wigner led the Princeton group in a series of experiments involving [[uranium]] and two tons of [[graphite]] as a [[neutron moderator]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; In early 1942, [[Arthur Compton]] concentrated the [[Manhattan Project]]'s various teams working on [[plutonium]] and [[nuclear reactor]] design, including Wigner's team from Princeton, at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]].{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=11–12}} The name was a codename; Creutz was the first to conduct actual [[metallurgy]] research, and he hired its first metallurgist to work with him.&lt;ref name="oral" /&gt;

Wigner led the Theoretical Group that included Creutz, Leo Ohlinger, [[Alvin M. Weinberg]], [[Katharine Way]] and Gale Young. The group's task was to design the reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling.{{sfn|Szanton|1992|pp=217–218}} The choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time because water was known to absorb [[neutron]]s, thereby reducing the efficiency of the reactor; but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using [[helium]] or [[liquid metal]] as a coolant would delay the project.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=22–24}} Working seven days a week, the group designed the reactors between September 1942 and January 1943.&lt;ref name="voices"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/alvin-m-weinbergs-interview |title=Alvin M. Weinberg's Interview |publisher=Manhattan Project Voices |accessdate=September 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creutz studied the corrosion of metals in a water-cooled system,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and designed the cooling system.&lt;ref name="voices" /&gt; In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

As a group leader at the Metallurgical Laboratory, Creutz conducted studies of uranium and how it could be extruded into rods. His group looked into the process of [[corrosion]] in metals in contact with fast-flowing liquids, the  processes for fabricating [[aluminium]] and jacketing uranium with it. It also investigated the forging of [[beryllium]], and the preparation of [[thorium]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=471}} [[Frederick Seitz]] and Alvin Weinberg later reckoned that the activities of Creutz and his group may have reduced the time taken to produce plutonium by up to two years.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by [[plutonium-240]] led Wigner to propose switching to breeding [[uranium-233]] from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type nuclear weapon]] design.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=36–38}} In October 1944, Creutz moved to Los Alamos,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=471}} where he became a group leader responsible for [[explosive lens]] design verification and preliminary testing.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led to the construction of a special test area in Pajarito Canyon, and Creutz became responsible for testing there.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=273}} As part of the preparation for the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]], Creutz conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon without nuclear material.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=657}} This test brought bad news; it seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. [[Hans Bethe]] worked through the night to assess the results, and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=661–663}}

== Later life ==
[[File:Tiare Apetahi.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Apetahia]] raiateensis'', a rare flower found only on [[Raiatea]] in [[French Polynesia]]. Creutz published a paper on it in 1966.]]
After the war ended in 1945, Creutz accepted an offer from Seitz to come to the Carnegie Institute of Technology as an [[associate professor]], and help create a nuclear physics group there.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Creutz in turn recruited a number of young physicists who had worked with him at Princeton and on the Manhattan Project in Chicago and Los Alamos, including Martyn Foss, [[J. G. Fox|Jack Fox]], Roger Sutton and Sergio DeBenedetti. Together, with funding from the [[Office of Naval Research]] they built a 450 MeV [[synchrotron]] at the Nuclear Research Center near [[Saxonburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; For a time,  This put them at the forefront of research into nuclear physics, allowing physicists there to study the recently discovered [[Pion|pi meson]] and [[Muon|mu meson]].&lt;ref name="oral" /&gt; A visiting scholar, [[Gilberto Bernardini]], created the first photographic emulsion of a meson.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Creutz became a professor, the head of the Physics Department, and the head of Nuclear Research Center at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1948. He was also a member of the Executive Board at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] from 1946 to 1958, and a consultant at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] from 1946 to 1958.&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?creutze |title=Edward Creutz |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |accessdate=September 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his work on nuclear physics, he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home. He published eight papers on floral species, and named three varieties of [[Viola (plant)|violets]] after his children. One 1966 paper, published in the ''[[New York Botanical Garden]] Journal'' was on ''[[Apetahia raiateensis]]'', a rare flower found only on the island of [[Raiatea]] in [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He travelled to Polynesia many times, and translated ''Grammar of the Tahitian language'' from French into English.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; His family served as hosts for a time to two young people from Tahiti and Samoa.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

In 1955 and 1956, Creutz spent a year at Los Alamos evaluating its [[thermonuclear fusion]] program for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]. While there he was approached by [[Frederic de Hoffmann]], who recruited him to join the [[General Atomics]] division of [[General Dynamics]]. He moved to [[La Jolla, California]], as its Vice President for Research and Development,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; and was concurrently the Director of its John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science from 1955 to 1967. He was also a member of the Advisory Panel on General Science at the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] from 1959 to 1963.&lt;ref name="AIP" /&gt;

[[File:TrigaReactorCore.jpeg|thumb|left|[[TRIGA]] is the world's most popular research reactor]]
Under his leadership, General Atomics developed [[TRIGA]], a small reactor for universities and laboratories. TRIGA used [[uranium zirconium hydride]] (UZrH) fuel, which has a large, prompt negative [[fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity]]. As the temperature of the core increases, the reactivity rapidly decreases. It is thus highly unlikely, though not completely impossible, for a [[nuclear meltdown]] to occur. Due to its safety and reliability, which allows it to be installed in densely populated areas, and its ability to still generate high energy for brief periods, which is particularly useful for research, it became the world's most popular research reactor, and General Atomics sold 66 TRIGAs in 24 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.com/about-triga |title=TRIGA® Nuclear Reactors |publisher=[[General Atomics]] |accessdate=September 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015011753/http://www.ga.com/about-triga |archivedate=October 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Very-high-temperature reactor|high-temperature gas-cooled reactor]] (HTGR) was less successful, and only two HTGR power reactors were built, both in the United States. A 40 MW demonstration unit at the [[Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station ]] in Pennsylvania operated successfully, but a larger 300 MW unit at the [[Fort St. Vrain Generating Station]] in Colorado encountered technical problems.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; General Atomics also conducted research into thermonuclear energy, including means of magnetically confining [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Between 1962 and 1974 Creutz published six papers on the subject.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

In 1970 [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Creutz as Assistant Director for Research of the [[National Science Foundation]]. He became Assistant Director for Mathematical and Physicals Sciences in 1975, and was acting Deputy Director from 1976 to 1977. The [[1970s energy crisis]] raised the national profile of energy issues, and Creutz served on a panel that produced a study called ''The Nation's Energy Future''.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; His wife Lela died of cancer in 1972. In 1974 he married Elisabeth Cordle, who worked for the National Science Board. The two of them enjoyed locating and photographing rare orchids.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="U-T"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/jul/13/1m13creutz231926-edward-creutz-worked-manhattan-pr/?uniontrib |title=Edward Creutz; worked on Manhattan Project |first=Blanca |last=Gonzalez |date=July 13, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His appointment at the National Science Foundation ended in 1977, and Creutz  became director of the [[Bishop Museum|Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum]] in [[Honolulu]]. He took particular interest in the museum's work preparing a two-volume ''Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii'', which was published in 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">'''Edward Michael Scheidt''' is a retired Chairman of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] Center and the designer of the cryptographic systems used in the ''[[Kryptos]]'' sculpture at CIA Headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]].

==Early life==
Scheidt was born July 20, 1939 in [[Santa Monica]], [[California]] United States. His father, Edward F. Scheidt, worked for the [[FBI]] and held the position of Director of the [[New York City]] FBI Field Office, and his mother was a switchboard operator at [[AT&amp;T]].  He graduated in 1957 from [[Brother Martin High School|Cor Jesu High School]] in [[New Orleans]] and then joined the [[U.S. Army|Army]],&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/ed-scheidt.html|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=2008|accessdate=May 23, 2011|title=The People of the CIA: Edward Scheidt}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked in [[Signals Intelligence]].

==CIA==
In 1963, he was hired as a [[communications officer]] for the CIA,  in the Office of Communications, which began a 26-year career, retiring in December 1989.  Scheidt spent 12 years posted overseas, including serving in [[Laos]] in the early 1960s, [[Lebanon]] in the late 1960s, and a tour in [[Southeast Asia]]. Most often he used [[one-time pad]] paper systems of encryption.&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; Scheidt received a B.A. in [[computer science|business administration]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1970 and a degree in telecommunications from [[George Washington University]] in 1975.

Scheidt is best known for his involvement with ''[[Kryptos]]'', a sculpture in the CIA courtyard which contains one of the world's most [[famous unsolved codes]].  ''Kryptos'' was created by [[Washington DC]] sculptor Jim Sanborn, who was commissioned by the CIA in the 1980s to create art around their new Headquarters building in 1988.  After Sanborn decided he wanted to incorporate some encrypted messages in his artwork, he was teamed with Scheidt, who was in the process of retiring and was called by then-director [[William H. Webster]] "The Wizard of Codes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/kryptos19.htm "Cracking the Code of a CIA Sculpture"], John Schwartz, July 19, 1999, Page A01, Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;  Up until that point, Sanborn had never used encryption or text in his work. Scheidt taught various encryption methods to Sanborn, who chose the exact messages to be encrypted.  Of the messages on the sculpture, three have been solved, but the fourth section, 97 or 98 characters at the very bottom, remains uncracked.  Scheidt has said that he knows the answer, along with Sanborn and "probably someone at the CIA."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/danbrown/story/0,15931,1505474,00.html "Interest grows in solving cryptic CIA puzzle after link to''Da Vinci Code''"], June 11, 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'', by Julian Borger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66359,00.html "Inside Info on  ''Kryptos'' Codes], January 21, 2005,  ''Wired News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/culture/1,66334-0.html "Solving the Enigma of Kryptos"], January 26, 2005, ''[[Wired News]]'', by [[Kim Zetter]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/06/17/sanborn/ "Sanborn: 'Kryptos' sculpture was 'an obsession'"], June 21, 2005, [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/22/us/22puzzle.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin "A Break for Code-Breakers on a C.I.A. Mystery"], April 22, 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==TecSec==
In the early 1990s, Scheidt noted that encryption, which originated for primarily one-to-one communications, now faced new and substantially different key management requirements in large network or virtual network environments.  It was into this technologically dynamic environment that Ed co-founded [http://www.tecsec.com TecSec Inc]., a software encryption company in 1990 in [[Vienna, Virginia]], where as of 2011 he works as Chief [[Scientist]].

One of their first ventures was to manufacture portable satellite versions of the secure [[STU-III]] telephones used by the government.  Scheidt manufactured the first model in his home basement workshop, and approximately 500 were in use worldwide by the [[United States Foreign Service]] as of 2002. The company also set out to create an encryption design with its key management that could be cited in standards or use components of standards.

In forming TecSec and building the company's large IP library, he anticipated the flexibility and mobility required of 21st Century communication systems with a key management system that is primarily client-based and much less dependent upon a central server. The relative scalability achieved by this approach, together with encryption at the object level, provides enforced role based access and granularity not otherwise available.  Ed remains deeply involved in the company's product development and expanding application solutions, just as he is in general management.

In February 2010 TecSec filed a lawsuit against several large tech vendors claiming infringement of several patents covering encryption technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9154319/Encryption_vendor_files_patent_lawsuit_against_tech_giants?source=CTWNLE_nlt_security_2010-02-10

'''Georges Frederic Roskopf''' (15 March 1813 – 14 April 1889), the inventor of the [[pin-pallet escapement]], was born in Germany and became a naturalized Swiss citizen.

== Early life and introduction ==

In 1829, when Roskopf was 16, he went to [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]] and began training in commerce with F. Mairet &amp; Sandoz, who dealt in ironmongery and watch parts. In 1833 he decided to become a watchmaker and went as an apprentice to J. Biber, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, to learn watchmaking.

== Career as a watch maker and specialist ==

Financed by his wife, he then set up in business as an établisseur, that is, a watch producer who bought the ebauche and all other parts of the watch and assembled them. He made cylinder and lever watches for export to North America and Belgium. Although the watches were well made, the business was not profitable and in 1850 Roskopf sold it. In 1851 Roskopf became the joint manager of the La Chaux-de-Fonds branch of B. J. Guttman Frères of Wurzburg. They manufactured English-type watches. In 1855 he set up in business with his son, Fritz Edouard, and Henri Gindraux as "ROSKOPF, GINDRAUX &amp; CO." After two years his son opened his own business in Geneva and Gindraux went to Neuchâtel to become the Director of the Watchmaking School.

Roskopf was an idealist who dreamed of making a good quality, cheap watch for working men. To accomplish this he used an old idea and reworked it, that of having the hands driven directly by the [[mainspring]]. In 1860 he began to design such a watch, which could be sold for 20 francs, and would still be of excellent quality, simple and solid. The watch had a large barrel in the center. a "Perron" [[pin-pallet escapement]], and a monometallic balance. After discussions with Moritz J. Grossman he adopted the simple detached pin lever escapement.

Listing of the features for the new caliber:

*1 Escapement on a platform normally using a pin lever design but possible with a lever or cylinder escapement;
*2. No center wheel but a large barrel;
*3. Motion work to hands direct from the barrel arbour;
*4. Philippe free spring with no stop work;
*5. Button wind but with handset by finger pressure.

== Parts refusal and patents ==

Roskopf met indifference and hostility among the watchmakers of the area who were still working as a home industry and who did not wish to make a watch such as he was offering. It is said, that in 1866 Roskopf ordered two boxes of ebauches from Emile Roulet and asked Gustave Rosselet to make escapements; both refused to take his orders because of the novelty of the work. He finally succeeded in producing a watch in 1867, using ebauches and cases from the Malleray Watch Co., and parts from many other makers, and having them assembled in Damprichard, Doubs, France, by M. Chatelain. The original order to Malleray Watch Co., was 2000 pieces. By the end of 1867 he was in business and by 1870 he had ordered 20,000 ebauches.

Roskopf was granted US patent No. 75,463 10 Mar. 1868, for a changeable escapement for watches (this patent said that the escapement could be adapted for use with a cylinder or lever as well as a pin pallet). Roskopf patented his watch in France with French patent No. 80611 of 25 Mar. 1868 for a watch with a type of platform escapement. He patented his designs in several countries (Belgium, No. 21988, 3 Aug. 1867) but never in Switzerland, because Switzerland did not yet have a patenting system, and because the idea had been used there before his use of it.

== Exhibitions and presentations ==

Through the influence of the House of Breguet in Paris, Roskopf was able to present his watch at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1868 and won a Bronze Medal. From then on Breguet began to send him orders. Some movements were supplied to Borel &amp; Courvoisier. Other orders poured in. The Roskopf watch was exhibited at the Amsterdam Exhibition in 1869 and won a Silver Medal. In 1870 Georges Roskopf introduced a second design with a setting mechanism; this watch cost 25 francs. In it he reduced the number of parts, simplified the escapement fitting, and introduced an improved winding. The escapement was assembled on its own adjustable platform. The watch was SW and pin-set. In his oversize barrel he arranged to use Adrien Philippe’s (Patek,Philippe) patent free mainspring without stop works for which he paid a royalty on each watch.

== Later career and death ==

In 1873 Roskopf handed over his business to Wille Frères and their associates, Ch. Léon Schmid.

When Roskopf died in 1889 a number of firms claimed to be his true successors. But Wille Frères actually owned the rights on the company. Actually, Wille Frères and Vve Ch. L. Schmid had been using Roskopf  trade mark for years before G. F. Roskopf’s death, with his permission.

By this time the idea of the Roskopf-type watch was becoming popular in Switzerland and a number of Swiss companies began making "Roskopf" watches. In order to be really cheap, the watches had to be machine mass manufactured as much as possible. These watches had [[pin-pallet escapement]]s rather than platform escapements.

'''Heaven on Earth''' are a husband and wife [[duet (music)|duo]] formed in [[England]] in 1983 by members Joe Ortiz (from New York City) and Pauly Ortiz (from Essex, England).

As a session and touring musician completing a European tour with the chart [[reggae]] group 'Inner Circle' Joe met Pauline Moore - a self styled singer-songwriter from Essex, England. Pauline commissioned Joe's multi-instrumental and vocal talents for her first album, titled ''Lady's Fire''. She was then professionally known as Jo Anna Forte, and signed to [[Eagle Records|Eagle Records UK]]. This album was also released on [[CBS Corporation|CBS Europe]].

In 1984, they had a son, [[Paul Antonio Ortiz|Paul Ortiz]], also a musician and composer/producer known throughout the internet as Chimp Spanner. In 1987, Joe and Pauly were signed to [[Atlantic Records]] for whom they recorded and released the LP and [[compact disc|CD]] titled ''Dedication''. In the same year, they entered their song "Love Come Down" which came in the final eight for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] entries.

They have also composed and produced popular [[television]] signature themes for such programmes as ''Heirloom'', ''Animals in Action'' and ''Jumble''. Today they manage their own multimedia business providing products and services to end users as well as the industry. They still continue to compose and record new material and have completed enough music to fill approximately seventy albums. It includes [[instrumental]]s.

== Career ==
Turley graduated from [[Cornell University|Cornell's]] agricultural school in the 1970s, and moved to the Napa Valley, landing at [[Robert Mondavi]]'s lab.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1984 she had her first job as a winemaker but began thinking differently about winemaking when she made two barrels of wine using wild yeast in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During her career, Turley evangelized a variety of winemaking methods that were unique for their time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/california-wine/california-wine-history-from-early-plantings-in-1800s-to-today/|title=Complete Napa Valley California Wine History from Early 1800s to Today|work=The Wine Cellar Insider|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the first winemakers in California to use cold soaks and to focus on harvesting phenolically ripe fruit to as to make the wine as natural as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the 1990s, Turley helped usher in the era of the superconsultant in California, taking startups such as Peter Michael, Colgin and Bryant Family to fame as her winegrowing regime pushed wine quality to new heights.  She gained renown helping many small wineries make exceptional wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.emporiagazette.com/news/article_78fb56f5-7283-5be6-bbcf-e1260e2c12fa.html|title=Don't overlook Overlook|last=Murphy|first=Regina|date=2017-09-30|work=Emporia Gazette|access-date=2017-10-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Don't get in the way of the wine," Turley drilled in her pupils and mentees; "If you've got the right vineyard—the right grapes—you can make great wine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Constellation-Buys-Napa-Cabernet-Star-Schrader-Cellars|title=Exclusive: Constellation Buys Napa Cabernet Star Schrader Cellars|last=Laube|first=James|date=2017-06-17|work=WineSpectator.com|access-date=2017-10-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Turley simultaneously made wines for Colgin, Bryant, Turley, Martinelli, Pahlmeyer, Green &amp; Red, Harrison, La Jota, Landmark and Canepa, as well her and husband John Wetlaufer’s own label, Marcassin. Some of her early triumphs came with the Napa Valley Cabernets of Bryant and Colgin, which shared her signature style of bold and extracted flavors underscored by finesse, polish and refinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/22/yes-women-can-make-great-wine|title=Yes, Women Can Make Great Wine|last=Salcito|first=Jordan|date=2014-03-22|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turley is also credited with helping raise the quality of Chardonnay in both [[Napa County, California|Napa]] and [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]]. With Marcassin, and the wines she made for Martinelli, Turley was instrumental in putting [[Sonoma Coast AVA|Sonoma Coast]] on the map.

==Lawsuits==
In 2001, the [[Roy Estate]] hired Turley and her husband, John Wetlaufer, to design their {{convert|17|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Napa Valley (wine)|Napa Valley]] vineyard and for Turley to serve as consulting winemaker. After making Roy Estate's 2003 &amp; 2004 vintages, Turley canceled the arrangement in March 2005. The following September, the owners of Roy Estate filed a lawsuit against Turley and Wetlaufer alleging breach of contract. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, Cyril, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', (June 8, 2006), [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/08/WIGOLJ9CQ11.DTL Washington's largest wine company buys one of Oregon's oldest]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2567">'''[[Igbo people|Igbo]] names''' are traditionally and historically constructed in a fashion similar to [[Arabic name|Arabic naming]] convention &amp; old European naming. In this convention there are no family names, instead one is known through their immediate male lineage.

In the olden days, Igbos - and especially the women - were named after the four market days (eke, orie, afor, and nkwo) in Igboland. Examples: Mgboafor, Mgbori, Nwanyinkwo, Mgbeke, Nkwoja, and Ugweke.

==Naming==
In the Igbo naming convention a child is given a name at birth referencing an event surrounding the birth, a deceased ancestor, or the time and/or place of birth. This is the name they will primarily be known by. To differentiate from others in the same generation with the same name a person will also give their father's first name. The first Westerners to communicate with the Igbo often confused this for a [[surname]] (family name), however, unlike a surname, it is not passed on to the next generation as a "second name".

This system extended even into marriage. Unlike in some Western countries, the woman does not always change her name. In the event that she did, it would be to her husband's first name.

[[Image:Igbo family.jpg|center|700px|Example of an Igbo family tree explained below.]]

In the example above, the progenitors, ''Onodugo'' and ''Nkechi'', may be differentiated from others in their generation by his and her father's name. For ex. ''Onodugo'' and ''Nkechi'' have fathers with first names ''Okonkwo'' and ''Agu'' respectively. They are the father and mother of a daughter, and son who are each married. ''The son and daughter each had a child. The first who had a child would name their child Ezenwa. The next sibling to have a child would almost always give their child a different first name. It is against custom to name a child after a living family member, especially one in the same or previous generation.  Ezenwa and his cousin would each get their fathers first name for their last.'' After marriage, Nkechi, Adanna and Oluchi are known either by their fathers' or husbands' first names.

In the beginning and middle of the 20th century, after the spread of [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christianity]] this method was almost completely dropped in favor of adopting the grandfather's name (father's "last name") as a surname. In many cases, either an English name or the father's first name becomes the child's middle name.

[[File:Portrait Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt 04.JPG|thumb|Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 2005]]
'''Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt''' (15 June 1928 – 2 June 2018) was an Austrian [[ethnologist]] in the field of [[human ethology]].&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://orf.at/stories/2441216/ |title=Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt gestorben |date=2018-06-02 |website=news.ORF.at |language=de-DE |access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In authoring the book which bears that title, he applied [[ethology]] to [[humans]] by studying them in a perspective more common to volumes studying animal behavior.

Born in [[Vienna]], Austria, Eibl-Eibesfeldt studied [[zoology]]&lt;ref name="ORF" /&gt; at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1945 to 1949. From 1946 to 1948 he was research associate at the Biological Station Wilhelminenberg near Vienna and became research associate of the Institute for Comparative Behavior Studies in Altenberg near Vienna with [[Konrad Lorenz]] in 1949. Between 1951 and 1969 he worked at the [[Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology]] (first in [[Westphalia]], from 1957 at [[Seewiesen]], [[Bavaria]]). In 1970 he became Professor for Zoology at the [[University of Munich]]. Since 1975 he has been the head of the [[Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology]], Department of Human Ethology in [[Andechs]], Germany. He was the co-founder and first president of the [[International Society for Human Ethology]]. Since 1992 he has been Honorary Director of the [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Ludwig-Boltzmann]]-Institute for Urban Ethology in Vienna.

In the first twenty years of his work as an animal ethologist, he investigated experimentally and descriptively the development of behavior of mammals and compared the behavior of communication of vertebrates. He is the author of many books such as ''[[Love and Hate: The Natural History of Behavior Patterns]]'' and ''[[Human Ethology (book)|Human Ethology]]''.

==Personal life==
He married Eleonore Eibl-Eibesfeldt in 1950.  They had two children, Bernolf and Roswitha.

Eibl-Eibesfeldt died on 2 June 2018 in [[Starnberg]], two weeks before his 90th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zeit.de/news/2018-06/03/verhaltensforscher-eibl-eibesfeldt-gestorben-180603-99-560947&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years he dived with [[Hans Hass]] on his diving boat ''Xarifa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehds.com/publications/hassbib.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727153647/http://www.thehds.com/publications/hassbib.html |date=July 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Grant Fuller, Jr.''' (November 30, 1913 – November 7, 1990)&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite web|first=Edwin |last=McDowell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/09/obituaries/john-fuller-76-playwright-dies-wrote-books-on-the-unexplained.html |title=John Fuller, 76, Playwright, Dies; Wrote Books on the Unexplained |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 9, 1990 |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a New England-based [[United States|American]] [[author]] of several [[non-fiction]] books and newspaper articles, mainly focusing on the theme of [[extra-terrestrials]] and the [[supernatural]]. For many years he wrote a regular column for the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' magazine, called "Trade Winds". His books include ''[[We Almost Lost Detroit]]'', ''[[The Ghost of Flight 401]]'', ''Incident at Exeter'', and ''The Interrupted Journey''.

==Writing==
''Incident at Exeter'' (1966) concerned a series of well-publicized [[unidentified flying object]] (UFO) sightings in and around the town of [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] in the fall of 1965 (see the [[Exeter incident]]). Fuller personally investigated the sightings and interviewed many of the eyewitnesses; he also claimed to have seen a UFO himself during his investigation.

''The Interrupted Journey: Two Lost Hours "Aboard a Flying Saucer"'' (1966) tells the story of the [[Barney and Betty Hill]] abduction. The Hills were a married couple who claimed to have been abducted in 1961 by the occupants of a UFO in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]] while returning home from a vacation. The book was the first to seriously claim that competent, reliable witnesses were being abducted by UFOs for medical and scientific experiments. The book remains one of the most influential in UFO history, and has been hotly debated since its publication. Like ''The Ghost of Flight 401'', ''The Interrupted Journey'' was also turned into a made-for-television movie in 1975.

''Aliens in the Skies'' (1969) is based on transcripts from the July 29, 1968 Congressional Hearing Before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics where experts such as [[Carl Sagan]] and [[J. Allen Hynek]] testified on the possibility of UFOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aliens in the Skies (review)|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-g-fuller-5/aliens-in-the-skies/|work=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller wrote ''The Great Soul Trial'' (1969) about the disappearance of Arizona Miner [[James Kidd (prospector)|James Kidd]] and the later trial regarding his will, which left his fortune to anyone who could prove the existence of the human soul.  The book was published prior to the final resolution of the case in 1971.

''[[Zé Arigó|Arigo]]: Surgeon of the Rusty Knife'' (1974) was about the life and purported supernatural healing powers of a [[Psychic surgery|psychic surgeon]] in Brazil. A poor review in [[The New York Review of Books]] led to a public disagreement between Mr. Fuller and the reviewer, [[Martin Gardner]].&lt;ref name=NYRevBooks&gt;{{cite news|title=Trick or Treatment|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1974/jul/18/trick-or-treatment/|accessdate=February 26, 2013|newspaper=New York Review of Books|date=July 18, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner protesting [[Crowell-Collier Publishing Company|Crowell-Collier]]'s publishing of Fuller's book ''Arigo'' withdrew publication of his own (Gardner) book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=Ray |title=The Martin Gardner Correspondence with Marcello Truzzi |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=57–59 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His book ''[[We Almost Lost Detroit]]'' (1975) deals with a serious accident at the Fermi nuclear power plant near Detroit. The book title was later the title of a song by [[Gil Scott-Heron]] on the ''No Nukes'' live album recorded by the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]].

''The Ghost of Flight 401'' (1976) was based on the tragic [[Eastern Air Lines Flight 401]] airplane crash in December 1972, and the alleged supernatural events which followed; it was eventually turned into a popular 1978 made-for-television movie.

''Are The Kids All Right?'' (1981) focused on [[The Who concert disaster]] at Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati on December 3, 1979. Fuller suggested that hard rock music's hypnotic rhythms mean the music "ignites and is responsible for unprecedented and potentially disastrous concert violence on a regular and continuing basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Robert|title=The Pop Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/06/books/the-pop-life-159782.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 6, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote two plays&amp;nbsp;— ''The Pink Elephant'', which opened in 1953, and ''Love Me Little'', which opened in 1958, both on Broadway.

''The Poison That Fell From the Sky'' (1977) is about [[dioxin]] poisoning following [[Seveso disaster|a chemical plant disaster]] in [[Seveso]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todisco|first=Paula J|author2=Rose Moorachian|title=The Poison That Fell from the Sky (Book Review)|journal=School Library Journal|date=September 1978|volume=25|issue=1|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Virginia|title=The Poison That Fell From the Sky/Heart Beat|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=Dec 1978|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Poison that Fell from the Sky (Review)|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-g-fuller-2/the-poison-that-fell-from-the-sky/|work=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=23 October 2013|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing Fuller's book, Jeff Greenfield, reviewer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', commented that Fuller was known for "raising the most unsettling of questions"; Fuller was also known for his ability to obtain and use government documents in his investigations.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

==Personal life==

Fuller was married to a [[Northwest Airlines]] flight attendant who was the researcher mentioned in his book "Ghost of Flight 401".

Fuller died of [[lung cancer]] in 1990.

Drogo is a powerful ''khal'', or warlord, of the [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki]] people, a tribal nation of horse riders in the steppes beyond the [[Free Cities (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Free Cities]]. He is an accomplished warrior and has never been defeated in battle.

===A Game of Thrones===
In ''A Game of Thrones'', [[Viserys Targaryen]] and [[Illyrio Mopatis]] marry [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to ''Khal'' Drogo to get his support and warriors for the invasion of Westeros.  He proves a kind, sensitive, and loving husband. After there is a failed attempt on Daenerys's life, he vows to invade Westeros, but is wounded in a subsequent battle. He begins developing a severe case of sepsis. Daenerys unwittingly sacrifices their unborn son to save him with blood magic. While this saves his life, he is left in a [[catatonic]] state. Daenerys  smothers him with a pillow. At his [[funeral pyre]], she walks with her dragon eggs into the flames and emerges unscathed with three baby dragons. He is the namesake of her favorite dragon, Drogon.

''Khal'' Drogo is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of [[Daenerys Targaryen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television adaptation==
[[File:Jason Momoa by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jason Momoa]] plays the role of Drogo in the [[Game of Thrones|television series]]]]

Khal Drogo is played by [[Jason Momoa]] in the television adaptation of the series of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/20779/jason-momoa-interview-game-of-thrones-playing-conan-and-more|title='Game of Thrones: Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo|work=DenofGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his audition for the part of Drogo he performed the ''[[Ka Mate]]'' [[haka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/19/jason-momoa-audition-tape_n_6010482.html|title=Jason Momoa Audition tape|publisher=Huffingtonpost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Momoa related his experience in reading for the role:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I read that ''Khal'' Drogo role, I was blown away. I couldn't believe it was happening, I had to have that role. I was like, "Nobody is going to take that role from me." ... People say it's easy [to play the role]—"You're just sitting there!" But it's extremely hard to be extremely intimidating, and say everything but not say anything.&lt;ref name="Hypable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hypable.com/game-of-thrones-actor-jason-momoa-thinks-playing-khal-drogo-is-phenomenal/|title=Khal Drogo: 'Game of Thrones' actor talks|publisher=Hypable}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Remarking on the character's early exit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was reading it and I was like: "Holy shit! Fuck, I'm dead!" ... It's amazing what [George R. R. Martin] sets up. Here's your lead characters, you're supposed to think about them one way, and you hate them, then you love them, and then they're killed and it's a whirlwind of emotion. All the little kids and even the smallest of characters just grow and grow and grow. He built a beautiful world. I'm bummed I'm not going back. To play ''Khal'' Drogo was phenomenal and I wished there was more stuff he could have done, I'm going to miss that character.&lt;ref name="Hypable" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Storylines===
====Season 1==== 
Khal Drogo is a [[warlord]] of the [[Dothraki Sea|Dothraki]] people. He is to marry Daenerys Targaryen, as arranged by her brother Viserys. He is undefeated in battle. Viserys Targaryen conspired with Magister Illyrio to marry Daenerys to Drogo in order to get his support in an invasion of Westeros. Though Daenerys was initially unhappy with the arrangement, Drogo proves to be a sensitive husband and lover despite his fearsome behavior with his men. After a failed poisoning attempt on a pregnant Daenerys' life, he promises to invade Westeros to reclaim the Seven Kingdoms as a gift to his unborn son, but is wounded by one of his men, Mago, before he could begin the invasion. The wound festers, owing to ‘treatment’ from a resentful witch enlisted as healer by Daenerys, and Drogo becomes so sick that he is unable to ride his horse, a sign of weakness to the Dothraki. Most of his khalasar abandons him, but Daenerys unknowingly sacrifices their unborn child for a spell to revive him. The spell works, but leaves him in a catatonic state. Daenerys smothers him out of pity, and the flames of his funeral pyre ultimately hatch her dragon eggs.

====Season 2====
As Daenerys walks through a stronghold in Qarth, she is struck with visions of places such as a ruined and snowbound Red Keep, and the Haunted Forest. She encounters her deceased husband, Khal Drogo, and their stillborn son Rhaego, both apparently alive and well. Although unsure whether she is dreaming, Daenerys leaves when she hears her dragons.

==Reception==
Momoa received positive reviews for his portrayal of the character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2011/06/20/game-of-thrones-jason-momoa|title='Game of Thrones' warlord Jason Momoa talks season finale|publisher=EW}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed his own ideas to his portrayal. For example, in one scene, Drogo cements his position as the lead ''khal'' by ripping out the tongue of a dissenter, Mago. The scene was not in the script, but was suggested by Momoa after he made the observation that Drogo, who is said to be a great warrior, had never been shown demonstrating his prowess as a warrior onscreen.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Mike (February 29, 2012).

'''Lotan''' ([[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]]:&amp;nbsp;𐎍𐎚𐎐''-ltn'', transliterated 
''Lôtān'',{{sfnp|Uehlinger|1999|p=514}} ''Litan'',{{sfnp|Barker|2014}} or ''Litānu'',{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999|p=133}} meaning "coiled") is a servant of the [[sea god]] [[Yam (god)|Yam]] defeated by the [[storm god]] [[Hadad|Hadad-Baʿal]] in the [[Ugaritic]] ''[[Baal Cycle]]''.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999|p=133}} possibly with the help or by the hand of his sister [[ʿAnat]].{{sfnp|Baumgarten|1981|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=BM8UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208 208]}} 
Lotan seems to have been prefigured by the serpent ''Têmtum'' represented in Syrian seals of the 18th–16th century BC, {{sfnp|Uehlinger|1999|p=512}} and finds a later reflex in the sea monster ''[[Leviathan]]'', whose defeat at the hands of [[Yahweh]] is alluded to in the [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] [[Book of Job]] and in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 27:1.{{sfnp|Uehlinger|1999|p=512}}{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999|p=133}} 
Lambert (2003) went as far as the claim that [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 27:1 is a direct quote lifted from the Ugaritic text, correctly rendering Ugaritic ''bṯn'' "snake" as Hebrew ''nḥš'' "snake".&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Lambert, "Leviathan in Ancient Art" in ''FS Shlomo Moussaieff'' (ed. R. Deutsch), 2003, 147&amp;ndash;154 (p. 154)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Barker|2014|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=cXRZJlN8BbwC&amp;pg=PA152 152]}}

''Lotan'' (''ltn'') is an adjectival formation meaning "coiled", here used as a proper name;{{sfnp|Baumgarten|1981|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=BM8UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208 208]}} the same creature has a number of possible epitheta, including  "the fugitive serpent" (''bṯn brḥ'') and maybe (with some uncertainty deriving from manuscript lacunae) "the wriggling serpent" (''bṯn ʿqltn'') and "the mighty one with seven heads" (''šlyṭ d.šbʿt rašm'').{{sfnp|Uehlinger|1999|p=512}}

The myth of Hadad defeating Lotan, Yahweh defeating Leviathan, Marduk defeating Tiamat (etc.) in the mythologies of the Ancient Near East are classical examples of the ''[[Chaoskampf]]'' mytheme, also reflected in [[Zeus]]' slaying of [[Typhon]] in [[Greek mythology]]{{sfnp|Ogden|2013}} and [[Thor]]'s struggle against [[Jörmungandr]] in the [[Gylfaginning]] portion of the [[Prose Edda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Prose Edda|last=Sturluson|first=Snorri|publisher=[[Penguin Classics]]|year=2005|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marie-Madeleine Jarret''', known as '''Madeleine de Verchères''' (({{IPA-fr|madəlɛn də vɛʁʃɛʁ}}); 3 March 1678&amp;nbsp;– 8 August 1747) was a woman of [[New France]] (modern Quebec) credited with repelling a raid on [[Verchères, Quebec|Fort Verchères]] when she was 14 years old.

==Early life==

François Jarret, of [[Saint-Chef]] in the department of [[Isère]] in France, joined the company of his uncle [[Antoine Pécaudy de Contrecœur]] to battle the [[Iroquois]] in [[New France]] (see [[Beaver Wars]]).  They arrived there in August 1665, and on 17 September 1669 Jarret [[child marriage|married the twelve-year-old]] Marie Perrot in Île d’Orléans.  He was awarded a [[land grant]] on the south shore of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] on 29 October 1672 in a [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneury]] called [[Verchères]], and thereafter continued to increase his land holdings.  The couple was to have twelve children, the fourth of whom was Marie-Madeleine, born in Verchères on 3 March 1678 and baptised that 17 April.{{sfn|Vachon|1974}}

The seigneury underwent periodic Iroquois raids.  In 1690 the matron of Verchères took command of a successful defense against an Iroquois assault on the stockade there.  By 1692 the Iroquois had killed the Jarrets' son François-Michel and two successive husbands of their daughter Marie-Jeanne.{{sfn|Vachon|1974}} Before she performed this courageous act, she usually worked in the family field during her spare time.

==Thwarting a surprise attack==

In the late 1600s the [[Iroquois]] mounted attacks on the settlers of New France, looting and burning their homes. On 22 October 1692 Madeleine's parents left the fort on business and to gather winter supplies. Madeleine and her brothers and sisters stayed at the fort. Now fourteen, Madeleine was in charge of the fort, with one very old man (Laviolette) and 2 soldiers.

One morning, some settlers left the fort to tend to the fields along with eight soldiers. Madeleine was in the cabbage garden, quite close to the fort. Suddenly, the Iroquois descended on the settlers. The men, caught off guard, tried to flee to safety. But the Iroquois were too quick for them and they were easily caught and carried off. Madeleine, working only 200 paces from the fort, had a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] on the Iroquois who were chasing her. One Iroquois caught up to her and grabbed her by her kerchief which she quickly untied, then Madeleine ran into the fort shouting, "''Aux armes! Aux armes!''" (To arms)

Madeleine ran to the [[bastions]]. She knew there was only one hope. Madeleine fired a musket and encouraged the people to make as much noise as possible so that the Iroquois would think there were many soldiers defending the fort. Then Madeleine fired the [[cannon]] to warn other forts of an attack and to call for reinforcements. The Iroquois had hoped a surprise attack would easily take over the fort, so for a moment, they retreated into the bushes with their prisoners.

During the siege, Madeleine noticed a canoe approaching the landing site with a family named Fontaine.  The soldiers inside the fort refused to leave, so Madeleine ran to the dock and led the family quickly inside, pretending to be reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, pg 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the evening, the settlers' cattle returned to the fort. She knew that the Iroquois could be hiding with the herd covered in animal skins. She had her two brothers wait with her to check the cattle for warriors but none were found and the cows were brought inside the fort.

Reinforcements from Montreal arrived just after the Iroquois left. Tired but relieved, Madeleine greeted the French lieutenant, "Mon seigneur, I surrender to you my arms." The reinforcements caught the Iroquois and returned the kidnapped settlers. By this time, Madeleine's parents had returned and news of Madeleine's heroic deed had spread through the colony.

==Later life==
François, Madeleine's father, died on 16 February 1700, and his pension of 1000 [[New France livre|livres]] was transferred to Madeleine due to her leadership in 1692, on the condition that she provide for her mother.&lt;ref name="Vachon, link below"&gt;Vachon, link below&lt;/ref&gt;

Madeleine managed Verchères until her marriage in September 1706 to Pierre-Thomas Tarieu de La Pérade, who was a lieutenant in the regular troops of New France.  He was the son of [[Thomas de Lanouguère]], an administrator of the colony who descended from an old noble family in France.  The couple moved to [[Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Quebec]], where Tarieu was co-seigneur.{{sfn|Vachon|1974}}  Madeleine's seigneury at Verchères was transferred to her new husband.  The complex land titles led to numerous lawsuits over the course of her life, and Madeleine sailed to France at least three times to represent herself and her husband in court.

Marie-Madeleine died at Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade on 8 August 1747 at age 69.  She was buried beneath her [[pew]] at Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade.  Pierre-Thomas died 26 January 1757 at age 79.{{sfn|Vachon|1974}}

==In Modern Culture==

A statue of Madeleine de Verchères stands on Verchères Point near Montreal. It was made by [[Louis-Philippe Hébert]], who was commissioned for the project in 1911.

''Madeleine de Verchères'', a J.-Arthur Homier film released 10 December 1922, featured [[Estelle Bélanger]] as Madeleine. The [[Internet Movie Database]] reports this film as "lost."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202998/ https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202998/], 6 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian government]] designated her as a [[Persons of National Historic Significance|Person of National Historic Significance]] in 1923.

''Madeleine Takes Command'' (1946) is a historical novel based upon the siege of Verchères, by [[Ethel C. Brill]] ([[Whittlesey House]]).

==Historiography and legacy==

The earliest reports of the raid of 1692 did not mention Madeleine.{{sfn|Coates|2012|pp=29–30}}  Five accounts of the siege of 1692 appeared during Madeleine's lifetime.  The earliest is a letter Madeleine wrote to the Comtesse de Maurepas 15 October 1699,{{sfn|Vachon|1974}} in which she gives her story in petition of a pension.  She wrote a longer, greatly embellished version{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=30}} dated 1722 or later{{sfn|Vachon|1974}} to [[Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois|Governor Beauharnois]] at his request.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=30}}  Claude-Charles de La Potherie in 1722 published two accounts: the first is virtually the same as Madeleine's letter of 1699, and the second virtually the same as the later to Beauharnois; both may have been based on, or were even the basis of, Madeleine's own.  [[Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix]] published another embellished version in 1744.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=31}}  In 1730 Gervais Levebre, a priest against whom Madeleine had initiated a legal process, was recorded stating, "God fears neither hero nor heroine", which suggests her story was well known by that time.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=32}}

Accounts progressively emphasized Madeleine's disguising herself as a man, the necessity of which is questioned: her mother had commanded a similar defence two years earlier with no such disguise.  In her first account, Madeleine describes how she escaped from an Iroquois by leaving her scarf in his hands and then replaced her headdress with a soldier's helmet.  Charlevoix adds to this that she knotted up her hair and put on a man's [[Jerkin (garment)|jerkin]].{{sfn|Coates|2012|pp=30–31}}  Later accounts may represent later societies' anxieties over Madeleine's transvestism.{{sfn|Coates|2012|pp=31–32}}  The 1730 lawsuit was over the priest Levebre's calling Madeleine a "whore", which may suggest notions of free sexuality the public had of women who assumed such a traditionally male role as that of warrior.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=32}}

Many writers took pains to ensure that, after the siege, Madeleine returned fully to her traditional feminine role and demeanour.  A journalist in 1912 wrote she "was a perfect woman, as good a housekeeper as a mother".  The [[curate]] [[Frédéric-Alexandre Baillairgé]] wrote that though "strong, {{interp|she}} was nonetheless soft and sensitive".  Some were more explicit, as [[Lionel Groulx]] who wrote that women "must sometimes fill in for men, but they must render them the arms for the battles that are more appropriate for them".{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=36}}  While female writers also often emphasized Madeleine's return to a traditional role supporting the men, others used her story to advance a feminist position of the role of women in Canadian history.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=36}}

Comparisons have been drawn between Madeleine and [[Joan of Arc]]—both teenaged virgins who dressed as males—and to [[Jeanne Hachette]], who led the defense of [[Beauvais]].  Parallels have also been seen with Madeleine's contemporary [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]], the hero of the [[Battle of Long Sault]] during the Beaver Wars.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=32}}

Verchères's story was mostly forgotten following her death.  It was revived after the discovery of her in the 1860s, and from the 1880s to the 1920s she achieved the status of a symbol of French-Canadian nationalism.{{sfn|Coates|Morgan|2002|p=41}}  In the wake of the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], [[Marie-Victorin Kirouac]] wrote a play, ''Peuple sans histoire'' (''"A people without history"'', 1918).  In it an indignant young French-Canadian servant to [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]], upon reading a report of Durham's following the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] of 1837 in which he declares the French Canadians have no history, appends to it "Thou liest, Durham!" and signs it Madeleine de Verchères.  The story he hears from her of Verchères convinces him to give credence to the French Canadians and compares the story to "a canto of the [[Iliad]]".{{sfn|Coates|Morgan|2002|pp=41–42}}

Later authors used the story of Madeleine for nationalistic ends.  To rally support for the [[Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire]], [[Arthur Doughty]]'s account of 1916 makes parallels between the Germans in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] and the Iroquois who stood in the way of "the advance of European civilization".{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=35}}

While heroes such as Dollard had had monuments erected to their memories, by the early 20th century that there was no such monument to Madeleine de Verchères came to public notice.  Baillairgé raised funds for such a monument to commemorate Verchères and its heroine, and by July 1912 had raised $2000.  Other efforts led to the federal government donating $25,000, and the wife of the mayor of Verchères unveiled the statue in a ceremony on 20 September 1913.  Amongst the speeches delivered, prime minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] declared, "If the kingdom of France was delivered and regenerated by Joan of Arc, this colony, then French in its cradle, was illustrated by Madeleine de Verchères".{{sfn|Coates|2012|pp=37–38}}

The stories of Madeleine de Verchères and [[Laura Secord]] in [[Upper Canada]] have served as nationalist stories for French and English Canadians.  Both were heroines in early Canadian settlements defending themselves from enemy forces—though where the enemy was the Iroquois to Madeleine, in Secord's story they were allies who helped her escape the Americans to inform the British of a pending attack.{{sfn|Coates|Morgan|2002|p=257}}  The motivations of the Iroquois are not made clear in contemporary documents.{{sfn|Coates|Morgan|2002|p=258}}

==Early years==
He was born on January 9, 1955 in [[Arriana]] village of [[Rhodope (regional unit)|Rhodope]] to Ali and his wife Fatma, a family from the [[Turks of Western Thrace|Turkish minority in Greece]]. Müezzinoğlu went to [[Istanbul]] for his high school education. He studied in an [[İmam Hatip school]], where he met [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], who was his classmate.&lt;ref name="eo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eskisohbet.com/mehmet-muezzinoglu-kimdir.html |newspaper=eskiSohbet |title=Mehmet Müezzinoğlu Kimdir |date=2014-10-09 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2014-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011092155/http://www.eskisohbet.com/mehmet-muezzinoglu-kimdir.html |archivedate=2014-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tbmm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/develop/owa/milletvekillerimiz_sd.bilgi?p_donem=24&amp;p_sicil=6491 |publisher=TBMM |title=Mehmet Müezzinoğlu |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Müezzinoğlu immigrated from Greece illegally by crossing the river [[Maritsa]] ({{lang-tr|Meriç}}). Before acquiring Turkish citizenship in 1986, he lived in Turkey as a [[statelessness|heimatlos]] between 1983 and 1986.&lt;ref name="eo"/&gt;

==Politics==
Müezzinoğlu became a member of the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Welfare Party]] ({{lang-tr|Refah Partisi}}, RP) in 1992, where he helped to make policy alongside Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Between 2002 and 2007, he served as the chairman of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]]'s Istanbul Province organization.&lt;ref name="eo"/&gt;

==During the 2013 protests==
During the [[2013 protests in Turkey]], several makeshift infirmaries were erected to treat victims of the violence. The injuries included trauma from plastic bullets and teargas canisters. In response to this, Müezzinoğlu declared that "[t]he infirmaries around the protest areas are illegal. This is ideologic and it's an execution violating the legal structure. There will be legal action taken against the medics working in those infirmaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/devlet-ve-siyaset/gezi-direnisine-destek-olan-saglik-calisanlarina-suc-duyurusu-haberi-74612 |newspaper=[[SoL (newspaper)|soL]] |title=Gezi direnişine destek olan sağlık çalışanlarına suç duyurusu |date=2013-06-13 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Melchior Lotter the Elder (1470-1549).jpg|thumb|Melchior Lotter the Elder]]
[[File:Lotterbibel.jpg|thumb|Bible printed by Lotter]]

'''Lotter''' was the last name of a family of [[Germany|German]] printers, intimately connected with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

The founder of the family was '''Melchior Lotter''', the elder, born at [[Aue]], and well-known at [[Leipzig]] as early as 1491. He published [[missal]]s, [[Breviary|breviaries]], a ''[[Aulus Persius Flaccus|Persius]]'' (1512), ''Horatii Epistol&amp;aelig;'' (1522), and ''Luther Tessaradecos Consolatoria pro Laborantibus'' (1520). His relations with the Reformation are not perfectly clear, but he seems to have been a sympathizer.  An innovation by the elder Lotter was his use of [[Latin alphabet|Roman letters]] for [[Latin]], reserving the [[Gothic type]]s for [[German language|German]].

His son was also named Melchior (died c. 1542), which has resulted in some bibliographical confusion. '''Melchior''', the younger, is best known for printing [[Martin Luther]]'s Bible, ''[[Luther Bible|Das Neue Testament]]'' (1522), and the impressions of 1523 and 1524 of the [[Old Testament]], which was transferred afterward to [[Hans Lufft]].  He published many other German writings of Luther.  Only a little less important was his bringing a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Typeface|font]] to [[Wittenberg]], thus giving [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] the means to carry on classes in Greek.  When he returned to Leipzig, about 1525, Lotter carried on his father's business.

[[Image:Magomayevsr.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Muslim Magomayev (grandfather)]]

'''Muslim Mahammad oglu Magomayev''' ({{lang-az|Müslüm Maqomayev}}) (18 September 1885 in [[Grozny]]&lt;ref name="bse"&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://m.slovari.yandex.ru/article.xml?book=bse&amp;title=%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2%20%D0%90%D0%B1%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BB%20%D0%9C%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BC%20%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 Магомаев Абдул Муслим Магометович] — article from [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia|GSE]]&lt;/ref&gt; – 28 July 1937 in [[Nalchik]]) was an [[Azerbaijan]]i, [[Chechnya|Chechen]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[composer]] and [[conducting|conductor]]. He is the grandfather and a namesake of Azerbaijani opera singer [[Muslim Magomayev (musician)|Muslim Magomayev]].

==Early life==
He was born Abdulmuslim Magomayev into a family of a blacksmith on the same day another prominent Azerbaijani composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]] was born.&lt;ref name="uzhaj"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://uzeyirbook.musigi-dunya.az/uzeyir/ru/article21.html Muslim Magomayev] by Uzeyir Hajibeyov. ''Bakinski Rabochi'' newspaper. 28 July 1938. Retrieved 1 January 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011152315/http://uzeyirbook.musigi-dunya.az/uzeyir/ru/article21.html |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had studied at a primary school in Grozny before being admitted to the [[Gori Pedagogical Seminary]] (in present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) in 1900. There Magomayev developed passion for music and conducting. That was also where he first met Uzeyir Hajibeyov, then his fellow student. However Magomayev found musical career financially unpromising and decided to focus on teaching. In 1905, he acquired his teaching certificate at the Tiflis Teachers' College and was appointed a teacher to the village of Bekovichi (now Kizlyar, [[Republic of North Ossetia–Alania]]). In 1906, he was voluntarily reappointed to [[Lankaran]] (present-day [[Azerbaijan]]). In 1911, he received a license that allowed him to teach in [[high school]]s and moved to a [[Baku]] suburb, [[Sabunçu, Baku|Sabunchu]]. While teaching at a school he took up music and conducting once again.&lt;ref name="uzhaj"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1916, Magomayev wrote his first opera entitled ''[[Shah Ismayil (opera)|Shah Ismayil]]'' based on the homonymous [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]] folk epic. Unlike other early Azeri operas, ''Shah Ismayil'' was less focused on the ethnic musical component and embodied European opera styles.&lt;ref name="uzhaj"/&gt; Magomayev's most major work was ''[[Nargiz (opera)|Nargiz]]''. Written in 1935, this successful propaganda opera depicts Azerbaijani [[communism|communists]] in their fight against the short-lived [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. Overall, Magomayev was the author of 15 musical compositions, mostly [[rhapsody (music)|rhapsodies]]. In 1927, together with Hajibeyov, he published '' The Collection of Azerbaijani Folk Songs''; a book where over 300 pieces of folk music had been documented in notes.&lt;ref name="uzhaj"/&gt;  In 1935 Muslum Magomayev was selected Honoured Arts worker of Azerbaijan SSR.

==Personal life==
In 1905, Magomayev married Baydigul Jamal Teregulova (whose younger sister Maleyka later married Uzeyir Hajibeyov making the two composers relatives) and fathered two sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.magomaev.info/book/02.htm Childhood Motives] by Muslim Magomayev (Magomayev's grandson). ''Magomaev.ru''. Retrieved 1 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1937, he died of [[tuberculosis]] while visiting [[Nalchik]] ([[Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Russia]]) and was buried in Baku. The [[Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall|Magomayev Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Society]] is named after Muslim Magomayev.

==“Shah Ismail” opera==
Muslum Magomayev’s “Shah Ismail” opera has been composed in 1916. The mugham opera composed in 1915-1916 is consist of 6 acts and 7 scenes. Libretto and text were written by composer Mirza Gadir Ismailzade.
The premiere of the opera was held on March 7, 1919 in Baku, with a benefit performance of Huseyngulu Sarabski. Muslim Magomayev was conductor and Huseyn Arablinski was director of the opera. Actors were: H.Sarabski - Shah Ismail, M.H.Teregulov - Aslan Shah and Huseynagha Hajibababeyov – Gulzar.

== “Nargiz” opera ==
”Nargiz ”– is the second opera by Muslim Magomayev, Azerbaijani composer and Honored Art Worker of the Azerbaijan SSR, written in 1935. [[Mammed Said Ordubadi]] is the author of a libretto to the opera. It is considered the most significant composition of Muslim Magomayev. Music of the opera consists of folk songs of Azerbaijan. In 1938, the opera was shown during the Decade of Azerbaijani Arts in Moscow, with the editorship of Reinhold Glière. It is also noted that, the opera narrates about a struggle of Azerbaijani peasants for the Soviet Power. “Nargiz” is the first Azerbaijani opera on a modern theme.

{{SpecialChars}}
The '''Greeks''' ({{lang-el|Έλληνες}}) have been identified by many [[ethnonym]]s.  The most common native ethnonym is "Hellen" ({{lang|grc|Ἕλλην}}), pl. [[Hellenes]] ({{lang|grc|Ἕλληνες}}); the name "Greeks" ([[Latin]]: ''Graeci'') was used by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] and gradually entered the [[European languages]] through its use in Latin.  The mythological patriarch ''[[Hellen]]'' is the named progenitor of the Greek peoples; his descendants the [[Aeolians]], [[Dorians]], [[Achaeans (tribe) | Achaeans]] and [[Ionians]] correspond to the main Greek tribes and to the main dialects spoken in Greece and [[Asia Minor]] ([[Anatolia]]).  Among his descendants are also mentioned the [[Graecians|Graeci]] and the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makedones]].

The first [[Greek (language)|Greek-speaking]] people, called [[Mycenean Greece|Myceneans]] or Mycenean-Achaeans by historians, entered present-day [[Greece]] sometime in the Neolithic era or the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Homer]] refers to ''[[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]'' as the dominant [[tribe]] during the [[Trojan war]] period usually dated to the 12th–11th centuries BC,&lt;ref&gt;C. Mossé. (1984). ''La Grèce archaïque d'Homère à Eschyle''. Editions du Seuil. Paris. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC, often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 1194–1184 BC, which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa.[4]&lt;/ref&gt; using "''Hellenes''" to describe a relatively small tribe in [[Thessaly]].  The [[Dorians]], an important Greek-speaking group appeared roughly at that time. According to the Greek tradition, the "Graeci" ("Greeks", {{lang|grc|Γραικοί}}, ''Graikoi'') were renamed "Hellenes" probably with the establishment of the [[Amphictyonic League|Great Amphictyonic League]] after the Trojan war.

When the Romans first encountered Greek colonists in southern [[Italy]], they used the name Graeci for the colonists and then for all Greeks; this became the root of all relevant terms in [[Europe]]an languages.  The [[Persia]]ns used the name ''[[Ionia (satrapy)|Yaunas]]''{{fact|date=October 2016}} (''Yunans'') after the [[Ionians]], a Greek tribe who colonized part of the coasts of western [[Asia Minor]]. The term was used later in [[Hebrew]] (''Yevanim'', {{lang|he|יוונים}}), [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and also by the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]. The word entered the languages of the Indian subcontinent as the ''[[Yona]]''.  A unique form is used in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], where the Greeks are called ''[[Saberdzneti|Berdzeni]]'' (ბერძენი).

By [[Late Antiquity]] (c. 3rd–7th century CE), the Greeks referred to themselves as ''Graikoi'' ({{lang|grc|Γραικοί}}, "Greeks") and ''[[Rhomaioi]]''/''Romioi'' ({{lang|el|{{lang|grc|Ῥωμαῖοι}}}}/{{lang|el|Ῥωμηοί}}/{{lang|el|Ρωμιοί}}, "Romans") the latter of which was used since virtually all [[Roman Greece|Greeks were Roman citizens]] after 212 CE. The term "Hellene" became applied to the followers of the [[Ancient Greek religion|polytheistic]] ("[[Paganism|pagan]]") religion after the establishment of [[Christianity]] by [[Theodosius I]].

==Brief history==
The first people speaking an ancient [[Proto-Greek language]] entered mainland Greece during the Neolithic period or the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;A comprehensive overview in Hooker, J.T., ''Mycenean Greece'', (1976, 2014&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), especially Chapter 2, "Before the Mycenenan Age", pp. 11–33 and passim; for a different hypothesis excluding massive migrations and favoring an autochthonous scenario see, Renfrew, C. "Problems in the General Correlation of Archaeological and Linguistic Strata in Prehistoric Greece: The Authochous origin" in Crossland, R.A. &amp; Birchall, A. (eds.), ''Bronze age Migrations'' (1974), pp. 263–275, especially p.  267.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Ancient Greek dialects]] as they presented themselves centuries later, it seems that at least two migrations of Greeks followed, the first of the Ionians and the Aeolians probably in the 19th century BC and the second of the Dorians probably in the 13th century BC. The first migration resulted in [[Mycenean Greek]], an archaic Greek language which appears in [[Linear B]] syllabic inscriptions and the second resulted in the Dorian dialect which displaced the [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot dialect]] that seems to be closest to the Mycenean Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chadwick |first=John |authorlink=John Chadwick |title=The Mycenaean world  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;dq |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1976 |pages=1–3 |isbn=0-521-29037-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks later called the [[autochthon (person)|autochthon]]ous or Proto-Greek speaking people by the names:
*[[Pelasgians]] who have uncertain origins and lived mainly in [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus]],
*[[Eteocretan language|Eteocretans]] who lived in [[Crete]] (descendants of the ancient [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]]) and
*[[Minyans]] who lived in [[Boeotia]].

The tribes later called Aeolians and Ionians established several feudal kingdoms around Greece, and the historians called them [[Myceneans]] after their most powerful kingdom [[Mycenea]] in [[Peloponnese]], or [[Myceneans]]-[[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] because in [[Homer]] the ''Achaeans'' were the dominating tribe in Greece and the name ''Achiyawa'' that appears in [[Hittites|Hittite]] texts seems to correspond to a thalassocratic country which might be ''Mycenea''.&lt;ref name="O.R.Gurney 1975 p.15"&gt;O.R.Gurney (1975). ''The Hittites''. Oxford University Press. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Homer refers to a union of the Greek kingdoms under the leadership of the king of ''Mycenae'' during the [[Trojan War]], there is no evidence that these kingdoms were dominated by a central power. Most of the Mycenean palaces were destroyed at the end of the 13th century BC. The Greek tradition relates this destruction to the Dorians, but it is suggested that the [[Dorian invasion]] was only one of the causes of the Bronze Age collapse in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]], as there is no evidence that the newcomers established a different civilization.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mossé. (1984). ''La Grèce archaïque d'Homère à Eschyle''. Editions du Seuil. Paris, pp. 16, 18&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction was followed by the [[Greek Dark Ages]] with very poor archaeological findings, when most occupied areas were deserted, but some areas like [[Attica]] occupied by the ''Ionians'' remained untouched by the invaders. Several Greek tribes moved to regions of Greece where they acquired different names, and population groups moved through the islands to the western coasts of Asia Minor where they kept their native names ''Aeolians'', ''Ionians'' and ''Dorians''.

It seems that the myth of [[Hellen]], the patriarch of ''Hellenes'' was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other, and stressed their common origin. The name "Hellenes" was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League, an ancient association of Greek tribes. According to legend it was founded after the Trojan War, by the eponymous [[Amphictyon]], brother of Hellen. It had twelve founders and was organized to protect the great temples of [[Apollo]] in [[Delphi]] ([[Phocis]]) and of [[Demeter]] near [[Thermopylae]] ([[Locris]]). The twelve founders enumerated by [[Aeschines]]&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, ii (''On the embassy''). 115; see also [[Strabo]], ix.3.7, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], x.8.2–5.&lt;/ref&gt; were the [[Aenianes]] or [[Oetaeans]] (Αἰνιᾶνες, Οἰταῖοι), the [[Boeotians]] (Βοιωτοί) of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], the [[Dolopes]] (Δόλοπες), the Dorians (Δωριείς) of [[Sparta]], the Ionians (Ἴωνες) of [[Athens]], the [[Phthia]]n Achaeans (Ἀχαιοί), the [[Locrians]] (Λοκροί) (''Opuntians'', Ὀπούντιοι and ''Ozolians'', Ὀζολαί), the [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]]ns (Μάγνητες), the [[Malians (Greek tribe)|Malians]] (Μαλιεῖς), the [[Perrhaebians]] (Περραιβοί), the [[Phocians]] (Φωκεῖς), the [[Pythia]]ns (Πύθιοι) of Delphi, and the [[Thessalians]] (Θεσσαλοί). Among the descendants of ''Hellen'' are mentioned [[Aeolus]], [[Ion]], [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]], [[Dorus]], [[Graecus|Graecos]] and [[Ancient Macedonians|Makedon]]. It seems that the Macedonians were a ''Dorian'' tribe which stayed behind in Macedonia when the main Dorian tribes moved to the south.

==Achaeans (Ἀχαιοί)==
{{Main|Achaeans (Homer)}}
The Greek cultural tradition has been continuous for centuries; it has always been centered on those who were wealthy and literate enough to have produced literature and have it preserved. They have defined the Greeks as those being in some ways similar to themselves, by descent, speech, culture, or religion. In the earliest surviving literary prose, from the fifth century BC, there is a strong distinction marked between the Greeks (who are called ''Hellenes'') and the rest of humankind; exactly who falls within this wall varies, depending on the century, the observer, and the purpose.

The evidence from before this period, such as it is, shows much less trace of any hard distinction between Greeks and the rest of humanity. The surviving samples of [[Linear B]] are inventory records, and do not discuss ethnicity; [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' is one great genealogical tree, including gods, men, and monsters; Persians, Latins, and Etruscans.

In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', the Greek allied forces are described under three different [[list of traditional Greek place names|names]], often used interchangeably: [[Argives]] (in Greek: ''Argeioi'', Ἀργεῖοι; used 29 times in the ''Iliad''), [[Danaans]] (Δαναοί, used 138 times) and Achaeans (Ἀχαιοί, used 598 times).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Cartledge]], "Ancient Greece: A Very Short Introduction", Oxford University Press, 2011, p.23: "The late Bronze Age in Greece is also called conventionally 'Mycenaean', as we saw in the last chapter. But it might in principle have been called 'Argive', 'Achaean', or 'Danaan', since the three names that Homer does in fact apply to Greeks collectively were 'Argives', 'Achaeans', and 'Danaans'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''Iliad'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+2.155&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134 2.155–175], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.%20Il.%204.8&amp;lang=original 4.8]; ''Odyssey'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.%20Od.%208.578&amp;lang=original 8.578], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+4.6&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0218 4.6].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Excluding his [[Catalogue of Ships]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Argives'' is an annotation drawn from the most prominent city of the Achaeans,{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} [[Argos]]). ''Danaos'' is the name attributed to a Greek mythological character, twin brother of [[Aegyptus]] and son of [[Achiroe]] and [[Belus (Egyptian)|Belus]].

==Hellenes (Ἕλληνες)==
{{anchor|Hellenes}}
[[File:Dodona location.svg|thumb|left|300px|The main Greek sanctuaries and localization of the [[sanctuary]] of Dodona.]]

There is currently no satisfactory etymology for the name ''Hellenes''. Some scholars assert that the name of the priests of [[Zeus]] in [[Dodona]], ''[[Selloi]]'' (Σελλοί; also Ἑλλοί ''Helloi''), changed to ''Sellanes'' (by analogy with [[Acarnania|''Akarnanes'']]) and then to ''Hellanes'' and ''Hellenes''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Beekes]]: entry 6701: ''Selloi''. [http://www.ieed.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=\data\ie\greek+&amp;first=6701 Greek Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is based on [[Aristotle]]'s comments in ''[[Meteorologica]]'' where he places archaic Hellas in [[Epirus]] between Dodona and the [[Achelous]] river, where in his opinion the great deluge of [[Deucalion]] must have occurred. The land was inhabited by Selloi and Graeci, who later came to be known as ''Hellenes''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Meteorologica]]'', I, 352b.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Graeci'' (''Graikoi'') was a native name of a [[Dorians|Dorian]] tribe in Epirus which was used by the [[Illyrians]].&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Greek|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=10 June 2012|author=Douglas Harper|year=2001–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] mentions that the ''Selloi'' were the prophets of Zeus at Dodona, but he is referring to Zeus of Dodona as god of the [[Pelasgians]] who belonged to a Pre-Dorian population.&lt;ref&gt;Homer writes of [[Achilles]] praying to the Dodonian [[Zeus]]: '"King Zeus", he cried, "lord of Dodona, god of the [[Pelasgians|Pelasgi]], who dwellest afar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your sway, where your prophets the Selloi dwell around you with their feet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground"': Homer, ''[[Iliad]]'', book 16, 233–235.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the extension of a particular cult of Zeus in Dodona (a tendency among the Greeks to form ever-larger cultic communities or [[amphictiony|amphictionies]]) caused the name to further extend to the rest of the peninsula.

This theory connects the name ''Hellenes'' with the [[Dorians]] (and the substrate of Pelasgians) who occupied Epirus in the extreme north of Greece, rendering uncertain the relation with the name ''Graeci'' used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Some toponyms, especially an ancient city ''Hellas'' in southern [[Thessaly]], and the Greek tradition seem to indicate that the name ''Hellenes'' was Pre-Dorian itself and that the homeland of the ''Graikoi'', who were later called ''Hellenes'', was in [[central Greece]]. The Greek tradition mentions an earlier deluge of [[Ogyges]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ogyges]] or ''Ogenos'', i.&amp;nbsp;e. the mythical [[Okeanos]], the great river that was believed to surround the Earth (perhaps derived from a [[Phoenicia]]n root, "to encircle").&lt;/ref&gt; in the region of [[Boeotia]] which was occupied by the [[Minyans]] a group of autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. The region was called [[Graïke]] in ancient times probably after the old city of [[Graea]] (Γραῖα ''Graîa'', from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] ''grau-j-'', "old lady") on the coast.

Homer refers to ''Hellenes'' as an originally relatively small tribe settled in [[Thessaly|Thessalic]] [[Phthia]]. During the era of the [[Trojan War]] they were centered along the settlements of [[Alos, Greece|Alos]], [[Alope]], [[Trachis]], and the Pelasgian [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'', book 2, 681–685.&lt;/ref&gt; This Homeric ''Hellas'' is described as "καλλιγύναικος", ''kalligýnaikos'', "of beautiful women", and its warriors, the Hellenes, along with the feared [[Myrmidons]], were under the command of [[Achilles]]. The [[Parian Chronicle]] mentions that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks ({{lang|grc|Γραικοί}}).&lt;ref name="ashmolean.org"&gt;The Parian marble. Entry No. 6: "From when Hellen ({{lang|grc|Έλλην}}) [son of] Deuc[alion] became king of [Phthi]otis and those previously called ''Graikoi'' were named Hellenes" ([http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q004/q004008.html online text]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alcman]] (7th century BC) also refers that the mothers of ''Hellenes'' were ''Graikoi''. In [[Greek mythology]], [[Hellen]], the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of [[Deucalion]], who ruled around Phthia with [[Pyrrha]], the only survivors after the great deluge.&lt;ref name="Apollodorus"&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. The name ''Hellenes'' was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the [[Great Amphictyonic League]]. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of [[Apollo]] in Delphi ([[Phocis]]) and of [[Demeter]] near [[Thermopylae]] ([[Locris]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschines]] ii.''On the embassy'' 115. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.2–5&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend it was founded after the Trojan War, by the eponymous [[Amphictyon]], brother of [[Hellen]].

==Greeks (Γραικοί)==
{{anchor|Greeks}}{{wiktionary|Greek|Γραικός}}
{{see|Graecians|Graecus|Graea}}
[[File:Soleto.jpg|thumb|[[Soleto]] is one of the nine [[Griko language|Greek]]-speaking towns in the province of [[Apulia]], Italy. Their inhabitants are descendants of the first wave of Greek settlers in Italy and [[Sicily]] in the 8th century BC. The dialect they speak evolved separately from [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic Greek]]. The people of these towns call themselves ''Grekos'', from the [[Latin]] ''Graecus''.]]
The modern English noun ''Greek'' ([[Old English]] ''Grecas'' or ''Crecas'') is derived from the [[Latin]] ''Graeci'', which in turn originates from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Γραικός}} (''Graikos''). It seems that the word is related with the Greek word {{lang|grc|γέρων}} ''geron'', "old man" (from the [[PIE]] base ''*ǵerh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'', "to grow old") via [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] ''*gera-'', "old age"—also related to [[Mycenean Greek]] ''kera'' /geras/, "gift of honour".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Beekes]]. ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'', entry 1531&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Germanic languages]] borrowed the name with an initial ''k'' sound, which was probably their initial sound closest to the Latin ''g'' (Goth. ''Kreks'').&lt;ref&gt;"Greek". ''Online Etymology Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle used the term ''Graikos'' related with ''Hellenes'' (''Meteorologica'' I xiv) and claimed that it was the name originally used by the [[Illyrians]] for the Dorians in [[Epirus]] from ''Graii'' native name of the people of Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;"Greek". ''Online Etymology Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; He places [[Ancient Greece|ancient Hellas]] in the region of [[Achelous]] river around [[Dodona]] where in his opinion the great deluge of [[Deucalion]] must have occurred. The priests of Zeus in Dodona were called ''Selloi'' which could lead to ''Sellanes'' (like ''Akarnanes'') and then to ''Hellanes''-''Hellenes''. However the toponyms and the Greek tradition indicate that it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece and that the name was probably Pre-Dorian. A Greek legend is referring to an older deluge of [[Ogyges]] in Boeotia, in the region occupied by the Minyans which are considered autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. The region outside of [[Attica]] including Boeotia was called [[Graïke]] and the word ''Ogyges'' related with [[ocean]]&lt;ref&gt;Ogyges may be related with the Greek [[Okeanos]] (Ὠκεανός, [[ocean]]), the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who personified the great world ocean/river, believed to surround the earth disc.—see Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&amp;pg=PA236 p. 236].&lt;/ref&gt; came to mean "from earliest days."&lt;ref&gt;The Greek word ''Ogygios'' (Ὠγύγιος), meaning ''Ogygian'', came to mean "primeval, primal," or "from earliest ages" and also "gigantic"—see [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=*)wgu/gios "Ὠγύγιος"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] is referring to ''Hellenes'' as a relative small tribe in [[Phthia]] in central Greece (''Achaea Pthiotis''). In the [[Parian Chronicle]] is mentioned that Phthia was the homeland of Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called ''Graikoi'' ({{lang|grc|Γραικοί}}).&lt;ref name="ashmolean.org"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], [[Hellen]], the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of [[Deucalion]] (who ruled around Phthia) and [[Pyrrha]], the only survivors after the great deluge.&lt;ref name="Apollodorus"/&gt; [[Hesiod]] is referring to [[Graecus]] son of [[Pandora]], who was sister of [[Hellen]]. [[Alcman]] mentions that the mothers of ''Hellenes'' were ''Graikoi''.

The German classical historian [[Georg Busolt]] (1850–1920) derives the name from ''Graikos'',"inhabitant of [[Graea]], a town on the coast of Boeotia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Greek.''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Graea'' (γραῖα) is derived from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] ''grau-j-'', "old lady".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Homer]], while reciting the Boeotian forces in the ''Iliad'''s [[Catalogue of Ships]], provides the first known reference to a region named [[Graea]],&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''"Iliad", II, 498''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the ancient city of [[Tanagra]] was for a time called Graea, adding that "no one knows where this Graia really was; Aristotle thought it was near [[Oropus]], further east on the same coast as [[Delion]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Periegesis'' book 5, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Busolt claimed that the name was given by the Romans originally to the Greek colonists from Graea who helped to found [[Cumae]] the important city in southern [[Italy]] where the Latins first encountered the Greeks and then to all Greeks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

According to Rene Olivier,&lt;ref&gt;Rene Olivier, Wörterbuch Französisch-Deutsch, 12. Edit., Leipzig, 1985, S.258, cited in [http://www.kathimerini.gr/893845/opinion/epikairothta/politikh/to-kairio-kai-diaforetiko]&lt;/ref&gt; in the French language the word ''grec'' (''Greek'') is sometimes also used as an [[ethnic slur]] meaning fraudster (in contrast with ''hellénique'' which has no negative connotations).

==Spread of the use of the term "Hellenes"==
''Hellenes'' in the wider meaning of the word appears in writing for the first time in an inscription by [[Echembrotus]], dedicated to [[Heracles]] for his victory in the [[Amphictyonic League|Amphictyonic]] Games,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[:el:s:Ελλάδος περιήγησις/Φωκικά, Λοκρών Οζόλων#p7.6|"Description of Greece", 10, 7, 6]]:&lt;br&gt;

"Fighting at the forefront of the Hellenes, the Athenians at Marathon..." 
&lt;ref&gt;Lycurgus, ''"Against Leocrates", speech 1, section 109''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and after the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], an inscription was written in Delphi celebrating victory over the [[Persia]]ns and calling [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]]  the leading general of the Hellenes.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''"Histories", I, 132''.&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness of a pan-Hellenic unity was promoted by religious festivals, most significantly in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], in which prospective initiates had to speak [[Greek language|Greek]], and almost as importantly through participation in the four [[Panhellenic Games]], including the Olympic Games, in which participants were recognized by tribal affiliation. Only Greek men were allowed to participate; the occasional exception in later times, such as that made for Emperor [[Nero]], was a sure sign of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] political hegemony.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==The tribal societies of the north==
The development of mythological genealogies of descent from [[eponym]]ous founder-figures, long after the actual southward migration of the four tribal groups recognized by the Greeks, affected how the identity of northern tribes was perceived. According to the most prevailing legend, [[Hellen]], son of [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]], received from the nymph [[Orseis]] three sons, [[Aeolus]], [[Dorus]], and [[Xuthus]], each of whom founded a primary tribe of Hellas–the [[Aeolians]], [[Dorians]], [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]] and [[Ionians]].

At the time of the Trojan War, the Epirotes ([[Molossians]], [[Thesprotians]] and [[Chaonians]]) were not considered Hellenes, for the people so named were then limited to a small tribe in Thessaly of which Achilles was a member. After the name was extended to all peoples south of [[Mount Olympus]], however, it still left out those of common origin living in the north. One factor contributing to this was their non-participation in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]],&lt;ref&gt;The Macedonians were Persian subjects at this time but their King, Alexander I, secretly pursued a pro-Hellenic policy&amp;nbsp;— see Herodotus, ''"The Histories", Book IX, 45''.&lt;/ref&gt; which were considered a vital affair for all Hellenes; subsequent to the Persian Wars, representatives of these tribes were accepted in the Olympic Games and competed alongside other Hellenes.&lt;ref&gt;In respect to the kingdom of Macedon, participation was originally limited to the Argead kings such as Alexander I, Archelaus I and Philip II. From the age of Alexander I and onwards, participation of ordinary Macedonians in the Olympic Games became common.
&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that each of these northern peoples at this time continued to live as an ''[[Ethnic group|ethnos]]'', or collection of tribes, under an archaic [[monarchy|monarchial]] political system&amp;nbsp;– as opposed to the [[democracy|democratic]] or [[oligarchic]] ''[[polis]]'' (city state) of the south–also contributed to this view of them as "barbaric".&lt;ref&gt;NGL Hammond, ''"A History of Greece to 322BC", Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1986''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thucydides]] calls the [[Acarnania]]ns, [[Aetolia]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''"History", II, 68, 5 and III, 97, 5''&lt;/ref&gt; Epirotes&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''"History", II, 68, 9 and II, 80, 5 and I, 47, 3''&lt;/ref&gt; and Upper Macedonians&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''"History", II, 80, 5''&lt;/ref&gt; [[barbarian]]s, but does so in a strictly linguistic sense&amp;nbsp;– these peoples were considered ''barbarophone'' to the extent that their dialects of Greek were sufficiently different and archaic so as to sound crude and barely understandable to a southern [[Attic Greek|Attic]] speaker such as Thucydides.&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in Chapter 5 of Jonathan Hall, ''"Hellenicity: Between Ethnicity and Culture", University of Chicago Press, 2002''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when the Athenian orator [[Demosthenes]] called [[Philip II of Macedon]] worse than a barbarian in his ''[[Philippic|Third Philippic]]'', he did so with respect to the culture they demonstrated as foreigners not adhering to proper Hellenic standards, and did not raise the issue of their origin: "''not only no Greek, nor related to the Greeks, but not even a barbarian from any place that can be named with honors, but a pestilent knave from Macedonia, whence it was never yet possible to buy a decent slave''." [[Herodotus]], [[Polybius]], [[Strabo]] and a large number of other Greek and Roman writers regard the tribes of [[West Greece|western Hellas]], Epirus, and Macedonia as Hellenic in every respect.&lt;ref&gt;J. Juthner, ''"Hellenen and Barbaren", Leipzig, 1928, p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; Both Thucydides and Demosthenes were themselves of partial non-Attic origins and for Demosthenes it seems of non-Greek origins altogether while notably both of them held strong opposing political positions against Macedonians.

==Hellenes and barbarians==
In the following centuries, ''Hellene'' typically contrasted with ''[[barbarian]]'', representing the uncivilized.

The Greek tribes quickly noticed that they did not speak the same tongue as their neighbors, and used the term "βάρβαρος" ("barbarian") for them, with the meanings "uncultured", "uncivilized" or "speaker of a foreign language". The term βάρβαρος is thought to be [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] in origin: "bar-bar"—i.e. [[stuttering|stammering]]—may have been how the speech of foreign peoples sounded to Greek speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, 1989, "barbarous" (entry)&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the case for the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], who, according to [[Herodotus]], "named barbarians all those who spoke a different tongue",&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, ''"History", 9, 38, 5; see also'' Strabo, ''"Geographica", 7, 7, 4; see also'' Herodotus, ''"Histories", book I, 56 and book VI, 127 and book VIII, 43''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''"Histories", book II, 158''&lt;/ref&gt; and in later years for the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], who gave the [[Germans]] the name ''němec'', which means "mute", while calling themselves ''slověnski'' or "people of the word". In his play ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'', [[Aristophanes]] calls the illiterate supervisor a "barbarian" who nevertheless taught the birds how to talk.&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''"The Birds", 199''&lt;/ref&gt; The term eventually picked up a derogatory use and was extended to indicate the entire lifestyle of foreigners, and finally coming to mean "illiterate" or "uncivilized" in general. Thus "an illiterate man is also a barbarian".&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''"The Clouds", 492''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a Hellene differed from a barbarian in four ways: refined language, education, religion, and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''"Roman Archaeology", 1, 89, 4''&lt;/ref&gt; Greek education became identified with noble upbringing. [[Paul of Tarsus]] considered it his obligation to preach the [[Gospel]] to all men, "Hellenes and barbarians, both wise and foolish".&lt;ref&gt;Saint Paul, ''"Epistle to the Romans", 1, 14''&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination between Hellenes and barbarians lasted until the 4th century BC. [[Euripides]] thought it plausible that Hellenes should rule over barbarians, because the first were destined for [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and the other for [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;Euripides, ''"Iphigeneia at Aulis", 1400''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] came to the conclusion that "the nature of a barbarian and a slave is one and the same".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''"Republic", I, 5''&lt;/ref&gt; Racial differentiation faded away through the teachings of [[Stoics]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, who distinguished between nature and convention and taught that all men have equal claim before the gods and thus by nature cannot be unequal to each other. With time and at least in some cases, ''Hellene'', to use the words of [[Isocrates]], became a trait of intellect, not race.

[[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests consolidated Greek influence in the East by exporting Greek culture into Asia and permanently transformed education and society in the region. [[Isocrates]] declared in his speech ''Panegyricus'', speaking about Athens and Greece: "And so far has our city distanced the rest of mankind in thought and in speech that her pupils have become the teachers of the rest of the world;  and she has brought it about that the name Hellenes suggests no longer a race but an intelligence, and that the title Hellenes is applied rather to those who share our culture than to those who share a common blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Panegyricus|chapterurl=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0144%3Aspeech%3D4%3Asection%3D50|author=Isocrates|last2=Norlin|first2=George (translator)|chapter=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a small reformation, the [[Hellenistic civilization]] is the evolution of classical Greek civilization into a civilization with global proportions, this time open to everybody. Similarly, "Hellene" evolved from a national name signifying an [[ethnic]] Greek to a cultural term signifying anybody who conducted his life according to Greek [[mores]].

=={{anchor|Ionians}}Ionians (Ἴωνες), Yunani, and Yavan (יָוָן)==
{{Main|Yona}}
A wholly different term came to establish itself in the [[Eastern world|East]]. The ancient people of the Middle East referred to the Hellenes as ''Yunan'', deriving from [[Old Persian language|Persian]] ''Yauna''{{fact|date=October 2016}}, itself a loan of [[Greek language|Greek]] Ιωνία ([[Ionia]]), the western coast of [[Asia Minor]]. It is by affiliation with the Ionian tribe the [[Persia]]ns conquered in the late 6th century BC that their name extended to all Hellenes. All peoples under Persian influence adopted the term, and it is from this root that [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Yona|Yavana]]'' derives, which one encounters in ancient Sanskrit sources, first attested in [[Pāṇini|Pāṇini's]] grammar, and later referring, together with [[Pāli|Pali]] ''[[Yona]]'', ''Yonaka'' to the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greeks]]. The term ''Yunan''  is used in current [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ({{lang|ar|يوناني}}), [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hindi]] (यूनान), [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]].

The related [[Hebrew]] name, ''Yavan'' or ''Javan'' ({{lang|he|יָוָן}}), was used to refer to the Greek nation in the Eastern Mediterranean in early [[Biblical]] times. There was an eponymous character [[Javan]] mentioned in ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' 10:2. In later times it was used for all [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms (for example, the [[Maccabean]]s applied it to their [[Seleucid]] foes). "Yavan" is still the name used for modern Greece in contemporary [[Israel]].

Although the contemporary [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term for Greece (希臘 ''Xīlà'') is based on ''Hellas'', Chinese previously used what was likely a version of the ''Yunan'' or ''Yona'' root when referring to the [[Dayuan|Dàyuān]] (大宛).  The Dàyuān were probably the descendants of the Greek colonies that were established by [[Alexander the Great]] and prospered within the Hellenistic realm of the [[Seleucids]] and [[Greco-Bactrians]], until they were isolated by the migrations of the [[Yueh-Chih]] around 160 BC. It has been suggested that the name ''Yuan'' was simply a transliteration of the words ''Yunan'', ''Yona'', or Ionians, so that Dàyuān (literally "Great Yuan") would mean "Great Yunans" or "Great Ionians."

==Hellene comes to mean "pagan"&lt;!--'Hellenes (religion)' redirects here--&gt;==
{{See also|Hellenistic religion}}

The name ''Hellene'' was given the meaning "pagan" by the [[early Christian]] church, and retained that meaning until the end of the millennium. It is believed that contact with Christian [[Jews]] led some [[Christians]] to use ''Hellene'' as a means of religious differentiation. Jews, like [[Greeks]], distinguished themselves from foreigners, but unlike Greeks, did so according to religious rather than cultural standards.

Roman domination of the Greek world enhanced the prestige of the religious institutions that remained intact. Early Christians differentiated people according to religion, so the sense of the word ''Hellene'' as a cultural attribute became marginalized and then supplanted by its religious element. Eventually, Christians came to refer to all pagans as ''Hellenes''.

[[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] in his Epistles uses ''Hellene'' almost always juxtaposed to ''Hebrew'', and in disregard of all other ethnicities (Romans, Syrians, Egyptians, etc.) living in the area at the time. The aim was probably to represent the aggregate of the [[polytheistic]] and the [[monotheistic]] religious communities, who respectively believed in many gods or one god.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Paul, ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', 13:48, 15:3 and 7:12, ''[[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]]'' 3:28&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hellene'' is used in a religious sense for the first time in the [[New Testament]]. In the ''[[Gospel of Mark]]'' 7:26, a woman arrives before [[Jesus]] kneeling before Him: "The woman was a Hellene, a Syrophœnician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter."&lt;ref&gt;New Testament, ''Gospel of Mark'', 7, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Since the nationality or ethnicity of the woman is stated to be Syrophœnician, "Greek" (translated as such into the English of the [[King James Version]], but as ''haiþno'' "{{linktext|heathen}}" in [[Ulfilas]]'s [[Gothic language|Gothic]]; [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]] and [[Myles Coverdale|Coverdale]] likewise have ''heathen'') must therefore signify her polytheistic religion. A broadly similar terminology is found in [[Gospel of John|John]] 12:20–23: "And there were certain Hellenes among them that came up to worship at the feast ... Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified". This could have one of two interpretations: either that Jesus meant that the time had come for his religion to spread to the ''pagans'' (in which case the term "Hellenes" is religious), or that it would spread by using the ''[[Greek language]]'' (in which case the term "Hellenes" is meant to be linguistic).  The development towards a purely religious meaning was slow, and complete by approximately the 2nd or 3rd century AD: Athenian statesman [[Apology of Aristides|Aristeides]], in his written Apology to the Emperor [[Hadrian]], picked out the ''Hellenes'' as one of the representative pagan peoples of the world along with the Egyptians and the [[Chaldea|Chaldæans]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristides, ''Apology''&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Clement of Alexandria]] reports an unknown Christian writer who named all of the above ''Hellenes'' and spoke of two old nations and one new: the Christian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Miscellanies'', 6, 5, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books written at this time demonstrate quite clearly the [[semantic]] shift. Perhaps the first was [[Tatian]]'s ''Address to the Greeks'', completed in AD 170, where Tatian criticizes pagan beliefs in order to defend Christian ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;!--for the use of ''Hellene'' as not meaning Greek--&gt; Most important of the later works was [[Athanasius]]' ''Against Hellenes'', originally titled ''Against the Gentiles'' (Greek ''ethnikoi'') according to older manuscripts. It was changed by a later writer at a time when ''Hellene'' had lost its ancient meaning entirely.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} From then on, ''Hellene'' no longer meant an ethnic Greek or an adherent to Greek culture, but pagans in general, regardless of race. Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian's]] attempt to restore paganism failed, and according to [[Pope Gregory I]], "matters moved in favor of Christianity and the position of the Hellenes was severely aggravated".&lt;ref&gt;Pope Gregory, ''Against Julian'', 1, 88&lt;/ref&gt; Half a century later Christians protested against the [[Eparchy|Eparch]] of [[Alexandria]], whom they accused of being a Hellene.&lt;ref&gt;Suda dictionary, entry τ (t)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodosius I]] initiated the first ''legal'' steps against paganism, but it was [[Justinian I|Justinian's]] legal reforms that triggered pagan persecutions on a massive scale. The ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' contained two statutes which decreed the total destruction of ''Hellenism'', even in civic life, and were zealously enforced even against men in high position. The official suppression of paganism made non-Christians a public threat, which further derogated the meaning of ''Hellene''. Paradoxically, [[Tribonian]], Justinian's own legal commissioner, according to the ''[[Suda]]'' dictionary, was a ''Hellene'' (pagan).&lt;ref&gt;Socrates, ''"Ecclesiastical History", 7, 14''&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Hellene meaning "pagan" has persisted into modern times. Many groups advocating a revival or reconstruction of the worship of the Olympian Gods call themselves Hellenic Polytheists and the religion Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism or [[Hellenismos]]. Such groups outside of Greece are careful not to imply that, by calling themselves Hellenes, they consider themselves Greek nationals.

==Macedonians (Μακεδόνες)==
The name "Macedonians", in order to colloquially mean the Greek soldiers (etc) that [[Alexander the Great]] was first the [[hegemon]] of, is being used by -at least- contemporary sources when referring to the [[Hellenistic period]], as the [[ancient Macedonian army]], including the famous [[somatophylakes]] (eg [[Lysimachus]]) and, later, the [[diadochi]] &lt;ref&gt;Eg Nearchus, who was from Crete, became a satrap of Lycia and Pamphylia. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nearchus &lt;/ref&gt; of Alexander, consisted of warriors from numerous and diverse [[Greek tribes]]. Thus, as the [[Spartans]] (Lacedaemonians) did not take part in Alexander's campaign, Alexander once ordered for an inscription to be sent, along with some war spoils, to Athens saying "Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the [[Lacedaemonians]] [...]" &lt;ref&gt;Arrian. Anabasis Alexandri, 2.7.4&lt;/ref&gt;. Likewise, the term "Macedonian", while referring here to Greek dialects, also ended up meaning the [[Koine Greek]] in classical sources &lt;ref&gt;C. Brixhe, A. Panayotou, 1994, «Le Macédonien» in Langues indo-européennes, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;, whereas diverse major Ancient Greek dialects were natively spoken in the later/expanded [[Macedonian Kingdom]], and even though the Koine dialect was mostly based on [[Attic Greek]] that was natively spoken around [[Athens]]. Notably, during of the reign of [[Constantine the Great]], who is regarded as the first [[Byzantine Emperor]], the [[Diocese of Macedonia]] was established, comprising principally the area that is modern [[Greece]], with [[Thessalonica]] as its capital.

==Romans (Ῥωμαῖοι)==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Roman]] and from various redirects --&gt;
{{anchor|Rhomaioi}}
[[File:Hieronymus wolf2.JPG|thumb|[[Hieronymus Wolf]] was a 16th-century German historian. After coming into contact with the works of [[Laonicus Chalcondyles]], he also went ahead with identifying [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historiography for the purpose of distinguishing medieval Greek from ancient Roman history.]]

Romans or ''Rhomaioi'' (Ῥωμαῖοι; sg. Ῥωμαῖος ''Rhomaios'') and ''Romioi'' (Ρωμιοί; sg. Ρωμιός ''Romios''), is the name by which the Greeks were known in the Middle Ages and during [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule]]. The name in antiquity originally signified the inhabitants of the city of Rome in Italy, but with the increasing grants of [[Roman citizenship]] to the Greeks and other nations of the Roman Empire, it soon lost its connection with the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]]. This process culminated in 212 AD, when Emperor Caracalla's ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' granted the citizenship to all free-born men of the Empire. Later Byzantine authors such as Nikephoros Basilakes,&lt;ref name="Basilaca1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicephorus Basilaca|title=Nicephori Basilacae orationes et epistolae|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0nZkIeqWz8C|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=1 January 1984|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-096405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Attaleiates]], [[Theodore Prodromos]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Germanus II of Constantinople|Germanus II]], [[Niketas Choniates]] and [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaean Emperor]] [[Theodore II Laskaris]] also used the classicizing term [[Ausones]] to refer to the people of the Eastern Roman Empire,&lt;ref name="Kaldellis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaldellis, Anthony|title=Hellenism in Byzantium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWs0Lh57NvwC|accessdate=26 February 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46842-8|pages=63, 374, 355, }}&lt;/ref&gt; although, as [[John Tzetzes]] points out (in his ''Scholia to [[Lycophron]]'s "Alexandra"'', attributed to himself and his brother Isaac), that should be understood in its proper context as a literary device.&lt;ref name="TzetzesTzetzes1811"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Isaac Tzetzes|author2=John Tzetzes|author3=Lycophron|author4=Christian Gottfried Müller|title=Isaakiou kai Iōannou tou Tzetzou Scholia eis Lykophrona|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AlGAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 February 2013|year=1811|publisher=Sumtibus F.C.G. Vogelii|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the word ''Rhomaios'' came to represent the hellenized inhabitants of the East Roman Empire. It is even used today (albeit extremely rarely), being the most popular{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} national name after Hellene.

Overall, the foreign borrowed name (Romans) initially had a more political than national meaning, which went hand in hand with the universalizing ideology of Rome that aspired to encompass all nations of the world under one true God. Up until the early 7th century, when the Empire still extended over large areas and many peoples, the use of the name "Roman" always indicated [[citizenship]] and never descent. Various ethnicities could apply their own [[ethnonyms]] or [[toponyms]] to disambiguate citizenship from genealogy, which is why the historian [[Procopius]] prefers to call the Byzantines as ''Hellenized Romans'',&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Gothic war'' III.1 &amp; ''Vandal war'', I.21&lt;/ref&gt; while other authors use ''Romhellenes'' and ''Graecoromans'',&lt;ref&gt;Lambru, ''Palaeologeia and Peloponnesiaka'', 3, 152&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to indicate descent and citizenship simultaneously. The [[Lombards|Lombard]] and [[Arab]] invasions in the same century resulted in the loss of most of the provinces including Italy and all of the Middle East, save for [[Anatolia]]. The areas that did remain were mostly Greek-speaking, thereby turning the empire into a much more cohesive unit that eventually developed a fairly self-conscious identity. Unlike in the previous centuries, there is a clear sense of [[nationalism]] reflected in [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] documents towards the end of the 1st millennium.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Byzantines' failure to protect the [[Pope]] from the [[Lombards]] forced the Pope to search for help elsewhere. The man who answered his call was [[Pepin II]] of [[Aquitaine]], whom he had named "Patrician", a title that caused a serious conflict. In 772, Rome ceased commemorating the emperor that first ruled from [[Constantinople]], and in 800 [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Roman Emperor by the Pope himself, officially rejecting the Eastern Roman Empire as true Romans. According to the [[Franks|Frankish]] interpretation of events, the [[papacy]] appropriately "transferred Roman imperial authority from the Greeks to the [[Germans]], in the name of His Greatness, Charles".&lt;ref&gt;Pope Innocent,  ''Decretalium'', ''Romanourm imperium in persona magnifici Caroli a Grecis transtuli in Germanos''.&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, a war of names about the [[New Rome]] revolved around Roman imperial rights. Unable to deny that an emperor did exist in Constantinople, they sufficed in renouncing him as a successor of Roman heritage on the grounds that [[Greeks]] have nothing to do with the Roman legacy. In 865, [[Pope Nicholas I]] wrote to the Emperor [[Michael III]]: "You ceased to be called 'Emperor of the Romans' since the Romans, of whom you claim to be Emperor, are in fact according to you barbarians."&lt;ref&gt;Epistola 86, of year 865, PL 119, 926&lt;/ref&gt;

Henceforth, the emperor in the East was known and referred to in the West as ''Emperor of the Greeks'' and their land as ''Greek Empire'', reserving both "Roman" titles for the Frankish king. The interests of both sides were nominal rather than actual. No land areas were ever claimed, but the insult the Byzantines took on the accusation demonstrates how close at heart the Roman name (Ῥωμαῖος) had become to them. In fact, Bishop [[Liutprand of Cremona]], a delegate of the Frankish court, was briefly imprisoned in Constantinople for not referring to the Roman emperor by his appropriate title,&lt;ref&gt;Liutprand, ''Antapodosis''&lt;/ref&gt; and in reprisal for his king, [[Otto I]], claiming the "Roman" title by styling himself as ''[[Holy Roman Emperor]]''.

==Revival in the meaning of "Hellene"==
[[File:Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 012.jpg|thumb|The Entry of the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] into [[Constantinople]], by [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1840. The sack of Constantinople in 1204 by the Crusaders acerbated [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]] nationalism and created disdain for the Latins which is well illustrated in the documents of the era. [[Nicetas Choniates]] portrays an especially lively account of the sack and its aftermath.]]

The secular use of ''Hellene'' revived in the 9th century, after paganism had been eclipsed and was no longer a threat to [[Christianity]]'s dominance. The revival followed the same track as its disappearance. The name had originally declined from a national term in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], to a cultural term in the Hellenistic years, to a religious term in the early [[Christian]] years. With the demise of paganism and the revival of learning in the [[Byzantine Empire]] it had regained its cultural meaning, and finally, by the 11th century it had returned to its ancient national form of an "ethnic Greek", synonymous at the time to "Roman".

Accounts from the 11th century onward (from Anna Komnena, Michael Psellos, John III Vatatzes, George Pletho Gemistos and several others) prove that the revival of the term Hellene (as a potential replacement for ethnic terms like Graekos and Romios) did occur. For example, Anna Komnena writes of her contemporaries as Hellenes, but does not use the word as a synonym for a pagan worshipper. Moreover, Anna boasts about her Hellenic classical education, and she speaks as a native Greek and not as an outsider/foreigner who learned Greek.

The refounding of the [[University of Constantinople]] in the palaces of [[Magnaura]] promoted an interest in learning, particularly in Greek studies. [[Photius I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] was irritated because "Hellenic studies are preferred over spiritual works". [[Michael Psellus]] thought it a compliment when Emperor [[Romanus III]] praised him for being raised "in the Hellenic way" and a weakness for Emperor [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian|Michael IV]] for being completely devoid of a Hellenic education,&lt;ref&gt;Romanus III, ''"Towards the son of Romanus himself", p.49''&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Anna Comnena]] claimed that she had "carried the study of Hellenic to the highest pitch".&lt;ref&gt;Anna Comnena, ''"Alexiad", prologue 1''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, commenting on the orphanage her father founded, she stated that "there could be seen a Latin being trained, and a [[Scythian]] studying Hellenic, and a Roman handling Hellenic texts and an illiterate Hellene speaking Hellenic correctly".&lt;ref&gt;Anna Comnena, ''"Alexiad", 15, 7''&lt;/ref&gt; In this case we reach a point where the Byzantines are Romans on the political level but Hellenic by descent. [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]] disambiguates the distinction in his account of the fall of Constantinople in 1204 by referring to the invaders with the generic term "Latins", encompassing all adherents to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the "Hellenes" as the dominant population of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Espugnazione di Thessalonica, p. 32, Palermo 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of Constantinople to the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]], Greek nationalism accentuated. [[Nicetas Choniates]] insisted on using the name "Hellenes", stressing the outrages of the "Latins" against the "Hellenes" in the [[Peloponessus]] and how the [[Alfeios River]] might carry the news to the barbarians in [[Sicily]], the [[Normans]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicetas Choniates, ''The Sack of Constantinople'', Bonn, p. 806''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] referred to the [[Byzantine emperor]]s as Hellenes,&lt;ref&gt;Nicephorus Blemmydes, ''"Pertial narration", 1, 4''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theodore Alanias]] wrote in a letter to his brother that "the homeland may have been captured, but Hellas still exists within every wise man".&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Alanias, ''PG'' 140, 414&lt;/ref&gt; The second Emperor of Nicaea, [[John III Ducas Vatatzes]], wrote in a letter to [[Pope Gregory IX]] about the wisdom that "rains upon the Hellenic nation". He maintained that the transfer of the imperial authority from Rome to Constantinople was national and not geographic, and therefore did not belong to the [[Latin Empire|Latins]] occupying Constantinople: [[Constantine the Great|Constantine's]] heritage was passed on to the Hellenes, so he argued, and they alone were its inheritors and successors.&lt;ref&gt;John Vatatzes, ''"Unpublished Letters of Emperor John Vatatzes", Athens I, pp. 369–378, (1872)''&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Theodore II Lascaris]], was eager to project the name of the Greeks with true nationalistic zeal. He made it a point that "the Hellenic race looms over all other languages" and that "every kind of philosophy and form of knowledge is a discovery of Hellenes... What do you, O Italian, have to display?"&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Lascaris, ''Christian Theology'', 7. and 8''&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of the name was slow and did not replace the "Roman" name completely. [[Nicephorus Gregoras]] named his historical work ''Roman History''.&lt;ref&gt;Nicephorus Gregoras, ''Roman History''&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzenus]], a big supporter of Greek education, in his own memoirs always refers to the Byzantines as "Romans",&lt;ref&gt;John Catacuzenus, ''History'', 4, 14&lt;/ref&gt; yet, in a letter sent by the ''[[sultan]]'' of [[Egypt]], [[Nasser Hassan Ben Mohamed]], referred to him as "Emperor of the Hellenes, [[Bulgars]], [[Sassanians]], [[Vlachs]], [[Russians]], [[Alans|Alanians]]" but not of the "Romans".&lt;ref&gt;Similar texts were composited by the scribes of the Kings in the north, e.g. of Russia, Poland, Lithuania...&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next century, [[George Gemistus Plethon]] pointed out to [[Constantine XI|Constantine Palaeologus]] that the people he leads are "Hellenes, as their race and language and education testifies",&lt;ref&gt;George Gemistus Plethon, ''Paleologeia and Peloponessiaka'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Laonicus Chalcondyles]] was a proponent of completely substituting "Roman" terminology for "Greek" terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Laonicus Chalcondyles, ''History'' I&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine Palaeologus himself in the end proclaimed [[Constantinople]] the "refuge for Christians, hope and delight of all Hellenes".&lt;ref&gt;George Phrantzes, ''History'', 3.6&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the same Emperor in his final speech before the Empire's demise called upon his audience to rally to the defenses by characteristically referring to them as "descendants of Hellenes and Romans", most possibly as an attempt to combine Greek national sentiment with the Roman tradition of the Byzantine crown and Empire, both highly respected elements in his subjects' psyche at that moment.

==Byzantines (Βυζαντινοί)==
By the time of the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] most easterners had come to think of themselves as Christians and, more than ever before, as Romans. Although they may not have liked their government any more than they had previously, the Greeks among them could no longer consider it foreign, run by Latins from Italy. The word ''Hellene'' itself had already begun to mean a pagan rather than a person of Greek race or culture. Instead eastern Greeks overwhelmingly used the self-identifying term ''Rhomaios'', "Roman".&lt;ref&gt;Warren Treadgold, ''History of the Byzantine State and Society'', Stanford, 1997, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill Page, "Being Byzantine: Greek Identity Before the Ottomans" p6&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Byzantine Empire" was introduced in 1557, about a century after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], by German historian [[Hieronymus Wolf]], who introduced a system of Byzantine [[historiography]] in his work ''Corpus Historiae Byzantinae'' in order to distinguish ancient Roman from medieval Greek history without drawing attention to their ancient predecessors. Several authors adopted his terminology, but it remained relatively unknown. English historians preferred to use Roman terminology ([[Edward Gibbon]] used it in a particularly belittling manner), while French historians preferred to call it Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Alexandre Rambeau, ''L'empire Grecque au X&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siecle''&lt;/ref&gt; The term reappeared in the mid-19th century and has since dominated completely in historiography, even in Greece, despite objections from [[Constantine Paparregopoulus|Constantine Paparregopoulos]], Gibbon's influential Greek counterpart, that the empire should be called Greek. Few Greek scholars adopted the terminology at that time, but it became popular in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ῥωμαῖος (Roman) remained a massively popular name for a Greek in Greece even after the foundation of the modern Greek state in 1829. ''Argyris Eftaliotis'' published his history of Greece series in 1901 under the title "History of Romanity", reflecting how well rooted Roman heritage still was in Greeks.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenic continuity and Byzantine consciousness==
{{Main|Byzantine Greeks}}
[[File:Greek Community of Trieste, 1787.JPG|thumb|The first printed [[Charter]] of the Greek Community of [[Trieste]], Italy 1787&amp;nbsp;– Archives of the Community of Trieste.]]

The "Byzantines" did not only refer to themselves as ''Rhomaioi'' in order to retain both their Roman citizenship and their ancient Hellenic heritage. In fact, the overwhelming majority of the "Byzantines" themselves were very conscious of their uninterrupted continuity with the ancient Greeks. Even though the ancient Greeks were not Christians, the "Byzantines" still regarded them as their ancestors. A common substitute for the term ''Hellene'' other than ''Rhomaios'' was the term ''Graikos'' (Γραικός). This term was used often by the "Byzantines" (along with ''Rhomaios'') for ethnic self-identification. Evidence of the use of the term ''Graikos'' can be found in the works of [[Priscus]], a historian of the 5th century AD. The historian stated in one of his accounts that while unofficially on an embassy to Attila the Hun, he had met at Attila's court someone who dressed like a [[Scythian]] yet spoke Greek. When Priskos asked the person where he had learned the language, the man smiled and said that he was a Graekos by birth. Many other "Byzantine" authors speak of the Empire's natives as Greeks [''Graikoi''] or Hellenes such as Constantine Porphyrogennitos of the 10th century. His accounts discuss about the revolt of a Slavic tribe in the district of Patras in the Peloponnese. Constantine states that the Slavs who revolted first proceeded to sack the dwellings of their neighbors, the Greeks (''ton Graikon''), and next they moved against the inhabitants of the city of Patras. Overall, ancient Hellenic continuity was evident all throughout the history of the Eastern Roman Empire. The "Byzantines" were not merely a general Orthodox Christian populace that referred to themselves as merely "Romans." Though they used the term for legal and administrative purposes, other terms were in fact used to ethnically distinguish themselves. In short, the Greek inhabitants of the Eastern Roman Empire were very conscious of their ancient Hellenic heritage and were able to preserve their identity while adapting to the changes the world was undergoing at the time.&lt;ref name=Constantelos2008&gt;{{cite news

==Contest between the names ''Hellene'', ''Roman'', and ''Greek''==
Following the [[Fall of Constantinople|Ottoman conquest of Constantinople]] and during the [[Ottoman Greece]] a fierce ideological battle ensued regarding the three rival national names of the Greeks. This struggle may have settled down after the [[Greek War of Independence]] but was permanently resolved only recently in the 20th century after the loss of [[Asia Minor]] to the [[Turkey|Turks]].

The struggle reflected the diverging view of history between [[classicist]]s and [[medievalist]]s ([[katharevousa]] and [[Demotic Greek|demotic]]) in their attempt to define Greek [[nationality]] at a time without a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] state to foster the movement. The concept of ''Hellene'' for a person of Greek origin was already well established since the late [[Middle Ages]]. However, for the majority of the population, especially those in rural areas away from urban centers, the dominant perception was still that of a ''Roman''/''Romios'', a descendant of the Byzantine Empire or ''Rhomania''. Scholar [[Rigas Feraios]] called "Bulgars and [[Arvanites]], [[Armenians]] and Romans" to rise in arms against the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Rigas Feraios, ''"Thurius", line 45''&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Ioannis Makrygiannis|Makrygiannis]] recalled a friend asking him: "What say you, is the Roman State far away from coming? Are we to sleep with the Turks and awaken with the Romans?"&lt;ref&gt;Strategus Makrygiannis, ''"Memoirs", book 1, p. 117, Athens, 1849''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Greek'' (Γραικός) was the least popular of the three terms, but received disproportionately larger attention by scholars compared to its popular use. [[Adamantios Korais]], a renowned Greek classicist, justified his preference in ''A Dialogue between Two Greeks'': "Our ancestors used to call themselves Greeks but adopted afterwards the name Hellenes by a Greek who called himself [[Hellen]]. One of the above two, therefore, is our true name. I approved 'Greece' because that is what all the enlightened nations of Europe call us."&lt;ref&gt;Adamantios Korais, ''"Dialogue between two Greeks", p. 37, Venice, 1805''&lt;/ref&gt; Hellenes for Korais are the pre-Christian inhabitants of Greece.

The absence of a Byzantine state gradually led to the marginalization of the Roman name and allowed Hellene (Ἕλλην) to resurface as the primary national name. {{Interlanguage link multi|Dionysius Pyrrhus|el|3=Διονύσιος Πύρρος}} requests the exclusive use of Hellene in his ''Cheiragogy'': "Never desire to call yourselves Romans, but Hellenes, for the Romans from ancient Rome enslaved and destroyed Hellas".&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Pyrrhus, ''"Cheiragogy", Venice, 1810''&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous author of ''The Hellenic Realm of Law'', published in 1806 in [[Pavia]], Italy, speaks of Hellenes: "The time has come, O Hellenes, to liberate our home".&lt;ref&gt;''Hellenic Prefecture'', p. 191, Athens, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the [[Greek War of Independence]] began his ''Declaration'' with a phrase similar to the above: "The time has come, O men, Hellenes".&lt;ref&gt;Ioannes Philemon, "Historical Essay on the Greek Revolution", Vol. 2, p. 79, (in Greek) [http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/5/4/9/metadata-02-0000171.tkl Ιωάννης Φιλήμων, Δοκίμιον ιστορικόν περί της ελληνικής Επαναστάσεως, T.2, Αθήνα 1859]&lt;/ref&gt; After the name was accepted by the spiritual and political leadership of the land, it rapidly spread to the population, especially with the onset of the Greek War of Independence where many naïve leaders and war figures distinguished between idle Romans and rebellious Hellenes.&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis Kakrides, ''"Ancient Greeks and Greeks of 1821", Thessalonike, 1956''&lt;/ref&gt;  General [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] in particular made a point of always addressing his revolutionary troops as Hellenes and invariably wore a [[helmet]] of ancient Greek style.

General [[Makrygiannis]] tells of a priest who performed his duty in front of the "Romans" (civilians) but secretly spied on the "Hellenes" (fighters). "Roman" almost came to be associated with passiveness and enslavement, and "Hellene" brought back the memory of ancient glories and the fight for freedom. Eyewitness historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Ambrosius Phrantzes|el|3=Αμβρόσιος Φραντζής (νεότερος)}} writes that while the Turkish authorities and colonists in [[Pylos|Niokastro]] had surrendered to the advancing Greek army, reportedly, shouts of defiance were made that led to their [[Navarino Massacre|massacre by the mob]]: "They spoke to the petty and small Hellenes as 'Romans'. It was as if they called them 'slaves'! The Hellenes not bearing to hear the word, for it reminded of their situation and the outcome of tyranny..."&lt;ref&gt;Ambrosius Phrantzes, ''Abridged history of a revived Greece'', T1 p. 398, Athens, 1839 [http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/2/5/9/metadata-39-0000531.tkl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The citizens of the newly independent state were called "Hellenes" making the connection with ancient Greece all the more clear. That in turn also fostered a fixation&lt;ref name="O.R.Gurney 1975 p.15"/&gt; on antiquity and negligence for the other periods of history, especially the [[Byzantine Empire]], for an age that bore different names and was a devisor to different and in many ways more important legacies. The classicist trend was soon balanced by the [[Megali Idea|Greek Great Idea]] that sought to recover [[Constantinople]] and reestablish the Byzantine Empire for all Greeks. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs proclaimed in front of Parliament in 1844, "The [[Kingdom of Greece]] is not Greece; it is only part of it, a small and poor part of Greece... There are two great centers of [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenism]]. Athens is the capital of the Kingdom. Constantinople is the great capital, the City, dream and hope of all Greeks."&lt;ref&gt;Markezines, ''"Political History of Modern Greece", book A, p. 208, Athens''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etiquette===

In some social situations Greeks can react negatively or be offended if the word Γραικός (''Greek'') is used in a situation where in the modern Greek language the word Έλληνας (''Hellene'') is considered the right word to use.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://pheidias.antibaro.gr/Hellas_names/Diamantopoulos.html]&lt;/Ref&gt; Both words have a positive meaning in the Greek language if they are used in the preferred context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7793">'''Peter Fagg''' (January 14, 1837 – December 10, 1917&lt;ref name="zetteler" /&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] law enforcement officer, [[retail clerk]], [[debt collector]], [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] lecturer, [[colporteur]], and politician from [[Milwaukee]] and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]] who served a single term as a member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]]'s 2nd [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] district (the 2nd [[wards of the United States|Ward]] of the City of Milwaukee). He was a member of the [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Reform Party]], a short-lived [[coalition]] of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], [[reform]] and [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grangers]] formed in 1873 in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]], which had secured the election for two years of [[William Robert Taylor]] as [[Governor of Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=2700&amp;keyword=taylor William Robert Taylor, Wisconsin Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as electing a number of state legislators, but failed to thrive.

== Background ==
Fagg was born as Pieter Fagg in [[Vlissingen]] in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] on January 14, 1837, son of Captain Johannes Gerardus Fagg (Zierikzee, 1804) son of John Fagg and Jacoba Johanna van der Tollen), who came of [[Scots people|Scotch]] and [[English people|English]] ancestors and Sara Jacoba Smith (Vlissingen, 1813). The captain was a ship owner, sailor, and merchant who owned a large grocery business in Vlissengen. His mother, Sarah Jacoba Smith, was a Vlissingen native from a prominent local family of English and Dutch ancestry and of a prominent family of the place. Captain Fagg never learned the [[Dutch language]], speaking only [[English language|English]].

John Fagg died at the age of 34, and for two years his mother managed the business. She again married on March 5, 1841,&lt;ref name="zetteler"&gt;[http://genealogie.planje.info/database Database genealogie Planje, Planjer, Planije, Zetteler en aanverwanten], Genealogical database, in Dutch.&lt;/ref&gt; this time to [[Frederick Zetteler|Frederick T. Zetteler]], a son of the royal [[tailor]]. A few years after Sarah's second marriage and after the second bankruptcy of her husband the whole family came to the United States, taking passage at [[Antwerp]] on a sailing ship that landed them at [[New York City]]. They proceeded to [[Albany, New York]] and thence by [[canals]] and the [[Great Lakes]] to [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], landing July 3, 1848, and there they settled down on a farm. In 1853 Zetteler moved the family to Madison and opened a [[general store]]. The mother and children ran the store and the father worked for official offices of the State, including the [[Secretary of State of Wisconsin]] and the State [[Register of Deeds]], and Peter worked in the office of former [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|Governor]] [[Leonard J. Farwell]]. In 1858, a fire destroyed all of the family's property, and Zetteler returned to Milwaukee and went into the [[real estate]] business.

Peter married Fyistke Fillma (called "Mary") on May 3, 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.mpl.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/MCMC/id/5714 Marriage certificate, Peter Fagg and Fyistke Fillma; Milwaukee County records]&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to [[Alto, Wisconsin|Alto]] in [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac County]] in 1861, where he worked as a [[retail clerk]] in a general store. Fagg was elected a [[justice of the peace]] in Alto, and county supervisor for the same place, in 1862, and re-elected. In 1863 his stepfather was elected (as a Democrat) to the State Assembly back in Milwaukee.

Fagg was appointed as a [[prison guard]] in the [[Waupun Correctional Institution|Wisconsin State Prison]] in 1865; then returned to Milwaukee in 1867, where he was appointed a [[police officer]] under Chief William Beck. He became a [[deputy sheriff]] under [[Sheriff]]s Parsons and McDonald, and resigned in October, 1873. He worked as a [[notary public]] and debt collector.

== Assembly ==
In 1874 he was elected to succeed fellow Reformer [[Joseph Hamilton (Wisconsin legislator)|Joseph Hamilton]] (who was not a candidate) under the label of "Democratic Reform." He won with 995 votes, to 451 for Thomas Armstrong, who ran as an "[[Independent Republican (United States)|Independent Republican]]". He was re-elected the next year as an "[[Independent Democrat]]" (the Reform Party was beginning to break down), with 763 votes to 534 for regular Democrat George Tyre, serving with his stepfather Frederick Zetteler, who had just been elected once again to the Assembly from Milwaukee as a Democrat. Due to the division of the Assembly, no single party could assemble a majority. Fagg was persuaded to support Republican [[Sam Fifield]] for [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]]. Fagg switched his vote and his influence, thus enabling the Republicans to control the Assembly. From that time on, he supported the Republican party cause, especially among his fellow [[Dutch American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, E. W. "When Peter Fagg Helped" ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' reprinted in ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' August 26, 1895; p. 4, col. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Fagg was not a candidate for re-election in 1876, and was succeeded by Hamilton (now running as a Democrat).

== After the Assembly ==
Fagg became briefly [[postmaster]] of the [[Wisconsin State Senate]], then with the help of Republican Governor [[William E. Smith]] moved on to a clerical position in the office of the [[Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands]], where he remained for nine years. In 1886, he was not reappointed due to his increasingly fervent religious and [[temperance movement]] positions. Fagg had been a [[teetotaler]] for many years, and increasingly argued that the only acceptable place for him in political matters was as a lecturer for the cause of [[Prohibition]]. He became a [[salesperson|sale agent]] for books and Bibles. He was active in a number of [[fraternal orders]], held high office in the [[Independent Order of Good Templars]]' Temple of Honor and Temperance and the [[Knights of Pythias]], and for years was a member of the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]].

By 1895, Fagg was reported to have suffered financial reversals, and to be working as [[day labor]] at the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] building.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, "When Peter Fagg Helped"&lt;/ref&gt; Fagg died in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death Claims Many Pioneers during Year|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8146022/peter_fagg_18371917/|newspaper=The Capital Times|date=December 31, 1917|page=8|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = January 3, 2017 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Petru Dugulescu''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈpetru duɡuˈlesku}}; November 18, 1945 &amp;ndash; January 3, 2008) was a [[Romania]]n [[Baptist]] pastor, poet, and politician. A member of the [[Baptist Union of Romania]] and a representative of the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Romania)]] (PNȚCD), he played a part in the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], being among the organizers of protests in [[Timişoara]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Conop|Chelmac]], [[Arad County]], Dugulescu graduated from the [[Baptist Theological Seminary, Bucharest|Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Bucharest]], and became a pastor, while authoring works of [[Christian poetry]]. During a period when the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] engaged in the persecution of Baptists, he was kept under surveillance by the secret police (the [[Securitate]]). The latter institution pressured him to stop preaching, and threatened that he was to suffer a car accident were he to refuse; Dugulescu refused to comply.&lt;ref name="Ramet, p.279"&gt;Ramet, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1985, an unmarked bus crashed into the car he was driving, causing the pastor to suffer multiple fractures.&lt;ref name="Ramet, p.279"/&gt; Dugulescu's  autobiography, ''Ei mi-au programat moartea'' ("They Programmed My Death", translated into English under the title ''Repenters''), details this interval and includes his own account of the events.

Following the Revolution, Petru Dugulescu joined the PNȚ, and was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] for [[Timiş County]] during the [[Romanian legislative election, 1992|1992 suffrage]], and again in the [[Romanian legislative election, 1996|1996 election]]. He served on the Committee for Human Rights, Religious Affairs and National Minority Issues, as well as on the Committee for Foreign Policy. He was the founder and president of Charity Foundation Jesus the Hope of Romania and Onesimus Brothers House for [[street children]] in [[Timişoara]].

Dugulescu turned in his last book (''Democrație și Persecuție'', "Democracy and Persecution") for publication on December 20, 2007, and on the afternoon of January 3, 2008 he suffered a fatal heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.pasi.ro/revista/interviu-cu-fostul-senator-pastorul-si-poetul-petru-d.html "A murit pastorul Petrică Dugulescu"], in [http://www.pasi.ro/ ''Paşi'']; retrieved January 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Playwright===
He first wrote a play to help [[Kingston Rowing Club]] raise money to buy a new boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/sherriff-blog-11/|title=The road to Journey’s End...A Hitch in the Proceedings and other early plays by R C Sherriff - Exploring Surrey's Past|website=www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His seventh play, ''[[Journey's End]]'', was written in 1928 and published in 1929 and was based on his experiences in the war.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/R-C-Sherriff|title=R.C.

===Novelist===
Sherriff also wrote prose. A novelised version of ''Journey's End'', co-written with [[Vernon Bartlett]], was published in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CKUhAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA452&amp;lpg=RA1-PA452&amp;dq=Journey's+End+novel+r.c.+sherriff+with+Vernon+Bartlett+published+in+1930&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QzRCgFowHL&amp;sig=YhL6fGr7frLdr_ft_AJh2unNNzk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi45fnkkb_XAhVjJsAKHeTpAu8Q6AEIYDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Journey's+End+novel+r.c.+sherriff+with+Vernon+Bartlett+published+in+1930&amp;f=false|title=Catalog of Copyright Entries.

Wells]]-influenced post-apocalyptic story about an earth devastated because of a collision with the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/6133642/Endpaper.html|title=Endpaper|first=Claudia|last=FitzHerbert|date=5 September 2009|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sober language and realistic depiction of an average man coming to terms with a ruined England is said{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} to have been an influence on later science fiction authors such as [[John Wyndham]] and [[Brian Aldiss]]. ''The Fortnight in September'', an earlier novel, published in 1931, is a rather more plausible story about a [[Bognor Regis|Bognor]] holiday enjoyed by a lower-middle-class family from [[Dulwich]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/the-fortnight-in-september.html&lt;/ref&gt; His 1936 novel ''Green Gates'' is a realistic novel about a middle-aged couple, Tom and Edith Baldwin, moving from an established London suburb into the then-new suburbs of [[Metro-land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bookssnob.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/greengates-by-r-c-sherriff/|title=Greengates by R C Sherriff|date=3 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award nominations==
Sherriff was nominated along with [[Eric Maschwitz]] and [[Claudine West]] for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy award for writing an adapted screenplay]] for ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' which was released in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/artist/rc-sherriff-p164845/awards|title=R.C.

'''Rani Karnavati''' also known as '''Rani Karmavati''' (died 8 March 1535), was a [[princess]] and temporary ruler from [[Bundi]], [[India]].  She was married to [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Chittorgarh]], the capital of [[Mewar]] Kingdom. She was the mother of the next two Ranas, [[Vikramaditya Singh|Rana Vikramaditya]] and [[Udai Singh II|Rana Uday Singh]], and grandmother of the legendary [[Maharana Pratap]]. She served as regent during the minority of her son, from 1527 until 1533.

==Biography==
After [[Babur]] had captured the throne of Delhi in 1526 AD, Rana Sangram Singh or Rana Sanga of Mewar lead a confederation of [[Rajput]] Kings against [[Babur]] to capture the throne of Delhi. But in The [[Battle of Khanua]] in 1527, the combined Hindu forces were defeated, and Rana Sanga died shortly afterward from his wounds.

Rani Karnavati took up the regency in the name of her elder son Vikramaditya, a weak ruler. In the meantime, Mewar was attacked for the second time by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, at whose hands Vikramaditya had earlier received a defeat. It was a matter of great concern for Rani.

The antagonized nobles were not ready to fight for Vikramaditya and the imminent battle was sure to be another blot in the history of Sisodias. Rani Karnavati wrote to the nobles to come forward for the sake of the honour of the [[Sisodia]]s, and was able to persuade the nobles to fight for Mewar, if not for Vikramaditya. Their sole condition was that Vikramaditya and Uday Singh should go to Bundi during the war for their personal safety. Rani also sent a Rakhi to [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], calling him a brother and asking for help. Thus her name became irrevocably linked to the festival of [[Raksha Bandhan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amarchitrakatha.com/stories/story_detail_page.php?story_id=OQ== Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun] ''[[Amar Chitra Katha]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1874799.cms True meaning of Raksha Bandhan] ''[[The Times of India]]'', August 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rani Karnavati agreed to send her sons to Bundi and told her trusted maid [[Panna Dai]] to accompany them and take good care of them. Panna was reluctant, but surrendered to the wishes of the queen, when she assured her that with the renewed support of the nobles and the expected help from Humayun, all would be well. However, tidings from Chittor were not good and the Sisodias had fought valiantly, but they were outnumbered and the war was lost. Humayun who was on Bengal's invasion responded graciously and assured his assistance to Rani Karnawati, which could make Rajputs favorable towards Mughals, he left the Bengal expedition midway but he could not reach Chittor on time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diaspora of Muslims by Everett Jenkins, Jr.]] [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TxAkCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=diaspora+of+muslims+and+%2B+karnavati&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tC3IemLvis&amp;sig=Ta0jZmbSZMk3JkUkPfWVMgLgKAk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnh9qE7sfVAhXIqo8KHbS_BGwQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=diaspora%20of%20muslims%20and%20%2B%20karnavati&amp;f=false]'&lt;/ref&gt; Bahadur Shah entered Chittorgarh and ransacked it for the second time. Realising that defeat was imminent, Karnavati and the other noble ladies of the court immolated themselves in a mass suicide by fire known as [[Jauhar]] on March 8, 1535 A.D., while all the men donned saffron clothes and went out to fight to the death and thus committed saka. This is the occasion for the second of the three Jauhars performed at Chittor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oGVSvXuCsyUC&amp;pg=SL1-PA51&amp;dq=rani+karnavati+humayun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b2RMUpSTFIOJrQfBtoCoBQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rani%20karnavati%20humayun&amp;f=false Encyclopaedia of Indian Events &amp; Dates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streeshakti.com/bookK.aspx?author=16 KARNAVATI, QUEEN OF CHITTOR ]&lt;/ref&gt; Humayun though late, avenged the death of Karnavati by capturing Mandu from Bahadur Shah in 1535. According to modern historians, Humayun was persuaded by his advisors to not go against a fellow muslim ruler for a [[kafir]]. Humayun thus waited for Chittor to fall and then used the situation as an excuse to invade Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diaspora of Muslims by Everett Jenkins, Jr.]] [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TxAkCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=diaspora+of+muslims+and+%2B+karnavati&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tC3IemLvis&amp;sig=Ta0jZmbSZMk3JkUkPfWVMgLgKAk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnh9qE7sfVAhXIqo8KHbS_BGwQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=diaspora%20of%20muslims%20and%20%2B%20karnavati&amp;f=false]'.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''presidential election''' was held in the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] on 28 March 1974. 

[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] was elected by the [[Great National Assembly]] as the [[President of Romania]] on 28 March 1974;&lt;ref&gt;Legea nr. 1/1974 privind modificarea Constitutiei Republicii Socialiste Romania, publicata in B.

On April 4, 1974, the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] daily ''[[Scînteia]]'' published a congratulatory telegram, in which [[Salvador Dalí]] actually mocked Ceauşescu on his "introducing the presidential scepter". Being successively re-elected, Ceaușescu served as the president until [[Romanian Revolution|22 December 1989]].

'''Scott Westgarth''' (27 July 1986 – 25 February 2018) was a British light heavyweight boxer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/661820|title=Scott Westgarth|last=|first=|date=|website=boxrec.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 25 February 2018 at the age of 31 after sustaining injuries following a victory in a 10-round light heavyweight bout during a Saturday night clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/5671462/scott-westgarth-dead-at-31-boxer-tragically-dies-after-rushed-hopsital/|title=Tragic final words of boxer Scott Westgarth who died after fight|date=2018-02-27|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Westgarth's final fight was widely considered to be the biggest victory of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/43196287|title=Scott Westgarth: British boxer dies after winning fight in Doncaster|date=2018-02-26|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Westgarth boxed 10 matches in his professional career, ending with 7 victories and only 2 losses before his death. He fought in his final bout on 24 February 2018 against Dec Spelman. This was a 10-round light heavyweight eliminator in [[Doncaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/scott-westgarth-dead-death-fight-steve-bunce-tribute-dec-spelman-a8229036.html|title=RIP Scott Westgarth: The latest anonymous sacrifice to give his life for a couple of thousand pounds|date=2018-02-26|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated Spelman in the elimination match on points and was looking to try to win the English national championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/5690710/scott-westgarth-dad-father-boxer/|title=Scott Westgarth's dad pays tribute to his 'baby' who died after boxing win|date=2018-02-28|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
During the final round of the fight against Spelman, Westgarth was knocked down, but was able to recover to ultimately win on points. He went on to conduct a post-match interview before consulting doctors in the dressing room. They sent him to [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]] in an ambulance after concerns for his well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/scott-westgarth-dies-dead-death-age-31-eliminator-fight-dec-spelman-a8228576.html|title=British boxer Scott Westgarth dies after winning fight, aged 31|date=2018-02-26|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/16048102.North_East_boxer_Scott_Westgarth_dies_after_bout/|title=Tributes after North-East boxer Scott Westgarth dies following bout|website=The Northern Echo|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the interview Westgarth held his wrapped hand to his head above his left eye a number of times, suggesting he was in some discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/scott-westgarth-dead-tribute-boxer-12089287|title=Boxer Scott Westgarth dies after being rushed to hospital following fight|last=Domin|first=Martin|date=2018-02-27|work=Mirror|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], Goldwasser obtained her [[Bachelor's degree|B.S.]] (1979) in mathematics and  science from [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and [[Master's degree|M.S.]] (1981) and [[Doctorate|PhD]] (1984) in computer science from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under the supervision of [[Manuel Blum]], who is well known for advising some of the most prominent researchers in the field. She joined [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1983, and in 1997 became the first holder of the RSA Professorship.  She became a professor at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], concurrent to her professorship at MIT, in 1993. She is a member of the [[theory of computation|Theory of Computation]] group at [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/shafi-goldwasser-wcs/|title=Shafi Goldwasser Biography|work=www.BookRags.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwasser was a co-recipient of the 2012 [[Turing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/goldwasser-and-micali-win-turing-award-0313.html|title=Goldwasser and Micali win Turing Award|author=AbAbazorius, CSAIL|date=13 March 2013|work=MIT News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On January 1, 2018, Goldwasser became the director of the [[Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/10/10/shafi-goldwasser-appointed-director-of-the-simons-institute-for-the-theory-of-computing/|title=Shafi Goldwasser appointed director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing|date=10 October 2017|website=News.berkeley.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since November 2016, Goldwasser is Chief Scientist and Co-Founder of Duality Technologies, an Israeli-American start-up which offers secure data analytics using advanced cryptographic techniques.&lt;ref name="duality.cloud"/&gt; She is also a scientific advisor for several technology start ups in the security area, including QED-it, specializing in the Zero Knowledge Blockchain, and Algorand, a [[Proof-of-stake]] Blockchain.

==Scientific career==
Goldwasser's research areas include [[computational complexity theory]], [[cryptography]] and [[computational number theory]]. 
She is the co-inventor of probabilistic encryption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/shafi/1984-jcss.pdf|format=PDF|title=Probabilistic Encryption|website=Groups.csail.mit.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which set up and achieved the gold standard for security for data encryption. 
She is the co-inventor of [[zero-knowledge proof]]s, which probabilistically and interactively demonstrate the validity of an assertion without conveying any additional knowledge, and are a key tool in the design of [[cryptographic protocol]]s. Her work in complexity theory includes the classification of approximation problems, showing that some problems in [[NP (complexity)|NP]] remain hard even when only an approximate solution is needed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/shafi/1996-jacm.pdf|format=PDF|title=Interactive Proofs and the Hardness of Approximating Cliques|website=Groups.csail.mit.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pioneering methods for delegating computations to untrusted servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/delegating-computation-interactive-proofs-for-muggles/|title=Delegating computation: interactive proofs for muggles|first1=Shafi|last1=Goldwasser|first2=Yael Tauman|last2=Kalai|first3=Guy|last3=Rothblum|date=1 January 2008|journal=Microsoft Research|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work in number theory, includes the invention with Joe Kilian of primality proving using elliptic curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Primality-Testing-Using-Elliptic-Curves-Goldwasser-Kilian/997df4e2a661aed97b2ad782531aa2ce122cab4d|title=Primality Testing Using Elliptic Curves - Semantic Scholar|website=Semanticscholar.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Goldwasser was awarded the 2012 [[Turing Award]] along with [[Silvio Micali]] for their work in the field of cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldwasser, Micali Receive ACM Turing Award for Advances in Cryptography|url=http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2013/turing-award-12|publisher=ACM|accessdate=13 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316052703/http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2013/turing-award-12|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goldwasser has twice won the [[Gödel Prize]] in [[theoretical computer science]]: first in 1993 (for ''"The knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems"''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/22145.22178| chapter = The knowledge complexity of interactive proof-systems| title = Proceedings of the seventeenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing  - STOC '85| pages = 291| year = 1985| last1 = Goldwasser | first1 = S. | last2 = Micali | first2 = S. | last3 = Rackoff | first3 = C. | isbn = 0897911512}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2001 (for ''"Interactive Proofs and the Hardness of Approximating Cliques"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Feige | first1 = U. |authorlink1=Uriel Feige| last2 = Goldwasser | first2 = S. |authorlink2=Shafi Goldwasser| last3 = Lovász | first3 = L. |authorlink3=László Lovász| last4 = Safra | first4 = S. |authorlink4=Shmuel Safra| last5 = Szegedy | first5 = M. |authorlink5=Mario Szegedy| title = Interactive proofs and the hardness of approximating cliques | doi = 10.1145/226643.226652 | journal = [[Journal of the ACM]]| volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 268–292 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards include the [[ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award]] (1996) for outstanding young computer professional of the year and the [[RSA Award in Mathematics]] (1998) for outstanding mathematical contributions to cryptography.

'''Tarja Cronberg''' (née '''Mattila''', born 29 June 1943 in [[Helsinki]]) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Green League]] politician who served as a [[member of the European Parliament]] from 2011 until 2014. 
Cronberg was Member of the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]] 2003&amp;ndash;2007. She chaired her party from 2005 until 2009 and was the [[Minister of Labor (Finland)|Minister of Labour]] in the [[Cabinet of Finland|Finnish government]] from 2007 to 2009 as part of [[Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/tietoa/historiaa/hallitukset-ja-ministerit/raportti/-/r/v9l/38|title=Finnish Government - Ministers of Labor|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Valtioneuvosto.fi|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=no|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cronberg in the EU Parliament==

Tarja Cronberg became MEP in 2011 by replacing [[Heidi Hautala]] who became Minister of International Development in the Finnish cabinet. During her 2011–2014 term in the EU Parliament, Cronberg was the chair of the [[European Parliament]] delegation for relations with Iran&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/delegations/en/d-ir/home.html Delegation for relations with Iran], European Parliament&lt;/ref&gt; and served on the [[European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] and the [[European Parliament Subcommittee on Security and Defence|Subcommittee on Security and Defence]].

==Life and work==

Cronberg was born in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] and currently resides in [[Polvijärvi]], [[Northern Karelia]]. She holds two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degrees: in technology from [[Lund University]], [[Sweden]] and in business administration from [[Copenhagen Business School]], [[Denmark]].

Cronberg has worked in various positions in both [[business]] and [[education]], such as an associate [[professorship]] at the [[Technical University of Denmark]], among others. She has long exercised political leadership in Europe's networked society. She was a Member of the Finnish Parliament from 2003 to 2007 and the Minister of Labour from 2007 to 2009. She chaired the Green League party from 2005 to 2009 and served on several parliamentary committees (foreign affairs, security and defense, employment). She was a member of the EU Competitiveness Council (2008-2009) and of the EU Employment and Social Affairs Council (2007-2009).

Cronberg has been involved in technology and the social sciences policy. She directed the [[North Karelia]] regional development council from 1993 to 2001 and led the [[Copenhagen Peace Research Institute]] from 2001 to 2003. She was a member of the Danish Parliament Technology Council (1986-1991) and the Norwegian Research Council dealing with IT and society (1984-1992). She was a member of the European Commission Information Society Technologies Advisory Group (ISTAG) from 1999 to 2002; chaired the EU COSTA4 Group that examined the relationship between technology and society (1992-1997) and contributed to the VALUE think-tank that focused on the interaction between research and society (1993-1994).

The focal point in Cronberg's work in recent times has been peace and security. After the [[Cold War]] she worked both in [[Russia]] and in the US studying the conversion of military industries into civilian uses. Together with [[Stanford University]] and the Perm Technical University she and her team studied the transformation processes mainly in the aerospace industry. As the Regional Director of [[North Karelia]] she was instrumental in establishing "soft borders" between Finnish border regions and the Karelian Republic on the Russian side. Her work led to the establishment of Euregio Karelia, a cross-border region with common development programmes and projects. Later, as the director of COPRI, Copenhagen Peace Research Institute she was involved in the further development of the [[Copenhagen School of Security Studies]], doing also work on [[missile defence]] and [[Dual-use technology|dual-use technologies]]. In her political work she has specialised in defence and security matters, lately in questions of [[nuclear disarmament]]. Her choice of committees in the EU Parliament reflects these interests, as does her work as the Chair of the Parliament's delegation for relations with Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/delegations/en/d-ir/home.html European Parliament delegation for relations with Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her native [[Finnish language|Finnish]], Cronberg is fluent in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
 
She was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] at the turn of the year 2008/2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/viihde/uutiset/muut.shtml/826463?cronberg_tarja Lehti: Työministeri Cronbergillä rintasyöpä]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaino Väljas''' (born 28 March 1931 in [[Külaküla]], [[Hiiumaa]]) is a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] politician. He was the Chairman of the 6th Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR from 18 April 1963 to 19 March 1967, first secretary of communist party of [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] from 16 June 1988 to April 1990 and chairman of the party from April 1990 to August 1991.

Since Väljas was considered to have Estonian nationalist inclinations, he was removed from Estonia and appointed as the Soviet ambassador to [[Venezuela]] in 1980 and [[Nicaragua]] in 1986. As the [[Estonian independence movement]] gained momentum in 1988, the relatively liberal Väljas was recalled from Nicaragua and was appointed by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] as leader of the [[Estonian Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GDoQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wo8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3060,6601998&amp;dq=vaino+v%C3%A4ljas&amp;hl=en|title=Estonia Gets Hope|date=23 October 1989|work=Ellensburg Daily Record|publisher=[[United Press International|UPI]]|pages=9|accessdate=18 March 2010|location=[[Helsinki|Helsinki, Finland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist party lost its monopoly of power in February 1990. Väljas later voted for the [[Estonian restoration of Independence]] in August 1990.

Väljas was the leader of the former Communist party, renamed the [[Estonian United Left Party|Democratic Estonian Workers Party]], until 1995.

'''Vilhelm Herman Oluf Madsen''' (11 April 1844 – 14 June 1917), was a Danish politician, minister, army officer, businessman and inventor. He was War Minister in the Ministry Deuntzer 1901-1905. Madsen was the father of the physician [[Thorvald Madsen]].

He began his military career in 1859 and served in the [[Second War of Schleswig]] of 1864 as a lieutenant. In 1896, at the rank of colonel, Madsen was responsible for the adoption of the [[Madsen machine gun]] by the Danish army in 1902 and widely exported. He also constructed the [[Madsen 20 mm anti-aircraft cannon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skaarup|first=Harold A|title=Shelldrake: Canadian Artillery Museums and Gun Monuments|year=2012|isbn=1469750015|page=250|url=https://www.google.co.in/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:1469750015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[War Minister of Denmark]] in the [[Cabinet of Deuntzer]] from 1901 to 1905 he supported the [[Fortification of Copenhagen]] and this contributed to the conflict that led to the split of the [[Venstre Reform Party]] as the left wing of the party left the party in protest to form the [[Radikale Venstre]].

He became a general in 1903 and was elected to the [[Folketing]] in 1909. He was interested in [[mathematics]] and was the president of [[Danish Mathematical Society]] from 1903 to 1910.

'''''Wee Peem''''' ("He's a Proper Scream") was a British comic strip, created by James Jewell.&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of the Beano|publisher=D.C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=Dundee, Scotland |year=2008 |pages= 305|isbn=978-1-902407-73-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran in ''[[The Beano]]'' from 1938 on and ceased publication in 1957.

==History==
The series was first published in the first issue of the comic book magazine ''[[The Beano]]'' , dated July 30, 1938, and ran until the 89th issue, dated April 6, 1940. This first incarnation also appeared in the 1940 and 1941 [[The Beano Book|Beano Books]].

The central character "Wee Peem" was a young boy who gets up to various forms of mischief in a similar way to later Beano strips such as [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]] and [[Minnie the Minx]]. The name "Peem" is commonly a diminutive form of "James" in North East Scotland.

==Publication history==
These first Wee Peem strips were later reprinted in [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd|D.C. Thomson]]'s magazine-cum-newspaper [[The People's Journal]] which were followed by new Wee Peem strips in [[The People's Journal]] this time drawn by James Malcolm.&lt;ref name=A/&gt; The character then reappeared in issue 486, dated 10 November 1951, this time drawn by Charles Grigg, in a new strip entitled ''Wee Peem's Magic Pills''&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of the Beano|publisher=D.C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=Dundee, Scotland |year=2008 |pages= 317|isbn=978-1-902407-73-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this new strip the character was redesigned to have a massive head and took pills which gave him magic powers. This new strip lasted until issue 507, dated 5 April 1952, and appeared in the 1953 Beano Book.&lt;ref name=B/&gt; The character then reappeared for a third and final time in 1956 in a new strip this time simply entitled Wee Peem.&lt;ref name=C&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of the Beano|publisher=D.C.

==Dipper the Dodger==

A similar character in both appearance and mannerisms appeared in the first [[Dandy Monster Comic]] under the name Dipper the Dodger.&lt;ref name=DMC1&gt;{{cite book | title=Dandy Monster Comic No. 1|publisher=D.C.

'''William and Jean Eckart''' were a husband-and-wife team of theatre designers in the 1950s and 1960s. They designed sets, costumes, and lighting for many productions, including ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', ''[[Here's Love]]'', ''[[Damn Yankees]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', ''[[The Fig Leaves Are Falling]]'', and ''[[The Golden Apple (musical)|The Golden Apple]]''.

== History ==
William Eckart was born October 21, 1920 in [[New Iberia, Louisiana]] and died on January 24, 2000 in [[Dallas, Texas]], aged 79. His wife Jean was born on August 18, 1921 in [[Glencoe, Illinois]] and died on September 6, 1993, aged 72.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
Historically, '''women in Myanmar''' (also known as '''Burma''') have had a unique [[social status]] and esteemed women in [[Burma|Burmese society]]. According to the research done by [[Mya Sein]], Burmese [[women]] "for centuries – even before [[recorded history]]" owned a "high measure of independence" and had retained their "legal and economic rights" despite the influences of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Burma once had a [[matriarchal]] system that includes the exclusive right to inherit [[oil well]]s and the right to inherit the position as [[village head]]. Burmese women were also appointed to high offices by [[Burmese kings]], can become chieftainesses and [[Supayalat|queens]].&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;Daw Mya Sein. [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1958/02/the-women-of-burma/6822/ "Women in Burma"], The Atlantic, Atlantic Magazine, February 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional dress==
The ''htamein'' ({{lang|my|ထမီ}} {{IPA-my|tʰəmèɪɴ|}}) is one of the traditional dresses of Burmese women.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Falconer/&gt; This skirtcloth or lower body wrapper was worn by women during the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] (1752–1855) as a wrap-around skirt, or sometimes as a folded clothing material placed "tightly across the abdomen slightly left center of the waist".&lt;ref name=Falconer/&gt; In comparison, Burmese men wore the traditional lower garment known as the ''pahso'' ({{lang|my|ပုဆိုး}} {{IPA-my|pəsʰó|}}).&lt;ref name=Falconer&gt;Falconer, John and Luca Invernizzi Tettoni. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yQeGTsOoD0IC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=htamein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LnZcuhWOQw&amp;sig=iqzvujhwSIzR6qqNntT5qPFgueU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iYezTfj2E8jZgQem-9THCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Burmese Design and Architecture], Tuttle Publishing, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love and marriage==

Marriages were previously allowed between Burmese women and male foreigners provided that the divisional courts in Burma were informed within 21 days of advance notice. However, in May 2010, the government of Burma disallowed conducting of marriage ceremonies between Burmese women and male foreigners.&lt;ref name=Irrawaddy/&gt; One of the suggested reasons was to avoid [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name=Irrawaddy&gt;Thae Thae. [http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=18550 ''Burmese Women Not Allowed to Marry Foreigners''], The Irrawaddy, 25 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Burmese women became victims of human traffickers and were traded for the sex industry in Pakistan and Thailand.&lt;ref name=Global&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/burma.htm Trafficking], Burma/Myanmar, Factbook on Global Sexual Exploitation, Coalition Against Trafficking in Women&lt;/ref&gt;

To some extent, arranged marriages was also a part of Burmese tradition, however, the Burmese women have the right to refuse the offer of being betrothed to the parents' chosen partner for her. At present, young Burmese women can choose to marry someone for love.&lt;ref name=Irrawaddy/&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{Main|Women's rights in Myanmar}}

[[File:Aung San Suu Kyi (December 2011).jpg|thumb|[[Aung San Suu Kyi]].]]
In 2000, the Asian Women's Resource Exchange (AWORC) published a report entitled ''Human Rights in Burma'' from the ''Forum News'' (August 1998) describing that by tradition, Burmese women are maternal self-abnegators, meaning that these women "consistently forgo their own needs in order to give their children first priority." The report also indicated that rural and urban Burmese women were affected by the deteriorating economic climate in Burma.&lt;ref name=Aworc&gt;[http://www.aworc.org/bpfa/pub/sec_e/vio00001.html Human Rights in Burma], Asian Women's Resource Exchange (AWORC), 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Burmese families were "increasingly prioritising the rights of males over females to limited resources." These changes affected the access of Burmese women to nutrition, medical services, vocational training, and other educational opportunities. Burmese women became unwilling porters and unpaid labourers for the military, including becoming victims of slavery, murder, torture, rape, and attacks.&lt;ref name=Aworc&gt;[http://www.aworc.org/bpfa/pub/sec_e/vio00001.html Human Rights in Burma], Asian Women's Resource Exchange (AWORC), 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, urban Burmese women "enjoyed high levels of social power" but later became confronted with restrictions on speech and limitations in acquiring high level positions in both private and public offices.&lt;ref name=Aworc/&gt; According to AWORC, only a few number of Burmese women receive education related to reproductive rights and safe birth control practices, thus making them prone to being infected by HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name=Aworc/&gt;

In January 2008, BBC News featured Burmese [[Kayan Lahwi]] women who became tourist attractions in Thailand because of the tradition of wearing coils of brass around their necks. The rings of brass push the "women's shoulders and ribs down" throughout several years giving the effect as if the necks had been stretched, thus described as sporting "unnaturally long, [[giraffe]]-like necks."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;Harding, Andrew. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7215182.stm Burmese women in Thai 'human zoo'], 30 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yuriy Vitaliyovych Lutsenko''' ({{lang-uk|Юрій Віталійович Луценко}}; born 14 December 1964) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] politician and the current [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]] (since 12 May 2016).&lt;ref name=YLaPGb&gt;[http://www.unian.info/politics/1343771-lutsenko-appointed-prosecutor-general-in-ukraine.html Lutsenko appointed prosecutor general in Ukraine], [[UNIAN]] (12 May 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutsenko is a former [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine|Minister of Internal Affairs]]. He occupied this post in the two [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinets]] of [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] and in cabinets of [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]], and [[Viktor Yanukovych]].

Lutsenko's wife Iryna Lutsenko is a current member of the [[Ukrainian parliament]].&lt;ref name=luwbip/&gt;

==Early life==
Lutsenko was born in [[Rivne]]. His father was Vitaliy Ivanovych Lutsenko (15 March 1937 – 4 June 1999), who was elected people's deputy of Ukraine in [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1994|1994]] and [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1998|1998]], and secretary of the Central Committee of [[Communist Party of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/ukrregions/data/99.html|title=Lutsenko Vitaliy Ivanovich biography|publisher=[[Hokkaido University]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutsenko's mother is Vira Mikhailivna (born 1936), a [[Veterinary medicine|veterinarian]].

Lutsenko earned his degree in engineering in 1989 from [[Lviv Polytechnic|Lviv Polytechnical Institute]].

==Political biography==
Lutsenko gained public fame as one of the leaders of the [[Ukraine without Kuchma!]] campaign, which followed the [[Cassette Scandal]] of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/03/05/ukraine.tent/index.html?iref=allsearch Ukrainians renew tent protest], [[CNN]] (5 March 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the "faces of the [[Orange revolution]]". From 1991, Lutsenko was a long-term member of the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] (SPU); prior to his appointment to the executive branch, he was people's deputy in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian parliament) beginning in February 2002. Lutsenko belonged to the so-called "right wing" of SPU, which takes a pro-European position akin to social democratic parties in the rest of Europe, rather than a post-Soviet conservative socialism.

As a Minister, Lutsenko refused to run in the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 parliamentary election]] on his party list. However, he has run for both the [[Kyivrada|Kiev City Council]] and Rivne Oblast Council simultaneously in the lists of the Socialist Party – "to make the point", as he explained. Having won these seats, Lutsenko resigned from both in favor of his Minister's position as the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] prohibits occupying positions in the legislative and executive branches of the government at the same time.

===Resignation from the Socialist Party===
After his appointment as a minister, Lutsenko suspended his membership of the SPU in the summer of 2006 as a result of the party leader [[Oleksandr Moroz]]'s entering into a Parliamentary coalition with the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] and the [[Party of Regions]] of the previous PM [[Yanukovych]]. When the Parliamentary coalition of the [[Party of Regions]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communists]], and the defected [[Socialist Party of Ukraine|Socialists]] began to take shape, Lutsenko stated flatly that he refused to continue serving as the minister in a future government formed by these parties. However, after President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] agreed to allow the forming of the cabinet in exchange for several [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] including the ability to pick the Minister of Interior, Lutsenko stated that the president asked him personally to remain as the minister, and he would do so.

Lutsenko was formally dismissed by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] on 1 December 2006.&lt;ref name="411-V"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=411-16|title=On dismissal of Yuriy Lutsenko from position of Minister of Internal Affairs|date=1 December 2006|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutsenko then (December 2006) created [[Civil Movement "People's Self-Defense"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php/java/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=38877 Yuriy Lutsenko's initiative to create civil movement "People's self-defense" supported by political party "Ukraine, onward!"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223135329/http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php/java/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=38877 |date=23 February 2012 }}, [[Radio Ukraine]] (25 December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

18 December 2007 Lutsenko again became minister of Internal Affairs, when [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] was again elected [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].

===Incident at Frankfurt Airport===
In early May 2009 Lutsenko became entangled in a scandal concerning his behaviour during a visit to Germany. According to [[Newspapers in Germany|German newspaper]] [[Bild]] Lutsenko was detained at [[Frankfurt Airport]] by the [[German police]] in a state of acute alcohol intoxication. The Ukrainian Interior Ministry dismissed these allegations.  According to the information of the Ministry, on 4 May 2009 the Interior Ministry's delegation was detained at the Frankfurt airport during document checks, and missed the flight.  The flight crew refused to take them on board. The delegation decided to catch the next flight. "There were no handcuffs, no drunken conflict," the department said. On 12 May 2009 Yuri Lutsenko sent in his resignation from the post of interior minister. In his [[letter of resignation]] the Minister described the incident that happened in [[Frankfurt]], and stressed that the German police had officially apologized to the Ukrainian delegation for this incident; but that despite this, German mass media disseminated false publications, which were later re-published by Ukrainian media. He said none of these publications mentioned the apologies of the German police. Lutsenko was confident that a dirty campaign had been waged against him in Ukraine. The aim of the campaign, according to him, was to destabilize the work of the Interior Ministry.&lt;ref name=incident&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315132.html Lutsenko sent in his resignation from post of Interior Minister], [[UNIAN]] (12 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ukrainian Parliament]] has to agree with the resignation of a Minister before the Minister can leave her/his post. On 15 May 2009 it passed a resolution, stipulating to address the government with a request to suspend Yuri Lutsenko from the post of the Interior Minister of Ukraine until the "drunken incident" is investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315779.html Verkhovna Rada asks government to suspend Lutsenko from post], [[UNIAN]] (15 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 12 May 2009 till 14 May 2009 and again on 15 May 2009 faction members of the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|oppositional]] [[Party of Regions]] blocked the [[Ukrainian parliament]]'s rostrum and presidium demanding the resignation of Lutsenko.  They placed (in the session hall) posters with inscriptions: "A Drunkard Minister is a shame for Ukraine", "Drunk policeman is a criminal" and "Drunk Minister –a politician?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315138.html Party of Regions MPs blocked parliament’s rostrum and presidium], [[UNIAN]] (12 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blocked/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/13810/ Regions Party unblocks parliament, break until Friday announced] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229123417/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/13810/ |date=29 February 2012 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (14 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315745.html Party of Regions again blocks parliament’s rostrum and presidium], [[UNIAN]] (15 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315784.html Lutsenko about Yanukovych: he was a convict, and he will die as convict], [[UNIAN]] (15 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on 12 May 2009, Lutsenko claimed he would sue Bild. According to Lutsenko, the publication does not contain "any true things, any references to documents or real officials".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315155.html Lutsenko to sue Bild, which published story about drunken incident], [[UNIAN]] (12 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] considered his appeal for resignation "a logical step, which should be made ...

"I may state that the son of the Interior Minister is a child ill with cancer; he underwent a very serious operation. This child is taking special medicines that are incompatible with alcohol drinking. Besides, no tests were made. I'm confident that this child had nothing in common at all with alcohol.

On 15 May 2009 the Ukrainian parliament passed a resolution asking the government to hold a seven-day official investigation into the events at Frankfurt Airport (first deputy [interior] minister Mykhailo Kliuyev served as acting Minister that period).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/41597/ Speaker:Lutsenko suspended as Ukraine's interior minister], [[Kyiv Post]] (18 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/41499/ Kliuyev to serve as Ukraine's interior minister during Lutsenko's suspension from duty], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; After that Lutsenko resumed at his post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/42263/ Lutsenko says he will resume fulfilling duties as interior minister], [[Kyiv Post]] (27 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov''' ({{lang-uk|Юрій Олександрович Мєшков}}, {{lang-ru|Юрий Александрович Мешков}} (''Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov''); born October 25, 1945) is a former [[Crimea|Crimean]] politician and a leader of the pro-Russian movement in [[Crimea]]. Yuriy Meshkov served as the only [[President of Crimea]] (the [[autonomous republic]] of Ukraine that was unilaterally  [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annaxed by of Russia in 2014]]) from 1994 to 1995.

Eleven days after his first return to Crimea since 1995, Meshkov was [[deportation|deported]] from Ukraine on July 13, 2011 with the restriction of entry for 5 years.&lt;ref name="13 July 2011 MD"/&gt;

==Biography==
Yuri Meshkov was born on October 25, 1945 in [[Synelnykove]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130412225637/http://data.synthesis.ie/site_media/trec/FBIS/FBIS3-24004.txt Meshkov Comments on Kiev, Moscow Talks], [[Vremya (MN)]] (February 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (now [[Ukraine]]) to a Ukrainian-born mother and a native [[Kuban Cossack]] [[Russia]]n father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/ukrregions/data/118.html|title=Meshkov Yuriy Aleksandrovich|accessdate=2009-02-24|publisher=AP Крым|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labyrinth.ru/content/card.asp?cardid=19036|title=MESHKOV Yuriy Aleksandrovich|accessdate=2009-02-24|work=labyrinth.ru|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Simferopol]] where he finished high school. When he was about eight years old the region of Crimea was officially transferred from the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. His military obligation he served in the [[Border Guard]]. In 1967 (in some sources 1977) he graduated from the Law School of [[Moscow State University]]. Until 1982 he worked as a detective and then as the head detective in the office of the District's Attorney. From 1982 to 1985 he spent time on the science-researching yacht ''Skif''. After 1985 and until 1990 worked privately as a judicial consultant. At that time he also was one of the leaders of the Crimea department of the All-Union historical-enlighting society "[[Memorial (organization)|Memorial]]", and the president of the Crimean Federation of [[kickboxing]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 1990, Meshkov was elected as a deputy to the [[Supreme Council of Crimea]] (the republic's parliament). There he became the co-founder of the RDK Party (Republican movement of Crimea). In 1994 he stood at the helm of the electoral bloc "Russia" for the republican presidential elections where he easily defeated in the second round of elections [[Mykola Bahrov]] who ran as the independent. [[Mykola Bahrov]] at that time was the head of the Supreme Council of Crimea. During the second round of the [[Crimean presidential election, 1994|1994 Crimean presidential elections]], Yuriy Meshkov won with 72.9 percent and elected as the republic's only president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly-weu.org/en/documents/sessions_ordinaires/rpt/2001/1761.pdf|title=New developments in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine|accessdate=2007-08-07|date=4 December 2001|format=PDF|work=Assembly of WEU|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bohlen1994"&gt;Bohlen, Celestine (March 23, 1994).

His main political platform was to facilitate much closer relationships with the [[Russian Federation]] up to the possible reunification of [[Crimea]] with [[Russia]]. Meshkov tried to initiate a military-political union with Russia and completely disregarded opinions of the [[Ukrainian government]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He also tried to force the rotation of the [[Russian currency]], issue Russian passports to the [[Crimians|Crimean]] population, and even transfer Crimea to the same [[time zone]] as [[Moscow]]. Due to the unforeseen resistance from the local opposition, Meshkov only managed in putting his autonomous republic into [[UTC+3|Moscow time zone]]. He also appointed the vice prime-minister, the [[Russians|Russian]] economist [[Yevgeny Saburov]], who virtually became the head of the government. And then argued when was confronted by other government officials regarding the legitimacy of his appointee who did not even have a Ukrainian passport. Due to that Yevgeny Saburov was forced to resign. After that he managed to paralyze the work of the Supreme Council of Crimea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 1995, the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] scrapped the Crimean Constitution and abolished the post of president on March 17, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada law]]|number=93/95-вр|law=92%2F95%2D%E2%F0|name=On the termination of the Constitution and some laws of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea|date=1995-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytstaff1995"&gt;Staff report (March 19, 1995).

Then Meshkov went to [[Moscow]] ([[Russia]]), where he taught at the Moscow university.&lt;ref name="13 July 2011 MD"/&gt; He did not return to Crimea till 2 July 2011 because his ex-wife (Lyudmyla) had died (on 28 May 2011).&lt;ref name="13 July 2011 MD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://newdaynews.ru/crimea/333398.html В Симферополе погибла жена президента Республики Крым (ВИДЕО) Активистка русского движения выпала из окна ''In Simferopol, the president's wife died of the ARC (VIDEO) Russian activist movement fell out of the window''], (28 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; At a 7 July 2011 press conference, he called for an referendum on restoring the [[Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Constitution of Crimea]] 1992 version, which actually declared Crimea an sovereign state.&lt;ref name="13 July 2011 MD"/&gt; Meshkov also stated then that he ruled out the possibility of his participation in the political life of Crimea because of the need to change citizenship; but instead would participate in "the work of social organizations".&lt;ref name=traitorCM&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://newdaynews.ru/odessa/338544.html Мешков: Русским движением в Крыму управляют предатели ''Meshkov: Russian movement in Crimea run by traitors''], (7 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated "the Russian movement in Crimea is divided and overrun by random people and traitors".&lt;ref name=traitorCM/&gt; The District Administrative Court of Crimea controlled by Ukraine at that time [[deported]] Meshkov from Ukraine with the restriction of entry for 5 years on 13 July 2011.&lt;ref name="13 July 2011 MD"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2011/07/13/6384087/ ЕКС-ПРЕЗИДЕНТА КРИМУ ВИСЛАЛИ З УКРАЇНИ ''Ex-President of Crimea sent FROM UKRAINE''], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (13 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia]], Meshkov visited the peninsular. Although he had conflicts with other members of the pro-Russian movement in Crimea in the 90s, his merits were finally recognized and in 2014 he was awarded a medal "For return of Crimea".
