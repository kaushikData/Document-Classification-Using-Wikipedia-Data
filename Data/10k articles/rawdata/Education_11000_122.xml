'''American Indian Public Charter School''' or '''AIPCS''' is an [[Oakland, California]] [[charter school|charter]] [[middle school]] with predominantly low-income, minority students. It opened in 1996 and struggled over the next few years until a turnaround after 2000 brought up enrollment numbers and test scores. 

By 2005, the AIPCS students achieved test scores superior those of most public schools in the state. Its principal, [[Ben Chavis (educator)|Ben Chavis]] ([[Lumbee]]), a Native American educator, believed that minority students were best served by high expectations for strong attendance and discipline, as well as regular homework and summer school. Chavis was criticized for some of his methods. In 2007, AICPS became the first public school in Oakland to win the [[National Blue Ribbon Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Katy.

The [[American Indian Model Schools]] charter system developed from the AIPCS in order to expand the offerings to students. Since 2007, under new management, it has operated three schools in the city, two middle schools (one had grades K-4 added in 2012), and a high school, [[American Indian Public High School]]. The charter for the AIMS schools was threatened in 2012 because of discoveries of financial mismanagement and concerns about leadership. Although the Oakland School District voted to revoke the charter, the school system gained a preliminary injunction that allowed it to operate the three schools. With new leaders, it gained a 5-year renewal of its charter in 2013.

Other irregularities were reported in 2012 as the result of a state "extraordinary audit" of the second middle school, AIPCS II. There were allegations of additional mismanagement and fraud. In March 2017 former principal Ben Chavis was indicted by the federal government on six felony counts for money laundering and mail fraud based on his financial activities with the AIMS schools. He will be tried in federal district court in [[San Francisco]].

==History==
AIPCS was chartered by the [[Oakland Unified School District]] (OUSD) in 1996 with the mission of improving the performance of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] students in the city. As a charter public school, AIPCS was free to students and had considerable autonomy. Once located in a converted church in [[Laurel, Oakland, California|Oakland's Laurel District]], the school moved to 171 12th Street. The high school is located at 746 Grand Avenue. 

Since 2007, the charter school district is known as AIMS, [[American Indian Model Schools]]. The first school had a predominantly Native American student population at its founding and it focused on Native American culture. Classes included cultural elements such as traditional bead-making and [[Native American drums|drumming]].&lt;ref name=expressdrum&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Waukazoo, one of the founders of the AIPCS, said that he withdrew from the school board because it did not sufficiently emphasize basic educational skills. He said "They were doing too many fuzzy, warm things like bead-making classes and [[Native American drumming|drum]] classes. Those are good hobbies, but our kids need to learn to read and write. I felt it was doing more harm than good."&lt;ref name=expressdrum/&gt; 

By 2001, the school was failing. Enrollment dropped to 34&lt;ref name=enroll&gt;Enrollment was never high in the early years, starting with 42 student and peaking at 68 in 1998-99. In 1999-00 it bottomed out at 18. From 2001 to 2009 it never dipped below 100, settling at around 180 students [http://data1.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/DQ/EnrTimeRptSch.aspx?cYear=1996-97&amp;Level=School&amp;cName=AMERICAN+INDIAN+PUBL&amp;cCode=6113807&amp;dCode=0161259]&lt;/ref&gt; and test scores were abysmal.&lt;ref name=expressdrum/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; That year, educator [[Ben Chavis (educator)|Ben Chavis]] ([[Lumbee]] from North Carolina) and a former faculty member at [[San Francisco State University]], became the school principal and initiated numerous changes. Chavis, who had experience as a public school principal, was recruited from Arizona, where he was serving as superintendent of schools at the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation]]. 

Chavis replaced most of the school's staff, eliminated bilingual education and Native American cultural content from the curriculum,&lt;ref name="Aboutschool2"&gt;Landsberg, Mitchell.

The principal is the coach," said Ben Chavis.// Chip Johnson, "A charter on success in Oakland", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 American Indian Public Charter School had seven teachers. The student teacher ratio was 25 to one. Most of the teachers were in their twenties. During that year, Chavis said that the few teachers who were not credentialed were enrolled in credentialing programs.&lt;ref name="Sebastianhard2"&gt;Sebastian, Simone. "HARD LINE, TOP SCHOOL." ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 16 December 2005. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/16/MNGAKG93SS1.DTL&amp;ao=2 2]. Retrieved on September 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005 AIPCS paid each first-year teacher an annual salary of $42,000 and allowed for a $1,500 bonus at the end of the school year. The annual salary of an entry-level teacher in the [[Oakland Unified School District]] was $37,000 during that year.&lt;ref name="Sebastianhard2"/&gt;

In the years that followed, the school's enrollment increased &lt;ref name=enroll/&gt; and test scores dramatically improved, with the school becoming one of the highest achievers in the state. During the same time period, the percentage of students identifying as American Indian at the school decreased to less than 5%, following the general trend in Oakland's public schools. Students included higher numbers of African Americans, Latino, and Asian Americans; by 2012, students in the three schools of the AIM system were 90% Asian American. 

In 2007, the AIPCS board expanded its operation, and founded the [[American Indian Model Schools]] system (see related article.) It opened a second middle school campus, AIPCS II, and a high school, the American Indian Public High School (AIPHS). In the same year, Chavis resigned as head of school after several controversies, but he was retained by the board in an executive role until January 2012.

&lt;!-- Move this material to Model Schools system article --&gt;
On March 20, 2013, the Oakland School Board in a 4 - 3 vote decided to revoke the three schools' charters. This included the charter for the AIPCS elementary school attended by Chavis' own children.&lt;ref name=eastbaytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2013/03/22/oaklands-american-indian-model-schools-to-seek-new-charter-after-ousd-board-revokes-charter/|title=Oakland’s American Indian Model Schools to seek new charter after OUSD board revokes charter|website=www.insidebayarea.com|date=22 March 2013|author=Bay Area News Group|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 2013, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo granted the school system a preliminary injunction, allowing all three campuses to remain open.&lt;ref name=tasion&gt;{{cite web|last=Kwamilele|first=Tasion|title=American Indian Model Schools to Remain Open|url=http://oaklandnorth.net/2013/07/15/american-indian-model-schools-to-remain-open/|work=Oakland North|publisher=UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational approach==
AIPCS employs a "back-to-basics, squared" approach to schooling. Students spend their academic school day in a self-contained classroom with one teacher. In theory, this teacher stays with these students through their three years at AIPCS, but in practice, high teacher turnover makes this impossible.

AIPCS adheres to the American Indian Model (AIM), the focus of which is excellent student attendance.&lt;ref name=mission&gt;[http://www.americanindianmodel.org/AIM/Mission.html American Indian Model school's mission statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903221656/http://www.americanindianmodel.org/AIM/Mission.html |date=2011-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this, originally AIPCS gave cash awards of up to $100 to students who attend every school day for a year&lt;ref name=success&gt;{{citation
|first=Chip
|last=Johnson
|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]
|title=A charter on success in Oakland
|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/08/23/BAGPH8CQRC1.DTL|date=August 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims yearly attendance rates as high as 99.6%.&lt;ref name=st8talk&gt;StraightTalk with Kathy Weppner, WBEN, March 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The school day at AIPCS begins with three hours of Language Arts and Mathematics, followed by a short lunch period (twenty minutes). Time between classes is intentionally minimal; the school estimates that this adds a week's worth of classroom time per year.

Students are assigned at least 2 hours of homework every night. Students with incomplete work are liable for a detention after school. Struggling students who show little to no improvement over the school year may be retained; one student was held back for earning a "B" in math. All students are required to attend [[summer school]].

The student [[dress code]] is khaki- or navy-colored pants and white, collared shirts. Makeup and jewelry are not permitted.

The school had minimal lab equipment in 2012, and science was taught mostly through textbooks. Under Chavis, the school had no televisions, as he believed they led to mischief. The school offers music, performance art, study hall, and club activities after school.

Andrew J. Coulson, Director of the Center for Educational Freedom, says that AIPCS has the formula for maximizing academic achievement for poor minority students: [AIPCS] "instills in the school environment those cultural characteristics necessary for academic success that are missing in the home".&lt;ref name=iq/&gt;

===Physical education===
[[Physical education]] at AIPCS was offered for forty minutes each school day, and consists of primarily [[calisthenics]] and [[running]]. Students do not play traditional games such as [[basketball]], [[American football|football]] or [[baseball]]. According to the AIPCS website, its students in 2007-2008 significantly outperform the [[Oakland Unified School District]] average on multiple measures of physical fitness, including aerobic capacity, flexibility, and multiple measures of strength.&lt;ref name=aipcs_fit&gt;[http://www.aimschools.org/aipcs_physical_fitness.shtml AIPCS Physical Fitness Results, 2007-2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924031822/http://www.aimschools.org/aipcs_physical_fitness.shtml |date=2009-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discipline===
AIPCS disciplinary procedures are in line with the California Education Code. Students who are disruptive, submit incomplete work, or misbehave in other ways are assigned an hour of detention after school. If the student commits a second infraction in the same week, he or she will get an additional hour of detention and four hours of Saturday School.

Other discipline is more unorthodox. For example, Chavis, with parental permission, shaved the head of a student who was accused of stealing, in front of the entire school. In other cases, he punished a girl by making her clean the boys' bathroom, and forced some students to wear embarrassing signs.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news

Not all AIPCS staff adhere to the methods used by Chavis.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Following his departure in 2012, the school administrators eliminated or toned down some of the more unorthodox disciplinary methods.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

==Chavis' conservative philosophy==
{{quote |We are looking for hard working people who believe in free market capitalism. . . . Multi-cultural specialists, ultra liberal zealots, and college-tainted oppression liberators need not apply.|AIPCS teacher recruiting statement}}

Chavis summed up his beliefs in 2007 that liberal thinkers hurt minority students:&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

{{quote|They have no standards for minorities. They're like, you know, let's let them get freedom. Let's understand their learning style. Let's give them multiculturalism. And no discipline, no structure, no game plan. So they're destroying us. They've destroyed a whole generation. They've wiped out many more people than the [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] has.|Ben Chavis}}

==Test scores==
From 2000 to 2006, the school's [[Academic Performance Index (California public schools)|Academic Performance Index (API)]] more than doubled. (API scores range from a minimum of 200 possible points to a maximum of 1000 possible.)
* In 2001, AIPCS had an API of 440, near worst among Oakland middle schools.
* In 2006, AIPCS had an API of 967. This was the eighth-highest in the state, where the median API is roughly 750, and highest in the state among those schools serving mostly low-income children, which typically score around 650 on the measure.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; In the same year, the federal government named AIPCS one of the top 250 schools in the country.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;
* In 2010, AIPCS had an API of 988 - making it the highest-performing middle school in California.

In 2009, the school's 41 8th graders' had the following scores: 
{{cst_scores |eng=100|math=100|sci=98|hist=93|score_url=http://star.cde.ca.gov/star2009/ViewReport.asp?ps=true&amp;lstTestYear=2009&amp;lstTestType=C&amp;lstCounty=01&amp;lstDistrict=61259-0106&amp;lstSchool=6113807&amp;lstGroup=1&amp;lstSubGroup=1}}

Note: All AIPCS 8th grade students take Algebra I in the 8th grade, while many California students do not take Algebra I until their first year of high school.

For comparison, test scores of nearby schools were:

===High school scores===
As of 2009 AIPHS students have also performed very well on standardized tests. Roughly 90% of AIPHS students score at proficient or advanced levels on most subjects, with lower scores in Chemistry and Earth Science.&lt;ref name=aiphsstar&gt;[http://star.cde.ca.gov/star2009/ViewReport.asp?ps=true&amp;lstTestYear=2009&amp;lstTestType=C&amp;lstCounty=01&amp;lstDistrict=61259-0765&amp;lstSchool=0111856&amp;lstGroup=1&amp;lstSubGroup=1 American Indian Public High School STAR report for 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, AIPHS graduated its first senior class.

But, he was skeptical about AIPCS' high test scores, saying that in his experience, such dramatic score improvements seldom stood up to scholarly scrutiny. He proposed six questions to be asked, such as whether the scores had been influenced by the "practice effect." He predicted that the apparent test score improvements at AIPCS under Chavis would prove much less impressive once such questions had been answered.&lt;ref name=skeptic&gt;{{citation

According to 2009 reporting by the ''Los Angeles Times'' and ''Mother Jones'', the teachers' union president said that AIPCS was known for "cherry-picking" - that is, recruiting students who would do well and dropping those students who did not perform well academically.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Betty Olson-Jones, president of the Oakland Education Association, a teachers' union, said "AIPCS had a reputation among the local public schools as being very interested in kind of recruiting kids who are going to do well, and getting rid of kids who won't," ''Landsberg, Mitchell (May 31, 2009).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIPCS denied the allegations. 

The ''LA Times'' noted that half of the 6th-grade students performing poorly in 2007 had left the school before graduation at grade 8. Thirty-nine of the 51 students who started in 2006 completed their middle school years with AIPCS. All the students who entered below-grade level and stayed through the 8th grade did improve their standings.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Charles Murray had noted in his blog that the failure to take into account the attrition of poorly performing students, who have dropped out of a school, is often the most decisive indicator that a school's evaluation has been inadequate.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:AIPCS ethnicities.png|thumb|300px|AIPCS ethnic breakdown by year]]

By 2007-2008, the AIPCS student body demographics had changed. The approximately 180 students represented the following ethnic groups:
* 46% Asian
* 23% African-American
* 22% Latino
* 3% American Indian/Alaskan Native
* &lt; 2% Caucasian, Pacific Islander, Filipino

Approximately 97% of AIPCS students in 2007-2008 were "socioeconomically disadvantaged"&lt;ref name=sarc&gt;AIPCS School Accountability Report Card for 2007-2008: {{cite web |url=http://www.aimschools.org/pdf/SARC_2007-2008_AIPCS_English.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230634/http://www.aimschools.org/pdf/SARC_2007-2008_AIPCS_English.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest years, the school had a larger American Indian population and smaller Asian population.&lt;ref name=sarc04&gt;AIPCS School Accountability Report Card for 2003-2004: http://www.aipcs.org/sarc/AIPCS-SARC-%2803-04%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sarc05&gt;AIPCS School Accountability Report Card for 2004-2005: http://www.aipcs.org/sarc/AIPCS-SARC-%2804-05%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sarc06&gt;AIPCS School Accountability Report Card for 2005-2006: http://www.aipcs.org/sarc/AIPCS-SARC-%2805-06%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007 the [[American Indian Model Schools]] system opened AIPCS II, located in [[Chinatown, Oakland|Oakland's Chinatown neighborhood]]; 67% of its students were Asian. In 2005-2006 the entering students came to the middle school almost exclusively from the nearby public [[Lincoln Elementary School (Oakland, California)|Lincoln Elementary School]]. Its students have had high test scores and are predominantly Asian.&lt;ref name=denial/&gt;&lt;ref name=lincoln&gt;{{citation |title=Chinatown school beating odds

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have suggested that AIPCS' continued success is due largely to this demographic shift and the success of its Asian student population. But the ''LA Times'' reported in 2009 that the school's Asian, African-American, and Latino students performed similarly on standardized tests.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

AIPCS staff says the school attracts a representative sample of students from local elementary schools. But  California's Office of Charter Schools noted that AIPCS' demographics were out of line with those in the surrounding [[Oakland Unified School District]]'s jurisdiction. In the total district, Asian students made up 14% of the student population, and African American and Latino students each made up 36% of the population. The differences in the AIMS schools could be the result of its recruiting practices.&lt;ref name=denial&gt;[http://ousd.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=472785&amp;GUID=4E466A19-C6E4-43D2-9EE8-66A21F7F3F4F AIPCS Charter Denied], OUSD Legistar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances==
From 2001 to 2008, AIPCS spent under $8,000 per student-year, which was less than half as much per student-year as the surrounding [[Oakland Unified School District]].&lt;ref name=chaviscnn&gt;{{citation |title=Interview: Who Says Schools Need More Money?

==Chavis controversies==
When Chavis was the principal at AIPCS and head of the AIMS system, he generated considerable controversy. 

===Use of racially and sexually charged statements===
As reported by the ''LA Times'' in 2009, Chavis tended to call all non-Caucasian students, including African Americans, "darkies."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Chavis earlier told the ''East Bay Express'', "I use 'darkie' every day, I use it in the context that I'm Indian and I'm black.

Chavis was reported as allegedly having pushed a teacher down a flight of stairs while calling her a "fucking bitch", "stupid bitch", as she tried to retrieve her violin after he fired her; allegedly called his own niece a "slut" and a "lying bitch", and threatened to kill her; and allegedly asked one of the AIPCS female students if a male student "was still trying to suck your titties", which he denied.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

In 2007 Chavis allegedly called a [[Mills College]] [[graduate student]] "a fucking black minority punk" after he showed up fifteen minutes late to a group visit at the school, saying that the student was a "worthless piece of (expletive) people have been making excuses for".&lt;ref name=madman&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Chavis said that he called the grad student a "dumbass minority," and said "he was an embarrassment to his race."&lt;ref name=express/&gt; He saw no reason to hold his guests to a different standard than AIPCS students, who receive an hour detention if they arrive one second late to school. "He came late. White people are on time. What does he think, there's black time? Mexican time? Indian time? The clock is white."&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

The evening of the incident with the Mills College team, Chavis told the AIPCS board his intention to step down from his position.&lt;ref name=chavisleaves&gt;{{citation |title=Oakland charter school principal steps down

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admissions controversies===
California charter schools are required either to accept all applicants, or, if they have more applicants than capacity, to hold a [[lottery]] to determine entrants. AIPCS has never held a lottery. The AIMS board was denied a petition to open a new school in the fall of 2008, in part because AIPCS was "unable to describe" their selection process. AIPCS staff stated they had never needed to hold a lottery because they had never had more applicants than seats.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; But in the same petition, AIPCS stated its primary motivation for opening an additional school was to serve the many families wishing to enroll that the existing schools could not accommodate.&lt;ref name=denial/&gt;

In 2006, an African-American parent filed a complaint stating that AIPCS told her there was no room for her son and refused to place him on the school's waiting list, even while it was accepting applications from white students. Chavis allegedly told a Caucasian parent that her son would be placed at the top of the school's waiting list because there were too many "darkies" and Asians enrolled in the school. If true, AIPCS violated federal and state laws, which prohibit public schools, including charters, from discriminating by race.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

In July 2011, the AIPCS governing board voted Dr. Chavis into an executive position to help with the expansion of the charter model school system. At a board meeting in January 2012, the board announced Dr. Chavis’ resignation and thanked him for his service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFHzGKVit3o|title=AIPCS BOARD MEETING Conflict of Interest Concerns|date=15 January 2012|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 "Extraordinary audit" by the state ==
In August 2011, California’s Fiscal and Crisis Management Team announced it would conduct an extraordinary audit of AIPCS. The audit focused on management of a federal [[ASES]] grant for an after-school program, facilities lease and rent expenditures, and the Political Reform Act of 1974, regarding conflict-of-interest laws.

In early June 2012, the FCMAT published the results of its audit. Key findings in the 65-page document note conclusive documentation of fraud by Chavis in rental agreements, funds siphoned from the SAIL summer program, and bidding for on-site construction projects.  The report also noted the lack of fiduciary responsibility by the AIPCS governing board.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/fcmat/AlamedaCOEfinalreport6121292.pdf |title=Alameda County Office of Education — Extraordinary Audit of the American Indian Model Charter Schools |author=FCMAT |date=12 June 2012 |website=wwwstatic.kern.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611085204/http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/fcmat/AlamedaCOEfinalreport6121292.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Michael Stember resigned from the board of the charter school system between April and June. Jean Martinez became president of the AIPCS governing board.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oakland schools' officials may face criminal probe| url=http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Oakland-schools-officials-may-face-criminal-probe-3632797.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Jill | last=Tucker | date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The allegations against American Indian charter schools officials include $3.7 million in payments [over 4 years] to businesses owned by founder Ben Chavis and his wife, including money for rent, storage fees, construction projects and the administration of summer school programs.”&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; 

That year Chavis returned to his home state of North Carolina. His records in California were seized in 2013 and he was under continuing investigation by the FBI and IRS for his financial affairs.&lt;ref name=

==Threat of charter revocation==

In March 2013, the OUSD Board voted to revoke the AIMS charter. The Alameda County Board of Education has an option to overturn the OUSD decision, and the California Board of Education serves as a final point of appeal. If an appeal is not successful, the revocation will come into effect on June 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ousd.k12.ca.us/AIMS |title=Recommendation on American Indian Model Schools |date=20 March 2013 |website=www.ousd.k12.ca.us |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223084018/http://www.ousd.k12.ca.us/AIMS |archivedate=23 February 2014 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eastbaytimes/&gt; After Chavis resigned, the school worked for a year to revoke the appeal and continue its charter. Before 2015 a new superintendent was selected.

The '''Arab Academy for Science, Technology &amp; Maritime Transport''' ({{lang-ar|الأكاديمية العربية للعلوم والتكنولوجيا والنقل البحري}}) is a regional university operated by the [[Arab League]] which runs programs in [[marine transportation]], [[Business school|business]], and [[engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=AAST|first1=Official page|title=AAST Official FB page|url=https://www.facebook.com/AAST.Officialpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Arab Academy for Science and Technology==
AASTMT's name has become the Arab Academy for Science and Technology: "A university specialized in maritime transport" and its certificates have been made equivalent to those granted by Egyptian universities.

==The Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (AASTMT)==
Over five years (from 1991 to 1996), the educational and maritime training services were funded by the Egyptian Ministry of Transport. Consequently, in 1992, the AASTMT was granted the most modern training ship, "Aida 4", as a donation from the Japanese government.

In 1994 the AASTMT was awarded the most modern simulator in the world (completed in two phases) from the USA administration. Cooperation with the American counterpart continued to found an advanced technology center. Scholarships have exceeded 120,000 for students from 58 countries. 

The World Bank has chosen the AASTMT from four international organizations representing the Norwegian Swedish Group, the Hungarian Group and the Danish Group to develop maritime education in Bangladesh by a limited tender. The AASTMT proposal was chosen as the best both technically and financially to carry out the project.

In October 1996 modified its title from: "The Arab Academy for Science and Technology: A university specialized in maritime transport." to "The Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport" (AASTMT).

==Certificates==
The AASTMT has obtained the approval of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Universities for considering the holders of the High Seas Second Officer eligible for the affiliation with any Egyptian University or any 4-year higher education entity which a student can join after high school. 

The AASTMT has flexibility in the process of transferring marine officers from vocational studies to that which allows them to obtain the bachelor''s degree in Marine Navigation Technology. This is due to the application of the American Credit Hours System. In order to show the importance of this achievement, the holder of the High Seas Captain certificate, when sent to the United Kingdom to obtain the bachelor''s degree, had to start his studies over regardless of his previous studies. However, due to the flexibility of the current system the AASTMT applies, it opened the door for its officers to obtain the bachelor''s degree as well as the eligibility certificate in four years.

A report which was prepared by the Japan Transport Cooperation Association in March 1997 tells of the AASTMT progress and the flexibility with which it switched to science and technology then to science, technology and maritime transport. AASTMT has made its certificates equivalent to those granted by Egyptian universities in the fields of engineering and management.

==Services and student activities==
Services include dormitories, hostels and restaurants. The girls hostel can accommodate up to 100 girls.

Seminars and lectures are organized by the Cultural Activities Department in addition to trips and athletic activities. Students organize the annual Parents'' Day.

==Community service programmes and continuous education==
AASTMT offers educational programmes to serve the community of Alexandria. The programmes enhance the skills of students in language, computing, secretarial work, aviation tickets reservation, marketing and management. 

The programmes start-over every three months, and run all year round. They are carried out at the AASTMT headquarters in Miami, Sidi Bishr and downtown. The programmes are offered according to an evening schedule. The courses are sometimes designed for groups of employees in a company or organizations. The estimated number of those benefiting from these programmes throughout the year, ranges from 15,000 to 20,000 Alexandrians. There are summer courses for the education of children which benefit around 5,000 children.

'''Arimaa''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Arimaa.ogg|ə|'|r|iː|m|ə}} ({{Respell|ə|REE|mə}}) is a two-player [[Abstract strategy|strategy]] [[board game]] that was designed to be playable with a standard chess set and difficult for computers while still being easy to learn and fun to play for humans. Since 2004, the Arimaa community has held three annual tournaments: a [[#World_Championship|World Championship]] (humans only), a [[#World_Computer_Championship|Computer Championship]] (computers only), and the [[#Arimaa_Challenge|Arimaa Challenge]] (human vs. computer). In 2015, the challenge was won decisively by the computer (Sharp by David Wu), with top players agreeing that computers had become better at the game than humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kingpinchess.net/2015/07/arimaa-game-over | title=Arimaa: Game Over?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was a prerequisite for the prize to be awarded, Wu published a paper describing the algorithm and most of ''[[ICGA Journal]]'' Issue 38/1 was dedicated to this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Arimaa | title=Arimaa: ChessProgramming Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm combined traditional [[alpha–beta pruning]] (changing sides every 4 [[Ply (game theory)|ply]]) with [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic functions]] manually written while analysing human expert games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wu |first=David |date=2015 |title=Designing a Winning Arimaa Program |url=http://icosahedral.net/downloads/djwu2015arimaa_color.pdf |journal=[[ICGA Journal]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=19-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arimaa was invented in 2003 by Omar Syed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Syed|first=Omar|author2=Syed, Aamir|year=2003|title=Arimaa – a New Game Designed to be Difficult for Computers|journal=International Computer Games Association Journal|volume=26|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Indian-American computer engineer trained in [[artificial intelligence]]. Syed was inspired by [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|Garry Kasparov's defeat at the hands of the chess computer Deep Blue]] to design a new game which could be played with a standard chess set, would be difficult for computers to play well, but would have rules simple enough for his then four-year-old son Aamir to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arimaa.com/arimaa/forum/cgi/YaBB.cgi?board=talk;action=display;num=1367476894#7|title=Arimaa Forum - plz say more about the design decisions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Arimaa" is "Aamir" spelled backwards plus an initial "a".)

Arimaa has won several awards including ''[[GAMES Magazine]]'' 2011 Best Abstract Strategy Game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesmagazine-online.com/gameslinks/archives.html#2011awards |title=GAMES Game Awards |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6duGEl6Ew?url=http://www.gamesmagazine-online.com/gameslinks/archives.html#2011awards |archivedate=2015-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creative Child Magazine'' 2010 Strategy Game of the Year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murphymonitor.com/articles/templates/news.asp?articleid%3D1436%26zoneid%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203051503/http://www.murphymonitor.com/articles/templates/news.asp?articleid=1436&amp;zoneid=3 |archivedate=2015-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2010 [[Parents' Choice Award|Parents' Choice Approved Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=27805&amp;StepNum=1&amp;award=aw|title=Arimaa|work=Parents' Choice Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been the subject of several [[Computer Arimaa#Research papers|research papers]].

==Rules==
Arimaa is played on an 8×8 board with four trap squares.  There are six kinds of pieces, ranging from elephant (strongest) to rabbit (weakest). Stronger pieces can push or pull weaker pieces, and stronger pieces freeze weaker pieces.  Pieces can be captured by dislodging them onto a trap square when they have no orthogonally adjacent {{boardgloss|friendly}} pieces.

The two players, Gold and Silver, each control sixteen pieces. These are, in order from strongest to weakest: one elephant ([[Image:Arimaa egb74.gif|26px|Elephant]]), one camel ([[Image:Arimaa mgb74.gif|26px|Camel]]), two horses ([[Image:Arimaa hgb74.gif|26px|Horse]]), two dogs ([[Image:Arimaa dgb74.gif|26px|Dog]]), two cats ([[Image:Arimaa cgb74.gif|26px|Cat]]), and eight rabbits {{nowrap|([[Image:Arimaa rgb74.gif|26px|Rabbit]])}}. These may be represented by the king, queen, rooks, bishops, knights, and pawns respectively when one plays using a chess set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arimaa.com/arimaa/learn/rulesIntro.html|title=Arimaa Game Rules|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''Diagram 1'''&lt;br/&gt;The players begin by setting up their pieces however they choose on their home rows.
}}
===Objective===
The main object of the game is to move a rabbit of one's own color onto the home rank of the opponent, which is known as a '''goal'''. Thus Gold wins by moving a gold rabbit to the eighth rank, and Silver wins by moving a silver rabbit to the first rank. However, because it is difficult to usher a rabbit to the goal line while the board is full of pieces, an intermediate objective is to capture opposing pieces by pushing or pulling them into the trap squares.

The game can also be won by capturing all of the opponent's rabbits ('''elimination''') or by depriving the opponent of legal moves ('''immobilization'''). Compared to goal, these are uncommon.
===Setup===
The game begins with an empty board. Gold places the sixteen gold pieces in any configuration on the first and second ranks. Silver then places the sixteen silver pieces in any configuration on the seventh and eighth ranks. Diagram 1 shows one possible initial placement.

|'''Diagram 2'''&lt;br/&gt;In the diagrammed position, if it were Gold's turn to move, Gold could win in three steps: The dog on a6 can push the rabbit on a7 to a8, thereby unfreezing the rabbit on b7, which can step to b8 for the victory.
}}
===Movement===
After the pieces are placed on the board, the players alternate turns, starting with Gold. A turn consists of making one to four steps. With each step a piece may move into an unoccupied square one space left, right, forward, or backward, except that rabbits may not step backward. The steps of a turn may be made by a single piece or distributed among several pieces in any order.

A turn must make a net change to the position. Thus one cannot, for example, take one step forward and one step back with the same piece, effectively passing the turn and evading [[zugzwang]]. Furthermore, one's turn may not create the same position with the same player to move as has been created twice before. This rule is similar to the [[Rules of Go#Repetition|situational super ko rule]] in the [[Go (board game)|game of Go]], which prevents endless loops, and is in contrast to chess where endless loops are considered draws. The prohibitions on passing and repetition make Arimaa a drawless game.

====Pushing and pulling====
The second diagram, from the same game as the initial position above,&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=5641&amp;s=w&lt;/ref&gt; helps illustrate the remaining rules of movement.

A player may use two consecutive steps of a turn to dislodge an opposing piece with a stronger friendly piece which is adjacent in one of the four [[cardinal direction]]s. For example, a player's dog may dislodge an opposing rabbit or cat, but not a dog, horse, camel, or elephant. The stronger piece may ''pull'' or ''push'' the adjacent weaker piece. When pulling, the stronger piece steps into an empty square, and the square it came from is occupied by the weaker piece. The silver elephant on d5 could step to d4 (or c5 or e5) and pull the gold horse from d6 to d5. When pushing, the weaker piece is moved to an adjacent empty square, and the square it came from is occupied by the stronger piece. The gold elephant on d3 could push the silver rabbit on d2 to e2 and then occupy d2. Note that the rabbit on d2 can't be pushed to d1, c2, or d3, because those squares are not empty.

Friendly pieces may not be dislodged. Also, a piece may not push and pull simultaneously. For example, the gold elephant on d3 could not simultaneously push the silver rabbit on d2 to e2 and pull the silver rabbit from c3 to d3. An elephant can never be dislodged, since there is nothing stronger.

====Freezing====
A piece which is adjacent in any cardinal direction to a stronger opposing piece is ''frozen'', unless it is also adjacent to a friendly piece. Frozen pieces may not be moved by the owner, but may be dislodged by the opponent. A frozen piece can freeze another still weaker piece. The silver rabbit on a7 is frozen, but the one on d2 is able to move because it is adjacent to a silver piece. Similarly the gold rabbit on b7 is frozen, but the gold cat on c1 is not. The dogs on a6 and b6 do not freeze each other because they are of equal strength. An elephant cannot be frozen, since there is nothing stronger, but an elephant can be [[b:Arimaa/Introduction to Strategy/Elephant Blockade|blockaded]].

====Capturing====
A piece which enters a trap square is captured and removed from the game unless there is a friendly piece orthogonally adjacent. Silver could move to capture the gold horse on d6 by pushing it to c6 with the elephant on d5. A piece on a trap square is captured when all  adjacent friendly pieces move away. Thus if the silver rabbit on c4 and the silver horse on c2 move away, voluntarily or by being dislodged, the silver rabbit on c3 will be captured.

Note that a piece may voluntarily step into a trap square, even if it is thereby captured. Also, the second step of a pulling maneuver is completed even if the piece doing the pulling is captured on the first step. For example, Silver could step the silver rabbit from f4 to g4 (so that it will no longer support pieces at f3), and then step the silver horse from f2 to f3, which captures the horse; the horse's move could still pull the gold rabbit from f1 to f2.

===Arimaa Challenge===
The Arimaa Challenge was a cash prize of around $10,000 that was to have been available annually until 2020 for the first computer program to win the human-versus-computer Arimaa challenge.&lt;ref name="arimaa challenge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/|title=The Arimaa Challenge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the conditions of the prize, the computer program must run on standard, off-the-shelf hardware.&lt;ref name="arimaa challenge" /&gt;

The Arimaa Challenge has been held twelve times, starting in 2004. Following the third match, Syed changed the format to require the software to win two out of three games against each of three players, to reduce the psychological pressure on individual volunteer defenders. Also Syed called for outside sponsorship of the Arimaa Challenge to build a bigger prize fund.

In the first five challenge cycles, David Fotland, programmer of [[Many Faces of Go]], won the [[#World_Computer_Championship|Arimaa Computer Championship]] and the right to play for the prize money, only to see his program beaten decisively each year. In 2009 Fotland's program was surpassed by several new programs in the same year, the strongest of which was Clueless by Jeff Bacher. Humanity's margin of dominance over computers appeared to widen each year from 2004 to 2008 as the best human players improved, but the 2009 Arimaa Challenge was more competitive. Clueless became the first bot to win two games of a Challenge match.

In 2010, Mattias Hultgren's bot Marwin edged out Clueless in the computer championship. In the Challenge match Marwin became the first bot to win two out of three games against a single human defender, and also the first bot to win three of the nine games overall. In 2011, however, Marwin won only one of the nine games, and that one having received a material handicap.  In 2012 a new challenger, Briareus, became the first program to defeat a top-ten player, sweeping all three games from the fifth-ranked human.  In 2013, however, the humans struck back against Marwin, with #4 and #6 each sweeping including a handicap win, and #31 winning two of three games.  In 2014, the computer bounced back to win two games, albeit no matches.

In 2015, Sharp made a substantial leap in playing strength.  After having scored 6-6 in twelve games against its top two computer rivals the previous year, Sharp went undefeated in the computer tournaments of 2015, including 13-0 against the second- and third-place finishers.  Sharp dominated the pre-Challenge screening against human opponents, winning 27 of 29 games.  In the Challenge itself, Sharp clinched victory in each of the three mini-matches by winning the first six games, finishing 7-2 overall and winning the Arimaa challenge.&lt;ref name="arimaa challenge" /&gt;

'''Karl Volter Boris Gyllenbögel''' (30 March 1884 [[Kauhajoki]] – 22 June 1948 [[Helsinki]]) was a Finnish Colonel, a Diplomat and a principal.

Gyllenbögel's parents were the  police chief Karl Nathanael Gyllenbögel (1859-1926) and Alma Maria Rosenlund (1864-1941).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.com/people/Karl-Volter-Boris-Gyllenb%C3%B6gel/6000000011249624902 Geni.com : Karl Volter Boris Gyllenbögel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyllenbögel addended the [[Hamina Cadet School]], [[Mikhailovskaya Artillery Military Academy|St Petersburg Artillery Institute]] and the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|St Petersburg Academy of War]]. He served in Russia, among others, as [[Chief of Staff]] of the  [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor Nicholas I]], as well as in military positions in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]. 

Gyllenbögel, who was promoted to the [[Russian Imperial Army]] in 1917, was governor of the county of [[Uusimaa Province|Uusimaa]], but resigned in July 1917 after refusing to [[Parliament of Finland|abolish parliament]] on the order of the [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian interim government]]. 

After Finland became independent, Gyllenbögel was appointed Finland's Charge d'Affaires to [[Poland]] in 1919 and he was then Finland's first Envoy in [[Warsaw]] between 1920 and 1921. After that, Gyllenbögel was Finnish Chargé d'Affaires to in [[Moscow]] but returned to Finland in 1922 at the request of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] and [[Antti Hackzell]] was appointed to replace him in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finland.pl/public/default.aspx?nodeid=40908&amp;contentlan=1&amp;culture=fi-FI Suomen Varsovan suurlähetystön historiaa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hspy-fi-bin.directo.fi/@Bin/ad63d3000a3c1cb13bb1757ea76bdb2c/1421432284/application/pdf/120001/Gyllenb%C3%B6gel%20Suomi-Puola%202009-2010.pdf Boris Gyllenbögel : Suomen ensimmäinen lähettiläs Puolassa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkisto.kokoomus.net/kokoomusbiografia/elamakerta-artikkelit/hackzell-antti/ Porvallisen työn arkisto : Antti Hackzell]&lt;/ref&gt;

After her diplomatic career, Gyllenbögel then served as Professor at the  Helsinki Finnish Private School in 1924-1938 and taught  languages  at the school.

According to Gyllenbögel, the school received the nickname "Jylla" and this nickname has survived and its followers until today. The school is nowadays the name of Espoonlahti School and Espoonlahti high school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jylla.fi/jyllan-vaiheita Espoonlahden lukio : Jyllan vaiheita]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jukka Relander |title= Aika Espoonlahden.

The younger brother of Gyllenbögel, Evald Alfons Rafael Gyllenbögel (born 1889) was a Counselor who served as Finland's representative at the [[League of Nations]] and since 1932 as Head of the Political Department of the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/aikalais/1934/0155.html Aikalaiskirja 1934 : Evald Gyllenbögel]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communication apprehension'''  is the level of anxiety triggered by the real or anticipated communication act, as defined by McCroskey.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCroskey|first1=James|last2=Beatty|first2=M.|title=Shyness: Perspectives on research and treatment|date=1986|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York, NY|pages=219–293|url=http://www.jamescmccroskey.com/publications/bookchapters/007_1986_C21.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is connected to the idea of judgment from the audience, and [[self-image]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/publicspeaking/front-matter/publisher-information/|title=Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public Speaking|last1=Creative Commons license|first=|date=2011|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication apprehension, CA, can cause a variety of involuntary responses such as "stomach butterflies", shaking, nausea, sweating, forgetting the information, among many others. The term communication apprehension is usually connected with 'stage fright';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 6|last=Burgoon|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9781135148799|location=|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this response is not necessarily connected with a delivery on a stage or in front of a large audience.&lt;ref name="ED284315"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holbrook|first1=Hilary Taylor|title=Communication Apprehension: The Quiet Student in Your Classroom.|journal=ERIC Digest|date=1987|volume=ERIC Clearinghouse on Reading and Communication Skills Urbana IL.|url=https://www.ericdigests.org/pre-926/quiet.htm|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anxiety can be caused by any of the five forms of communication: [[Intrapersonal communication|intrapersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]], group, public, and [[mass communication]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Types==
There are different types of communication apprehension, each of these types represent a specific or general situation that presents a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] for this anxiety response. McCroskey argues that there are four types of communication apprehension:

===Trait anxiety===
Trait anxiety is considered a personality type, which represents that the individual has an orientation to feel anxiety during the communication act regardless of the situation, audience or context.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Witt, P. L., Brown, K. C., Roberts, J. B., Weisel, J., Sawyer, C., &amp; Behnke, R. (2006, March). Somatic anxiety patterns before, during and after giving a public speech. Southern Communication Journal, 71, 87–100.&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of people will avoid exposing themselves to a communication situation, since their communication apprehension is part of their daily behavior.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/304210263|title=Communication apprehension and individual learning style preference: Correlations and dimensions|last=Dwyer|first=Karen|date=1995|website=The University of Nebraska - Lincoln|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCroskey and Beatty argue that some people have a higher vulnerability factor for communication apprehension due to genetics, also known as [[communibiology]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;McCroskey, J. C.; Beatty, M. J. (2000). "The communibiological perspective: Implications for communication in instruction". ''Communication Education''. '''49''': 1. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03634520009379187 10.1080/03634520009379187].&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers oppose this idea and argue that it can not be solely inherited but rather a personality trait acquired; therefore, it can be changed. However, they can compromise that around 80% of communication apprehension is obtained within our neurological structures, which are determined genetically. Furthermore, only 20% is influenced by an environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Boren, Justin P.; Veksler, Alice E. (2011). [http://justinboren.com/pdf/CRT_v30_n4.pdf "A decade of research exploring biology and communication: The brain, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems"] (PDF). ''Communication Research Trends''. '''30''' (4): 1–31. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] [https://www.worldcat.org/issn/0144-4646 0144-4646].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Meaning that this type of communication apprehension can be improved with practice and other techniques; however, it will not be completely eliminated since it is inherited.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Context anxiety===
Context anxiety triggers communication apprehension due to a specific context. This is considered a psychological response caused by a specific context but not necessarily on others; a person can have no problem talking to her best friend but can get anxiety while talking in front of a class. The most known example for context anxiety is public speaking; almost 70% of students suffer from a certain level of communication apprehension trigger by public speaking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are other contexts that can create a similar response such as speaking in front of class, small group discussions, or meetings.&lt;ref name="ED284315" /&gt;

===Audience anxiety===
Audience anxiety is when a specific individual or group of people creates a problem on communication, or a reverse reaction. For some people, anxiety can be caused by familiar peers, while for others it can be caused by unfamiliar faces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At the beginning of a speech class, the students tend to be fearful since they see new faces which increases the levels of communication apprehension. However, once the students get to know each other they feel comfortable; decreasing or eliminating their levels of apprehension.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Dwyer, Karen Kangas; Carlson, Robert E.; and Dalbey, Jennifer (2003) "Impact of High School Preparation on College Oral Communication Apprehension," Basic Communication Course Annual: Vol. 15 , Article 9. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ecommons.udayton.edu/bcca/vol15/iss1/9&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation anxiety===
Situational anxiety is a psychological reaction of a person due to a specific situation that may not have any relation with the person or context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This anxiety is triggered by a special combination of audience and context that involves different dimensions and creates a unique scenario.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As an example we can see a first date. Although a person may not suffer from communication apprehension; the situation of being with a person that they have feelings for, on a new environment, and being the first time they experience this situation, can increase the stress levels and create communication apprehension.

==PRCA==
The PRCA 10 is a test created to determine the communication shyness of a speaker. This test shows that communication apprehension is not limited to public speaking since it allows you to identify different situations that can trigger anxiety, these situations belong to an apprehension triggered by context, context anxiety.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The four situations that are presented on the test are: group discussion, meetings, interpersonal, and public speaking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This test provides an easy equation to obtain a score for each category, these scoress are compared to the ranges provided at the end of the test; these ranges were obtained by a study of over 40,000 college students and over 3,000 non-students adults provided on a national sample.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By this comparison, the test taker can determine their level of communication apprehension for each scenario, ranking them with a low, moderate or high level of apprehension. The test is able to provide a diagnostic of context anxiety and overall communication apprehension by simply adding the sub scores and comparing the total score.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67550">'''Computer-supported collaborative learning''' ('''CSCL''') is a [[pedagogical]] approach where in learning takes place via social interaction using a computer or through the Internet. This kind of learning is characterized by the sharing and [[learning|construction of knowledge]] among participants using technology as their primary means of communication or as a common resource.&lt;ref name="stahl"&gt;Stahl, G., Koschmann, T., &amp; Suthers, D. (2006). Computer-supported collaborative learning: An historical perspective. In R. K. Sawyer (Ed.), [http://gerrystahl.net/cscl/CSCL_English.pdf Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences] (pp. 409-426). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  CSCL can be implemented in online and classroom learning environments and can take place synchronously or asynchronously.

The study of computer-supported collaborative learning draws on a number of academic disciplines, including [[instructional technology]], [[educational psychology]], [[sociology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[social psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hmelo-Silver, C.E. (2006). Analyzing collaborative learning: Multiple approaches to understanding processes and outcomes. Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Learning sciences, USA, 1059-1065. {{ISBN|0-8058-6174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[collaborative learning]] and [[computer-supported cooperative work|computer supported cooperative work (CSCW)]].

==History==
Interactive computing technology was primarily conceived by academics, but the use of technology in education has historically been defined by contemporary research trends. The earliest instances of software in instruction drilled students using the [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] method that was popular throughout the mid-twentieth century. In the 1970s as [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] gained traction with educators, designers began to envision learning technology that employed artificial intelligence models that could adapt to individual learners.&lt;ref&gt;Koschmann, T. (1996) CSCL: Theory and practice of an emerging paradigm Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer-supported collaborative learning emerged as a strategy rich with research implications for the growing philosophies of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] and [[social cognitivism]].&lt;ref name="resta"&gt;Resta, P. &amp; Laferrière, T. (2007). Technology in Support of Collaborative Learning. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 19, 65–83. {{doi|10.1007/s10648-007-9042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though studies in collaborative learning and technology took place throughout the 1980s and 90s, the earliest public workshop directly addressing CSCL was "Joint Problem Solving and [[Microcomputers]]" which took place in [[San Diego]] in 1983. Six years later in 1989, the term "computer-supported collaborative learning" was used in a [[NATO]]-sponsored workshop in [[Maratea]], Italy.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bannon"&gt;Bannon, Liam J. (1989). [http://www.ul.ie/~idc/library/papersreports/LiamBannon/12/LBMarat.html Issues in computer supported collaborative learning.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126144330/http://www.ul.ie/~idc/library/papersreports/LiamBannon/12/LBMarat.html |date=2011-01-26 }} Chapter to appear in Proceedings of NATO Advanced Workshop on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (Claire O'Malley, Editor) held in Maratea, Italy, Sept. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; A biannual CSCL conference series began in 1995. At the 2002 and 2003 CSCL conferences, the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) was established to run the CSCL and ICLS conference series and the ''International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning'' (''ijCSCL'') and JLS journals.&lt;ref&gt;International Society for the Learning Sciences. (2010). [http://www.isls.org/conferences.html Conferences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061618/http://www.isls.org/conferences.html |date=2011-05-25 }}. Retrieved 10/20/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''ijCSCL'' was established by the CSCL research community and ISLS. It began quarterly publication by Springer in 2006. It is peer reviewed and published both online and in print. Since 2009, it has been rated by ISI as being in the top 10% of educational research journals based on its impact factor.&lt;ref&gt;ijCSCL [http://ijCSCL.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid development of social media technologies and the increasing need of individuals to understand and use those technologies has brought researchers from many disciplines to the field of CSCL.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt; CSCL is used today in traditional and online schools and knowledge-building communities such as [[Wikipedia]].

==Theories==
The field of CSCL draws heavily from a number of learning theories that emphasize that knowledge is the result of learners interacting with each other, sharing knowledge, and building knowledge as a group.  Since the field focuses on collaborative activity and collaborative learning, it inherently takes much from constructivist and social cognitivist learning theories.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt;

===Precursor theories===
The roots of collaborative epistemology as related to CSCL can be found in [[Vygotsky]]'s social learning theory. Of particular importance to CSCL is the theory's notion of internalization, or the idea that knowledge is developed by one's interaction with one's surrounding culture and society.  The second key element is what Vygotsky called the [[Zone of proximal development]]. This refers to a range of tasks that can be too difficult for a learner to master by themselves but is made possible with the assistance of a more skilled individual or teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Kearsley, G. (13 Oct 10). [http://icebreakerideas.com/learning-theories/ The Theory Into Practice Database].&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas feed into a notion central to CSCL: knowledge building is achieved through interaction with others.

[[Cooperative learning]], though different in some ways from collaborative learning, also contributes to the success of teams in CSCL environments. The distinction can be stated as: cooperative learning focuses on the effects of group interaction on individual learning whereas collaborative learning is more concerned with the cognitive processes at the group unit of analysis such as shared meaning making and the joint problem space. The five elements for effective cooperative groups identified by the work of Johnson and Johnson are positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, [[social skills]], and group processing.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R., &amp; Holubec, E. (2002). Circles of learning: Cooperation in the classroom. Edina, MN: Interaction Book Company, p. 95-118, {{ISBN|0-939603-12-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the inherent relationship between cooperation and collaboration, understanding what encourages successful cooperation is essential to CSCL research.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter wrote seminal articles leading to the development of key CSCL concepts: knowledge-building communities and knowledge-building discourse, intentional learning, and expert processes. Their work led to an early collaboration-enabling technology known as the Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE).&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia, M. &amp; Bereiter, C. (1994). Computer support for knowledge building communities. The Journal of the Learning Sciences. 3(3), 265-283.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically for CSCL, their theories were integrated with the design, deployment, and study of the CSCL technology. CSILE later became Knowledge Forum, which is the most widely used CSCL technology worldwide to date.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Other learning theories that provide a foundation for CSCL include [[distributed cognition]], [[problem-based learning]], [[group cognition]], cognitive apprenticeship, and situated learning.  Each of these learning theories focuses on the social aspect of learning and knowledge building, and recognizes that learning and knowledge building involve inter-personal activities including conversation, argument, and negotiation.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt;

===Collaboration theory and [[group cognition]]===
Only in the last 15 to 20 years have researchers begun to explore the extent to which computer technology could enhance the collaborative learning process.  While researchers, in general, have relied on learning theories developed without consideration of computer-support, some have suggested that the field needs to have a theory tailored and refined for the unique challenges that confront those trying to understand the complex interplay of technology and collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="collab"&gt;Stahl, G. (2002). Contributions to a theoretical framework for CSCL. In G. Stahl (Ed.), Computer support for collaborative learning: Foundations for a CSCL community. Proceedings of CSCL 2002 (pp. 62-71). Boulder, CO: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaboration theory, suggested as a system of analysis for CSCL by [[Gerry Stahl]] in 2002-2006, postulates that knowledge is constructed in social interactions such as discourse. The theory suggests that learning is not a matter of accepting fixed facts, but is the dynamic, on-going, and evolving result of complex interactions primarily taking place within communities of people. It also emphasizes that collaborative learning is a process of constructing meaning and that meaning creation most often takes place and can be observed at the group unit of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, G. (2004). [http://GerryStahl.net/cscl/papers/ch16.pdf Building collaborative knowing: Elements of a social theory of CSCL.] In J.-W. Strijbos, P. Kirschner &amp; R. Martens (Eds.), What we know about CSCL: And implementing it in higher education (pp. 53-86). Boston, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of collaboration theory is to develop an understanding of how meaning is collaboratively constructed, preserved, and re-learned through the media of language and artifacts in group interaction. There are four crucial themes in collaboration theory: collaborative knowledge building (which is seen as a more concrete term than "learning"); group and personal perspectives intertwining to create group understanding; mediation by artifacts (or the use of resources which learners can share or imprint meaning on); and interaction analysis using captured examples that can be analyzed as proof that the knowledge building occurred.&lt;ref name="collab" /&gt;

Collaboration theory proposes that technology in support of CSCL should provide new types of media that foster the building of collaborative knowing; facilitate the comparison of knowledge built by different types and sizes of groups; and help collaborative groups with the act of negotiating the knowledge they are building. Further, these technologies and designs should strive to remove the teacher as the bottleneck in the communication process.  In other words, the teacher should not have to act as the conduit for communication between students or as the avenue by which information is dispensed.  Finally, collaboration theory-influenced technologies will strive to increase the quantity and quality of learning moments via computer-simulated situations.&lt;ref name="collab" /&gt;

Stahl extended his proposals about collaboration theory during the next decade with his research on [[group cognition]] [http://GerryStahl.net/elibrary]. In his book on "Group Cognition",&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;Stahl, G. (2006). Group Cognition: Computer support for building collaborative knowledge. Cambridge:MA. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; he provided a number of case studies of prototypes of collaboration technology, as well as a sample in-depth interaction analysis and several essays on theoretical issues related to re-conceptualizing cognition at the small-group unit of analysis. He then launched the [[Virtual Math Teams]] project at the Math Forum, which conducted more than 10 years of studies of students exploring mathematical topics collaboratively online. "Studying VMT"&lt;ref name="SVMT"&gt;Stahl, G. (2009). Studying Virtual Math Teams. New York:NY. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; documented many issues of design, analysis and theory related to this project. The VMT later focused on supporting dynamic geometry by integrating a multi-user version of GeoGebra. All aspects of this phase of the VMT project were described in "Translating Euclid."&lt;ref name="TE"&gt;Stahl, G. (2013). Translating Euclid: Creating a Human-Centered Mathematics. Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, "Constructing Dynamic Triangles Together"&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;Stahl, G. (2016). Constructing dynamic triangles together: The development of mathematical group cognition. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a detailed analysis of how a group of four girls learned about dynamic geometry by enacting a series of group practices during an eight-session longitudinal case study. The VMT project generated and analyzed data at the small-group unit of analysis, to substantiate and refine the theory of group cognition and to offer a model of design-based CSCL research.

==Strategies==
Currently, CSCL is used in instructional plans in classrooms both traditional and online from primary school to post-graduate institutions. Like any other instructional activity, it has its own prescribed practices and strategies which educators are encouraged to employ in order to use it effectively. Because its use is so widespread, there are innumerable scenarios in the use of CSCL, but there are several common strategies that provide a foundation for group cognition.

One of the most common approaches to CSCL is [[collaborative writing]]. Though the final product can be anything from a research paper, a Wikipedia entry, or a short story, the process of planning and writing together encourages students to express their ideas and develop a group understanding of the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Heimbuch, S., &amp; Bodemer, D. (2015). Let's Talk about Talks: Supporting Knowledge Exchange Processes on Wiki Discussion Pages. In ''AAAI Technical Report on Wikipedia, a Social Pedia: Research Challenges and Opportunities (ICWSM-15)'' (Vol. WS-15-19), 56–61. Palo Alto, USA: AAAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools like [[blogs]], [[interactive whiteboards]], and custom spaces that combine free writing with communication tools can be used to share work, form ideas, and write synchronously.&lt;ref&gt;Onrubia, J. &amp; Engel, A. (2009). Strategies for Collaborative Writing and Phases of Knowledge Construction in CSCL Environments. Computers &amp; Education, 53(4), 1256-1265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikis"&gt;Larusson, J., &amp; Alterman, R. (2009). Wikis to support the "collaborative" part of collaborative learning. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 4(4), 371-402. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-009-9076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology-mediated discourse refers to debates, discussions, and other social learning techniques involving the examination of a theme using technology. For example, wikis are a way to encourage discussion among learners, but other common tools include mind maps, survey systems, and simple message boards. Like collaborative writing, technology-mediated discourse allows participants that may be separated by time and distance to engage in conversations and build knowledge together.&lt;ref name="wikis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asterhan, C., &amp; Schwarz, B. (2010). Online moderation of synchronous e-argumentation. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(3), 259-82. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group exploration refers to the shared discovery of a place, activity, environment or topic among two or more people. Students do their exploring in an online environment, use technology to better understand a physical area, or reflect on their experiences together through the Internet. [[Virtual worlds]] like [[Second Life]] and [[Whyville]] as well as synchronous communication tools like [[Skype]] may be used for this kind of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, B., &amp; Ketelhut, D. (2008). Exploring embedded guidance and self-efficacy in educational multi-user virtual environments. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 3(4), 413-27. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-008-9049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ioannidou, A., Repenning, A., Webb, D., Keyser, D., Luhn, L., &amp; Daetwyler, C. (2010). Mr. Vetro: A Collective Simulation for teaching health science. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(2), 141-66. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9082-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem-based learning is a popular instructional activity that lends itself well to CSCL because of the social implications of problem solving. Complex problems call for rich group interplay that encourages collaboration and creates movement toward a clear goal.&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;Lu, J., Lajoie, S., &amp; Wiseman, J. (2010). Scaffolding problem-based learning with CSCL tools. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(3), 283-98. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koschmann, T., Feltovich, P., Myers, A., &amp; Barrows, H. (1992). Implications of CSCL for problem-based learning:Special issue on computer supported collaborative learning. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 21(3), 32-35. {{doi|10.1145/130893.130902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project-based learning]] is similar to problem-based learning in that it creates impetus to establish team roles and set goals. The need for collaboration is also essential for any project and encourages team members to build experience and knowledge together. Although there are many advantages to using software that has been specifically developed to support collaborative learning or project-based learning in a particular domain, any  file sharing or communication tools can be used to facilitate CSCL in problem- or project-based environments.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld, P., Soloway, E., Marx, R., Krajcik, J., Guzdial, M., &amp; Palincsar, A. (1991). Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning. Educational Psychologist, 26(3/4), 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Web 2.0]] applications  (wikies,  blogs,  RSS  feed,  collaborative  writing,  video  sharing,  social  networks, etc.) are used for computer-supported collaborative learning specific strategies should be used for their implementation, especially regarding (1) adoption by teachers and students; (2) usability and quality in use issues; (3) technology maintenance; (4) pedagogy and instructional design; (5) social interaction between students; (6) privacy issues; and (7) information/system security.&lt;ref&gt;Bubas, G., Orehovacki, T., Coric, A. (2011). Strategies for implementation of Web 2.0 tools in academic education [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307915719_Strategies_for_implementation_of_Web_20_tools_in_academic_education]. 17th European University Information Systems International Congress, EUNIS 2011, Dublin, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teacher roles==

Though the focus in CSCL is on individuals collaborating with their peers, teachers still have a vital role in facilitating learning. Most obviously, the instructor must introduce the CSCL activity in a thoughtful way that contributes to an overarching design plan for the course. The design should clearly define the learning outcomes and [[Assessment in computer-supported collaborative learning|assessments]] for the activity. In order to assure that learners are aware of these objectives and that they are eventually met, proper administration of both resources and expectations is necessary to avoid learner overload. Once the activity has begun, the teacher is charged with kick-starting and monitoring discussion to facilitate learning. He or she must also be able to mitigate technical issues for the class. Lastly, the instructor must engage in [[Assessment in computer-supported collaborative learning|assessment]], in whatever form the design calls for, in order to ensure objectives have been met for all students.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, P (2008). [http://www.learningpeaks.com/instrcomp.pdf Competencies for online instructors.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703164002/http://www.learningpeaks.com/instrcomp.pdf |date=2008-07-03 }} Learning Peaks, Retrieved October 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the proper structure, any CSCL strategy can lose its effectiveness. It is the responsibility of the teacher to make students aware of what their goals are, how they should be interacting, potential technological concerns, and the time-frame for the exercise. This framework should enhance the experience for learners by supporting collaboration and creating opportunities for the construction of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kobbe, L., Weinberger, A., Dillenbourg, P., Harrer, A., Hämäläinen, R., Häkkinen, P. &amp; Fischer, F. (2007) Specifying computer-supported collaboration scripts.  International Journal of Computer Supported Learning,  2(2-3), 211-224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoonenboom, J. (2008). The effect of a script and a structured interface in grounding discussions. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 3(3), 327-41. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-008-9042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important consideration of educators who implement online learning environments is [[affordance]]. Students who are already comfortable with online communication often choose to interact casually. Mediators should pay special attention to make students aware of their expectations for formality online.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, G. &amp; Hesse, F. (2009).  [http://ijcscl.org/?go=contents&amp;article=77#article77  Practice perspectives in CSCL.] International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, 4(2), pp. 109-114&lt;/ref&gt;  While students sometime have frames of reference for online communication, they often do not have all of the skills necessary to solve problems by themselves. Ideally, teachers provide what is called "scaffolding", a platform of knowledge that they can build on. A unique benefit of CSCL is that, given proper teacher facilitation, students can use technology to build learning foundations with their peers. This allows instructors to gauge the difficulty of the tasks presented and make informed decisions about the extent of the scaffolding needed.&lt;ref name="lu" /&gt;

==Effects==
According to Salomon (1995), the possibility of intellectual partnerships with both peers and advanced information technology has changed the criteria for what is counted to be the effects of technology. Instead of only concentrating on the amount and quality of learning outcomes, we need to distinguish between two kinds of effects: that is, "effects with a tool and/or collaborating peers, and effects of these." He used the term called "effects with" which is to describe the changes that take place while one is engaged in intellectual partnership with peers or with a computer tool. For example, the changed quality of problem solving in a team. And he means the word "effects of" more lasting changes that take place when computer-enhanced collaboration teaches students to ask more exact and explicit questions even when not using that system.

===Applications===
It has a number of implications for instructional designers, developers, and teachers.
*First, it revealed what technological features or functions were particularly important and useful to students in the context of writing, and how a CSCL system could be adapted for use for different subject areas, which have specific implications for instructional designers or developers to consider when designing CSCL tools.
*Second, this study also suggested the important role of a teacher in designing the scaffolds, scaffolding the collaborative learning process, and making CSCL a success. Third, it is important that a meaningful, real-world task is designed for CSCL in order to engage students in authentic learning activities of knowledge construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tml.tkk.fi/Opinnot/T-110.556/2003/Materiaali/EditedLehtinenCSCL.pdf|contribution=COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING: AN APPROACH TO POWERFUL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS|author=Erno Lehtinen|editors=E. De Corte, L. Verschaffel, N. Entwistle &amp; J. Van Merriëboer|title=Unravelling basic components and dimensions of powerful learning environments|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Third, cooperative work in the classroom, using as a tool based technology devices "one to one " where the teacher has a program of classroom management, allows not only the enhancement of teamwork where each member takes responsibilities involving the group, but also a personalized and individualized instruction, adapting to the rhythms of the students, and allowing to achieve the targets set in which has been proposed for them individualized Work Plan.

==Criticism and concerns==
Though CSCL holds promise for enhancing education, it is not without barriers or challenges to successful implementation. Obviously, students or participants need sufficient access to computer technology. Though access to computers has improved in the last 15 to 20 years, teacher attitudes about technology and sufficient access to Internet-connected computers continue to be barriers to more widespread usage of CSCL pedagogy.

Furthermore, instructors find that the time needed to monitor student discourse and review, comment on, and grade student products can be more demanding than what is necessary for traditional face-to-face classrooms. The teacher or professor also has an instructional decision to make regarding the complexity of the problem presented. To warrant collaborative work, the problem must be of sufficient complexity, otherwise teamwork is unnecessary. Also, there is risk in assuming that students instinctively know how to work collaboratively. Though the task may be collaborative by nature, students may still need training on how to work in a truly cooperative process.

Others have noted a concern with the concept of scripting as it pertains to CSCL. There is an issue with possibly over-scripting the CSCL experience and in so doing, creating "fake collaboration".  Such over-scripted collaboration may fail to trigger the social, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms that are necessary to true collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="bannon" /&gt;

There is also the concern that the mere availability of the technology tools can create problems. Instructors may be tempted to apply technology to a learning activity that can very adequately be handled without the intervention or support of computers. In the process of students and teachers learning how to use the "user-friendly" technology, they never get to the act of collaboration. As a result, computers become an obstacle to collaboration rather than a supporter of it.&lt;ref&gt;Dillenbourg, P. (2002). [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00190230/fr/ Over-scripting CSCL: The risks of blending collaborative learning with instructional design.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== For second language acquisition ==

=== History ===
The advent of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) as an instructional strategy for [[second language acquisition]] can be traced back to the 1990s. During that time, the internet was growing rapidly, which was one of the key factors that facilitated the process.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (1997). Computer-Mediated Collaborative Learning: Theory and Practice. ''The Modern Language Journal, 81''(4), 470-481.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the first [[wikis]] (such as [[WikiWikiWeb]]) were still undergoing early development,&lt;ref&gt;Ebersbach, Anja (2008), Wiki: Web Collaboration, Springer Science+Business Media, {{ISBN|3-540-35150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the use of other tools such as electronic discussion groups allowed for equal participation amongst peers, particularly benefiting those who would normally not participate otherwise during face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (1997). Computer-Mediated Collaborative Learning: Theory and Practice. The Modern Language Journal, 81(4), 470-481.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the establishment of wikis in the 2000s, global research began to emerge regarding their effectiveness in promoting second language acquisition. Some of this research focused on more specific areas such as [[systemic-functional linguistics]], [[humanistic education]], [[experiental learning]], and [[psycholinguistics]]. For example, in 2009 Yu-Ching Chen performed a study to determine the overall effectiveness of wikis in an English as a second language class in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Y. (2009). The effect of applying wikis in an English as a foreign language (EFL) class in Taiwan. Dissertation Abstracts International, A: The Humanities and Social Sciences, 69(11), 4300.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is a 2009 study by Greg Kessler in which pre-service, non-native English speaker teachers in a Mexican university were given the task to collaborate on a wiki, which served as the final product for one of their courses. In this study, emphasis was placed on the level of grammatical accuracy achieved by the students throughout the course of the task.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, G. (2009). Student-Initiated Attention to Form in Wiki-Based Collaborative Writing. Language Learning &amp; Technology, 13(1), 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the continual development of technology, other educational tools aside from wikis are being implemented and studied to determine their potential in scaffolding second language acquisition. According to Mark Warschauer (2010), among these are blogs, automated writing evaluation systems, and open-source netbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (2010). Invited Commentary: New Tools For Teaching Writing. Language Learning &amp; Technology, 14(1), 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ex situ'' of the classroom, the development of other recent online tools such as [[Livemocha]] (2007) have facilitated language acquisition via member-to-member interactions,&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Clint (Spring 2010). "Livemocha and the Power of Social Language Learning". IH Journal of Education and Development (28).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating firsthand the impact the advancement of technology has made towards meeting the varying needs of language learners.

=== Effectiveness and perception ===

Studies in the field of [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL) have shown that computers provide material and valuable feedback for language learners and that computers can be a positive tool for both individual and collaborative language learning. CALL programs offer the potential for interactions between the language learners and the computer.&lt;ref&gt;Chapelle, C. A. (2003). English language learning and technology. Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, students' [[autonomous language learning]] and [[self-assessment]] can be made widely available through the web.&lt;ref&gt;Chapelle, C. A. (2001). Computer applications in second language acquisition: Foundations for teaching, testing and research. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In CSCL, the computer is not only seen as a potential language tutor by providing assessment for students' responses,&lt;ref&gt;Levy, M. (1997). CALL: Context and conceptualisation. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but also as a tool to give language learners the opportunity to learn from the computer and also via collaboration with other language learners. Juan&lt;ref&gt;Juan, A. A., 1972. (2010). Monitoring and assessment in online collaborative environments: Emergent computational technologies for e-learning support. Hershey, PA: Information Science Reference.&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on new models and systems that perform efficient evaluation of student activity in online-based education. Their findings indicate that CSCL environments organized by teachers are useful for students to develop their language skills. Additionally, CSCL increases students' confidence and encourages them to maintain active learning, reducing the passive reliance on teachers' feedback. Using CSCL as a tool in the second language learning classroom has also shown to reduce [[learner anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, S. (2007). Anxiety and non-anxiety in a distance language learning environment: The distance factors as a modifying influence. System, 35(4), 487-508.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various case studies and projects had been conducted in order to measure the effectiveness and perception of CSCL in a language learning classroom. After a collaborative internet-based project, language learners indicated that their confidence in using the language had increased and that they felt more motivated to learn and use the target language. After analyzing student questionnaires, discussion board entries, final project reports, and student journals, Dooly&lt;ref&gt;Dooly, M. (2007). Joining forces: Promoting metalinguistic awareness through computer-supported collaborative learning. Language Awareness, 16(1), 57-74.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that during computer supported collaborative language learning, students have an increased awareness of different aspects of the target language and pay increased attention to their own language learning process. Since the participants of her project were language teacher trainees, she adds that they felt prepared and willing to incorporate online interaction in their own teaching in the future.

=== Cultural considerations ===

[[Culture]] may be thought of as composed of "beliefs, norms, assumptions, knowledge, values, or sets of practice that are shared and form a system".&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, N. (2014). Social and cultural anthropology: The key concepts. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Learning communities]] focused in whole or part on second language acquisition may often be distinctly multicultural in composition, and as the cultural background of individual learners affects their collaborative norms and practices, this can significantly impact their ability to learn in a CSCL environment.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Anastasios A. Economides. (2008). Culture‐aware collaborative learning. Multicultural Education &amp; Technology Journal, 2(4), 243–267.  http://doi.org/10.1108/17504970810911052&lt;/ref&gt;

CSCL environments are generally valued for the potential to promote collaboration in cross-cultural learning communities. Based on [[social constructivist]] views of learning,&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L. (1978). Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes.&lt;/ref&gt; many CSCL environments fundamentally emphasize learning as the co-construction of knowledge through the computer-mediated interaction of multivoiced community members. Computer-mediation of the learning process has been found to afford consideration of alternative viewpoints in multicultural/multilingual learning communities.&lt;ref&gt;Atsumi, T., Misumi, J., Smith, P., Peter, B., Peterson, M., Tayeb, M., … Tanzer, N. (1989). Groups, leadership and social influence. Recent Advances in Social Psychology: An  International Perspective, 369–428.&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to traditional face-to-face environments, computer-mediated learning environments have been shown to result in more equal levels of participation for ESL students in courses with native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (2005). Comparing face-to-face and electronic discussion in the second language classroom. CALICO Journal, 13(2-3), 7–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Language barriers for non-native speakers tend to detract from equal participation in general,&lt;ref&gt;Gunawardena, C. N., Nolla, A. C., Wilson, P. L., Lopez‐Islas, J. R., Ramirez‐Angel, N., &amp; Megchun‐Alpizar, R. M. (2001). A cross‐cultural study of group process and development in online conferences. Distance Education, 22(1), 85–121.&lt;/ref&gt; and this can be alleviated to some extent through the use of technologies which support asynchronous modes of written communication.&lt;ref&gt;Ku, H.-Y., &amp; Lohr, L. L. (2003). A case study of Chinese student's attitudes toward their first online learning experience. Educational Technology Research and  Development, 51(3), 95–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Online learning environments however tend to reflect the cultural, [[epistemological]], and [[pedagogical]] goals and assumptions of their designers.&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, C., &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). Designing learning environments for cultural inclusivity: A case study of indigenous online learning at tertiary level. Australasian  Journal of Educational Technology, 16(1). Retrieved from http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/submission/index.php/AJET/article/view/1822&lt;/ref&gt; In computer-supported collaborative learning environments, there is evidence that cultural background may impact learner motivation, attitude towards learning and e-learning, learning preference (style), computer usage, learning behavior and strategies, academic achievement, communication, participation, knowledge transfer, sharing and collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Studies variously comparing Asian, American and Danish and Finnish learners have suggested that learners from different cultures exhibit different interaction patterns with their peers and teachers in online.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K.-J., &amp; Bonk, C. J. (2002). Cross-cultural Comparisons of Online Collaboration. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 8(1), 0–0.  http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2002.tb00163.x&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have shown that difference in Eastern and Western educational cultures, for instance, which are found in traditional environments are also present in online environments.&lt;ref&gt;Liang, A., &amp; McQueen, R. J. (1999). Computer assisted adult interactive learning in a multi-cultural environment. Adult Learning, 11(1), 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, L., &amp; Ku, H. (2005). Chinese graduate students' experiences and attitudes toward online learning. Educational Media International, 42(1), 33–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J. (2007). A cultural look at information and communication technologies in Eastern education. Educational Technology Research and Development, 55(3), 301–314.&lt;/ref&gt; has described Eastern education as more group-based, teacher-dominated, centrally organized, and examination-oriented than Western approaches. Students who have learned to learn in an Eastern context emphasizing teacher authority and standardized examinations may perform differently in a CSCL environment characterized by [[peer critique]] and co-construction of [[educational artifacts]] as the primary mode of assessment.

==== Design implications ====
A "multiple cultural model" of [[instructional design]] emphasizes variability and flexibility in the process of designing for multicultural inclusiveness, focusing on the development of learning environments reflecting the multicultural realities of society, include multiple ways of teaching and learning, and promote equity of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, L. (1994). Reeves' pedagogic model of interactive learning systems and cultural contextuality (pp. 189–203). Presented at the Proceedings of the second  international interactive multimedia symposium, Promaco Conventions Pty. Ltd. Perth.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, L. (1996). Instructional design of interactive multimedia: A cultural critique. Educational Technology Research and Development, 44(4), 85–104.&lt;/ref&gt; McLoughlin, C. &amp; Oliver&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, C., &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). Designing learning environments for cultural inclusivity: A case study of indigenous online learning at tertiary level. Australasian  Journal of Educational Technology, 16(1). Retrieved from http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/submission/index.&lt;/ref&gt; propose a social, constructivist approach to the design of culturally-sensitive CSCL environments which emphasizes flexibility with regard to specific learning tasks, tools, roles, responsibilities, communication strategies, social interactions, learning goals and modes of assessment [B5]. Constructivist instructional design approaches such as R2D2&lt;ref&gt;Willis, J. (1995). A Recursive, Reflective Instructional Design Model Based on Constructivist-Interpretivist Theory. Educational Technology, 35(6), 5–23.&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasize reflexive, recursive, [[participatory design]] of learning experiences may be employed in developing CSCL which authentically engages learners from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

== Dyslexia in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning ==

=== History ===
[[Dyslexia]] primarily involves difficulties with reading, spelling and sentence structure, transposition, memory, organization and time management, and lack of confidence.&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"&gt;Woodfine, et. al. (2006). Text-based synchronous e-learning and dyslexia: Not necessarily the perfect match!. Science Direct, 703-717.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexia has in the past two decades become increasingly present in research and legislation. The United Kingdom passed the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] in which institutions were required to “reasonably adjust” instruction for students with disabilities, particularly physical and sensory disabilities; in 2002, the [[Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001|Special Education Needs and Disabilities Act]] adjusted the legislation to include learning disabilities.
 
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) established that all students with disabilities must be included in all state and districtwide assessments of student progress. The ADA also guarantees equal accommodation for the disabled in, “employment, public accommodations, state and local government services, transportation, and telecommunications.”&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"/&gt;
 
In recent years, tools such as WebHelpDyslexia and other capabilities of web applications have increased the availability of tools to provide coping skills for students with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;Avelar, L. O., Rezende, G. C., &amp; Friere, A. P. (2015). WebHelpDyslexia: a browser extension to adapt web content for people with dyslexia. Procedia Computer Science, 67, 150-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on Dyslexia in E-Learning Environments ===
In 2006, Woodfine argued that dyslexia can impact the ability of a student to participate in synchronous e-learning environments, especially if activities being completed are text-based. During experimental qualitative research, Woodfine found that data suggested “learners with dyslexia might suffer from embarrassment, shame and even guilt about their ability to interact with other learners when in a synchronous environment.”&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"/&gt;
 
In a study by Fichten et al., it was found that assistive technology can be beneficial in aiding students with the progression of their reading and writing skills. Tools such as spell check or text-to-speech can be helpful to learners with dyslexia by allowing them to focus more on self-expression and less on errors.&lt;ref name="Alsobhi, A. 2015"&gt;Alsobhi, A., Khan, N., &amp; Rahanu, H. (2015). Personalised learning materials based on dyslexia types: ontological approach.Procedia Computer Science, 60, 113-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design implications ===

Alsobhi, et al., examined assistive technologies for dyslexic students and concluded that the most fundamental considerations to be had when serving students of this population are: “the learning styles that people with dyslexia exhibit, and how [[assistive technology]] can be adapted to align with these learning behaviors.”&lt;ref name="Alsobhi, A. 2015"/&gt;
 
The [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915012673 Dyslexia Adaptive E-Learning] (DAEL) is a suggested a framework that proposes four dimensions that cover 26 attributes. The proposed framework asks educators to make decisions based on perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and system adaptability:
*perceived ease of use: This refers to the degree to which a student believes that using the technology is free of effort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alsobhi, A., Khan, N., &amp; Rahanu, H. (2015). DAEL framework: a new adaptive e-learnng framework for students with dyslexia. Procedia Computer Science, 51, 1947-1956.&lt;/ref&gt; One technique to increase the perceived ease of use includes utilizing technology in which self-descriptiveness is present. This, coupled with clarity and logical flow of functions, makes the learning process easier and the interaction between the user and machine more convenient.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
*perceived usefulness: Defined as how a student's performance, or learning performance, can be enhanced by a system. Studies show the impact of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness and their role in a users’ decision on whether to use a system again. Scaffolding as well as accommodations to the student's learning style will help overcome limitations of system operations, as will feedback geared toward system improvements.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
*system adaptability: Refers to the user experiences and the way in which students are given control over a system to increase confidence and comfort in their learning. In addition to implications for the system, the flow of content shouldb be logical and the tone (attitude) of content should be encouraging.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== 508 Compliance &amp; the implications for Educators ===
Educators that choose to use the CSCL environment must be aware of [https://www.section508.gov/content/learn 508 compliance] and its legal implications. “In the U.S., the criteria for designing Web pages accessibly are provided by two major sets: the W3C’s [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|Web Accessibility Guidelines]] (WCAG) and the design standards issued under U.S. federal law, [[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973|Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act]], as amended in 1998.1 Features of accessible design include, among others, the provision of ALT tags for nontextual elements, such as images, animations and image map hot spots; meaningful link text; logical and persistent page organization, and the inclusion of skip navigation links."&lt;ref&gt;Axel Schmetzke &amp; David Comeaux (2009) Accessibility Trends among Academic Library and Library School Web Sites in the USA and Canada, Journal of Access Services, 6:1-2, 137-152, DOI: 10.1080/15367960802286286&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Unfortunately, not all educators are exposed to these guidelines, especially if their collegiate programs do not provide exposure to the use of computers, aspects of web design or technology in education. In some cases, it may be advantageous for the educator to collaborate with an instructional technologist or web designer to ensure 508 guidelines are addressed in the desired learning environment for the CSCL.

== Web 3.0 and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) ==
The [[World Wide Web]] began as information sharing on [[Static web page|static webpages]] accessible on a computer through the use of a [[web browser]]. As more interactive capabilities were added, it evolved into [[Web 2.0]], which allowed for [[user-generated content]] and participation (e.g. [[Social networking service|social networking]]). This opened up many new possibilities for computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) using the Internet. The internet is now entering a new phase, [[Web 3.0]] or the [[Semantic Web]], which is characterized by the greater [[interconnectivity]] of [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]] data from many different sources. New intelligent technology applications will be able to manage, organize and create meaning from this data,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2013-02-08|title=Web 3.0 technology: It's the business!|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/02580541311304571|journal=Strategic Direction|volume=29|issue=3|pages=8–10|doi=10.1108/02580541311304571|issn=0258-0543|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will have a significant impact on CSCL.

The interconnectivity of machine-readable data with semantic tags means that searches will be greatly enhanced. Search results will be more relevant, recommendations of resources will be made based on search terms and results will include [[multimedia]] content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allison|first=Mark|last2=Kendrick|first2=Lynn Marie|date=2015-12-01|title=Toward Education 3.0: Pedagogical Affordances and Implications of Social Software and the Semantic Web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tl.20167/abstract|journal=New Directions for Teaching and Learning|language=en|volume=2015|issue=144|pages=109–119|doi=10.1002/tl.20167|issn=1536-0768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Robin D.|date=2011-01-01|title=Web 3.0: Implications for Online Learning|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-011-0469-9|journal=TechTrends|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–46|doi=10.1007/s11528-011-0469-9|issn=8756-3894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halimi|first=Khaled|last2=Seridi-Bouchelaghem|first2=Hassina|date=2015-01-01|title=Semantic web based learning styles identification for social learning environments personalization|url=http://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&amp;doi=10.3233/WEB-150307|journal=Web Intelligence|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–29|doi=10.3233/web-150307|issn=2405-6456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Web 3.0 capabilities for learners include enhanced tools for managing learning, allowing them to [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulate]] and [[Co-regulation|co-regulate]] learning without the assistance of an instructor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Through the use of Web 3.0, groups and communities can be formed according to specific criteria without human input. These communities and groups can provide support to new learners and give experts an opportunity to share their knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Teachers can benefit from these same capabilities to manage their teaching.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafari|first=Ali|date=2002|title=Conceptualizing Intelligent Agents for Learning and Teaching|url=https://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eqm0235.pdf|journal=Educause Quarterly|volume=25 |issue=3|pages=28–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the software for Web 3.0 collaboration will include using data from group communications, which then generates how much each individual has collaborated based on how often they communicate and how long their messages are.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeong|first=Heisawn|last2=Hmelo-Silver|first2=Cindy E.|date=2016-04-02|title=Seven Affordances of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning: How to Support Collaborative Learning?

=== Examples of new Web 3.0 tools to enhance CSCL ===

==== Virtual Assistants and Intelligent Agents  ====
Making data machine-readable is leading to the development of [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistants]] and [[intelligent agent]]s. These are tools which can access data on a user's behalf and will be able to assist learners and collaborators in several ways. They can provide personalized and customized search results by accessing data on a variety of platforms, recommend resources based on user information and preferences, manage administrative tasks, communicate with other agents and databases, and help organize information and interactions with collaborators.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riaan Rudman|last2=Rikus Bruwer|date=2016-01-20|title=Defining Web 3.0: opportunities and challenges|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/EL-08-2014-0140|journal=The Electronic Library|volume=34|issue=1|pages=132–154|doi=10.1108/el-08-2014-0140|issn=0264-0473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Virtual Learning Communities  ====
Virtual learning communities are [[cyberspace]]s that allow for individual and [[collaborative learning]] to take place. While they exist today, with Web 3.0 they will gain enhanced features enabling more collaborative learning to take place. Some describe them as evolving out of existing [[learning management system]]s (LMSs), adding intelligent agents and virtual assistants that can enhance content searches and deal with administrative and communication tasks,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or enabling different LMSs around the world to communicate with each other, creating an even larger community to share resources and locate potential collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribón|first=Julio César Rodríguez|last2=Villalba|first2=Luis Javier García|last3=Kim|first3=Tai-hoon|date=2015-10-01|title=Virtual learning communities: unsolved troubles|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-013-1543-4|journal=Multimedia Tools and Applications|language=en|volume=74|issue=19|pages=8505–8519|doi=10.1007/s11042-013-1543-4|issn=1380-7501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual learning communities will also enable different types of peer-to-peer interaction and resource sharing to support co-construction of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Stephen J.H.|date=2006|title=Context Aware Ubiquitous Learning Environments for Peer-to-Peer Collaborative Learning|jstor=jeductechsoci.9.1.188|journal=Journal of Educational Technology &amp; Society|volume=9|issue=1|pages=188–201|doi=10.2307/jeductechsoci.9.1.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities may also include some aspects of 3D gaming and VR.

==== Non-immersive and Immersive 3D Virtual Environments ====
Through the use of [[3D game graphics|3D gaming]], users can simulate lives of others while providing their knowledge throughout the 3D environment as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]. These 3D environments also foster [[simulation]] and scenario building&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; for places where users would otherwise not have access. The 3D environments facilitate online knowledge building communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Web 3.0 in education {{!}} Editură acreditată CNCSIS, Editura Universitară|url=http://www.editurauniversitara.ro/carte/education/web_30_in_education/10419|doi=10.5682/2066-026x-12-073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-immersive environments are environments in which not all five senses are used but still allows users to interact in virtual worlds.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Randolph L.|last2=Fagan|first2=Eileen|date=2000|title=Collaboration and Learning Within Immersive Virtual Reality|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/351006.351018|journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Collaborative Virtual Environments|series=CVE '00|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=83–92|doi=10.1145/351006.351018|isbn=1581133030}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virtual reality headset|Virtual Reality (VR) headsets]] are sometimes used to give users a full immersion experience, into these 3D virtual worlds. This allows users to interact with each other in real time and simulate different learning situations with other users. These learning experiences and environments vary between fields and learning goals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Certain virtual reality headsets allow users to communicate with each other while being in different physical locations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Multimodal literacy development in CSCL ==

=== The concept of Multimodal literacy ===

Multimodal literacy is the way processes of literacy - reading, writing, talking, listening and viewing - are occurring within and around new communication media. (Kress &amp; Jewitt, 2003; Pahl &amp; Rowsell, 2005; Walsh, 2008) It refers to meaning-making that occurs through the reading, viewing, understanding, responding to and producing and interacting with multimedia and digital texts. (Walsh, 2010)

=== Literature review on multi-modal literacy in CSCL ===
==== * Online forum  ====

Online forums offer numerous advantages for both teacher and students for collaborative learning online. Discussion forums provide a wider platform to exchange information and ideas, to develop writing and reading skills, critical thinking skills. (Jill Margerison, 2013) A collaborative online forum can also help students learn about the unique challenges of online communication, especially the need for clarity and the dangers of sarcasm. (Susan Martens-Baker, 2009) For the teacher, they offer a flexible platform from which to educate in a participatory culture, where teachers and students can interact with each other and create new knowledge. (Jill Margerison, 2013)

==== * Video games ====
Video games were designed as a learning tool engaged learners who advance through experimentation, critical thinking and practice in the virtual world. (Abrams, 2009) Video games in CSCL can promote positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face promotive interaction, social skills, and group processing abilities in the ELA classroom. Through interactions in the virtual world, learners have the opportunities to establish their presence, identity and create meanings for their lives.

==== * Multimodal composition in digital storytelling: podcast, video/ audio crafts ====
Digital storytelling refers to integrating a variety of means, such as images, audio, video, graphics and diagram to personal narratives and crafts. Four skill competencies: reading, writing, speaking, and listening would be enhanced by producing digital products. (Brenner, 2014) Students have a greater sense of autonomy, agency through the digital storytelling in CSCL.

=== The implication for classroom teaching ===

==== * Online-forum ====
Online forums provide opportunities for young people to engage in the self-exposition as they practice digital literacies and hone the skill of movement across multiple literacies, languages and subject positions. Meanwhile, identity is a constellation of the multiple communities. It is also important to emphasize the potentially harmful cultural discourses that occur within young people's consumption. (Kim, 2015)

==== * Videogame ====
Through capitalizing on students’ gaming experiences by recognizing how they apply to the subject at hand, teachers can highlight the benefits of virtual learning environments and draw upon students’ gaming experiences to understand their application of virtual learning across curricula. Educators need to choose the appropriate game for the particular subject to endorse their instruction and promote collaboration among students.

==== Multimodal composition: podcast, audio, video crafts in digital storytelling ====
Students who engage in collaborative learning for creating digital production show the characteristics of leadership. Moreover, students would gain the experience of collaboration and expand their skill of the multimodal literacy. In addition, digital composition provides a meaningful tool for teachers to assess. (Brenner, 2014)

=== Applications for ELLs ===

Multimodal literacy can facilitate English learners’ literacy learning. It has provided opportunities for English learners to expand the interpretation of texts. (Ajayi, 2009)  Specifically, English language learners can increase their language ability through computer-collaborative learning. 
The multimodality platforms provide students, especially ELLs with an anxiety-free zone to collaborate with their peers in a virtual world in order to make meanings together. Technology self-efficacy increases ELLs’ level of independence and reduces their level of anxiety. (Mellati, Zangoei &amp; Khademi, 2015) ELLs will have more motivation and self-confident while participating in online group projects to make contributions and share knowledge with their peers. As a result of collaborative learning,  ELLs would expand their vocabulary, gain advanced and more academic grammars.

== CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ==

=== Overview of CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ===

====Research on CSCL in post-secondary education settings====
The applications of CSCL in post-secondary education demonstrate positive impacts on students’ learning such as promoting learner interaction, motivation and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang, N., Ghislandi, P., &amp; Dellantonio, S|first=|date=2018|title=Online collaboration in a large university class supports quality teaching|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-017-9564-8|journal=Education Tech Research Dev|volume=66|pages=671–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As collaborative learning is grounded in social constructivism, the interaction and collaboration during learning is valued.

==== Developing Professional Skills ====
There's research findings that shows online students had higher scores than face-to-face students in professional competence acquisition test, showing the effectiveness of CSCL in promoting the development of professional skills&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francescato, D., Mebane, M., Porcelli, R., Attanasio, C., &amp; Pulino, M.|first=|date=2007|title=Developing professional skills and social capital through computer supported collaborative learning in university contexts|url=|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|volume=65(2)|pages=140–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Knowledge Building ====
Knowledge co-construction among geographically dispersed students in an online postgraduate program was explained in a study as students relied heavily on each other for their on-going participation in the online discussions and joint refinement of ideas introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zenios, M|first=|date=2011|title=Epistemic activities and collaborative learning: Towards an analytical model for studying knowledge construction in networked learning settings|url=|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|volume=27(3)|pages=259–268|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Principles &amp; Instructional Strategies for CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ===
The design principles for using CSCL can be considered from different perspectives. For technical use, instructors need to provide tutorials and online training modules to students.&lt;ref name="Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W 2012 135–145"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W|first=|date=2012|title=Using an online learning management system as collaborative media to support adult learning: needs assessment|url=|journal=International Journal of Technology in Teaching and Learning|volume=8(2)|pages=135–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For collaboration, students need time to plan and coordinate group work as well as instructors’ support and guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vuopala, E., Hyvönen, P.,&amp; Järvelä, S|first=|date=2016|title=Interaction forms in successful collaborative learning in virtual learning environments|url=|journal=Active Learning in Higher Education|volume=17(1)|pages=25–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the discussions. Also, group size and composition should be taken into consideration for better quality of interaction.&lt;ref name="Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y. 2017 769–805"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y.|first=|date=2017|title=The Effects of Mobile-Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning: Meta-Analysis and Critical Synthesis|url=|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=87|pages=769–805|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More instructional strategies are presented below.

==== Project-Based Settings Using Wikis ====
Wikis is a tool for learners to co-construct knowledge online with the access to create and edit contents. There are three phases of using wikis for collaborative writing:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin, H. &amp; Kelsey, K.D|first=|date=2009|title=Building networked environment in Wikis: The evolving phases of collaborative learning in a Wikibook project|url=|journal=Educational Computing Research|volume=40(2)|pages=145–169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 1. Crisis of Authority

Users experience challenges due to unfamiliarity with the use of wiki and the unknown of other teammates’ boundaries of being commented or revised on their writings.

Phase 2. Crisis of Relationship

Collaborative learning emerges and group communication is improved.

Phase 3. Resolution of Crisis

More frequent communication occurs and increased co-writing among team members.

To better design wiki-based project, the design principles design include:

1. Provide learners with a practice article to edit at the beginning of a course for getting familiar with using wikis

2. Informs learners of different communication tools to work collaboratively.

3. Engage learners with repeated wiki article assignments.

4. Provide timely feedback on students’ discussion, participation and interaction.

==== Online Learning Management Systems ====
The characteristic of social interaction in CSCL can be demonstrated on the online learning community where learners can communicate with each other. One of the medium facilitating the online community to work is online learning management system that provides all people including learners, professors, and administrative staff to communicate.

When using an online learning management system for collaborative learning, the instructor should provide technical training by presenting video tutorials, online training modules or online workshops&lt;ref name="Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W 2012 135–145"/&gt;

==== Mobile Computer Supported Collaborative Learning ====
Mobile CSCL (mCSCL) is beneficial to students’ learning achievements, attitude and interactions.&lt;ref name="Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y. 2017 769–805"/&gt; The suggested design principles for mCSCL include:

1. An idea group size is around 3 to 4 people.

2. A duration between 1 and 4 weeks demonstrate better effects

=== Professional Teaching Community ===
Professional teacher communities are positively related to student learning, teacher learning, teacher practice and school culture. Teacher collaboration is a significant element of these communities. Reflection‐oriented tasks (such as reflection on teaching performance in individual writing, peer feedback, and collective writing) stimulated participation, and in combination with task structure also interaction in these communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditte Lockhorst, Wilfried Admiraal &amp; Albert Pilot|first=|date=2010|title=CSCL in teacher training: what learning tasks lead to collaboration?|url=|journal=Technology, Pedagogy and Education|volume=19:1|pages=63–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, structured tasks(such as crossword puzzles, the path to come to a solution is unambiguous and answers can be immediately checked) which required critical reflection on personal experiences and perspectives triggered task‐related communication and a deep level of information exchange.

=== Distance Learning ===
The European Union Comenius fund sponsored FISTE project which is concerned with the educational use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), specifically with the development and dissemination of a new pedagogical strategy for distance learning through in-service teacher education in schools across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsteinsson, G. &amp; Page, T (2007) Computer Supportive Communication Learning Approach to Improve In-Service Teachers’ Education in Europe. FISTE - A Future Way For In-Service Teacher Training Across Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; This project uses the online Virtual Learning Environment platform BSCW as a Computer Supportive Communication Learning tool to facilitate the way the participants work together. This work has involved schools and teacher training providers, building culturally different work in in-service teacher education in the participating countries. The value of using CSCL supported technology for in-service teacher education in Europe lies in the concept of hinterland. Cross-national courses like the FISTE would be difficult to run without this technological approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">'''Cultural contracts''' refer to the degree that cultural values are exchanged between groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (2002). Cultural contracts theory: Toward an understanding of identity negotiation. Communication Quarterly, 50, 359-67.&lt;/ref&gt; It extends [[identity negotiation]] theory and [[uncertainty reduction theory]] by focusing defining the negotiation experience from the perspective of minority groups when dealing with majority cultural norms. Cultural contracts theory was developed in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (1999). The Negotiation of Cultural Identity. Westport, CT: Praeger Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr. Ronald L. Jackson, an identity scholar and a professor in media and cinema studies at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

== Background ==
Cultural contracts first appeared in Communication Quarterly in 1999. The theory is inspired by Ting-Toomey's (1986) identity validation model (IDM) that emerged from a study of European American and African American communication experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey, S. (1986). Conflict communication styles in black and white subjective cultures. International and Intercultural Communication Annual, 10, 75-88 here&lt;/ref&gt; Both theories are rooted in the exchanges between strangers as described in Berger and Calabrese's (1975) uncertainty reduction theory.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, C. R., Calabrese, R. J. (1975). Some Exploration in Initial Interaction and Beyond: Toward a Developmental Theory of Communication. Human Communication Research, 1, 99–112&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural contracts focuses specifically on the exchanges between traditionally marginalized groups and majority groups in power in American society from the standpoint of the minority member. The theory is not limited to oral communication. Any value that makes up an individual's [[worldview]], including behavior and other cultural norms, can be negotiated and subjected to a cultural contract.

Cultural contracts suggests that [[mainstream]] and [[marginalized]] identities are in natural conflict. In order to achieve [[communication]], individuals must decide how much of their values will be negotiated. This results in one of three contracts by the minority identity: ready-to-sign contracts (assimilating to mainstream values); quasi-completed contracts (adapting marginalized values to accommodate mainstream values); and co-completed contracts (validating both mainstream and marginalized values).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson. R. L. (2004). Cultural contracts theory: Toward a critical rhetorical identity. In New approaches to rhetoric&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals are not aware that they create or sign cultural contracts.

Each contract is a “result of how identities have been personally and socially constructed and exposed."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. &amp; Crawley, R. (2003).  White Student Confessions about an African American male professor: A Cultural Contracts Theory approach to intimate conversations about race and worldview.  Journal of Men's Studies, 12(1), 25-42&lt;/ref&gt; The first contract is a [[ready-to-sign contract]], or assimilation, which occurs when individuals replace their culture identity for the dominant culture. This contract can be temporary or long-term and benefits the majority. There is no room for negotiating marginalized identity with [[mainstream]] ideals in this contract with no perceived benefit to the marginalized group.[[Quasi-completed contracts]] (adaptation) result in temporarily incorporating a small part of an individual's value to the mainstream value, and vice versa. This is usually a short-term contract since neither identity is dominant in this interaction. Lastly, [[co-completed contracts]] (mutual validation) result in blending values together. Cultural differences are acknowledged and valued in this contract.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, M. L., Jackson, R. L., &amp; Ribeau, S. A. (2003). African American communication: Exploring ethnic identity and culture, p. 248. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain instance, values are deeply penetrated and are not up for exchange. Others are more surface and the perceived benefits of the contract do not conflict with our core identity. This will determine if an individual is willing to sign a cultural contract or remain in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (2002). Cultural contracts are not unique and can either be short-term or long-term. This depends on the level of confidence a person has in her worldview. Although negotiation of cultural differences is expected, mutual validation is not always the goal or intent of human interaction. Cultural contracts theory: Toward an understanding of identity negotiation. Communication Quarterly, 50, 359-67&lt;/ref&gt; The contracts can be signed one or two ways: the signee perceives a benefit in accommodating or assimilating, or the signee is forced to accommodate or assimilate.

Applications. In addition to identity research, cultural contracts theory has been used in higher education scholarship to explore the relationships between [[White people|White]] students and [[African America]]n faculty&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L., &amp; Crawley, R. L. (2003). White student confessions about a Black male professor: A cultural contracts theory approach to intimate conversations about race and worldview. The Journal of Men’s Studies, 12, 25-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, T. M. (2007). Black feminist thought and cultural contracts: Understanding the intersection and negotiation of racial, gendered, and professional identities in the academy.

== Event Resume ==

Efficient Use of Our Resources was the second international workshop organized by JLC Lisbon, dated August 2009. In this event the organization tried to apply to youthinaction European program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/youth/index_en.htm|author=EU|title=YouthInAction}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initial aim of the activities were adapted to the requirements of this program. We decided to keep most of those activities as they were planned initially so the academic part of the event was mostly based on visits to the companies related to the event's subjects ([[Renewable energy|renewable energies]], [[sustainable architecture]] and [[recycling]]). The event had two parts (the same happened in our first event, 2007 '''Power Your Future''') the first 3 nights were in Lisbon and the rest of the days were in Alentejo (south to Lisbon).

[[File:Euoor valorsul.png|right|thumb|Visit to ValorSul]]

In Lisbon the participants stayed in the university (Technical University of Lisbon) residence located in the center of Lisbon. There was sightseeing on the first day to [[Belém]] with a city rally in the afternoon. At night participants had a dinner in a great restaurant in [[Alfama]] (an old typical location from Lisbon) after a small [[sightseeing]] there. This dinner had the presence of Fado singers and everyone experienced the listening of this Portuguese music genre in a typical atmosphere. The next day participants visited INETI (research and development building featuring sustainable architecture) and ValorSul (recycling center). At night there was another great dinner featuring Fado near Rossio, another typical location from Lisbon.

During the trip to Alentejo participants had a chance to visit SECIL (concrete company, EUOOR sponsor) and cross the Sado river in a ferry boat. In Alentejo the participants stayed in the house of one of the organizers featuring a swim pool and good location, near to the beach. The temperature was around 37–40°, was great for using the swim poll and going to the beach. There was a visit to Amareleja solar field and Alqueva dam. At night dinners were in the house as well the social activities. The international day featured a big table full of food and drinks from different parts of Europe, the participants had exposed their great cooking skills and everyone exchanged good feelings and tastes. During the Alentejo stay there was also time to build a [[solar cooker]] made of simple materials.

In the end (which, unfortunately is always part of the good things) there was a dinner in a beach restaurant before the farewell party in the Alentejo house where participants gave their presents to the organizers and exchanged some personal thoughts about the event.

==Quote==
"Midnight Rounds"  a poem written by George Edward Tait for his wife Akosua. 
"Out of the nucleus of nature she is a nimbus in the night
Her vintage voice filling the vaporized void with veracity."
And women, if you want to read real love poems, try "A Dance for Akosua" and "Dance of Destiny." Hear love married to mission and mission married to Spirit:
"Let us dance, my dear:
Dance with purpose and power
Dance with productivity and pride
Dance with the passion of Providence
&amp; with the potency of prayer."

"Swashbuckler's Song"

"The pen is longer than the sword
Is what the jurists think;
The pen is stronger than the sword
Is what the purists think.
So I duly dip my pen in blood
While I soak my sword in ink".

By George Edward Tait

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8049">'''Hans Karl Maeder''' (December 29, 1909 – September 8, 1988) was an innovative [[educator]] who founded the [[Stockbridge School]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]] and served as its director and [[headmaster]] for 23 years.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;David E. Pitt, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE1F3BF932A2575AC0A96E948260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=hans%20k.%20maeder&amp;st=cse Hans K. Maeder, Stockbridge Founder, Dies at 78], ''[[New York Times]]'', September 11, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Maeder was born in [[Hamburg, Germany]] on December 29, 1909, the third child in a prosperous family.  He described his father as an authoritarian [[nationalist]] and [[anti-Semite]] who embraced [[Hitler|Hitler's]] message.  Maeder left home at 18, refusing to go into business as his father had wished, and deciding instead to become a teacher.

Maeder, a [[Socialism|socialist]] consistent with the ideas of the [[Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund]]&lt;ref name=Nabel-GER&gt;Günter Nabel: Hans Maeders Kampf für die Menschenrechte, p. 199-205.&lt;/ref&gt; had to leave the university of Hamburg due to his political attitude. In June 1933 he was warned that his arrest was imminent and therefore he fled to [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=Nabel-GER/&gt; Here he taught at the Udlose Boys Home, an institution for boys with problems.&lt;ref name=Biodictionary/&gt; He was engaged in a political committee named to [[Giacomo Matteotti]] and was in close contact to Walter Hösterey (also known as Walter Hammer), a German publicist who agitated against the Nazis and lived in Danish exile.&lt;ref name=Nabel-GER/&gt;

In autumn 1937 he had to leave Denmark and went over France to Switzerland. Here he was expelled again and had to leave after a short time.&lt;ref name=Nabel-GER/&gt; From her he subsequently traveled to [[Kenya]]. He worked on a coffee plantation and a school program for the children of the black farmworkers. When the farmer noticed this activities, Maeder was fired. Later on he published an article about the exploitation on the plantations and this was the reason to leave Kenya.&lt;ref name=Nabel-GER/&gt; He had much luck, because the American consul in [[Nairobi]] was the father of a school friend of Maeder at his time in Hamburg. By this coincidence Maeder got a visa for [[Manila]] without an affidavit.&lt;ref name=Nabel-GER/&gt; He now travelled to [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and at last to the [[Philippines]].  After some times he got an invitation to teach at the University of Hawaii and with the help of American friends he finally got a visa for Hawaii.&lt;ref name=Nabel-GER/&gt; Maeder arrived in [[Hawaii]] in 1941,&lt;ref name=Childhoodeducation/&gt; but was interned as an [[enemy alien]]&lt;ref name=Biodictionary/&gt; on December 8, the day after the [[bombing of Pearl Harbor]].

Maeder was released from an [[Internment#Internment camp|internment camp]] in [[Texas]] on February 23, 1943. Arriving in New York, Maeder soon obtained a position as the director of the boys' division of a [[YMCA]] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=Childhoodeducation&gt;http://stockbridgeschool.org/stories/maed2.html Children Are The Same Everywhere 1945, issue of Childhood Education.&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1944, Maeder took a teaching job for a year at [[Windsor Mountain School]] in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], several miles from the site of the future Stockbridge School.

Maeder then moved to the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]], a private day school in [[Manhattan]], teaching [[German language|German]] and the history of languages and briefly serving as the school's director in 1947 and 1948.  It was at Walden that he met his wife Ruth, a widow at the time, through her son David, a Walden student whom he later adopted.  Maeder left Walden in 1948 to found Stockbridge School.

== Stockbridge School ==
The Maeders paid $60,000 to acquire the 1,100-plus acres of the former estate of Daniel Rhodes Hanna, son of [[Mark Hanna]]. Their purchase of what became the site of Stockbridge School occurred shortly after the failure of [[Liberal Arts, Inc.]] to establish a [[Great Books]]-based college associated with [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], [[Annapolis, Maryland]], on the same site. The property had been vacant since the [[Great Depression]] and extended from the summit of West Stockbridge Mountain to the shore of a lake called the Stockbridge Bowl. Only a portion of this extensive property became the school campus, with the Maeders retaining title to the remainder.

As a progressive private [[boarding school]] for adolescents, Maeder intended that Stockbridge School's educational philosophy be interracial, nondenominational and international.  The school was notable for being completely racially integrated from its inception and Maeder made successful efforts to recruit an international student body.

To help express Maeder's philosophy, and in light of his experiences as a [[Germany|German]] refugee and expatriate, the school flew the [[United Nations]] flag just below the [[American flag]] beginning in 1948, three years after the U.N. came into existence. For some years, its curriculum included a junior year abroad, and Stockbridge briefly operated a branch in [[Corcelles, Bern|Corcelles]], [[Switzerland]].

The best-known Stockbridge School alumnus is [[Arlo Guthrie]], whose arrest for littering by Stockbridge police shortly after graduation in 1965 inspired the song "[[Alice's Restaurant]]". Alice Brock had been the school librarian before opening a lunch counter in Stockbridge. Among other notable alumni are [[Chevy Chase]], [[Benjamin Barber]], [[Dr. Kenneth Edelin]] and Gunter Nabel.

== Final years ==
Maeder retired from Stockbridge School in 1971. The school closed five years later, in 1976, as a result of declining enrollment and debt. In 1978 the school campus became the site of the [[DeSisto School|DeSisto at Stockbridge School]], a wholly unrelated institution.

After leaving Stockbridge, Maeder worked as an educational consultant in New York City.&lt;ref name=Biodictionary&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PBj5-zHEMvoC&amp;pg=PA212 Maeder, Hans Karl], ''Biographical dictionary of modern American educators'', pp. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Ruth, died in 1976. He died in Manhattan in 1988; the cause of his death was [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Since health literacy is a primary contributing factor to [[health disparities]], it is a continued and increasing concern for health professionals. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Health Literacy of America's Adults: Results From the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy|last=Kutner|first=MA|last2=Greenberg|first2=E|last3=Jin|first3=Y|last4=Paulson|first4=C|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Health Literacy: Why We Need Accessible Health Information|url=http://health.gov/communication/literacy/issuebrief/|website=health.gov|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors may influence health literacy. However, the following factors have been shown to strongly increase this risk: age (especially patients 65 years and older), limited English language proficiency or English as a second language, less education, and lower socioeconomic status. Patients with low health literacy understand less about their medical conditions and treatments and overall report worse health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-02-10|title=Health literacy: report of the Council on Scientific Affairs. Ad Hoc Committee on Health Literacy for the Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10022112|journal=JAMA|volume=281|issue=6|pages=552–557|issn=0098-7484|pmid=10022112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various interventions, such as simplifying information and illustrations, avoiding [[jargon]], using "[[The teach-back method|teach-back]]" methods, and encouraging patients' questions, have improved health behaviors in persons with low health literacy. The proportion of adults aged 18 and over in the U.S., in the year 2010, who reported that their health care providers always explained things so they could understand them was about 60.6%.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/health-communication-and-health-information-technology/national-snapshot|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number increased 1% from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov" /&gt; The [[Healthy People program#Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020|Healthy People 2020]] initiative of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] has included health literacy as a pressing new topic, with objectives for improving it in the decade to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=18|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society as a whole is responsible for improving health literacy. Most importantly, improving health literacy is the responsibility of healthcare and public health professionals and systems.

==Characteristics==

=== Plain language ===
In order to have a patient that understands health terms and can make proper health decisions, the language used by health professionals has to be at a level that others who are not in the medical field can understand. Health professionals must know their audience in order to better serve their patients. The language used by these professionals should be [[plain language]]. Plain language is a strategy for making written and oral information easier to understand; it is communication that users can understand the first time they read or hear it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Health Literacy - Fact Sheet: Health Literacy Basics|url = http://health.gov/communication/literacy/quickguide/factsbasic.htm|website = health.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key elements of plain language include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/TOC.cfm|title=Federal Plain Language Guidelines: Table of Contents|website=www.plainlanguage.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Organizing information so most important points come first
* Breaking complex information into understandable chunks
* Using simple language and defining technical terms
* Using active voice
* Using lists and tables to make complex material easier to understand

The National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends that patient education materials should be not written higher than a 6th-7th grade reading level; further recommendations provided by the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison are published in their [https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication "Clear Communication" Initiative.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication|title=Clear Communication|work=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Many factors determine the health literacy level of [[health education]] materials or interventions: [[Reading level|readability]] of the text, the patient's current state of health, [[language barrier]]s of the patient, cultural appropriateness of the materials, format and style, sentence structure, use of illustrations, and numerous other factors.

A study of 2,600 patients conducted in 1995 by two US hospitals found that between 26% and 60% of patients could not understand medication directions, a standard [[informed consent]] form, or materials about scheduling an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. V. Williams|year=1995|title=Inadequate functional health literacy among patients at two public hospitals|journal=JAMA|volume=274|issue=21|pages=677–82|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/21/1677|accessdate=2006-06-30|doi=10.1001/jama.274.21.1677|pmid=7474271|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and  concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The young and multidisciplinary field of '''health literacy''' emerged from two groups of experts: physicians, health providers such as nurses,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, C., and Piano, MR. (2013) "Health literacy and nursing: an update." The American Journal of Nursing.  Jun;113(6):52-7. doi: 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000431271.83277.2f.&lt;/ref&gt; and health educators; and [[Adult Basic Education]] (ABE) and [[English as a second language]] (ESL) practitioners in the field of education. [[Physicians]] and [[nurses]] are a source of patient comprehension and compliance studies. Adult Basic Education / English for Speakers of Languages Other Than English (ABE/ESOL) specialists study and design interventions to help people develop reading, writing, and conversation skills and increasingly infuse curricula with health information to promote better health literacy. A range of approaches to adult education brings health literacy skills to people in traditional classroom settings, as well as where they work and live.

===Biomedical approach===
The [[biomedical approach]] to health literacy that became dominant (in the U.S.) during the 1980s and 1990s often depicted individuals as lacking health literacy or "suffering" from low health literacy. This approach assumed that recipients are passive in their possession and reception of health literacy and believed that models of literacy and health literacy are politically neutral and universally applicable. This approach is found lacking when placed in the context of broader ecological, critical, and cultural approaches to health. This approach has produced, and continues to reproduce, numerous correlational studies.&lt;ref&gt;Pleasant &amp; Kuruvilla, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of health literacy is considered adequate when the population has sufficient knowledge, skills, and confidence to guide their own health, and people are able to stay healthy, recover from illness, and/or live with disability or disease.&lt;ref name="McMurray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne McMurray|title=Community Health and Wellness: A Sociological Approach|location=Brisbane|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7295-3788-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMurray states that health literacy is important in a community because it addresses health inequities. It is no coincidence that individuals with lower levels of health literacy live, disproportionally, in communities with lower socio-economic standing. A barrier to achieving adequate health literacy for these individuals is a lack of awareness, or understanding of, information and resources relevant to improving their health. This knowledge gap arises from both patients being unable to understand information presented to them and hospitals' inadequate efforts and materials to address these literacy gaps.

A more robust view of health literacy includes the ability to [[Scientific literacy|understand scientific concepts]], content, and health research; skills in spoken, written, and online communication; critical interpretation of mass media messages; navigating complex systems of health care and governance; knowledge and use of community capital and resources; and using cultural and indigenous knowledge in health decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=1460-2245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ratzan|first=S.

This perspective defines health literacy as the wide range of skills, and competencies that people develop over their lifetimes to seek out, comprehend, evaluate, and use health information and concepts to make informed choices, reduce health risks, and increase quality of life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarcadoolas|first=Christina|last2=Pleasant|first2=Andrew|last3=Greer|first3=David S.|date=June 2005|title=Understanding health literacy: an expanded model|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15788526|journal=Health Promotion International|volume=20|issue=2|pages=195–203|doi=10.1093/heapro/dah609|issn=0957-4824|pmid=15788526}}&lt;/ref&gt; While various definitions vary in wording, they all fall within this conceptual framework.

Defining health literacy in that manner builds the foundation for a multi-dimensional model of health literacy built around four central domains:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

*fundamental literacy,
*scientific literacy,
*civic literacy, and
*cultural literacy.

There are several tests, which have verified reliability in the academic literature that can be administered in order to test one's health literacy. Some of these tests include the Medical Term Recognition Test (METER), which was developed in the United States (2 minute administration time) for the clinical setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altin|first1=Sibel|last2=Finke|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kautz-Freimuth|first3=Sibylle|last4=Stock|first4=Stephanie|title=The evolution of health literacy assessment tools: a systematic review|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|volume=14|issue=1|page=1207|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1207|pmc=4289240|pmid=25418011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The METER includes many words from the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) test.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Short Assessment of Health Literacy in Spanish and English populations (SAHL-S&amp;E) uses word recognition and multiple choice questions to test a person's comprehension.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The CHC-Test measures Critical Health Competencies and consists of 72 items designed to test a person's understanding of medical concepts, literature searching, basic statistics, and design of experiments and samples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Patient safety and outcomes==
According to an [[Institute of Medicine]] (2004) report, low health literacy negatively affects the treatment outcome and safety of care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Medicine: [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10883.html#toc Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of health literacy affects all segments of the population.  However, it is disproportionate in certain demographic groups, such as the [[elderly]], [[ethnic minorities]], recent [[immigrants]], and persons with low general [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy [http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/index.asp?file=AssessmentOf/HealthLiteracy/HealthLiteracyResults.asp&amp;PageID=158 The Health Literacy of America's Adults] Retrieved 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These populations have a higher risk of hospitalization, longer hospital stays, are less likely to comply with treatment, are more likely to make errors with medication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Terry C.

The mismatch between a clinician's [[communication]] of content and a patient's ability to understand that content can lead to medication errors and adverse medical outcomes. Health literacy skills are not only a problem in the general population. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, public health workers) can also have poor health literacy skills, such as a reduced ability to clearly explain health issues to patients and the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Anesthesiology abstracts (October 25, 2005), Aaron M.

In addition to tailoring the content of what health professionals communicate to their patients, a well arranged layout, pertinent illustrations, and intuitive format of written materials can improve the usability of health care literature. This in turn can help in effective communication between healthcare providers and their patients.&lt;ref name="IJGM_Gill2012"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012|title=Readability Assessment of Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Publications by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=5|pages=923–933|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S37110|first1=P.S.|last1=Gill|first2=T.S.|last2=Gill|first3=A.|last3=Kamath|first4=B.|last4=whisnant|url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=14417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk identification===
Identifying a patient as having low health literacy is essential for a healthcare professional to conform their health intervention in a way that the patient will understand. When patients with low health literacy receive care that is tailored to their more limited medical knowledge base, results have shown that health behaviors drastically improve. This has been seen with: correct medication use and dosage, utilizing health screenings, as well as increased exercise and smoking cessation. Effective visual aids have shown to help supplement the information communicated by the doctor in the office. In particular, easily readable brochures and videos have shown to be very effective.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Evidence Report/Technology Assessment: Number 87 [http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/litsum.htm Literacy and Health Outcomes]&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare professionals can use many methods to attain patients' health literacy. A multitude of tests used during research studies and three minute assessments commonly used in doctors offices are examples of the variety of tests healthcare professionals can use to better understand their patients' health literacy.&lt;ref name="TOFLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPSF/&gt;

The American Medical Association showed that asking simple single item questions, such as "How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?", is a very effective and direct way to understand from a patient's point of view how they feel about interacting with their healthcare provider and understanding their health condition.&lt;ref name=Questions/&gt;

===Intervention===
In order to be understood by patients with insufficient health literacy, health professionals must intervene to provide clear and concise information that can be more easily understood. Avoidance of medical jargon, illustrations of important concepts, and confirming information by a "teach back" method have shown to be effective tools to communicating essential health topics with health illiterate patients.&lt;ref name=Conversation&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/conversation-cultural-competence-cindy-brach-senior-health-policy-researcher-ahrq|title=A Conversation on Cultural Competence With Cindy Brach, Senior Health Policy Researcher, AHRQ|date=2013-04-17|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program called "Ask Me 3"&lt;ref name=NPSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|title=National Patient Safety Foundation|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308091008/http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|archivedate=2008-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to bring public and physician attention to this issue, by letting patients know that they should ask three questions each time they talk to a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist:
*What is my main problem?
*What do I need to do?
*Why is it important for me to do this?

There have also been large-scale efforts to improve health literacy. For example, a public information program by the US Department of Health and Human Services encourages patients to improve healthcare quality and avoid errors by asking questions about health conditions and treatment.&lt;ref name=Questions&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: [http://www.ahrq.gov/questionsaretheanswer/ Questions Are the Answer], retrieved 2008-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the IROHLA (Intervention Research on Health Literacy of the Ageing population)  project, funded by the European Union (EU), seeks to develop evidence-based guidelines for policy and practice to improve health literacy of the ageing population in EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irohla.eu/home/|title=Home|publisher=|access-date=2015-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613081655/http://www.irohla.eu/home/|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has developed a framework and identified and validated interventions which together constitute a comprehensive approach of addressing health literacy needs of the elderly.

===Health illiterate-related diabetes prevalence in Vietnamese-American populations===
Diabetes is a rapidly growing health problem among immigrants—affecting approximately 10 percent of Asian-Americans.  It is the fifth-leading cause of death in Asian-Americans between the ages of 45 and 64.  In addition, type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease.  Those who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have high levels of blood glucose because the body does not effectively respond to insulin.  It is a lifelong disease with no known cure.  Diabetes is a chronic, debilitating, and costly social burden—costing healthcare systems about $100 billion annually.&lt;ref name="Cabiglio"&gt;Cabiglio, Josie. Diabetes on the rise among Asians.  Nguoi Viet 2. Web. 7 Dec 2010.

Diabetes disproportionately affects underserved and ethnically diverse populations, such as Vietnamese-American communities.  The relationship between the disease and health literacy level is in part because of an individual's ability to read English, evaluate blood glucose levels, and communicate with medical professionals.  Other studies also suggest lack in knowledge of diabetes symptoms and complications.&lt;ref name="Glazier"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Glazier R.H. | year = 2004 | title = Neighborhood recent immigration and hospitalization in Toronto, Canada | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Public Health | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 130–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an observational cross-sectional study conducted, many Vietnamese-American diabetic patients show signs of poor blood glucose control and adherence due to inadequate self-management knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Mull"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mull Dorothy S.

==== Oral health literacy in school teachers of Mangalore, India ====
The problem of low oral health literacy (OHL) is often neglected which may lead to poor oral health outcomes and under utilization of oral care services. A cross-sectional survey of  school teachers working in schools at Mangalore, India was undertaken. Details regarding demographics, medical, and dental history, oral hygiene practices and habits, diet history, and decay promoting the potential of school teachers were obtained using face-to-face interview method. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry-99 (REALD-99) was used to assess their OHL.The OHL was high in the school teachers with the REALD-99 scores ranging from 45 to 95 with a mean score of 75.83 ± 9.94. Th This study found that there was a statistically significant difference between OHL and education, frequency of brushing and the filled teeth. Although this study indicated high OHL levels among school teachers in Mangalore, India the magnitude of dental caries in this population was also relatively high and very few had a healthy periodontium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Arun K|last2=Rao|first2=Ashwini|last3=Rajesh|first3=GuruRaghavendran|last4=Shenoy|first4=Ramya|last5=Pai|first5=Mithun B.

==eHealth literacy==
eHealth literacy describes the relatively modern concept of an individual's ability to search for, successfully access, comprehend, and appraise desired health information from electronic sources and to then use such information to attempt to address a particular health problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e9/|title=eHealth Literacy: Essential Skills for Consumer Health in a Networked World|first1=Cameron D|last1=Norman|first2=Harvey A|last2=Skinner|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the increasing influence of the internet for information-seeking and health information distribution purposes, eHealth literacy has become an important topic of research in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=T|last2=Brainin|first2=E|last3=Neter|first3=E|date=|title=With Some Help From My Network: Supplementing eHealth Literacy With Social Ties|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=3|pages=e98.|doi=10.2196/jmir.6472|via=|pmc=5391437|pmid=28360024|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stellefson (2011) states, "8 out of 10 Internet users report that they have at least once looked online for health information, making it the third most popular Web activity next to checking email and using search engines in terms of activities that almost everybody has done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2011/4/e102/|title=eHealth Literacy Among College Students: A Systematic Review With Implications for eHealth Education|first1=Michael|last1=Stellefson|first2=Bruce|last2=Hanik|first3=Beth|last3=Chaney|first4=Don|last4=Chaney|first5=Bethany|last5=Tennant|first6=Enmanuel Antonio|last6=Chavarria|date=1 January 2011|publisher=|volume=13|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.1703|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though in recent years, individuals may have gained access to a multitude of health information via the Internet, access alone does not ensure that proper search skills and techniques are being used to find the most relevant online and electronic resources. As the line between a reputable medical source and an amateur opinion can often be blurred, the ability to differentiate between the two is important.

Health literacy requires a combination of several different literacy skills in order to facilitate eHealth promotion and care.  Six core skills are delineated by an eHealth literacy model referred to as the Lily model.  The Lily Model's six literacies are organized into two central types: analytic and context-specific.  Analytic type literacies are those skills that can be applied to a broad range of sources, regardless of topic or content (i.e., skills that can also be applied to shopping or researching a term paper in addition to health) whereas context-specific skills are those that are contextualized within a specific problem domain (can solely be applied to health).  The six literacies are listed below, the first three of the analytic type and the latter three of the context-specific:
* Traditional literacy
* Media literacy
* Information literacy
* Computer literacy
* Scientific literacy
* Health literacy

According to Norman (2006), both analytical and context-specific literacy skills are "required to fully engage with electronic health resources."  As the World Wide Web and technological innovations are more and more becoming a part of the healthcare environment, it is important for information technology to be properly utilized to promote health and deliver health care effectively. Furthermore, it was argued by Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), that digital media fosters the creation of interpersonal ties, that can supplement eHealth literacy. According to Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), individuals with low eHealth literacy who were able to recruit help when performing online activities demonstrated higher health outcomes compared to similar individuals who did not find help. Also relating to the proliferation of digital media is the fact that many individuals now can create their own ‘media content’ ([[user-generated content]]). This means that the boundary between “information” and “media” content, as proposed by Norman in 2006, now is increasingly blurred, creating additional challenges for health practitioners (Holmberg, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holmberg C | year = 2016 | title = If You can't beat It-Use It: why and how clinicians need to consider social media in the treatment of adolescents with obesity | url = | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 9| pages = 977–8 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2016.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the move towards [[Patient-centred care|patient-centered care]] and the greater use of technology for self-care and self-management requires higher health literacy on the part of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Henna|last2=Xie|first2=Bo|title=Health literacy in the eHealth era: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|date=January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2017.01.015|volume=100|pages=1073–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been noted in several research studies, for example among adolescent patients with obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, C., Berg, C., Dahlgren, J., Lissner, L., &amp; Chaplin, J. E. (2018). Health literacy in a complex digital media landscape: Pediatric obesity patients’ experiences with online weight, food, and health information. Health Informatics Journal. Mar 1:1460458218759699. doi: 10.1177/1460458218759699&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improvement ==

=== Incorporate information through the university level ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] created a National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|date=|accessdate=|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the National Action Plan is to incorporate health and science information in childcare and education through the university level. The target is to educate people at an early stage; that way individuals are raised with health literacy and will have a better quality of life. The earlier an individual is exposed to health literacy skills the better for the person and the community.

Programs such as Head Start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs|title=Home - Office of Head Start - Administration for Children and Families|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Food and Nutrition Service|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have impacted our society, especially the low income population. Head Start provides low-income children and their families early childhood education, nutrition, and health screenings. Health literacy is integrated in the program for both children and parents through the education given to the individuals. WIC serves low-income pregnant women and new mothers by supplying them with food, health care referrals, and nutrition education. Programs like these help improve the health literacy of both the parent and the child, creating a more knowledgeable community with health education.

Although programs like Head Start and WIC have been working with the health literacy of a specific population, much more can be done with the education of children and young adults. Now, more and more adolescents are getting involved with their health care. It is crucial to educate these individuals in order for them to make informed decisions.

Many schools in the country incorporate a health class in their curriculum. These classes provided an excellent opportunity to facilitate and develop health literacy in today's children and adolescents. The skills of how to read food labels, the meaning of common medical terms, the structure of the human body, and education on the most prevalent diseases in the United States should be taught in both private and public schools. This way new generations will grow with health literacy and would hopefully make knowledgeable health decisions.

=== Framework and potential intervention points ===
The National Library of Medicine defines health literacy as:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confustion|last=Nielsen-Bohlmn|first=Lynn|date=2004|journal=Institute of Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health literacy
information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."}}

Based on this clinical definition, health literacy gives
individuals the skills that they need to both understand and effectively
communicate information and concerns. Bridging that gap between literacy skills
and the ability of the individual in health contexts, the ''Health Literacy Framework'' highlights the health outcomes and costs
associated with health contexts including cognitive abilities, social skills,
emotional state, and physical conditions such as visual and auditory contributions.

''Potential Intervention Points'' are illustrated in reflection of the ''Health Literacy Framework.''
While these potential intervention points include interactions such as those of individuals and the education systems
that they are engaged with, their health systems, and societal factors as they
relate to health literacy, these points are not 
components of a causal model.  The three
potential intervention points are culture and society, the health system, and
the education system. Health outcomes and costs are the products of the health
literacy developed during diversity of exposure to these three potential intervention
points.

Referring to shared ideas, meanings, and values that
influence an individual's beliefs and attitudes, cultural and societal
influences are a significant intervention point for health literacy
development. As interactions with healthcare systems often first occur at the
family level, deeply rooted beliefs and values can shape the significance of
the experience. Included components that reflect the development of health
literacy both culturally and societally are native language, socioeconomic status,
gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as mass media exposure. These
are pathways to understanding American life paralleling conquests for a health
literate America.

The health system is an intervention point in the ''Health Literacy Framework''. For the
purposes of this framework, health literacy refers to an individual's
interaction with people performing health-related activities in settings such
as hospitals, clinics, physician's offices, home health care, public health agencies,
and insurers.

In the United States, the education system consists of [[K-12]] curricula. In addition to this standard educational
setting, adult education programs are also environments in which individuals
can develop traditional literacy skills founded in comprehension and real-world
application of knowledge via reading and writing.  Tools for educational development provided by
these systems impact an individual's capacity to obtain specific knowledge
regarding health. Reflecting components of traditional literacy such as
cultural and conceptual knowledge, oral literacy (listening and speaking,)
print literacy (reading and writing,) and numeracy, education systems are also
potential intervention points for health literacy development.

=== Development of a health literacy program ===
A successful health literacy program will have many goals that all work together to improve health literacy. Many people assume these goals should communicate health information to the general public, however in order to be successful the goals should not only communicate with people but also take into account social and environmental factors that influence lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/15/3/259/551108/Health-literacy-as-a-public-health-goal-a|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=0957-4824}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the movement to end smoking. When a health literacy program is put into place where only the negative side effects of smoking are told to the general public it is doomed to fail. However, when there is a larger program put in – one that includes strategies outlining how to quit smoking, raises tobacco prices, reduces access to tobacco by minors, and reflect social a social unacceptability of smoking – it will be much more effective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests a National Action Plan to implement a comprehensive Health Literacy Program. They include 7 goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|first=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|date=2010|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|url=https://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Develop and disseminate health and safety information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable
# Promote changes in the health care system that improve health information, communication, informed decision making, and access to health services
# Incorporate accurate, standards-based, and developmentally appropriate health and science information and curricula in child care and education through the university level
# Support and expand local efforts to provide adult education, English language instruction, and culturally and linguistically appropriate health information services in the community
# Build partnerships, develop guidance, and change policies
# Increase basic research and the development, implementation, and evaluation of practices and interventions to improve health literacy
# Increase the dissemination and use of evidence-based health literacy practices and interventions
These goals should be taken into account when implementing a health literacy program.

There are also goals for the outcomes of a Health Literacy Program.

''Health Related Goals''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promoting and protect health and prevent disease
* Understand, interpret, and analyze health information

===Libraries===
Libraries have increasingly recognised that they can play a role in health literacy since the 2000s, influenced by the [[Medical Library Association]].  Library initiatives have included running education programs, fostering partnerships with health organisations, and using outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=13 June 2016|title=Health literacy and libraries: a literature review|journal=[[Reference Services Review]]|volume=44|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1108/RSR-02-2016-0005|last1=Barr-Walker|first1=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Pickering Bowditch''' (April 4, 1840 – March 13, 1911) was an American soldier, physician, physiologist, and [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the [[Harvard Medical School]].&lt;ref name="NCCN"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Bowditch, Henry Pickering|year=1954|editor=Barnhart, Clarence L.|encyclopedia=New Century Cyclopedia of Names, Volume One, A &amp;ndash; Emin Pasha|location=New York|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|page=606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herringshaw"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Bowditch, Henry Pickering|editor=Herringshaw, Thomas William|year=1909|encyclopedia=Herringshaw's national library of American biography, Volume 1, Aaron–Clason |location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=American Publishers' Association|page=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015026671456;num=385;seq=385;view=1up 385]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following his teacher [[Carl Ludwig]], he promoted the training of medical practitioners in a context of [[physiology|physiological]] research. His teaching career at Harvard spanned 35 years.

==Early life==
Henry P. Bowditch was born to the Massachusetts Bowditch family, noted for the mathematician [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], his grandfather, and the archaeologist [[Charles Pickering Bowditch]], his brother. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Jonathan Ingersoll Bowditch and Lucy Orne Nichols Bowditch.&lt;ref name=AMB&gt;{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Bowditch, Henry Pickering}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, he graduated from [[Harvard College]], and then entered Harvard’s [[Lawrence Scientific School]]. His studies there were interrupted by his service in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], where he rose to the rank of [[major]] in the [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry|Fifth Massachusetts Colored Cavalry Regiment]].&lt;ref name="Herringshaw" /&gt; 

After graduation from Harvard Medical School in 1868, he went to [[Paris]] to study with [[Claude Bernard]]. In Bernard’s lab he worked alongside [[Louis-Antoine Ranvier]], later known for neuroanatomy, and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] who promoted the use of photography to capture physiological dynamics. According to [[Walter Bradford Cannon]], when in Paris, Bowditch joined with fellow Bostonians [[John Collins Warren Jr.]], [[William James]], and Charles Emerson for frog-hunting parties.
Bowditch continued his European studies in Bonn with [[Wilhelm Kuhne]] and [[Max Schultze]]. Ultimately he proceeded to Leipzig where [[Carl Ludwig]] was conducting the program that Bowditch would emulate at Harvard. Bowditch impressed Ludwig by constructing an improvement on the [[kymograph]] then in use. His studies in Leipzig brought him into contact with, among others, [[Ray Lankester]], [[Angelo Mosso]], [[Hugo Kronecker]] and [[Carl von Voit]].

==Career==
Bowditch was appointed assistant professor of physiology at Harvard in 1871.&lt;ref name="Herringshaw" /&gt; While still in Germany, he purchased European materials to support the investigative training program he planned. And dramatically, on 9 September 1871, just days before sailing for Boston, he married Selma Knuth of Leipzig. The Bowditch laboratory at Harvard, the first physiological laboratory in the United States,&lt;ref name="NCCN" /&gt; began modestly in attic rooms. 

In 1875–1876, Bowditch, [[William James]], Charles Pickering Putnam, and [[James Jackson Putnam]] founded the [[Putnam Camp]] at [[St. Huberts, New York|St. Huberts]], [[Essex County, New York]].&lt;ref name="NysNrhpNom"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/| title = Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS)| publisher = [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2016-02-01}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=26543&amp;q=false| title = National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Putnam Camp| accessdate = 2016-02-01| author = Rachel D.

Bowditch's career at Harvard was parallel to that of [[William James]] who instituted his program of [[experimental psychology]] in 1875. Bowditch and James represented the ''New Education'' espoused by [[Charles William Eliot]], Harvard's President. In 1876 Bowditch was promoted to full professor.&lt;ref name="Herringshaw" /&gt;  In 1887 he co-founded and was the first president of the [[American Physiological Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.the-aps.org/fm/About/Founders |title=APS Founders |publisher=[[American Physiological Society]] |accessdate=22 March 2015 |quote=Three of them, Henry Pickering Bowditch, S. Weir Mitchell, and Henry Newell Martin, were signers of the original letter of invitation to attend the organizational meeting. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Harvard he rose to the position of dean of the medical school, serving from 1883 to 1893.&lt;ref name="NCCN" /&gt; In 1903 he was honoured with the George Higginson chair. After 35 years teaching for Harvard, he retired in 1906, and died in Jamaica Plains, Massachusetts in 1913.&lt;ref name="NCCN" /&gt; His students included [[Walter Bradford Cannon]], [[Charles Sedgwick Minot]] and [[G. Stanley Hall]].

Manfred Bowditch, Henry's son, gave a personal description of his father. Bowditch did much experimentation in a cottage at an Adirondack camp at the head of [[Keene Valley, New York|Keene Valley]] which bore his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bryan, John M.|year=2005|title=Maine Cottages: Fred L. Savage and the Architecture of Mount Desert|publisher=Springer Verlag|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cR_PAr6kYUsC&amp;pg=PA48 48]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, with a well-equipped workshop the son witnessed considerable "inventiveness and manual skill" that Henry also applied in the physiology lab.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Bowditch (1978) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110609182244/http://www.the-aps.org/publications/tphys/legacy/1958/issue4/7.pdf Henry Parker Bowditch: an intimate memoir], from American Physiological Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowditch was granted honorary degrees from five universities: Cambridge, Edinburgh, Toronto, Pennsylvania, and Harvard. Since 1956 the [[American Physiological Society]] has selected a distinguished physiologist to deliver the "Henry Pickering Bowditch Award Lecture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-aps.org/mm/awards/Other-APS-Awards/Recipients/Bowditch.html Recipients of the Henry Pickering Bowditch Award Lectureship] from the [[American Physiological Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Henry Pickering Bowditch was known for his physiological work on [[cardiac]] [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] and [[knee jerk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Growth and Development|first1=Stanley J.|last1= Ulijaszek|first2= Francis E.|last2= Johnston|first3= M. A. |last3=Preece|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|ISBN=0-521-56046-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/references?id=per171 Short biography, bibliography, and links on digitized sources] in the [[Virtual Laboratory]] of the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Later Years of the Saturday Club 1870-1920|first=Mark A. |last=Howe|publisher= Ayer Publishing|year= 1968|ISBN=0-8369-0548-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also developed an interest in [[anthropometry]], and showed that nutrition and environmental factors contribute to physiological development.
Bowditch can be seen as a link between the [[milieu interieur]] of Claude Bernard, his teacher, and [[homeostasis]] as developed by his student Walter Cannon.

'''Hélène Kirsova''' (18 June 1910{{spaced ndash}}22 February 1962) was a Danish [[ballerina]], [[choreographer]], and director who started the first professional ballet company in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name='Potter'&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Potter | first1 = M. | title = "A Strong Personality and a Gift for Leadership": Hélène Kirsova in Australia | journal = Dance Research: the Journal of the Society for Dance Research | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 62–76 | doi = 10.2307/1290914 | year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 1290914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirsova was  born in [[Copenhagen]] as Ellen Elisabeth Kiersten Wittrup. In Denmark, she received ballet training from Emilie Walborn and Jenny Møller. She continued her studies in [[Paris]] with [[Olga Preobrajenska]], [[Léo Staats]], and [[Lubov Egorova]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Sally and Mary Rutledge. "Kirsova, Hélène (1910-1962)." ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'': Online Edition 15. Melbourne University Press, 2000. http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150042b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; She toured with various companies in the 1920s and 1930s. Most notably, she was a founding member of the [[Original Ballet Russe|Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref name='Potter' /&gt; Kirsova toured to [[Australia]] as a principal artist in the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1936. She returned in 1938 to wed the Danish vice-consul Dr. Erik Fisher, who was living in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name='Potter' /&gt; Her company, the [[Kirsova Ballet]], was based in Sydney and presented its first show in 1941. The Kirsova Ballet continued to present works on and off until 1944, when it folded due to war-time financial constraints and difficulty receiving backing from [[J. C. Williamson]] Theatres, which largely controlled Australian theatrical productions at the time.&lt;ref name='Potter' /&gt;

[[File:Helene Kirsova stars in the De Basil Ballet Russe Petrouchka, Theatre Royal, Sydney, 11 January 1937 Sam Hood.jpg|thumb|Helene Kirsova stars in the De Basil Ballet Russe ''[[Petrouchka]]'', [[Theatre Royal, Sydney]], 11 January 1937. Photo from the Sam Hood collection.]]

Hélène Kirsova's company did not last as long as [[Edouard Borovansky]]'s (which would later turn into the [[Australian Ballet]].) As such, Kirsova is often mentioned only in passing as Borovansky's failed rival. Kirsova's school and company played an important role in exposing Australians to ballet.

The set designer [[Loudon Sainthill]] worked with Kirsova in the early part of his career.

She died in [[London]] in 1962, aged only 51.

== History ==
* Initial idea and development of a beta-version of the platform in 2008 by founder Jonas Liepmann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/american-mooc-providers-face-international-competition/44637, Grossman, Sara in The Chronicle of Higher Education: “American MOOC Providers Face International Competition”], 5 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This startup is said to have begun in 2011 and offered online collaboration tools for [[Learning Management|learning management]] with Hannes Klöpper as the co-founder and the second managing director.&lt;ref name="Lomas"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/09/online-learning-platform-iversity-gets-a-lifeline-from-holtzbrinck-media-group/|title=Online learning platform iversity gets a lifeline from Holtzbrinck media group|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in 2012 iversity decided to become a European-based MOOC platform&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredacademic.com/2013/07/5-questions-with-an-edtech-startup-hannes-klopper-of-berlin-based-mooc-provider-iversity/, Wired Academic: "5 Questions With An EdTech Startup: Hannes Klöpper of Berlin-based MOOC provider ‘iversity"], 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spring 2013 – iversity and the [[Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft]] launched “The MOOC Production Fellowship” as a competition for online course concepts. A jury chose 10 of the best MOOC concepts out of more than 250 entries. The winners were each awarded €25,000 for the production of their courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venturevillage.eu/iversity-raises-funding, Fowler, Nina in Venture Village: “Online education platform iversity raises funding from T-Venture and new CEO”], 16 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/en/pages/advisory-board, iversity: “Press Release: iversity creates Advisory Board”], 18 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://netzwertig.com/2014/01/29/zwei-jahre-spaeter-15-heise-startups-aus-berlin-und-was-aus-ihnen-geworden-ist/, Weigert, Martin in Netzwertig: “Zwei Jahre später - heiße Startups aus Berlin und was aus ihnen geworden ist”], 29 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2013 iversity relaunched as a platform for online courses, initially with 10 courses and 115,000 registered users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venturevillage.eu/iversity-stifterverband-mooc-fellowship, Fowler, Nina in Venture Village: "Professors, want to teach online?

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|history}}

'''''Jerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism''''' ({{lang-de|Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum}}) is a book written by [[Moses Mendelssohn]], which was first published in 1783 – the same year, when the Prussian officer [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]] published the second part of his Mémoire ''Concerning the amelioration of the civil status of the Jews''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dohm|1781, 1783}}; Engl. transl.: {{Harvnb|Dohm|1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moses Mendelssohn was one of the key figures of Jewish Enlightenment ([[Haskalah]]) and his philosophical treatise, dealing with social contract and political theory (especially concerning the question of the [[Separation of church and state|separation between religion and state]]), can be regarded as his most important contribution to [[Haskalah]]. The book which was written  in Prussia on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], consisted of two parts and each one was paged separately. The first part discusses "religious power" and the freedom of conscience in the context of the political theory ([[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Thomas Hobbes]]), and the second part discusses Mendelssohn's personal conception of [[Judaism]] concerning the new secular role of any religion within an enlightened state. In his publication Moses Mendelssohn combined a defense of the Jewish population against public accusations with contemporary criticism of the present conditions of the Prussian Monarchy.

==Historical background==
[[File:Mendelssohn-Lessing Kupferstich.jpg|thumb|right|Mendelssohn, Lavater and Lessing (behind), engraving made of a painting by the artist [[Moritz Daniel Oppenheim]] (1800-1881)]]

In 1763 some students of theology visited [[Moses Mendelssohn#Support for Judaism|Moses Mendelssohn]] in Berlin because of his reputation as a [[man of letters]], and they insisted that they wanted to know Mendelssohn's opinion about Christianity. Three years later one of them, the Swiss [[Johann Caspar Lavater]], sent him his own German translation of [[Charles Bonnet]]'s ''Palingénésie philosophique'', with a public dedication to Mendelssohn. In this dedication he charged Mendelssohn with the decision to follow Bonnet's reasons by converting to Christianity or to refute Bonnet's arguments. The very ambitious priest Lavater published his dedication to Mendelssohn and Mendelssohn's response together with other letters which were dated to the year 1774—including a prayer of Dr. Kölbele "baptizing two Israelites as a consequence of the Mendelssohn dispute". He abused the reputation of Mendelssohn and of his letters about religious tolerance to fashion himself as a kind of Christian Messiah of contemporary Judaism, disregarding the [[Haskalah]] as a conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''Sammlung derer Briefe, welche bey Gelegenheit der Bonnetschen philosophischen Untersuchung der Beweise für das Christenthum zwischen Hrn. Lavater, Moses Mendelssohn, und Hrn Dr. Kölbele gewechselt worden [Collection of those letters which have been exchanged between Mr. Lavater, Moses Mendelssohn, and Mr. Dr. Kölbele on occasion of Bonnet's investigation concerning the evidence of Christianity]'', {{Harvnb|Lavater|1774|loc=Zueignungsschrift, 3}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=3dwAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA339&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PRA2-PA3,M1 Google Books]).&lt;/ref&gt;

This intrigue was transferred to the times of the medieval crusades in the allegorical drama ''[[Nathan der Weise]]'' of Mendelssohn's friend [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]: Lessing replaced the young priest Lavater with the historical figure [[Saladin]] who appeared as the tolerant hero of the crusades in the perspective of contemporary enlightened historiography. The motive of Nathan who replied with the ''ring parable'', was taken from [[Boccaccio]]'s "''[[Decamerone]]''" and Lessing intended to create his drama as a monument of tolerance and enlightenment dedicated to Moses Mendelssohn. Lessing was an open-minded and modern type of freemason and he himself had a public theological dispute ([[:de:Fragmentenstreit|Fragmentenstreit]]) about the historical truth of the [[New Testament]] with the orthodox Lutheran Hauptpastor [[Johann Melchior Goeze]] in Hamburg during the 70s. Finally he was banned 1778 by the Herzog of Brunswick. Lessing's new way to ask about the fundament of a certain religion and to regard its efforts on religious tolerance was intended as a reflection of the current political practice.

In 1782, after the declaration of the so-called "Toleranzpatent" in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor#Religion|Joseph II]] and the realization of the «lettres patentes» in the [[French Monarchy]] under [[Louis XVI]], religion and especially the [[Jewish emancipation]] became a favorite subject of private debates in Alsace-Lorraine and these debates were often followed by publications of Christian clerics and Abbés.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkovitz|1989|loc=30-38,60-67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mendelssohn's ''Jerusalem or on Religious Power and Judaism'' may be regarded as his contribution to the debate.

During the 1770s Mendelssohn was frequently asked to act as a mediator by Jews in Switzerland and Alsace – and once [[Lavater]] supported Mendelssohn's intervention. About 1780 there was another antisemitic intrigue in Alsace, when François Hell accused the Jewish population to exhaust the peasants. The contemporary Alsatian Jews had no permission to buy land, but they often existed as innkeepers and moneylenders in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stern|1962-1975|loc=8/1585-1599}}; {{Harvnb|Ṿolḳov|2000|loc=7}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=3md-QcdbOaEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA7,M1 Google Books]).&lt;/ref&gt; Moses Mendelssohn was asked by Herz Cerfberr, the communal leader of the Alsatian Jews, to react with a ''Mémoire'' about the legal discrimination of the Jewish population as it was common practice of the Prussian administration. Moses Mendelssohn arranged a ''Mémoire'' by the Prussian officer and [[freemason]] [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]] in which both authors tried to relate the confirmation of the unenlightened condition with a demand for a general improvement of the civil condition.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Konrad Wilhelm von Dohm: ''Über die Bürgerliche Verbesserung der Juden'' ("Concerning the amelioration of the civil status of the Jews"), 1781 and 1783. The autograph is now preserved in the library of the Jewish community (Fasanenstraße, Berlin) – {{Harvnb|Dohm|1781, 1783}}; Engl. transl.: {{Harvnb|Dohm|1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this respect Moses Mendelssohn proved in his book ''Jerusalem'' which was published in the same year, that the "amelioration" of the civil status of the Jews could not be separated from an urgent need to modernize the Prussian Monarchy as a whole. The reason, why Moses Mendelssohn as one of the most recognized philosophers of [[Haskalah]] was from [[Prussia]], has to be understood by the fact that the state of Jewish emancipation there as on the lowest level in comparison with the neighbour countries. So the Jewish population was more forced to assimilate than in other countries during the 19th century: The Hohenzollern Monarchy followed with their edicts into the footsteps of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]—with 10 years delay. In 1784, one year after the publication of Mendelssohn's book ''Jerusalem'', the administration of the Habsburg Monarchy prohibited rabbinic jurisdiction and submitted the Jewish population to its own jurisdiction, but with an inferior legal status.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Häusler described also the ambiguous effects of the "Toleranzpatent" in his chapter ''Das Österreichische Judentum'', in {{Harvnb|Wandruszka|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This first step of the monarchy was expected to be done in a direction towards intolerance. In 1791 the National Assembly of the [[French Revolution]] declared the full civil rights for the Jewish population of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen]]'').

==Moses Mendelssohn's treatise "On Religious Power" and its composition==

Moses Mendelssohn was a highly educated scholar and teacher who devoted much effort to the German translation of classical Hellenic and Roman philosophers and poets as a young man, and he became a very famous and influential philosopher of [[Haskalah]]. His book ''Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum'' can be regarded as one of the main works of Jewish Enlightenment.

Often this text which explains the real subject of "amelioration" in Dohm's defense, is still underestimated as a contribution to philosophy—probably because it was directly connected with the historical situation and the social conditions of the author's life. On the other hand, a lot of historians concerned about Haskalah criticized the heroic image about Moses Mendelssohn in which he appears as the starting point of Jewish enlightenment without any respect to earlier attempts around the beginning of the 18th century.

Regarding the present accusations and complaints concerning the current state of Judaism as a modern Christian prejudice which just had replaced the medieval ones (like poisoning fountains, ritual slaughtering of Christian children on Pessah etc.),&lt;ref&gt;Moses Mendelssohn offered 1782 a little history of antisemitism in his [http://www.judaica-frankfurt.de/content/pageview/121698 preface] to his German translation of [[Menasseh Ben Israel|Mannaseh ben Israel]]'s "Salvation of the Jews" (''Vindiciae Judaeorum'' translated as "[http://www.judaica-frankfurt.de/content/titleinfo/134519 Rettung der Juden]"; Engl. transl.: {{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1838d|loc=82}}).&lt;/ref&gt; his subject of amelioration was the religion and especially the one which has to be separated from the state.

The two parts of his books have no titles except ''Erster'' and ''Zweiter Abschnitt'' ("first" and "second section"), and the first one treated clearly the contemporary conflicts of the state and the second those of religion. In the first the author developed his political theory towards a utopia of a just and tolerant democracy, which he identified with the political attempt of the Mosaic Law: therefore the title "Jerusalem". In the second part he worked out a new pedagogic charge which every religion has to fulfill in the private sector. It was reduced to it, because the tolerant state should be separated from any religion. Hence the [[Halakha|Mosaic law]] and the traditional practice of jurisdiction was no longer the business of Judaism, if there would be a tolerant state. Instead the new charge of religion would be the education of just and tolerant citizens. The book as a whole summarizes Moses Mendelssohn's critic concerning the contemporary conditions of the Prussian Monarchy and the legal status of the different religions, which finally means the civil status of its inhabitants according to their faith—the subject of [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]]'s ''[[#cite note-0|Mémoire]]''.

===The philosophical issue (first part)===
[[File:Johann georg sulzer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Georg Sulzer]]]]
Mendelssohn's concept of political theory has to be understood from the historical situation in Prussian Monarchy and he formulated his theory before Kant. In 1771 he was also chosen by [[Johann Georg Sulzer]], who wanted him as a member of the philosophical department at the ''Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften''. But Sulzer's call was prohibited by [[Frederick the Great#Religious tolerance|Frederick the Great]]. The royal intervention clearly showed the borders of enlightenment and tolerance within Prussian monarchy, as far as the separation between religion and state was concerned.&lt;ref&gt;There is no doubt about the fact that Prussia profited a lot, allowing Protestant and Jewish immigrants to settle down in its territories.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792 [[Immanuel Kant|Immanel Kant]] used in ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason|Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft]]'' a conventional theological argument about the inferiority of the [[Mosaic law]] which would violently force mankind to a moral attitude, so it could not be really understood as a religion.

====Despotism (Spinoza and Montesquieu)====

Moses Mendelssohn opened the first part of his treatise which was published in 1783, with a very similar understanding of religion, but he chose as political example the "Roman Catholic despotism". Although his description of the conflict between state and religion as a conflict between common sense and religion was very close to that of [[Baruch Spinoza]] in his ''Tractatus theologico-politicus'', Mendelssohn mentioned Spinoza only briefly,&lt;ref&gt;The relation was studied thoroughly by Julius {{Harvnb|Guttmann|1931}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by a comparison of his merits in metaphysics that corresponded to [[Hobbes]]' in the field of moral philosophy. [[Montesquieu]]'s more recent political theory remarked a change in the contemporary situation, when this conflict caused finally the decline of the church and also hopes and fears about the expected end of the ''ancient régime:''

{{quote|Der Despotismus hat den Vorzug, daß er bündig ist. So lästig seine Forderungen dem gesunden Menschenverstande sind, so sind sie doch unter sich zusammenhängend und systematisch. […] So auch nach römisch-katholischen Grundsätzen die kirchliche Verfassung. […] Räumet ihr alle ihre Forderungen ein; so wisset ihr wenigstens, woran ihr euch zu halten habet. Euer Gebäude ist aufgeführt, und in allen Theilen desselben herrscht vollkommene Ruhe. Freylich nur jene fürchterliche Ruhe, wie Montesquieu sagt, die Abends in einer Festung ist, welche des Nachts mit Sturm übergehen soll. […] So bald aber die Freyheit an diesem systematischen Gebäude etwas zu verrücken wagt, so drohet Zerrüttung von allen Seiten, und man weis am Ende nicht mehr, was davon stehen bleiben kann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=I. Abschnitt, 4-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despotism has the advantage that it is consistent. How inagreeable its demands might be commonsense, they are coherent and systematic. […] As well as the church constitution according to Roman Catholic principles: […] As long as you follow all its demands, you know what to do. Your edifice is founded, and perfect silence reigns in all its parts. Certainly only that terrifying kind of silence, as Montesquieu has objected, that you will find in a fortress, before it will be taken by storm at nightfall. […] But as soon as liberty dares to move something in this edifice, it will threaten disruption everywhere. So at the end you do not know which part of the building will not be ruined.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The natural condition of man is intolerance (Thomas Hobbes)====

[[File:Leviathan.jpg|thumb|right|"Non est potestas super terram quae comparatur ei [There is no power ruling the earth which can be compared with His.] Iob 41:24" — The frontispiece of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Abraham Bosse]]  (London, 1651)]]

From this libertarian point of view he drew nearer to [[Thomas Hobbes]]' scenario of the "war of every man against every man" (''bellum omnium contra omnes'') which Hobbes had described as the "natural condition of mankind" in his book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'':

{{quote|Stand der Natur sey Stand des allgemeinen Aufruhrs, des Krieges aller wider alle, in welchem jeder mag, was er kann; alles Recht ist, wozu man Macht hat. Dieser unglückselige Zustand habe so lange gedauert, bis die Menschen übereingekommen, ihrem Elende ein Ende zu machen, auf Recht und Macht, in so weit es die öffentliche Sicherheit betrift, Verzicht zu thun, solche einer festgesetzten Obrigkeit in die Hände zu liefern, und nunmehr sey dasjenige Recht, was diese Obrigkeit befielt.

Für bürgerliche Freyheit hatte er entweder keinen Sinn, oder wollte sie lieber vernichtet, als so gemißbraucht sehen. […] Alles Recht gründet sich, nach seinem System, auf Macht, und alle Verbindlichkeit auf Furcht; da nun Gott der Obrigkeit an Macht unendlich überlegen ist; so sey auch das Recht Gottes unendlich über das Recht der Obrigkeit erhaben, und die Furcht vor Gott verbinde uns zu Pflichten, die keiner Furcht vor der Obrigkeit weichen dürfen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=I. Abschnitt, 7-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|[According to Hobbes] the state of nature was the state of a common riot, a ''war of every man against every man'', in which everyone ''might do'' what he ''could do;'' in which everything would be right as long as there were only the power to do it. This unfortunate condition lasted until men agreed to finish their misery and to abstain from right and power, as far as public safety was concerned. And they agreed to leave both in the hands of a chosen authority. From now on it was right, what this authority had ordered.

He [Thomas Hobbes] either had no sense for civil liberty or he just preferred to see it annihilated rather than have it thus abused. […] According to his system, all ''right'' is based on ''power'', and all ''common sense'' on ''fear.'' Since God in his power is infinitely superior to any [secular] authority, the right of God is also infinitely superior to the right of any authority. And this fear of God commits us to duties, which should never be abandoned for the fear of any [secular] authority.}}

From this natural human condition which was banned by a religious fear of God (in [[Abraham Bosse|Bosse]]'s frontispiece made up by a crowd of people), Mendelssohn defined the role of the state (the left column under the sword) and the role of the religion (the right column under the crook) and the way, how they both had to be brought into harmony:

{{quote|Der Staat gebietet und zwinget; die Religion belehrt und überredet; der Staat ertheilt Gesetze, die Religion Gebote. Der Staat hat physische Gewalt und bedient sich derselben, wo es nöthig ist; die Macht der Religion ist Liebe und Wohlthun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=I. Abschnitt, 28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The state gives orders and coerces; the religion educates and convinces; the state declares laws, religion offers precepts. The state has physical power and uses it, when it is necessary; the power of religion is ''charity'' and ''beneficience.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But, whatever the religion might be which had to be kept in harmony with the state, the state as a secular authority should never have the right to decide about the faith and the conscience of its citizens.

In Thomas Hobbes' ''Leviathan'' the argument that the fear of God also committed the state as an inferior power, was borrowed from a theological tradition which was also very common in Christian Patristic and its reception of the [[Tanakh]]. Mendelssohn obviously used Hobbes' moral philosophy to address the present conditions in the French and the Habsburg Monarchy and its Roman Catholic constitution, but his main address was probably Prussia and its "[[Frederick the Great#Music.2C arts.2C and learning|philosopher king]]".

But Mendelssohn's "triumph" over Hobbes did not mean that Hobbes' condition of human nature was not important for his own political theory. Hobbes' impressive justification of a social contract was much more useful for the rhetorical needs of [[Haskalah]] than [[Rousseau]]'s ''[[Social Contract#Thomas Hobbes.27s Leviathan .281651.29|contrat sociale]]'', because his moral philosophy reflected very deeply the consequences of the abuse of political power. And all contemporaries who had another faith than that of state religion, were quite familiar with these consequences.

====The contract of tolerance (John Locke)====

[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|right|John Locke in a portrait by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]] (1646–1723)]]

Through the category "freedom of conscience" (''Gewissensfreiheit'') Mendelssohn turned from the dark side ("war of every man against every man") to [[John Locke]]'s enlightened definition of "tolerance" and to his concept of the separation between religion and state:

{{quote|Locke, der in denselben verwirrungsvollen Zeitläuften lebte, suchte die Gewissensfreyheit auf eine andre Weise zu schirmen. In seinen Briefen über die Toleranz legt er die Definition zum Grunde: Ein Staat sey eine Gesellschaft von Menschen, die sich vereinigen, um ihre ''zeitliche'' Wohlfarth gemeinschaftlich zu befördern. Hieraus folgt alsdann ganz natürlich, daß der Staat sich um die Gesinnungen der Bürger, ihre ewige Glückseligkeit betreffend, gar nicht zu bekümmern, sondern jeden zu dulden habe, der sich bürgerlich gut aufführt, das heißt seinen Mitbürgern, in Absicht ihrer zeitlichen Glückseligkeit, nicht hinderlich ist. Der Staat, als Staat, hat auf keine Verschiedenheit der Religionen zu sehen; denn Religion hat an und für sich auf das Zeitliche keinen nothwendigen Einfluß, und stehet blos durch die Willkühr der Menschen mit demselben in Verbindung.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=I. Abschnitt, 12-13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Locke who lived in the same time full of confusion [as Hobbes], looked for another way to protect the freedom of conscience. In his letters on the tolerance he founded his definition as follows: A state should be an association of humans, who agreed to support together their ''temporal'' welfare. From this follows quite naturally that the state should not take care of the citizen's attitude concerning their eternal faith, it should rather tolerate everybody who behaves with civil respect — i.e. it should not obstruct its fellow citizens in respect of their temporal faith. The state, as civil authority, had not to observe the divergence; because religion in itself had not necessarily any influence on the temporal, it was just related with it by the arbitrariness of the humans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Locke's proposed relation between a tolerant state and the humans who were associated to it as citizens, had to be granted by a social contract. Moses Mendelssohn followed a simple judicial advice, when he described the subject of this contract as "perfect" and "imperfect" ''"rights"'' and ''"responsibilities"'':

{{quote|Es giebt vollkommene und unvollkommene, sowohl Pflichten, als Rechte. Jene heißen Zwangsrechte und Zwangspflichten; diese hingegen Ansprüche (Bitten) und Gewissenspflichten. Jene sind äusserlich, diese nur innerlich. Zwangsrechte dürfen mit Gewalt erpreßt; Bitten aber verweigert werden. Unterlassung der Zwangspflichten ist Beleidigung, Ungerechtigkeit; der Gewissenpflichten aber blos Unbilligkeit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=I. Abschnitt, 32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are perfect and imperfect, as well responsibilities — as rights. The former are called "coercive rights" and "coercive responsibilities" and the latter "requirements" (requests) and "responsilities of conscience". The former are formal, the latter only inner. It is allowed to enforce coercive rights, but also to refuse requests. The neglect of coercive responsibilities is an insult and an unfairness; but the neglect of responsilities of the conscience is only an inequity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mendelssohn's social contract the separation between state and religion was based on the distinction of the "formal" and the "inner" side. Therefore, religion in itself was no "formal" subject of the social contract, only the acts of a citizen had to be judged, as long as they had violated a "formal right" or "responsibility". Despite this separation of the religion from the political theory and its reduction to the private sphere, every religion had its own "inner" power which Mendelssohn described in the second part.

===The religious issue (second part)===

[[File:Frederick II of Prussia Coloured drawing.png|thumb|right|[[Frederick the Great]] in a coloured engraving]]

In his political theory Moses Mendelssohn had to criticize the present conditions of the Prussian state, and he did without mentioning it, partly for reasons of censorship and partly for rhetorical reasons. This was his polite way to say that its regent was centuries behind his own philosophy:

{{quote|Ich habe das Glück, in einem Staate zu leben, in welchem diese meine Begriffe weder neu, noch sonderlich auffallend sind. Der weise Regent, von dem er beherrscht wird, hat es, seit Anfang seiner Regierung, beständig sein Augenmerk seyn lassen, die Menschheit in Glaubenssachen, in ihr volles Recht einzusetzen. […] Mit weiser Mäßigung hat er zwar die Vorrechte der äußern Religion geschont, in deren Besitz er sie gefunden. Noch gehören vielleicht Jahrhunderte von Cultur und Vorbereitung dazu, bevor die Menschen begreifen werden, daß Vorrechte um der Religion willen weder rechtlich, noch im Grunde nützlich seyen, und daß es also eine wahre Wohlthat seyn würde, allen bürgerlichen Unterschied um der Religion willen schlechterdings aufzuheben. Indessen hat sich die Nation unter der Regierung dieses Weisen so sehr an Duldung und Vertragsamkeit in Glaubenssachen gewöhnt, daß Zwang, Bann und Ausschließungsrecht wenigstens aufgehört haben, populäre Begriffe zu seyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=II. Abschnitt, 5-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have the fortune to live in a state in which my opinions are neither new nor very extraordinary. Its wise regent who rules it, paid always, since the beginning of his reign, attention, that mankind gets its full right concerning all affairs of faith [literally: believe, confession]. […] With wise moderateness he preserved the privilege of the formal religion as he had found it. There are still centuries of civilization and preparation before us, when man will finally understand that privileges of a certain religion are neither based on law nor on the religion's own fundament, so that it will be a real benefit to abolish simply any civil divergence in favour of one religion. However under the rule of this Wise the nation got so accustomed to tolerance and compatibility in respect to other religions, that at least force, bann and the right to exclude are no longer popular terms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In consequence the second part on religious power had to criticize the present conditions of that religion which he always had to defend during his life. For these critics he needed the idea that state and religion should be divided, but kept in harmony, as well as the utopic postulation of a just state which should be the political target of a religious community. After this preparation, the finding of the preconditions in his political theory (the key or better: the ''ring'' in his whole argumentation), the first step was to comment the misconceived points of view: the adaptation to despotism, as it was postulated by many Christians discussing the "amelioration of the Jews".

====Falling to the upper floor (Lavater and Cranz)====

[[File:Johann Casper Lavater.jpg|thumb|right|The priest Johann Caspar Lavater]]

Therefore, Moses Mendelssohn refers to his older arguments which he used in his dispute with [[Lavater]] – and more recently in response to an anonymous recension of Mendelssohn's introduction to [[Menasseh Ben Israel|Menassah Ben Israel]]'s ''Vindication of the Jews''.&lt;ref&gt;August Friedrich Cranz from Prussia published it under this title and pretended to be Josef von Sonnenfels ("the admirer S***") – a privileged Jew who could influence the politics at Habsburg court. He addressed Mendelssohn directly: ''Das Forschen nach Licht und Recht in einem Schreiben an Herrn Moses Mendelssohn auf Veranlassung seiner merkwürdigen Vorrede zu Mannaseh Ben Israel (The searching for light and justice in a letter to Mr. Moses Mendelssohn occasioned by his remarkable preface to Mannaseh Ben Israel)'', "Vienna" 1782 (reprint: {{Harvnb|Cranz|1983|loc=73–87}}; Engl. transl: {{Harvnb|(Cranz)|1838|loc=117–145}}).&lt;/ref&gt; With the medieval metaphor of masonry for the [[art of memory]] (often represented allegorically as "[[prudence]]") and its reference to religious education as a moral and sentimental education, he tried to turn back Lavater's projection. While Christians like to regard the crisis of Judaism, Mendelssohn regards the present situation – in the eve of the [[French revolution]] – as a general crisis of religion:

{{quote|Wenn es wahr ist, daß die Ecksteine meines Hauses austreten, und das Gebäude einzustürzen drohet, ist es wohlgethan, wenn ich meine Habseligkeit aus dem untersten Stokwerke in das oberste rette? Bin ich da sicherer? Nun ist das Christentum, wie Sie wissen, auf dem Judentume gebauet, und muß nothwendig, wenn dieses fällt, mit ihm über einen Hauffen stürzen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=II. Abschnitt, 25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is true, that the cornerstones of my house had become so weak, that the building might tumble down, shall I follow the advice to save my goods from the ground to the upper floor? Will I be safer there? As you know, Christianity is built upon Judaism and so, if the latter tumbles, the former will necessarily fall over it in one heap of rubble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mendelssohn's house metaphor from the beginning of the first part reappears at the beginning of the second part. Here he used it to reflect the historical fact that Christianity never developed its own ethics independent from the [[ten commandments]], which are still part of the canonic redaction of the Christian Bible.

Lavater serves here as a more or less moderate example of the hypocritic religious man, whose religion is the favoured and the dominating one within the political system. Like in Hobbes' scenario he likes, what the system allows him to do – at least in this case: forcing another citizen to convert to the dominating religion.

====Jews as equal citizens and the crisis of Judaism (the reform of Haskalah)====

But this hypocrisy reflects once more the radicalism of Moses Mendelssohn's contract of tolerance: If the religion's business has to be reduced to the "inner side" and religion itself cannot be the formal subject of this contract, it simply means that state affairs like [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]] will be no longer religious affairs. Nevertheless, he was denying the contemporary practice of rabbinic jurisdiction, which was hardly acceptable for a lot of orthodox Jews. And one year after the publication of his book the denial of rabbinic jurisdiction became political practice in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], when a state edict, added to the "tolerance patent", submitted Jewish subjects to its own law court without regarding them on an equal footing with Christian subjects.

Moses Mendelssohn is supposed to be the first Maskilim of his time who denied the present conditions and the rabbinic practice attached to it. This condition was that each Jewish community had its own jurisdiction and that the coexistence of several communities often corrected judges. His proposition must not only regarded as very modern, it turned out to be substantial during the discussions of the [[French Legislative Assembly]] concerning the [[Jewish emancipation]] during the 1790s. In these debates Judaism was often supposed to be an "own nation within the nation" and the Jewish representatives had to abandon this former status, so that the Jewish population will gain the new status as equal citizens and that they will participate in the new law of the French constitution.

In his pragmatism Mendelssohn had to convince the Jewish population that they have to abandon the tradition of rabbinic jurisdiction, but in the same time they have no reason to feel inferior, because some Christians believe that the moral conditions of Jewish tradition has to be regarded as inferior to their theological concept of absolution.

It was up to the Christians to find the way back to their fundament, which was the Mosaic law. But it was up to the Jews to face the present situation, in which Jewish communities were abandoned by a wealthy and privileged minority, so that poverty was increasing rapidly – especially in the town ghettos. In his philosophy Moses Mendelssohn reacted to the change from medieval conditions among the communities, when an elite between rich and rabbinic families was ruling the community. New privileges were granted by the Prussian state to rich members of the community, so that they finally left the community by conversion. But Mendelssohn regarded beneficence less as a "coerce responsibility" than as a voluntary act of wealthy members.

====The ''ring'' (Lessing and deism)====

[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Recha Welcoming Her Father - 1877.jpg|thumb|right|Daja, Recha und Nathan in Lessing's play ''Nathan der Weise'' — painting by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]] (1877)]]

Moses Mendelssohn created a syncretism which combined contemporary humanistic idealism and its [[Deism|deistic]] concept of a natural religion based on rational principles with the living tradition of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenasic]] Judaism. His adoration of the Mosaic law should not be misunderstood as a kind of historical criticism, it was based on an own politically motivated interpretation of the [[Torah]] as a divine revelation which was offered to the prophet Moses, so that he will save Judaism from its materialistic decline, symbolized in worshipping the golden calf and idolatry, by the divine law.

For Moses Mendelssohn the Mosaic law was "divine", as long as the community following its principles would be just. The attribute "divine" was simply given by the law's function to create a just social fabric: the [[social contract]] in itself. The eternal truth of the law was bound to this function, and it was so less achievable, that any judgement of a rabbi had to be judged according to Salomonic Wisdom. Mendelssohn referred to an anecdote of the [[House of Hillel|Hillel school]] of [[Mishnah]] which has in itself an own theological formulation of the [[categorical imperative]] as Kant would later call it on:

{{quote|Ein Heide sprach: Rabbi, lehret mich das ganze Gesetz, indem ich auf einem Fuße stehe! Samai, an dem er diese Zumuthung vorher ergehen ließ, hatte ihn mit Verachtung abgewiesen; allein der durch seine unüberwindliche Gelassenheit und Sanftmuth berühmte Hillel sprach: Sohn! liebe deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst. Dieses ist der Text des Gesetzes; alles übrige ist Kommentar. Nun gehe hin und lerne!&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=II. Abschnitt, 58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;A goy said: "Rabbi, teach me the whole law, on which I stand with one foot!" Shammai to whom he addressed before with the same impertinence, disregardfully refused him. But Hillel who was famous for his insuperable serenity and mildness, replied: "Son! love thy neighbour as thyself. [Leviticus 19:18] This is the text of the law, the rest is commentary. Now go and learn!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this biblical proverb, often quoted in the New Testament including the beatitudes, Mendelssohn returned to the deistic adoration of the Mosaic law as the Jewish-Christian contribution to universal ethics:

{{quote|Diese Verfassung ist ein einziges Mal da gewesen: nennet sie die ''mosaische Verfassung'', bey ihrem Einzelnamen. Sie ist verschwunden, und ist dem Allwissenden allein bekannt, bey welchem Volke und in welchem Jahrhunderte sich etwas Aehnliches wieder wird sehen lassen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=II. Abschnitt, 123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The constitution had been here only once: you may call it the ''mosaic Constitution'', which was its name. It has disappeared, and only the Almighty knows, in which nation and in which century something similar will appear again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Mosaic Constitution" was just the Jewish name of the democratic constitution, as it was called by their ancestors. And probably some Jews were waiting for it like for a Messiah who would once unban them from feudal slavery.

The argument through which he inspired Lessing in his drama ''[[Nathan der Weise]]'', was the following: Each religion has not to be judged in itself, but only the acts of a citizen who keeps faith with it, according to a just law. This kind of law constitutes a just state, in which the people of different faith may live together in peace.

According to his philosophy the new charge of any religion in general was not jurisdiction, but education as a necessary preparation to become a just citizen. Mendelssohn's point of view was that of a teacher who translated a lot of classical rabbinic authors like Maimonides from Hebrew into German, so that a Jewish child would be attracted to learn German and Hebrew in the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Note that Mendelssohn's engagement for German was in resonance with his contemporaries who tried to establish German as an educated language at universities. Nevertheless he refused Yiddish as a "corrupt dialect": {{Harvnb|Ṿolḳov|2006|loc=184}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=DjGdCaHJMH0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA2-PA184,M1 Google Books]).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moses Mendelssohn's estimation of the civil conditions (1783)====

At the end of his book Mendelssohn returns to the real political conditions in Habsburg, French and Prussian Monarchy, because he was often asked to support Jewish communities in their territories. In fact none of these political systems were offering the tolerant conditions, so that every subject should have the same legal status regardless to his or her religious faith. (In his philosophy Mendelssohn discussed the discrimination of the individuum according to its religion, but not according to its gender.) On the other hand, a modern education which Mendelssohn regarded still as a religious affair, required a reformation of the religious communities and especially their organization of the education which has to be modernized.

As long as the state did not follow John Locke's requirement concerning the "freedom of conscience", any trial of an ethic education would be useless at all and every subject would be forced to live in separation according to their religious faith. Reflecting the present conditions Mendelssohn addresses – directly in the second person – to the political authorities:

{{quote|Ihr solltet glauben, uns nicht brüderlich wieder lieben, euch mit uns nicht bürgerlich vereinigen zu können, so lange wir uns durch das Zeremonialgesetz äusserlich unterscheiden, nicht mit euch essen, nicht von euch heurathen, das, so viel wir einsehen können, der Stifter eurer Religion selbst weder gethan, noch uns erlaubt haben würde? — Wenn dieses, wie wir von christlich gesinnten Männern nicht vermuthen können, eure wahre Gesinnung seyn und bleiben sollte; wenn die bürgerliche Vereinigung unter keiner andern Bedingung zu erhalten, als wenn wir von dem Gesetze abweichen, das wir für uns noch für verbindlich halten; so thut es uns herzlich leid, was wir zu erklären für nöthig erachten: so müssen wir auf bürgerliche Vereinigung Verzicht thun; so mag der Menschenfreund Dohm vergebens geschrieben haben, und alles in dem leidlichen Zustande bleiben, in welchem es itzt ist, in welchem es eure Menschenliebe zu versetzen, für gut findet. […] Von dem Gesetze können wir mit gutem Gewissen nicht weichen, und was nützen euch Mitbürger ohne Gewissen?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1783|loc=II. Abschnitt, 131-133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;You should think, that you are not allowed to return our brotherly love, to unite with us as equal citizens, as long as there is any formal divergence in our religious rite, so that we do not eat together with you and do not marry one of yours, which the founder of your religion, as far as we can see, neither would have done, nor would have allowed us? — If this has to be and to remain your real opinion, as we may not expect of men following the Christian ethos; if a civil unification is only available on the condition that we differ from the law which we are already considering as binding, then we have to announce – with deep regret – that we do better to abstain from the civil unification; then the philanthropist Dohm has probably written in vain and everything will remain on the awkward condition – as it is now and as your charity has chosen it. […] We cannot differ from the law with a clear conscience and what will be your use of citizens without conscience?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this paragraph it becomes very evident, that Moses Mendelssohn did not foresee the willingness of some Jewish men and women who left some years later their communities, because they do not want to suffer from a lower legal status any longer.

==History of reception==

[[File:Mendelssohn Tomb.JPG|thumb|right|Tombstone of Moses Mendelssohn in a drawing by [[Daniel Chodowiecki]] (1726-1801)]]

Moses Mendelssohn risked a lot, when he published this book, not only in front of the Prussian authority, but also in front of religious authorities – including Orthodox Rabbis. The following years some of his famous Christian friends stroke him at his very sensible side: his adoration for [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] who died 1781 and could not defend his friend as he always had done during his lifetime.

===Mendelssohn and Spinoza in the Pantheism Controversy===

The strike was done by [[Lavater]]'s friend [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] who published an episode between himself and Lessing, in which Lessing confessed to be a "Spinozist", while reading [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' poem ''[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Über die Lehre des Spinoza'' ({{Harvnb|Jacobi|1789|loc=19-22}}) was a reply to Mendelssohn's ''Morgenstunden'' ({{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1786}}). In an earlier publication Jacobi opposed to Mendelssohn's opinion about Spinoza. On the frontispice of his publication we see an allegoric representation of "the good thing" with a banner like a scythe over a human skeleton (the skull with a butterfly was already an attribute dedicated to Mendelssohn since his prized essay ''Phädon''), referring to a quotation of [[Immanuel Kant]] on page 119 ({{Harvnb|Jacobi|1786}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8YAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP8&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]). Following the quotation Jacobi defines Kant's "gute Sache" in his way by insisting on the superiority of the "European race". His publication in the year of Mendelssohn's death makes it evident, that Jacobi intended to replace Mendelssohn as a contemporary "Socrate" — including his own opinion about Spinoza.&lt;/ref&gt; "Spinozism" became quite fashionable that time and was a rather superficial reception, which was not so much based on a solid knowledge of Spinoza's philosophy than on the "secret letters" about Spinoza.&lt;ref&gt;W. Schröder: ''Spinoza im Untergrund. Zur Rezeption seines Werks in der littérature clandestine [The underground Spinoza - On the reception of his works in French secret letters]'', in: {{Harvnb|Delf|Schoeps|Walther|1994|loc=142-161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These letters circulated since Spinoza's lifetime in the monarchies, where Spinoza's own writings were on the index of the Catholic [[Inquisition]], and often they regarded Spinoza's philosophy as "atheistic" or even as a revelation of the secrets of [[Kabbalah]] mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Hammacher: ''Ist Spinozismus Kabbalismus? Zum Verhältnis von Religion und Philosophie im ausgehenden 17. und dem beginnenden 18. Jahrhundert [Is Spinozism Kabbalism? On the relation between religion and philosophy around the turn to the 18th century]'', in: {{Harvnb|Hammacher|1985|loc=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German Spinoza fashion of the 1780s was more a "[[pantheism controversy|pantheistic]]" reception which gained the attraction of rebellious "atheism", while its followers are returning to a romantic concept of religion.&lt;ref&gt;It is astonishing, how superstitious the level of this Spinoza reception was in comparison to that of Spinoza's time among scholars and scientists at the Leyden University: [1] M. Bollacher: ''Der Philosoph und die Dichter – Spiegelungen Spinozas in der deutschen Romantik [The philosopher and the poets - Reflexions of German romanticism in front of Spinoza]'', in: {{Harvnb|Delf|Schoeps|Walther|1994|loc=275-288}}.

Hammacher: ''Il confronto di Jacobi con il neospinozismo di Goethe e di Herder [The confrontation between Jacobi and the Neo-Spinozism of Goethe and Herder]'', in: {{Harvnb|Zac|1978|loc=201-216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, 1819 during the [[Hep-Hep riots|''hep hep'' riots]] or pogroms, this new form of idealism turned out to be very intolerant, especially in the reception of [[Jakob Fries]].&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Rose: ''German Nationalists and the Jewish Question: Fichte and the Birth of Revolutionary Antisemitism'', in: {{Harvnb|Rose|1990|loc=117-132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fashion ''pantheism'' did not correspond to [[Moses Mendelssohn#Later years and legacy|Mendelssohn]]'s deistic reception of [[Spinoza]]&lt;ref&gt;As far as ''Jerusalem'' is concerned, Mendelssohn's reception of Spinoza has been studied by Willi Goetschel: "An Alternative Universalism" in {{Harvnb|Goetschel|2004|loc=147-169}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=CYcOfkrduWYC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0 Google Books]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lessing]] whose collected works he was publishing. He was not so wrong, because Spinoza himself developed a fully rational form of [[deism]] in his main work ''Ethica'', without any knowledge of the later ''pantheistic'' reception of his philosophy.  Mendelssohn published in his last years his own attitude to Spinoza – not without his misunderstandings, because he was frightened to lose his authority which he still had among rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn published his ''Morgenstunden'' mainly as a refute of the pantheistic Spinoza reception ({{Harvnb|Mendelssohn|1786}}).&lt;/ref&gt; On his own favor [[Goethe]] fashioned himself as a "revolutionary" in his ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'', while he was very angry with Jacobi because he feared the consequences of the latter's publication using Goethe's poem.&lt;ref&gt;[1] There exists an unverified anecdote in which Herder refused to bring a lent Spinoza book to the library, using this justification: "Anyway there is nobody here in this town, who is able to understand Spinoza." The librarian Goethe was so upset about this insult, that he came to Herder's house accompanied by policemen. [2] About the role of Goethe's ''Prometheus'' in the ''[[pantheism controversy]]'', Goethe's correspondence about it and his self portrait in ''Dichtung und Wahrheit'': {{Harvnb|Blumenberg|1986|loc=428-462}}. [3] {{Harvnb|Bollacher|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This episode caused a reception in which Moses Mendelssohn as a historical protagonist and his philosophy is underestimated.

Nevertheless, Moses Mendelssohn had a great influence on other ''Maskilim'' and on the [[Jewish emancipation]], and on nearly every philosopher discussing the role of the religion within the state in 19th century Western Europe.

===The French Revolution and the early Haskalah reform of education===

[[File:Jacobson.gif|thumb|left|The philanthropist and reformer [[Israel Jacobson]] in a contemporary drawing]]

Mendelssohn's dreams about a tolerant state became reality in the new French Constitution of 1791. [[Berr Isaac Berr]], the Ashkenazic representative in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], praised the French republic as the "Messiah of modern Judaism", because he had to convince French communities for the new plans of a Jewish reform movement to abandon their autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Berr Isaac Berr: ''Lettre d'un citoyen, membre de la ci-devant communauté des Juifs de Lorraine, à ses confrères, à l'occasion du droit de citoyen actif, rendu aux Juifs par le décrit du 28 Septembre 1791'', {{Harvnb|Berr|1907}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The French version of Haskalah, called ''régénération'', was more moderate than the Jewish reform movement in Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkovitz|1989|loc=71-75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While better conditions were provided by the constitution of the French Republic, the conflict between Orthodox Rabbis and wealthy and intellectual laymen of the reform movement became evident with the radical initiatives by Mendelssohn's friend and student [[David Friedlaender#The .22dry baptism.22 initiative|David Friedländer]] in Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;On the contemporary evolution of Jewish education → ''Eigenheit und Einheit: Modernisierungsdiskurse des deutschen Judentums der Emanzipationszeit [Propriety and Unity: Discourses of modernization in German Judaism during the Emancipation period]'', {{Harvnb|Gotzmann|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first who followed Mendelssohn's postulations in education, since he founded 1776 together with [[Isaak Daniel Itzig]] the ''Jüdische Freischule für mittellose Berliner Kinder'' ("Jewish Free School for Impecunious Children in Berlin") and 1778 the ''Chevrat Chinuch Ne'arim'' ("Society for the Education of Youth"). His 1787 attempt of a German translation of the Hebrew prayerbook ''Sefer ha-Nefesh'' ("Book of the Soul") which he did for the school, finally became not popular as a ritual reform, because 1799 he went so far to offer his community a "dry baptism" as an affiliation by the Lutheran church. There was a seduction of free-thinking Jews to identify the seclusion from European modern culture with Judaism in itself and it could end up in baptism. As [[Heinrich Heine]] commented it, some tend to reduce Judaism to a "calamity" and to buy with a conversion to Christianity an "entré billet" for the higher society of the Prussian state. By the end of the 18th century there were a lot of contemporary concepts of enlightenment in different parts of Europe, in which humanism and a secularized state were thought to replace religion at all.

[[Israel Jacobson]], himself a merchant, but also an engaged pedagogue in charge of a land rabbi in Westphalia, was much more successful than David Friedländer. Like Moses Mendelssohn he regarded education as a religious affair. One reason for his success was the political fact, that Westphalia became part of France. Jacobson was supported by the new government, when he founded in 1801 a boys' school for trade and elementary knowledge in Seesen (a small town near [[Harz]]), called "Institut für arme Juden-Kinder". The language used during the lessons was German. His concept of pedagogy combined the ideas of Moses Mendelssohn with those of the socially engaged ''Philantropin'' school which [[Johann Bernhard Basedow|Basedow]] founded in Dessau, inspired by [[Rousseau#Education and child rearing|Rousseau]]'s ideas about education. 1802 also poor Christian boys were allowed to attend the school and it became one of the first schools, which coeducated children of different faith. Since 1810 religious ceremonies were also held in the first Reform Temple, established on the school's ground and equipped by an organ. Before 1810 the Jewish community of the town had their celebrations just in a prayer room of the school. Since 1810 Mendelssohn needed the instrument to accompany German and Hebrew songs, sung by the pupils or by the community in the "Jacobstempel".&lt;ref&gt;He published his arrangements, 26 German and 4 Hebrew hymns adapted to 17 church tunes, in a chant book in which the score of the Hebrew songs were printed from the right to the left. {{Harvnb|Jacobson|1810}}. In this year he founded a second school in Cassel which was the residence of the Westphalian [[Jerome Bonaparte|King Jerome]], Napoleon's brother.&lt;/ref&gt; He adapted these prayers himself to tunes, taken from famous Protestant chorales. In the charge of a rabbi he read the whole service in German according to the ideas of the reformed Protestant rite, and he refused the "medieval" free rhythmic style of ''chazzan'', as it was common use in the other Synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Idelsohn|1992|loc=232-295}} (Chapter XII) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=sqrrPJ6Eh-cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de#PPA232,M1 Google Books]).&lt;/ref&gt; 1811 Israel Jacobson introduced a "confirmation" ceremony of Jewish boys and girls as part of his reformed rite.

===Conflicts in Prussia after the Viennese Congress===

Since Westphalia came under Prussian rule according to the [[Congress of Vienna]] 1815, the Jacobson family settled to Berlin, where Israel opened a Temple in his own house. The orthodox community of Berlin asked the Prussian authorities to intervene and so his third "Jacobstempel" was closed. Prussian officers argued, that the law allows only one house of Jewish worship in Berlin. In consequence a reformed service was celebrated as ''[[minyan]]'' in the house of Jacob Herz Beer. The chant was composed by his son who later became a famous opera composer under the name [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. In opposition to Israel's radical refuse of the traditional Synagogue chant, Meyerbeer reintegrated the ''chazzan'' and the recitation of Pentateuch and Prophets into the reformed rite, so that it became more popular within the community of Berlin.

[[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s appreciation of the Mosaic Ethics was influenced by Mendelssohn's book ''Jerusalem'' as well as by personal exchange with him. It seems that in the tradition of Christian deistic enlightenment the Torah was recognized as an important contribution to the Jewish-[[Christian civilization]], though contemporary Judaism was often compared to the decadent situation, when Aaron created the golden calf (described in Exodus 32), so enlightenment itself was fashioning itself with the archetypical role of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. Rose: ''Herder: "Humanity" and the Jewish Question'', in: {{Harvnb|Rose|1990|loc=97-109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the contemporary Jewish population was characterized by Herder as a strange Asiatic and selfish "nation" which was always separated from others, not a very original conception which was also popular in the discussions of the National Assembly which insisted that Jewish citizens have to give up their status as a nation, if they want to join the new status as equal citizens.

[[File:Hegel by Kugler (retouched).jpg|thumb|left|[[Hegel]] in a drawing by one of his students]]

[[Hegel#Heidelberg and Berlin: 1816–1831|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] whose philosophy was somehow inspired by a "Mosaic" mission, was not only an important professor at the University in Berlin since 1818, he also had a positive influence on reform politics of Prussia. Though his missionary ambitions and his ideas about a general progress in humanity which can be found in his philosophy, [[Hegel]] was often described by various of his students as a very open minded and warm hearted person who was always ready to discuss controversially his ideas and the ideas opposed to it. He was probably the professor in Prussia who had the most Jewish students, among them very famous ones like [[Heinrich Heine]] and [[Ludwig Börne]], and also reform pedagogues like [[Nachman Krochmal]] from Galicia.

When Hegel was still in Heidelberg, he was accusing his colleague [[Jakob Fries]], himself a student of [[Fichte]], for his superstitious ideas concerning a German nation and he disregarded his antisemitic activities as a mentor of the [[Urburschenschaft|Burschenschaft]] which organized the [[Wartburgfest]], the murder of [[August von Kotzebue#Assassination|August von Kotzebue]] and the [[hep hep riots]]. In 1819 he went with his students to the hep hep riot in Heidelberg and they were standing with raised arms before the people who lived in the poverty of the Jewish ghetto, when the violent mob was arriving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rose|1990|loc=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As result he asked his student [[Friedrich Wilhelm Carové]] to found the first student association which also allows access for Jewish students, and finally [[Eduard Gans]] founded in November the ''Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden [Society for Culture and Science of the Jews]'' on the perspective that the ideas of enlightenment must be replaced by a ''synthesis'' of European Jewish and Christian traditions. This perspective followed some fundamental ideas which Hegel developed in his dialectic philosophy of history, and it was connected with hopes that finally an enlightened state will secularize religious traditions and fulfill their responsibility. In some respect this ''synthesis'' was expected as a kind of revolution, though an identification with the demagogues was not possible—as Heinrich Heine said in a letter 1823:

{{quote|Obschon ich aber in England ein Radikaler und in Italien ein Carbonari bin, so gehöre ich doch nicht zu den Demagogen in Deutschland; aus dem ganz zufälligen und g[e]ringfügigen Grunde, daß bey einem Siege dieser letztern einige tausend jüdische Hälse, und just die besten, abgeschnitten werden.&lt;ref&gt;Heine in a letter to Moritz Embden, dated the 2 February 1823 — quoted after the [http://hhp.uni-trier.de/Projekte/HHP/briefe/04baende/band20/index_html?widthgiven=30&amp;letterid=W20B0046&amp;lineref=0&amp;mode=1 Heinrich Heine Portal of University Trier] (letter no. 46 according to the edition of "Weimarer Säkularausgabe"   vol. 20, p. 70).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even though I am a Radical in Britain and a Carbonari in Italy, I do certainly not belong to the demagogues in Germany—just for the very simple reason that in case of the latter's victory some thousand Jewish throats will be cut—the best ones first.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the last two years Prussia passed many restrictive laws which excluded Jews from military and academic offices and as members of parliament. The expectation that the Prussian state will once follow the reasons of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit|Weltgeist]]'', failed, instead it was turning backwards and the restrictions increased up to 1841, whereas the officer Dohm expected a participation as equal citizens for 1840. Moses Mendelssohn who was regarded as a Jewish Luther by Heinrich Heine, made several predictions of the future in ''Jerusalem''. The worst of them became true, and finally a lot of Jewish citizens differed from the law and became what Mendelssohn called "citizens without conscience". Because there was no "freedom of conscience" in Prussia, [[Heinrich Heine]] left the ''Verein'' without any degree in law and finally—like Eduard Gans himself—converted to the Lutheran church 1825.

===Moses Mendelssohn's ''Jerusalem'' and the rise of revolutionary antisemitism===
[[File:Marx4.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Marx in 1861]]
[[Karl Marx]] was not a direct student of [[Hegel]], but Hegel's philosophy, whose lectures were also frequented by Prussian officers, was still very present after his death in 1831 as well among conservatives as among radicals who were very disappointed about the present conditions and the failed reform of the state.  1835, when Karl inscribed as a student, Hegel's book ''Leben Jesu'' was published posthumously and its reception was divided into the so-called Right or Old and the Left or [[Young Hegelians]] around [[Bruno Bauer]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. Karl had grown up in a family which were related to the traditional rabbinic family Levi through his mother. Because the Rhine province became part of the French Republic, where the full civil rights were granted by the Constitution, Marx's father could work as a lawyer (''Justizrat'') without being discriminated for his faith. This changed, when the Rhine province became part of Prussia after the Congress of Vienna. In 1817 [[Heinrich Marx]] felt forced to convert to the Lutheran church, so that he could save the existence of his family continuing his profession.&lt;ref&gt;For more interest in Karl Marx' biography see the entry in: {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824 his son was baptized, when he was six years old.

The occasion that the Jewish question was debated again, was the 7th Landtag of the Rhine province 1843. The discussion was about an 1839 law which tried to withdraw the [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]] edict from 1812. 1839 it was refused by the Staatsrat, 1841 it was published again to see what the public reactions would be. The debate was opened between Ludwig Philippson (''Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums'') and Carl Hermes (''Kölnische Zeitung''). Karl Marx was thinking to join the debate with an own answer of the Jewish question, but he left it to [[Bruno Bauer]]. His later answer was mainly a reception of Bauer's argument. Marx's and Bauer's polemic style was probably influenced by [[Heinrich Heine]]'s ''Damascus letters'' (Lutetia Teil 1, 1840) in which Heine was calling [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] a "revolutionary" and in which he used phrases such as:

{{quote|Bey den französischen Juden, wie bey den übrigen Franzosen, ist das Gold der Gott des Tages und die Industrie ist die herrschende Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heine|1988|loc=53}}. Original text and autograph (please click on "[http://hhp.uni-trier.de/Projects/HHP/werke/baende/D13/loadimage?filename=D13S0052_01E&amp;book=D13&amp;refpage=0052&amp;refline=01&amp;refsigle=E&amp;refnodeid=176&amp;anzfaks=15 E]") at [http://hhp.uni-trier.de/Projects/HHP/werke/baende/D13/getpage?pageid=D13S0052&amp;mode=1 Heinrich Heine Portal of University Trier]. Heinrich Heine sent letters and books to his wife Betty de Rothschild since 1834, and he asked the family for financial support during the 50s.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;For French Jews as well for all the other French gold is the God of the day and industry the dominating religion!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas Hegel's idea of a humanistic secularization of religious values was deeply rooted in the idealistic emancipation debates around Mendelssohn in which a liberal and tolerant state has to be created on the fundament of a modern (religious) education, the only force of modernization according to Marx was capitalism, the erosion of traditional values, after they had turned into material values. The difference between the ''ancien régime'' and Rothschild, chosen as a representant of a successful minority of the Jewish population, was that they had nothing to lose, especially not in Prussia where this minority finally tended to convert to Christianity. But since the late 18th century the Prussian Jews were merely reduced to their material value, at least from the administrative perspective of the Prussian Monarchy.

Marx's answer to Mendelssohn's question: "What will be your use of citizens without conscience?" was simply that: The use was now defined as a material value which could be expressed as a sum of money, and the Prussian state like any other monarchy finally did not care about anything else.

{{quote|Der Monotheismus des Juden ist daher in der Wirklichkeit der Polytheismus der vielen Bedürfnisse, ein Polytheismus, der auch den Abtritt zu einem Gegenstand des göttlichen Gesetzes macht. Das ''praktische Bedürfniß, der Egoismus'' ist das Prinzip der ''bürgerlichen Gesellschaft'' und tritt rein als solches hervor, sobald die bürgerliche Gesellschaft den politischen Staat vollständig aus sich herausgeboren. Der Gott des ''praktischen Bedürfnisses und Eigennutzes'' ist das ''Geld.''

Das Geld ist der eifrige Gott Israels, vor welchem kein andrer Gott bestehen darf. Das Geld erniedrigt alle Götter des Menschen, - und verwandelt sie in Waare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1844|loc=184}}; Engl. transl. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111004101043/http://trotsky.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/index.htm On the Jewish Question]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Behind Jewish monotheism is the polytheism of various needs, a polytheism which turns even a doormat into an object of the divine law. The ''practical need, the egoism'' is the fundament of the ''civil society'' and itself finally emerges clearly, when a civil society has born its own political state entirely. The God of the ''practical need and self-interest'' is the ''money''.

The money is the busily God of Israel who do not accept any other God beneath himself. The money humiliates all Gods of mankind and turns them into a ware.}}

{{Jewish philosophy|philosophy}}

Bauer's reference to the golden calf may be regarded a modern form of antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lawrence Rose ({{Harvnb|Rose|1990|loc=263ff; 296ff}}) used the term "revolutionary antisemitism" and analysed, how it developed between Bauer and Marx.&lt;/ref&gt; But Karl Marx turned Bauer's reference into a "syncretism between Mosaic monotheism and Babylonian polytheism". His answer was antisemitic, as far as it was antisemitic that his family was forced to leave their religious tradition for very existential reasons. He hardly foresaw that the rhetorical use of Judaism as a metaphor of capitalism (originally a satirical construction of Heinrich Heine, talking about the "prophet Rothschild") will be constantly repeated in a completely unsatirical way in the history of socialism. [[Marx#Marx and antisemitism|Karl Marx]] used these words in a less satirical than in an antihumanistic way. Its context was the controversy between Old and Young Hegelian and his polemic aimed the "Old Hegelian". He regarded their thoughts as a Prussian form of the ''ancien régime'', figured and justified as the humanists, and himself as part of a Jewish privileged minority which was more adapted to modern citizenship than any representant of the Prussian ''ancien régime''. While the humanists felt threatened by the industrial revolution, also because they simply feared to lose their privileges, it was no longer the ''parvenu'' (as [[Bernard Lazare]] would call the rich minority later) who needed to be "ameliorated".

Moses Mendelssohn was not mentioned in Marx's answer to the Jewish question, but Marx might have regarded his arguments as an important part of the humanists' approach to ameliorate the Prussian constitution. Nevertheless, Mendelssohn had already discussed the problem of injustice caused by material needs in his way: In ''Jerusalem'' he advised to recompense politicians according to the loss of their regular income. It should not be lower for a rich man, and not higher for a poor. Because if anyone will have a material advantage, just by being a member of parliament, the result cannot be a fair state governing a just society. Only an idealistic citizen who was engaging in politics according to his modern religious education, was regarded as a politician by Moses Mendelssohn.

===Mendelssohn's philosophy during the Age of Zionism===

Karl Marx's point of view that the idealistic hopes for religious tolerance will be disappointed in the field of politics, and soon the political expectations will disappear in a process of economical evolution and of secularization of their religious values, was finally confirmed by the failure of the [[1848 revolution]]. Though the fact that revolutionary antisemitism was used frequently by left and right wing campaigners, for him it was more than just rhetoric. His own cynical and refusing attitude concerning religion was widespread among his contemporaries and it was related with the own biography and a personal experience full of disappointments and conflicts within the family. Equal participation in political decisions was not granted by a national law as they hoped, the participation was merely dependent on privileges which were defined by material values and these transformations cause a lot of fears and the tendence to turn backwards. Even in France where the constitution granted the equal status as citizens since 100 years, the [[Dreyfus affair]] made evident that a lot of institutions of the French Republic like the military forces were already ruled by the circles of the ''ancien régime''. So the major population was still excluded from participation and could not identify with the state and its authorities. Social movements and emigration to America or to Palestine were the response, often in a combination. The utopies of these movements were sometimes secular, sometimes religious, and they often had charismatic leaders.

[[File:Martin Buber.jpg|thumb|left|Martin Buber among his students]]

1897 there was the [[First Zionist Congress]] in Basel (Switzerland), which was an initiative by [[Theodor Herzl]]. The Zionist [[Martin Buber]] with his rather odd combination of German Romanticism ([[Fichte]]) and his interest in [[Hasidism]] as a social movement was not very popular on the Congress, but he finally found a very enthusiastic reception in a Zionist student association in Prague, which was also frequented by [[Max Brod]] and [[Franz Kafka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baioni|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a time when the Jewish question has become a highly ideological matter mainly treated in a populistic way from outside, it became a rather satirical subject for Jewish writers of Yiddish, German, Polish and Russian language.

[[Franz Kafka]] learned Yiddish and Hebrew as an adult and he had a great interest for [[Hasidism]] as well as for rabbinic literature. He had a passion for Yiddish drama which became very popular in Central Europe that time and which brought [[Yiddish]] literature, usually written as narrative prosa, on stage mixed up with a lot of music (parodies of synagogue songs etc.). His interest corresponded to [[Martin Buber]]'s romantic idea that [[Hasidism]] was the folk culture of [[Ashkenazi Jews]], but he also realized that this romanticism inspired by Fichte and German nationalism, expressed the fact that the rural traditions were another world quite far from its urban admirers. This had changed since Maskilim and school reformers like Israel Jakobson have settled to the big towns and still disregarded Yiddish as a "corrupt" and uneducated language.

In the parable of his romance ''[[The Trial|Der Process]]'', published 1915 separately as short story entitled ''[[Before the Law|Vor dem Gesetz]]'', the author made a parody of a [[midrash]] legend, written during the period of early [[Merkabah]] mysticism (6th century), that he probably learned by his Hebrew teacher. This ''Pesikhta'' described Moses' meditation in which he had to fight against Angelic guardians on his way to the divine throne in order to bring justice (the [[Torah]]) to the people of Israel.

Somehow it also reflected Mendelssohn's essay in the context of the public debate on the [[Jewish question]] during the 1770s and 1780s, which was mainly led by Christian priests and clerics, because this parable in the romance was part of a Christian prayer. A mysterious priest prayed only for the main protagonist "Josef K." in the dark empty cathedral. The bizarre episode in the romance reflected the historical fact that Jewish emancipation had taken place within Christian states, where the separation between state power and the church was never fully realized. There were several similar parodies by Jewish authors of the 19th century in which the Christians dominating the state and the citizens of other faith correspond to the jealous guardians. Unlike the prophet Moses who killed the angel guarding the first gate, the peasant ("ein Mann vom Lande") in the parable is waiting to his death, when he finally will be carried through the gate which was only made for him. In the narration of the romance which was never published during his lifetime, the main protagonist Josef K. will finally be killed according to a judgement which was never communicated to him.

===Hannah Arendt's reception of the Haskalah and of the emancipation history===

[[Hannah Arendt]]'s political theory is deeply based on theological and existentialist arguments, regarding Jewish Emancipation in Prussia as a failure – especially in her writings after World War II. But the earliest publication discussing the [[Haskalah]] with respect to the German debate of the Jewish Question opened by Christian Wilhelm von Dohm and Moses Mendelssohn dates to 1932.&lt;ref&gt;The early essay concerning Lessing, Herder and Mendelssohn: ''Aufklärung und Judenfrage'', {{Harvnb|Arendt-Stern|1932}} was published in a periodical called "Zeitschrift für die Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland". Here Hannah Arendt regarded Moses Mendelssohn, because of his ideas concerning education (history as a teacher) and his negative attitude against [[Yiddish]], as too naive and too idealistic; thus, in her view, Mendelssohn was not able to face the real social and historic problems among the inhabitants of the contemporary [[ghetto]]. In her criticism of Mendelssohn she tried to understand why the following generation of [[Maskilim]] were so convinced of the inferiority of Jewish tradition in comparison with the philosophy of enlightenment.&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay [[Hannah Arendt]] takes Herder's side in reviving the debate among [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm|Dohm]], [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. According to her Moses Mendelssohn's concept of emancipation was assimilated to the pietist concept of Lessing's enlightenment based on a separation between the truth of reason and the truth of history, which prepared the following generation to decide for the truth of reason and against history and Judaism which was identified with an unloved past. Somehow her theological argument was very similar to that of Kant, but the other way round. For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] as a Lutheran Christian religion started with the destruction and the disregard of the Mosaic law, whereas Herder as a Christian understood the Jewish point of view in so far, that this is exactly the point where religion ends. According to Hannah Arendt the Jews were forced by Mendelssohn's form of [[Haskalah]] to insert themselves into a Christian version of history in which Jews had never existed as subjects:

{{quote|So werden die Juden die Geschichtslosen in der Geschichte. Ihre Vergangenheit ist ihnen durch das Herdersche Geschichtsverstehen entzogen. Sie stehen also wieder vis à vis de rien. Innerhalb einer geschichtlichen Wirklichkeit, innerhalb der europäischen säkularisierten Welt, sind sie gezwungen, sich dieser Welt irgendwie anzupassen, sich zu bilden. Bildung aber ist für sie notwendig all das, was nicht jüdische Welt ist. Da ihnen ihre eigene Vergangenheit entzogen ist, hat die gegenwärtige Wirklichkeit begonnen, ihre Macht zu zeigen. Bildung ist die einzige Möglichkeit, diese Gegenwart zu überstehen. Ist Bildung vor allem Verstehen der Vergangenheit, so ist der "gebildete" Jude angewiesen auf eine fremde Vergangenheit. Zu ihr kommt er über eine Gegenwart, die er verstehen muß, weil er an ihr beteiligt wurde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arendt-Stern|1932|loc=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;In consequence the Jews have become without history in history. According to Herder's understanding of history they are separated from their own past. So again they are in front of nothing. Within a historical reality, within the European secularized world, they are forced to adapt somehow to this world, to educate themselves. They need education for everything which is not part of the Jewish world. The actual reality has come into effect with all its power, because they are separated from their own past. Culture is the only way to endure this present. As long as culture is the proper perception of the past, the "educated" Jew is depending on a foreign past. One will reach it through a certain present, just because one participated in it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although her point of view was often misunderstood as a prejudice against Judaism, because she often also described forms of opportunism among Jewish citizens, her main concern was totalitarianism and the anachronistic mentality of the ''ancien régime'', as well as a postwar criticism, which was concerned with the limits of modern democracy. Her method was arguably idiosyncratic.  For instance, she used [[Marcel Proust]]'s romance "''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''" as a historical document and partly developed her arguments on Proust's observations of Faubourg de Saint Germain, but the publication of her book in 1951 made her very popular, because she also included an early analysis of Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arendt|1951}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later she finally published her biographical study about [[Rahel Varnhagen]]. Here she concludes that the emancipation failed exactly with Varnhagen's generation, when the wish to enter the Prussian upper society was related with the decision to leave the Jewish communities. According to her, a wealthy minority, which she called ''parvenues'', tried to join the privileges of the ruling elite of Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;''Rahel Varnhagen. The life of a Jewess'', {{Harvnb|Arendt|1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "parvenu" was taken from [[Bernard Lazare]] and she regarded it as an alternative to [[Max Weber]]'s term "pariah."

'''''JumpStart Kindergarten''''' (known as '''''Jump Ahead Classic Kindergarten''''' in the UK) is an [[educational game|educational]] [[personal computer game]] developed by Fanfare Software and released by [[Knowledge Adventure]] on the [[MS-DOS]] platform in 1994 (v1.0). It was the first product released in the [[JumpStart]] series and, as its name suggests, it is intended to teach kindergarten students. It was ported to the [[Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] systems in 1995 (v1.2). It was updated with a new version in 1998 (v2.0). In 2000, the game was specially designed on VHS. That same year it was updated with additional content in a 2-CD Deluxe version in 2000 (v2.6), that included ''JumpStart Around the World''. Eventually it was replaced in 2002 by ''JumpStart Advanced Kindergarten''.

==Gameplay==
The game takes place in a kindergarten schoolhouse. The game is hosted by the teacher, an [[anthropomorphic]] gray [[bunny]] named Mr. Hopsalot. The specifics of the game vary from the two versions, but in both the user may access educational activities and simple games by clicking on objects. In the early version, all of the activities are accessible from a single screen inside the classroom. In the re-release, different areas of the classroom and the nearby areas outside containing activities may be explored and as a new addition playing activities earns the player stars.

[[File:PriestleyHistoryLectures.jpg|right|thumb|Title page from [[Joseph Priestley]]'s ''Lectures'']]

'''''Lectures on History and General Policy''''' (1788) is the published version of a set of lectures on history and government given by the 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] to the students of [[Warrington Academy]].

The ''Lectures'' cover an array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley offers a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon]]'s decline narrative found in the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume]]'s cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical underpinning of Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749). Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke]]'s theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690, postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world travelled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilisations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lectures'' was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

== About LYRASIS ==

A non-profit membership organization committed to serving archives, libraries and museums of all types, LYRASIS was established in April 2009, with a collective history of legacy networks that dates back to 1936.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} 

LYRASIS is a 501 c 3 nonprofit membership organization whose mission is to support enduring access to the world’s shared academic, scientific and cultural heritage through leadership in open technologies, content services, digital solutions and collaboration with archives, libraries, museums and knowledge communities worldwide. LYRASIS organizational and staff values are: communication, respect, collaboration, impact, and service.

LYRASIS was created by its members to help them tackle wide-reaching challenges with a collective strength, including: the development and selection of new technology solutions; fostering community-wide projects that help deliver better outcomes and services; content creation, acquisition and management; support for new content models and strategies; and large-scale knowledge management programs unique to collections-holding institutions. 

With an organizational history dating back to 1936, LYRASIS is home to more than 1,000 member academic and public libraries, museums, archives and other collections-holding organizations located in 28 countries. With a global staff of over 50 experts and professionals, LYRASIS is organized into three primary units of focus – community supported/open source software, technology hosting services and content creation and acquisition. In addition to these business units, we also offer specific programs such as consulting, training, fiscal services and more.

Supporting these three units are dedicated teams including member outreach and member services (sales and customer service), marketing and communication, fiscal operations, grant writing and licensing. These are unique functional areas and benefits afforded the member. 

LYRASIS supports a diverse membership that includes academic, public, special, and school libraries, as well as archives museums and state libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = LYRASIS {{!}} ICOLC Website|url = http://icolc.net/consortia/71|website = icolc.net|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2015, Robert Miller replaced Kate Nevins as the Executive Director of LYRASIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robert Miller Leaves Internet Archive to Become New CEO of LYRASIS {{!}} LJ INFOdocket|url = http://www.infodocket.com/2015/05/08/robert-miller-named-new-ceo-of-lyrasis-announces/|website = www.infodocket.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
'''Community Supported Open Source Software''' – LYRASIS is the structural and fiscal organizational home to two open source software solutions that have a combined membership of over 350 institutions. This unique model allows for community-driven governance and contribution to work inside the boundaries and security of a professionally managed host organization.

'''Technology Hosting Services''' – LYRASIS is an active leader and supporter within different software communities. LYRASIS oversees the hosting and migration services for over 100 institutions from community software platforms. In addition, the software engineers and program managers from LYRASIS contribute code, training and documentation to the community.

'''Content Creation and Acquisition''' – LYRASIS is responsible for the negotiation of contracts with over 80 publishers, vendors, and partnering organizations. As such, LYRASIS members do not have to worry about skill gaps or contractual risk as group size is leveraged in expert license negotiation for multi-million dollar contracts. The LYRASIS reputation is one of active leadership in Open Access publishing models through partnership, advocacy and fiscal agency. In addition, LYRASIS has a long legacy of digitization services, enabling participants to digitize their collections with best practices and at favorable prices. 

'''Consulting and Training''' – LYRASIS has world-class experts who assist members in digitization, preservation, digital preservation, disaster preparedness and strategic planning.  LYRASIS consultants and instructors help institutions make the most of their collections and ensure long-term access.

'''Fiscal Services''' – LYRASIS assists more than 500 institutions manage their annual budgets by allowing them to deposit funds for future use, protecting it from unanticipated budget adjustments.

'''Leader’s Circle, Leaders Forum and Catalyst Fund''' – More than 200 LYRASIS members are actively involved in these programs so far, engaging in early innovation exploration, cross-institution collaboration and initial vetting of ideas, services and programs. Our members work together on new ideas and trends throughout the year in informal forums. [https://www.lyrasis.org/Leadership/Pages/Catalyst-Fund.aspx Catalyst Fund] ideas submitted by members are then selected by vote of the [https://www.lyrasis.org/Leadership/Pages/Leaders-Circle.aspx Leaders Circle] to be funded. During the annual Member Summit, Catalyst Fund recipients report on progress and members work together to consider future directions for funded projects, including expansion and potential grant or business planning. Through these leadership programs, LYRASIS members are able to participate in the creation and fruition of new ideas all the way through the life cycle of a program.

'''Investments''' – LYRASIS works closely with members to submit and receive grants from foundations such as The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to support ideas and programs on behalf of its members and other libraries, archives and museums who need access to these innovative programs. Furthermore LYRASIS has reinvested proceeds from its traditional investments into potential ideas, program and solutions to benefit its membership.

== Open Source ==
A strategic focus for LYRASIS since 2013 has been supporting open source software communities that are created and designed for archives, libraries, museums and other cultural heritage communities. LYRASIS serves as the organizational home for two open source communities, ArchivesSpace and CollectionSpace, and offers hosting, support and code contributions to two more open source programs, Islandora and Library Simplified.

[http://archivesspace.org ArchivesSpace] is a next-generation web-based archives information management system, designed by archivists and supported by diverse archival repositories.

[http://www.collectionspace.org CollectionSpace] is a web-based, open source collections management software for museums and more.

[[Islandora]] is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.

A controversy surrounding the [[MMR vaccine|combined measles, mumps, and rubella]] (MMR) [[vaccine]] started with the 1998 publication of a &lt;!--Do not remove the word "fraudulent" without talk page consensus--&gt;fraudulent research paper in ''[[The Lancet]]'' linking the vaccine to [[colitis]] and [[autism spectrum]] disorders.&lt;ref name=Wakefield/&gt; The claims in the paper were widely reported,&lt;ref name=Goldacre-2008/&gt; leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland and increases in the incidence of measles and mumps, resulting in deaths and serious permanent injuries.&lt;ref name=McIntyre/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pepys/&gt; Following the initial claims in 1998, multiple large [[epidemiologic]]al studies were undertaken. Reviews of the evidence by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]],&lt;ref name=CDC-MMR-autism/&gt; the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt; the UK [[National Health Service]],&lt;ref name = MMRthefacts/&gt; and the [[Cochrane Library]]&lt;ref name=Cochrane/&gt; all found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

==Background==
{{further|MMR vaccine#Safety}}
Before the autism-related controversy started in 1998, some concern had already arisen about the safety of the MMR vaccine due to side effects associated with the Urabe [[mumps]] strain, including rare adverse events of [[aseptic meningitis]], a transient mild form of viral meningitis.&lt;ref name=Schattner&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Vaccine |year=2005 |volume=23 |issue=30 |pages=3876–86 |title= Consequence or coincidence? The occurrence, pathogenesis and significance of autoimmune manifestations after viral vaccines |author= Schattner A |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.03.005 |pmid=15917108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Adverse Events Associated with Childhood Vaccines: Evidence Bearing on Causality |year=1994 |isbn=0-309-07496-7 |chapter=Measles and mumps vaccines |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2138&amp;page=131 |publisher= National Academy Press |author= Institute of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; A late-1980s trial in Britain of a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain produced three cases of probably associated [[febrile convulsions]] per 1,000 vaccinations. Concerns about adverse reactions to the vaccine were raised by American and Canadian authorities based on reports from Japan linking Urabe MMR with [[meningoencephalitis]]. Canadian authorities withdrew a Urabe-based vaccine in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARCHIVED - Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Mumps Outbreaks in Canada|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/10vol36/36s1/immunizati-immunisati-eng.php|website=Public Health Agency of Canada|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[National Health Service]] introduced an MMR vaccine using the Urabe mumps strain in 1988, replacing it entirely with the Jeryl Lynn strain in September 1992 following the identification of an unacceptable risk of [[aseptic meningitis]] 15–35 days after vaccination.&lt;ref name=pmid7483800&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller E, Hill A, Morgan-Capner P, Forsey T, Rush M |title=Antibodies to measles, mumps and rubella in UK children 4 years after vaccination with different MMR vaccines |journal=Vaccine |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=799–802 |date=June 1995 |pmid=7483800 |doi= 10.1016/0264-410X(94)00086-3|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0264410X94000863}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no such risk seen in vaccines using the [[Jeryl Lynn]] mumps strain,&lt;ref name=pmid7483800/&gt;&lt;ref name=Colville/&gt; the UK NHS withdrew two of the three MMR vaccines then available (Immravax, made by [[Merieux UK]], and Pluserix, made by [[GlaxoSmithKline|SmithKline Beecham]]) in favor of [[Merck Sharp and Dohme]]'s MMR II brand, based on the Jeryl Lynn strain.&lt;ref name=Colville&gt;{{cite journal |journal= European Journal of Pediatrics |year=1994 |volume=153 |issue=6 |pages=467–8 |title=Withdrawal of a mumps vaccine |vauthors=Colville A, Pugh S, Miller E, Schmitt HJ, Just M, Neiss A |pmid=8088305 |doi=10.1007/BF01983415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although MMR administration did continue with MMR II, the MMR vaccination rate first began to fall after 1996, following claims by Wakefield that it was linked to [[Crohn's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= MMR timeline |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/28/mmr-doctor-timeline |accessdate=2010-10-28 |work=The Guardian |date=28 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the [[Jeryl Lynn]] strain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= International Journal of Epidemiology |year=2002 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=983–4 |title= Commentary: Ongoing debate over the safety of the different mumps vaccine strains impacts mumps disease control |vauthors=Fullerton KE, Reef SE |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/31/5/983 |pmid=12435772 |doi=10.1093/ije/31.5.983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a strain with higher [[efficacy]] along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall illness.&lt;ref name=Colville/&gt;

===Revaccination campaign===
In the wake of the measles outbreaks, which occurred in England in 1992, and on the basis of analyses of seroepidemiological data combined with mathematical modeling, British Health authorities predicted a major resurgence of measles in school-age children. Two strategies were then examined: either to target vaccination at all children without a history of prior measles vaccination or to immunize all children irrespective of vaccination history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0950268800058969 |vauthors=Calvert N, Cutts F, Irving R, Brown D, Marsh J, Miller E |title=Measles immunity and response to revaccination among secondary school children in Cumbria |journal=Epidemiology &amp; Infection |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=65–70 |date=February 1996 |pmid=8626005 |pmc=2271248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1994, the latter option was chosen and a national measles and rubella vaccination campaign, described as "one of the most ambitious vaccination initiatives that Britain has undertaken" was commenced:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller E |title=The new measles campaign |journal=The BMJ |volume=309 |issue=6962 |pages=1102–3 |date=October 1994 |pmid=7987096 |pmc=2541903 |doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6962.1102}}&lt;/ref&gt; within one month, 92% of the 7.1 million schoolchildren in England aged 5–16 years received measles and rubella (MR) vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cutts FT |title=Revaccination against measles and rubella |journal=The BMJ |volume=312 |issue=7031 |pages=589–90 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8595319 |pmc=2350416 |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7031.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MMR litigation starts ===
In April 1994, Richard Barr,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardbarr.org/#/mmr/4511615194|title=Richard Barr original writing site|website=www.richardbarr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a solicitor, succeeded in winning legal aid for the pursuit of a class action lawsuit against the manufacturers of MMR vaccines under the UK [[Consumer Protection Act 1987]]. The class action case was aimed at [[Aventis Pasteur]], [[SmithKline Beecham]], and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], manufacturers respectively of Immravax, Pluserix-MMR and MMR II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Fitzpatrick |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/articles/00000006E019.htm |title=spiked-health &amp;#124; Medicine on trial |publisher=Spiked-online.com |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suit, based on a claim that MMR is a defective product and should not have been used, was the first big class action lawsuit funded by the Legal Aid Board (which became the [[Legal Services Commission]], which in turn was replaced by the [[Legal Aid Agency]]) after its formation in 1988.

==1998 ''The Lancet'' paper==
In February 1998, a group led by [[Andrew Wakefield]] published a fraudulent paper in the respected British medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', supported by a press conference at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt;&lt;ref name=LancetPR&gt;[http://briandeer.com/mmr/royal-free-press-1998.pdf Press release from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine], 26 February 1998, hosted at briandeer.com&lt;/ref&gt; This paper reported on twelve children with developmental disorders referred to the Royal Free Hospital. The parents or physicians of eight of these children were said to have linked the start of behavioral symptoms to MMR vaccination. The paper described a collection of bowel symptoms, [[endoscopy]] findings and [[biopsy]] findings that were said to be evidence of a possible novel syndrome that Wakefield would later call [[autistic enterocolitis]], and recommended further study into the possible link between the condition and the MMR vaccine. The paper suggested that the connection between autism and the [[gastrointestinal]] pathologies was real, but said it did not prove an association between the MMR vaccine and autism.&lt;ref name=Wakefield&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]], Murch S, Anthony A|title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=The Lancet |volume=351|issue=9103|pages = 637–41|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0|pmid=9500320|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|accessdate= 2007-09-05|display-authors=etal}}{{Retracted paper|{{PMID|20137807}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the press conference before the paper's publication, later criticized as "[[science by press conference]]",&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield said that he thought it prudent to use single vaccines instead of the MMR triple vaccine until this could be ruled out as an environmental trigger; parents of eight of the twelve children studied were said to have blamed the MMR vaccine, saying that symptoms of autism had set in within days of vaccination at approximately 14 months. Wakefield said, "I can't support the continued use of these three vaccines given in combination until this issue has been resolved."&lt;ref name=Deer-so-far&gt;{{cite web |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm |title= The MMR–autism crisis – our story so far |accessdate=2008-12-06 |author= Deer B |date=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a video news release issued by the hospital to broadcasters in advance of the press conference, he called for MMR to be "suspended in favour of the single vaccines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Deer B |title= Royal Free facilitates attack on MMR, in Dr Andrew Wakefield "single shots" video |url=http://briandeer.com/wakefield/royal-video.htm |accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a BBC interview Wakefield's mentor [[Roy Pounder]], who was not a coauthor, "admitted the study was controversial". He added: "In hindsight it may be a better solution to give the vaccinations separately,... When the vaccinations were given individually there was no problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/60510.stm |title= Child vaccine linked to autism |work=BBC News |date=27 February 1998 |accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These suggestions were not supported by Wakefield's coauthors nor by any scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/page292.asp |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224730/http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/page292.asp |archivedate= 2007-09-26 |accessdate=2007-09-06 |title= MMR – the controversy |date=1 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial press coverage of the story was limited. The ''Guardian'' and the ''Independent'' reported it on their front pages, while the ''Daily Mail'' only gave the story a minor mention in the middle of the paper, and the ''Sun'' did not cover it.&lt;ref name=Goldacre-2008&gt;{{cite news |title= The MMR hoax |author= Goldacre B |work=The Guardian |date=30 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-30 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/30/mmr.health.media|archiveurl=http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/|archivedate=30 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wakefield ''The Lancet'' paper controversy===
The controversy began to gain momentum in 2001 and 2002, after Wakefield published papers suggesting that the immunisation programme was not safe. These were a review paper with no new evidence, published in a minor journal, and two papers on laboratory work that he said showed that measles virus had been found in tissue samples taken from children who had autism and bowel problems. There was wide media coverage including distressing anecdotal evidence from parents, and political coverage attacking the health service and government peaked with unmet demands that Prime minister [[Tony Blair]] reveal whether his infant son, Leo, had been given the vaccine. It was the biggest science story of 2002, with 1257 articles mostly written by non-expert commentators. In the period January to September 2002, 32% of the stories written about MMR mentioned Leo Blair, as opposed to only 25% that mentioned Wakefield. Less than a third of the stories mentioned the overwhelming evidence that MMR is safe.&lt;ref name=Goldacre-2008/&gt; The paper, press conference and video sparked a major health scare in the United Kingdom. As a result of the scare, full confidence in MMR fell from 59% to 41% after publication of the Wakefield research. In 2001, 26% of family doctors felt the government had failed to prove there was no link between MMR and autism and bowel disease.&lt;ref name="Halvorsen"&gt;{{cite book | author = Halvorsen R | title = The Truth about Vaccines | publisher = Gibson Square | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-903933-92-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Bad Science (book)|Bad Science]]'', [[Ben Goldacre]] describes the MMR vaccine scare as one of the "three all-time classic bogus science stories" by the British newspapers (the other two are the Arpad [[Pusztai affair]] about [[genetically modified crops]], and Chris Malyszewicz and the [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] hoax).&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldacre, Ben |title= Bad Science|year=2009 |publisher=[[HarperCollins Music Entertainment|Fourth Estate]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-728487-0 |page= 283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confidence in the MMR vaccine increased as it became clearer that Wakefield's claims were unsupported by scientific evidence. A 2003 survey of 366 family doctors in the UK reported that 77% of them would advise giving the MMR vaccine to a child with a close family history of autism, and that 3% of them thought that autism could sometimes be caused by the MMR vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/files/HPSurveyreport.pdf |accessdate=2007-09-06 |format=PDF |year=2003 |title= Health professionals 2003 childhood immunisation survey report |publisher= NHS Immunisation Information |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929103639/http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/files/HPSurveyreport.pdf |archivedate = 29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar survey in 2004 found that these percentages changed to 82% and at most 2%, respectively, and that confidence in MMR had been increasing over the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/files/hp_survey_2004.pdf |accessdate=2007-09-06 |format=PDF |year=2004 |title= Health professionals 2004 childhood immunisation survey executive summary |publisher= Immunisation Information England |author= BMRB Social Research |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929104358/http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/files/hp_survey_2004.pdf |archivedate = 29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A factor in the controversy is that only the combined vaccine is available through the UK National Health Service. As of 2010 there are no single vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella licensed for use in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.immunisationscotland.org.uk/vaccines-and-diseases/mmr.aspx#safety-trials | title=MMR vaccine – measles, mumps, rubella vaccine | work=Immunisation Scotland | accessdate = 2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime minister Tony Blair gave support to the programme, arguing that the vaccine was safe enough for his own son, Leo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1803609.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Blair signals support for MMR |accessdate=2008-07-10 | date=7 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; but refusing on privacy grounds to state whether Leo had received the vaccine; in contrast, the subsequent Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]], explicitly confirmed that his son has been immunised.&lt;ref&gt;Nic Fleming [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/07/nmmr07.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/02/07/ixhome.html My son has had MMR jab, says Brown (in dig at Blair)] ''Telegraph'' 7 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cherie Blair]] confirmed that Leo had been given the MMR vaccination when promoting her autobiography.&lt;ref name=Goldacre-2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/12/cherieblair.labour|work=The Guardian|title=Cherie Blair: what she said|accessdate=2012-03-09 |date=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administration of the combined vaccine instead of separate vaccines decreases the risk of children catching the disease while waiting for full immunisation coverage.&lt;ref name=MMR-vs-single&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/MMR/GeneralInformation/ |title= Why is MMR preferable to single vaccines? |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher= Health Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined vaccine's two injections results in less pain and distress to the child than the six injections required by separate vaccines, and the extra clinic visits required by separate vaccinations increases the likelihood of some being delayed or missed altogether;&lt;ref name=MMR-vs-single/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MMR vs three separate vaccines:

[[John Walker-Smith]], a coauthor of Wakefield's report and a supporter of the MMR vaccine, wrote in 2002 that epidemiology has shown that MMR is safe in most children, but observed that epidemiology is a blunt tool and studies can miss at-risk groups that have a real link between MMR and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Lancet |year=2002 |volume=359 |issue=9307 |pages=705–6 |title= Autism, bowel inflammation, and measles |author= Walker-Smith J |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07783-8 |pmid=11879886}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a rare subtype of autism were reliably identified by clinical or pathological characteristics, epidemiological research could address the question whether MMR causes that autism subtype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Lancet |year=2002 |volume=359 |issue=9323 |pages=2112–3 |title= Autism, bowel inflammation, and measles |vauthors=Smeeth L, Hall A, Rodrigues L, Cook C, Fombonne E |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08918-3 |pmid=12086784}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no scientific evidence that MMR causes damage to the infant immune system, and there is much evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick04/&gt;

=== Conflict of interest ===

In February 2004, after a four-month investigation, reporter [[Brian Deer]] wrote in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' of London that, prior to submitting his paper to ''The Lancet'', Wakefield had received £55,000 from [[Legal Services Commission|Legal Aid Board]] solicitors seeking evidence to use against vaccine manufacturers, that several of the parents quoted as saying that MMR had damaged their children were also litigants, and that Wakefield did not inform colleagues or medical authorities of the conflict of interest. When the editors of ''The Lancet'' learned about this, they said that based on Deer's evidence, Wakefield's paper should have never been published because its findings were "entirely flawed".&lt;ref name=Deer04a&gt;''The Sunday Times'' 2004:
*{{cite news |author= Deer B |title= Revealed: MMR research scandal |work=The Sunday Times |date=22 February 2004 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1027603.ece |accessdate=2007-09-23 | location=London}}
*{{cite web |author= Deer B |title= The Lancet scandal |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wakefield maintained that the legal aid funding was for a separate, unpublished study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Lancet |year=2004 |volume=363 |issue=9411 |pages=823–4 |title= A statement by Dr Andrew Wakefield |author= Wakefield A |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15710-3 |pmid=15022650}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a position later rejected by a panel of the UK [[General Medical Council]]), the editors of ''The Lancet'' judged that the funding source should have been disclosed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Lancet |year=2004 |volume=363 |issue=9411 |pages=820–1 |title= A statement by the editors of ''The Lancet'' |author= Horton R |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15699-7 |pmid=15022645}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]], the editor-in-chief, wrote, "It seems obvious now that had we appreciated the full context in which the work reported in the 1998 ''Lancet'' paper by Wakefield and colleagues was done, publication would not have taken place in the way that it did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Lancet |year=2004 |volume=363 |issue=9411 |pages=747–9 |title= The lessons of MMR |author= Horton R |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15714-0 |pmid=15016482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Wakefield's co-researchers also strongly criticized the lack of disclosure.&lt;ref name=Deer04a/&gt;

Deer continued his reporting in a [[Channel 4]] ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' television documentary, ''MMR: What They Didn't Tell You'', broadcast on 18 November 2004. This documentary alleged that Wakefield had applied for patents on a vaccine that was a rival of the MMR vaccine, and that he knew of test results from his own laboratory at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] that contradicted his own claims.&lt;ref name=Patent-and-test-results&gt;2004 BBC documentary:

In January 2005, Wakefield sued Channel 4, 20/20 Productions, and the investigative reporter Brian Deer, who presented the Dispatches programme. However, after two years of litigation, and the revelation of more than £400,000 in undisclosed payments by lawyers to Wakefield, he discontinued his action and paid all the defendants' costs.

In 2006, Deer reported in ''The Sunday Times'' that Wakefield had been paid £435,643, plus expenses, by British trial lawyers attempting to prove that the vaccine was dangerous, with the undisclosed payments beginning two years before the ''Lancet'' paper's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Deer B |title= MMR doctor given legal aid thousands |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/newspapers/sunday_times/britain/article1265373.ece |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070223155047/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/newspapers/sunday_times/britain/article1265373.ece |archivedate= 2007-02-23 |accessdate=2007-09-23 |work=The Sunday Times |date=31 December 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This funding came from the UK legal aid fund, a fund intended to provide legal services to the poor.&lt;ref name=Deer-so-far/&gt;

===Retraction of an interpretation===
''The Lancet'' and many other medical journals require papers to include the authors' conclusions about their research, known as the "interpretation". The summary of the 1998 ''Lancet'' paper ended as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Interpretation''' We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.&lt;ref name=Wakefield/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2004, immediately following the news of the conflict of interest allegations, ten of Wakefield's 12 coauthors retracted this interpretation,&lt;ref name=retraction&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH, etal |title= Retraction of an interpretation |journal=The Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |page=750 |year=2004 |pmid=15016483 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while insisting that the possibility of a distinctive gastrointestinal condition in children with autism merited further investigation.&lt;ref name="Fitz2004"&gt;{{cite book | author = Fitzpatrick M | title = MMR and Autism: What Parents Need to Know | publisher = Routledge | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2011-02-02 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMWuvsJ1WY4C| isbn = 978-0-415-32179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a separate study of children with gastrointestinal disturbances found no difference between those with [[autism spectrum]] disorders and those without, with respect to the presence of measles virus [[RNA]] in the bowel; it also found that gastrointestinal symptoms and the onset of autism were unrelated in time to the administration of MMR vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= PLoS ONE |year=2008 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e3140 |title= Lack of association between measles virus vaccine and autism with enteropathy: a case-control study |editor1-first= Mark R. |editor1-last= Cookson |vauthors=Hornig M, Briese T, Buie T, etal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003140 |pmid=18769550 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003140 |laysummary=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/03/AR2008090303396.html |laysource= The Washington Post |laydate=2008-09-04 |pmc= 2526159|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.3140H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulation of data===
On 8 February 2009, Brian Deer reported in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that Wakefield had "fixed" results and "manipulated" patient data in his 1998 paper, creating the appearance of a link with autism.&lt;ref name=Deer2009&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/news/article148992.ece |title= MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism |author= Deer B |work=The Sunday Times |date=8 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield denied these allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Pediatrics/Autism/12850 |title= Father of vaccine–autism link said to have fudged data |author= Gever J | work= MedPage Today |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even filed a complaint with the [[Press Complaints Commission]] (PCC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.box.net/shared/9cz9sntkzy |title=Complaint to UK |publisher=Box.net |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; over this article on 13 March 2009.

===General Medical Council investigation===
The [[General Medical Council]] (GMC), which is responsible for licensing doctors and supervising medical ethics in the UK, investigated the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article565188.ece |title=MMR scare doctor faces list of charges |work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=2008-07-10 |date=11 September 2005 | location=London |author=Deer B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GMC brought the case itself, not citing any specific complaints, claiming that an investigation was in the public interest. The then-secretary of state for health, [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], called for a GMC investigation, which Wakefield himself welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/23/uk.society|title=Demand grows for full MMR inquiry|last=Meikle|first=James|date=2004-02-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a debate in the House of Commons, on 15 Mar 2004, Dr. Evan Harris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drevanharrismp.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/dr-andrew-wakefield-and-the-mmr-scare-evan-on-c4-news/ |title=Dr Andrew Wakefield and the MMR Scare&amp;nbsp;– Evan on C4 News |publisher=Drevanharrismp.wordpress.com |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Liberal Democrat MP, called for a judicial inquiry into the ethical aspects of the case, even suggesting it might be conducted by the [[Crown Prosecution Service|CPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-commons.htm |title=Evan Harris demands inquiry into MMR research on children |publisher=Briandeer.com |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006 the GMC confirmed that they would hold a disciplinary hearing of Wakefield.

The GMC's Fitness to Practise Panel first met on 16 July 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circare.org/consents/wakefield_20070716.pdf |title=Andrew Wakefield, John Walker-Smith, Simon Murch.

The GMC examined, among other ethical points, whether Wakefield and his colleagues obtained the required approvals for the tests they performed on the children; the data-manipulation charges reported in the ''Times'', which surfaced after the case was prepared, were not at question in the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Pediatrics/Autism/12850 |title=Father of Vaccine-Autism Link Said to Have Fudged Data |publisher=Medpagetoday.com |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GMC stressed that it would not be assessing the validity of competing scientific theories on MMR and autism. The General Medical Council alleged that the trio acted unethically and dishonestly in preparing the research into the MMR vaccine. They denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MMR scare doctor 'paid children' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6289166.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case proceeded in front of a GMC Fitness to Practise panel of three medical and two lay members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= General Medical Council | title= Dr Andrew Wakefield, Professor John Walker-Smith, Professor Simon Murch |url=http://www.gmcpressoffice.org.uk/apps/news/events/detail.php?key=1960 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045540/http://www.gmcpressoffice.org.uk/apps/news/events/detail.php?key=1960 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2010, the GMC panel delivered its decision on the facts of the case: Wakefield was found to have acted "dishonestly and irresponsibly" and to have acted with "callous disregard" for the children involved in his study, conducting unnecessary and invasive tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Andrew Wakefield found 'irresponsible' by GMC over MMR vaccine scare |author= Boseley S |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|date= 28 January 2010|url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/28/andrew-wakefield-mmr-vaccine | location=London}}

===Full retraction and fraud allegations===
In response to the GMC investigation and findings, the editors of ''The Lancet'' announced on 2 February 2010 that they "fully retract this paper from the published record".&lt;ref name=full-retraction&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Editors Of The Lancet |title=Retraction—Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=The Lancet |volume= 375 |issue= 9713|page=445 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20137807 |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-4 |accessdate=2010-02-02 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2960175-4/fulltext# |laysource=BBC News |laydate=2010-02-02 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/health/8493753.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Bach, Ministry of Justice dismissed this possibility.

In an April 2010 report in ''[[The BMJ]]'', Deer expanded on the laboratory aspects of his findings recounting how normal clinical [[histopathology]] results generated by the [[Royal Free Hospital]] were later changed in the medical school to abnormal results, published in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref name=enterocolitis&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deer B |title=Wakefield's "autistic enterocolitis" under the microscope |journal=The BMJ |volume=340 |issue=apr15 2 |pages=c1127 |year=2010 |pmid=20395277 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c1127 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/apr15_2/c1127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deer wrote an article in ''The BMJ'' casting doubt on the "autistic enterocolitis" that Wakefield claimed to have discovered.&lt;ref name=enterocolitis/&gt; In the same edition, Deirdre Kelly, President of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition and the Editor of the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition expressed some concern about ''The BMJ'' publishing this article while the GMC proceedings were underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Deer |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/340/apr15_2/c1127#235356 |title=Response to feature Wakefield's "autistic enterocolitis" under the microscope from ESPGHAN |work=The BMJ |accessdate=2011-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504082345/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/340/apr15_2/c1127 |archivedate=4 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2010, the GMC panel found Wakefield guilty of serious professional misconduct on four counts of dishonesty and 12 involving the abuse of developmentally challenged children, and ordered that he be struck off the medical register.&lt;ref name=times25510/&gt; John Walker-Smith was also found guilty of serious professional misconduct and struck off the medical register, but that decision was reversed on appeal to the High Court in 2012, because the GMC panel had failed to decide whether Walker-Smith actually thought he was doing research in the guise of clinical investigation and treatment. The High Court criticised "a number of" wrong conclusions by the disciplinary panel and its "inadequate and superficial reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= John Aston | date =7 March 2012 | work = The Independent | title =MMR Doctor John Walker-Smith wins High Court appeal |accessdate= 16 April 2012|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/mmr-doctor-john-walkersmith-wins-high-court-appeal-7543114.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Murch was found not guilty.&lt;ref name=times25510&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7134893.ece | location=London |work=The Times |vauthors=Sanchez R, Rose D | title=Dr Andrew Wakefield struck off medical register | date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2011, ''The BMJ'' published the first of a series of articles by Brian Deer, detailing how Wakefield and his colleagues had faked some of the data behind the 1998 Lancet article. By looking at the records and interviewing the parents, Deer found that for all 12 children in the Wakefield study, diagnoses had been tweaked or dates changed to fit the article's conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed| author=Deer B| journal=The BMJ| year=2011| volume=342 | issue=jan05 1| pages=c5347| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5347 | pmid=21209059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing  ''BMJ'' series on 11 January 2011,&lt;ref name=HowMakeMoney&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The BMJ |date= 11 January 2011 |pages= c5258–c5258 |issue= jan11 4 |volume=  342|doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5258 |title= How the vaccine crisis was meant to make money |author=Deer B |url= http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5258.full |pmid=21224310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deer said that based upon documents he obtained under [[Freedom of information legislation]],&lt;ref name=WakefieldCapitalize&gt;{{cite news|url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/checkup/2011/01/wakefield_tried_to_capitalize.html | title= Wakefield tried to capitalize on autism-vaccine link, report says |author= Stein, Rob |date= 11 January 2011 |work= The Washington Post |accessdate= 2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield—in partnership with the father of one of the boys in the study—had planned to launch a venture on the back of an MMR vaccination scare that would profit from new medical tests and "litigation driven testing".&lt;ref name=AuthorHeld&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/11/autism.vaccines/?hpt=Sbin |title= Vaccine study's author held related patent, medical journal reports| publisher= CNN |date= 11 January 2011 |accessdate= 2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported that Deer said that Wakefield predicted he "could make more than $43 million a year from diagnostic kits" for the new condition, [[autistic enterocolitis]].&lt;ref name=WakefieldCapitalize/&gt; [[WebMD]] reported on Deer's ''BMJ'' report, saying that the $43 million predicted yearly profits would come from marketing kits for "diagnosing patients with autism" and "the initial market for the diagnostic will be litigation-driven testing of patients with AE [autistic enterocolitis, an unproven condition concocted by Wakefield] from both the UK and the USA".&lt;ref name=DoctorPlanned&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110111/mmr-doctor-planned-make-millions-journal-claims |title= MMR Doctor 'Planned to Make Millions,' Journal Claims |author= Russell, Peter |publisher= WebMD Health News |date= 11 January 2011 |accessdate= 2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WebMD, the ''BMJ'' article also claimed that the venture would succeed in marketing products and developing a replacement vaccine if "public confidence in the MMR vaccine was damaged".&lt;ref name=DoctorPlanned/&gt;

==Media role==
Observers have criticized the involvement of mass media in the controversy, what is known as '[[science by press conference]]',&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt; alleging that the media provided Wakefield's study with more credibility than it deserved. A March 2007 paper in ''[[BMC Public Health]]'' by Shona Hilton, Mark Petticrew, and Kate Hunt postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had "created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against".&lt;ref name=hilton&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K | year = 2007 | title = Parents' champions vs. vested interests: Who do parents believe about MMR?

A 2007 editorial in ''Australian Doctor'' complained that some journalists had continued to defend Wakefield's study even after ''The Lancet'' had published the retraction by 10 of the study's 12 original authors, but noted that it was an investigative journalist, Brian Deer, who had played a leading role in exposing weaknesses in the study.&lt;ref name=Katelaris&gt;{{cite journal |author= Katelaris A|url= http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/bf/0c04f2bf.asp |title= Wakefield saga a study in integrity |journal= Australian Doctor |date= 17 August 2007 |page= 20 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070908211909/http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/bf/0c04f2bf.asp |archivedate= 2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PRWeek]]'' noted that after Wakefield was removed from the general medical register for misconduct in May 2010, 62% of respondents to a poll regarding the MMR controversy stated they did not feel that the media conducted responsible reporting on health issues.&lt;ref name=PRWeek&gt;[http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1007378/Reputation-survey-MMR-panic-subsides "Reputation Survey: MMR panic subsides"]. ''[[PR Week]]'', 2 June 2010: 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' article examining the history of antivaccinationists said that opposition to vaccines has existed since the 19th century, but "now the antivaccinationists' media of choice are typically television and the Internet, including its social media outlets, which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence".&lt;ref name=AgeOld&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poland GA, Jacobson RM |title= The Age-Old Struggle against the Antivaccinationists |journal= The New England Journal of Medicine |volume= 364 |issue= 2 |pages= 97–9 |date= 13 January 2011 |pmid= 21226573 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMp1010594|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1010594}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial characterized anti-vaccinationists as people who "tend toward complete mistrust of government and manufacturers, conspiratorial thinking, denialism, low cognitive complexity in thinking patterns, reasoning flaws, and a habit of substituting emotional anecdotes for data", including people who range from those "unable to understand and incorporate concepts of risk and probability into science-grounded decision making" and those "who use deliberate mistruths, intimidation, falsified data, and threats of violence".&lt;ref name=AgeOld/&gt;

In a January 2011 editorial in ''[[The American Spectator]]'', Robert M. Goldberg contended that evidence from the scientific community of issues with Wakefield's research " ... were undermined because the media allowed Wakefield and his followers to discredit the findings just by saying so".&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Robert M., [http://spectator.org/archives/2011/01/07/andrew-wakefields-lethal-legac "Andrew Wakefield's Lethal Legacy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110035155/http://spectator.org/archives/2011/01/07/andrew-wakefields-lethal-legac |date=10 January 2011 }}, ''[[The American Spectator]]'', 7 January 2011. Retrieved 11 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seth Mnookin]], author of ''The Panic Virus'', also partly blames the media for presenting a [[false balance]] between scientific evidence and people's personal experiences: "Reporting fell into this 'on the one hand, on the other hand' fallacy, this notion that if you have two sides that are disagreeing, that means that you should present both of them with equal weight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vaccines: An Unhealthy Skepticism |url=http://www.retroreport.org/video/vaccines-an-unhealthy-skepticism/ |date=1 February 2015 |publisher=[[Retro Report]] |accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Fiona Godlee]], editor of ''The BMJ'', said in January 2011:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The original paper has received so much media attention, with such potential to damage public health, that it is hard to find a parallel in the history of medical science. Many other medical frauds have been exposed but usually more quickly after publication and on less important health issues.&lt;ref name=GodleeEditorial /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerns have also been raised over the journal [[peer review]] system, which largely relies on trust among researchers,&lt;ref name=BMJLiftsCurtain /&gt; and the role of journalists reporting on scientific theories that they "are hardly in a position to question and comprehend".&lt;ref name=IBTimes/&gt; Neil Cameron, a historian who specializes in the history of science, writing for the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', labeled the controversy a "failure of journalism" that resulted in unnecessary deaths, saying that: 1) ''The Lancet'' should not have published a study based on "statistically meaningless results" from only 12 cases; 2) the anti-vaccination crusade was continued by the satirical ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' magazine; and 3) a grapevine of worried parents and "nincompoop" celebrities fueled the widespread fears.&lt;ref name=FailureJournalism&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/Autism+study+represents+failure+journalism/4095111/story.html |title=Autism 'study' represents a failure of journalism |author=Cameron, Neil |date=12 January 2011 |work=The Montreal Gazette |accessdate=2011-01-12 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' also reported that:

==Litigation==
During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of lawsuits were brought against manufacturers of vaccines, alleging the vaccines had caused physical and [[mental illness|mental disorders]] in children. While these lawsuits were unsuccessful, they did lead to a large jump in the costs of the MMR vaccine, and pharmaceutical companies sought legislative protections. In 1993, [[Merck KGaA]] became the only company willing to sell MMR vaccines in the United States and the United Kingdom.

=== Italy ===

In June 2012, a local court in [[Rimini]], [[Italy]], ruled that the MMR vaccination had caused autism in a 15-month-old boy. The court relied heavily on the discredited ''Lancet'' paper and largely ignored the scientific evidence presented to it. The decision was appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2013/08/09/court-rulings-dont-confirm-autism-vaccine-link/|title=Court Rulings Don't Confirm Autism-Vaccine Link|publisher=[[Forbes]]|author=Willingham E|date=2013-08-08|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 2015, the decision was overturned by a Court of Appeals in Bologna.&lt;ref name=Bocci&gt;{{Citation |last=Bocci |first=Michele |date=1 March 2015 |title=Autismo, i giudici assolvono il vaccino ("Autism, the judges acquit the vaccine") |newspaper=La Repubblica |url=http://www.repubblica.it/salute/medicina/2015/03/01/news/autismo_i_giudici_assolvono_il_vaccino-108441541/ |accessdate=4 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MMR scare caused a low percentage of mumps vaccination (less than 30%), which resulted in outbreaks in Japan.&lt;ref name=naoko&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]] |vauthors=Yoshida N, Fujino M, Ota Y, etal |title= Simple differentiation method of mumps Hoshino vaccine strain from wild strains by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) |volume= 25 |issue= 7 |pages= 1281–1286 |date= 26 January 2007 |pmid= 17097200 |doi= 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.09.093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were up to 2002 measles-caused deaths in Japan while there were none in the UK, but the extra deaths were attributed to Japan's application of the vaccine at a later age.

Commenced before the Civil Procedure Rules were promulgated, the MMR Litigation had its status as group litigation achieved by the then Lord Chief Justice's practice direction of 8 July 1999. On 8 June 2007, the High Court judge, Justice Keith, put an end to the group litigation because the withdrawal of legal aid by the legal services commission had made the pursuit of most of the claimants impossible. He ruled that all but two claims against pharmaceutical companies must be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/wakefield/keith-judgment.doc|title=404 - file not found - Brian Deer|author=|date=|website=briandeer.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge stressed that his ruling did not amount to a rejection of any of the claims that MMR had seriously damaged the children concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foiacentre.com/news-MMR-070608.html |title=FOIA Centre news: MMR group legal claim collapses in high court |publisher=FOIA Centre |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pressure group]] called JABS (Justice, Awareness, Basic Support) was established to represent families with children who, their parents said, were "vaccine-damaged". £15&amp;nbsp;million in public legal aid funding was spent on the litigation, of which £9.7&amp;nbsp;million went to solicitors and [[barrister]]s, and £4.3&amp;nbsp;million to expert witnesses.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick07&gt;{{cite news |work=spiked |date=4 July 2007 |title= 'The MMR–autism theory?

It is structured to facilitate the handling of nearly 5000 vaccine petitions involving claims that children who have received certain vaccinations have developed autism. The Petitioners' Steering Committee have claimed that MMR vaccines can cause autism, possibly in combination with [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal-containing vaccines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/opinion/13fri2.html?_r=0 | title=Editorial: Vaccines Exonerated on Autism | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=12 February 2009 | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 three test cases were presented to test the claims about the combination; these cases failed.

In some cases, the plaintiffs' attorneys opted out of the Omnibus Autism Proceedings, which were concerned solely with autism, and issues concerned with bowel disorders; they argued their cases in the regular vaccine court.

On 30 July 2007, the family of Bailey Banks, a child with pervasive developmental delay, won its case versus the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Abell.BANKS.02-0738V.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514063807/http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Abell.BANKS.02-0738V.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case listed as relating to 'non-autistic developmental delay', Special Master Richard B. Abell ruled that the Banks had successfully demonstrated, "the MMR vaccine at issue actually caused the conditions from which Bailey suffered and continues to suffer." In his conclusion, he ruled that he was satisfied that MMR had caused a brain inflammation called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). He reached this conclusion because of two vaccine cases in 1994 and 2001, which had concluded, "ADEM can be caused by natural measles, mumps, and rubella infections, as well as by measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/blogs/lab-notes/2009/02/25/vaccines-and-autism-the-unending-story.html Vaccines and Autism: The Unending Story], thedailybeast.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices;&lt;!-- ref name=Rutter/ --&gt; it is not known how much, if any, growth came from real changes in autism's [[prevalence]], and no causal connection to the MMR vaccine has been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=Rutter&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rutter M |title= Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning |journal= Acta Paediatrica |volume=94 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=2–15 |pmid=15858952 |doi= 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x |authorlink= Michael Rutter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a meta review financed by the [[European Union]] assessed the evidence given in 120 other studies and considered unintended effects of the MMR vaccine, concluding that although the vaccine is associated with positive and negative side effects, a connection between MMR and autism was "unlikely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jefferson T, Price D, Demicheli V, Bianco E | title=Unintended events following immunization with MMR: a systematic review | journal=Vaccine | year=2003 | pages=3954–60 | volume=21 | issue=25–26 | pmid=12922131 | doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(03)00271-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2004, a review article was published that concluded, "The evidence now is convincing that the measles–mumps–rubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autistic spectrum disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeStefano|first1=F|last2=Thompson|first2=WW|title=MMR vaccine and autism: an update of the scientific evidence.|journal=Expert Review of Vaccines|date=February 2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=19–22|doi=10.1586/14760584.3.1.19|pmid=14761240}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 review of the literature regarding vaccines and autism found "[t]he bulk of the evidence suggests no causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doja A, Roberts W |title=Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature |journal=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=341–6 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17168158 |doi= 10.1017/s031716710000528x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 case study used the figure in Wakefield's 1999 letter to ''The Lancet'' alleging a temporal association between MMR vaccination and autism&lt;ref name=Original&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Lancet |year=1999 |volume=354 |issue=9182 |pages=949–50 |title=MMR vaccination and autism |author= Wakefield AJ |pmid=10489978 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)75696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate how a graph can misrepresent its data, and gave advice to authors and publishers to avoid similar misrepresentations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Drug Safety |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=831–6 |title= A case study of a graphical misrepresentation: drawing the wrong conclusions about the measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccine |vauthors=Cox AR, Kirkham H |pmid=17867721 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200730100-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 review of independent studies performed after the publication of Wakefield ''et al.''&amp;#39;s original report found that the studies provided compelling evidence against the hypothesis that MMR is associated with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics |year=2007 |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=756–9 |title= Vaccines and autism: evidence does not support a causal association |author= DeStefano F |doi=10.1038/sj.clpt.6100407 |pmid=17928818}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the work conducted in 2004 for UK court proceedings but not revealed until 2007 found that the [[polymerase chain reaction]] analysis essential to the Wakefield ''et al.'' results was fatally flawed due to contamination, and that it could not have possibly detected the measles that it was supposed to have detected.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick07/&gt;  A 2009 review of studies on links between vaccines and autism discussed the MMR [[vaccine controversies|vaccine controversy]] as one of three main hypotheses that epidemiological and biological studies failed to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerber JS, Offit PA |title= Vaccines and autism: a tale of shifting hypotheses |journal= Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=456–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19128068 |pmc= 2908388 |doi=10.1086/596476 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110418194142/http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-04-18 |laysummary=http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=13336 |laysource=IDSA |laydate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Cochrane Library]] published a review of dozens of scientific studies involving about 14,700,000 children, which found no credible evidence of an involvement of MMR with either autism or [[Crohn's disease]]. The authors stated "the design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate".&lt;ref name=Cochrane&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj C |title=Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2 |issue= 2|pages=CD004407 |year=2012 |pmid=22336803 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2014 [[meta-analysis]] involving more than 1.25 million children found "vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder.

After the controversy began, the MMR vaccination compliance dropped sharply in the United Kingdom, from 92% in 1996 to 84% in 2002. In some parts of London, it was as low as 61% in 2003, far below the rate needed to avoid an epidemic of measles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Lancet |year=2003 |volume=362 |issue=9394 |pages=1498–9 |title= Separating inflammation from speculation in autism |author= Murch S |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14699-5 |pmid=14602448}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006 coverage for MMR in the UK at 24 months was 85%, lower than the about 94% coverage for other vaccines.&lt;ref name=McIntyre&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McIntyre P, Leask J |title= Improving uptake of MMR vaccine |journal=The BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7647 |pages=729–30 |year=2008 |pmid=18309963 |pmc= 2287215 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39503.508484.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After vaccination rates dropped, the incidence of two of the three diseases increased greatly in the UK. In 1998 there were 56 confirmed cases of measles in the UK; in 2006 there were 449 in the first five months of the year, with the first death since 1992; cases occurred in inadequately vaccinated children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The BMJ |year=2006 |volume=333 |issue=7574 |pages=890–5 |title= Measles in the United Kingdom: can we eradicate it by 2010? |vauthors=Asaria P, MacMahon E |doi=10.1136/bmj.38989.445845.7C |pmid=17068034 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7574/890 |pmc=1626346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mumps cases began rising in 1999 after years of very few cases, and by 2005 the United Kingdom was in a mumps epidemic with almost 5000 notifications in the first month of 2005 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The BMJ |year=2005 |volume=330 |issue=7500 |pages=1132–5 |title=Mumps and the UK epidemic 2005 |vauthors=Gupta RK, Best J, MacMahon E |pmid=15891229 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7500.1132 |pmc=557899}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age group affected was too old to have received the routine MMR immunisations around the time the paper by Wakefield ''et al.'' was published, and too young to have contracted natural mumps as a child, and thus to achieve a [[herd immunity]] effect. With the decline in mumps that followed the introduction of the MMR vaccine, these individuals had not been exposed to the disease, but still had no immunity, either natural or vaccine induced. Therefore, as immunisation rates declined following the controversy and the disease re-emerged, they were susceptible to infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10125382 |title= England and Wales in grip of mumps epidemic |work= N Z Herald |date=13 May 2005 |accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/mumps/gen_info.htm |title=Mumps |publisher=Health Protection Agency |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502002924/http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/mumps/gen_info.htm |archivedate=2 May 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measles and mumps cases continued in 2006, at incidence rates 13 and 37 times greater than respective 1998 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Confirmed cases of measles, mumps &amp; rubella |publisher= Health Protection Agency |date=22 March 2007 |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/measles/data_mmr_confirmed.htm |accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two children were severely and permanently injured by measles [[encephalitis]] despite undergoing [[kidney transplantation]] in London.&lt;ref name=Pepys/&gt;

Disease outbreaks also caused casualties in nearby countries. Three deaths and 1,500 cases were reported in the Irish outbreak of 2000, which occurred as a direct result of decreased vaccination rates following the MMR scare.&lt;ref name=Pepys&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Clinical Medicine |year=2007 |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=562–78 |title= Science and serendipity |author= Pepys MB |pmid=18193704 |doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.7-6-562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, for the first time in 14 years, measles was declared [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in the UK, meaning that the disease was sustained within the population; this was caused by the preceding decade's low MMR vaccination rates, which created a population of susceptible children who could spread the disease.&lt;ref name=Eurosurveillance&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Eurosurveillance |year=2008 |author1=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) – Surveillance and Communication Unit |volume=13 |issue=27 |page=18919 |title= Measles once again endemic in the United Kingdom |url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919|pmid=18761933}}&lt;/ref&gt; MMR vaccination rates for English children were unchanged in 2007–08 from the year before, at too low a level to prevent serious measles outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7633115.stm |date=24 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-24 |title= MMR vaccine uptake rise 'stalls' |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, a British 17-year-old with an underlying [[immunodeficiency]] died of measles.

=== Impact on society ===

The ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' said that antivaccinationist activities resulted in a high cost to society, "including damage to individual and community well-being from outbreaks of previously controlled diseases, withdrawal of vaccine manufacturers from the market, compromising of national security (in the case of anthrax and smallpox vaccines), and lost productivity".&lt;ref name=AgeOld/&gt;

Costs to society from declining vaccination rates (in US dollars) were estimated by AOL's ''Daily Finance'' in 2011:&lt;ref name=CostlyLie&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/autism-vaccine-fraud-wakefield-cost-money-deaths/19793484/ |title= The Autism Vaccine Fraud: Dr. Wakefield's Costly Lie to Society |author= Alazraki, Molly |date= 12 January 2011 |publisher= AOL Money and Finance: Daily Finance |accessdate= 2011-01-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115040538/http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/autism-vaccine-fraud-wakefield-cost-money-deaths/19793484/|archivedate=15 January 2011|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A 2002–2003 outbreak of measles in Italy, "which led to the hospitalizations of more than 5,000 people, had a combined estimated cost between 17.6 million euros and 22.0 million euros".
* A 2004 outbreak of measles from "an unvaccinated student return[ing] from India in 2004 to Iowa was $142,452".
* A 2006 outbreak of mumps in Chicago, "caused by poorly immunized employees, cost the institution $262,788, or $29,199 per mumps case".
* A 2007 outbreak of mumps in Nova Scotia cost $3,511 per case.
* A 2008 outbreak of measles in San Diego, California cost $177,000, or $10,376 per case.

In the United States, [[Jenny McCarthy]] blamed vaccinations for her son Evan's disorders and leveraged her celebrity status to warn parents of a link between vaccines and autism.

[[Bill Gates]] has reacted strongly to Wakefield and the work of anti-vaccination groups: 
{{quote|Dr. [Andrew] Wakefield has been shown to have used absolutely fraudulent data. He had a financial interest in some lawsuits, he created a fake paper, the journal allowed it to run.

Because the mothers who heard that lie, many of them didn’t have their kids take either pertussis or measles vaccine, and their children are dead today. And so the people who go and engage in those anti-vaccine efforts — you know, they, they kill children.

Before 1903, writings about Mormons were mostly orthodox documentary histories or [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] material. The first dissertations on Mormons, published in the 1900s, had a naturalistic style that approached [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormon history]] from economic, psychological, and philosophical theories. While their position within Mormon studies is debated, Mormon [[apologetics]] have a tradition dating back to [[Parley P. Pratt]]'s response to an anti-Mormon book in 1838.

The amount of scholarship in Mormon studies increased after World War II. From 1972–1982, while [[Leonard J. Arrington|Leonard Arrington]] was a [[Church Historian and Recorder|Church Historian]] in the history department, the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]] were open to Mormon and non-Mormon researchers. Researchers wrote detached accounts for Mormon intellectuals in the "New Mormon history" style. Many new publications started to publish history in this style, including [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'']], ''[[BYU Studies Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Woman's Exponent|Exponent II]]''. Some [[General authority|general authorities]] in the church did not like the New Mormon history style, and Arrington and his remaining staff were transferred to [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) in 1982, where they worked in the [[Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History]]. The institute continued to support scholarship in Mormon history until 2005, when the institute closed and employees transferred to the LDS Church Office Building. In the late 1980s and 1990s, several other incidents made BYU faculty reluctant to voice unorthodox ideas about church history. Around 1990, BYU professors were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]''. Two historians were [[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|excommunicated]] in 1993, probably for their published unorthodox views. ''BYU Studies'' and other LDS church-sponsored publishers published more "faithful" scholarship at this time. Presses outside of Utah started to publish more books in Mormon studies. 

Mormon scholars engaging in Mormon studies still feel they must be careful about what they write, especially if they work with material from the Church History Library archives. Non-Mormon scholars are often suspicious of Mormon scholars' work. This is gradually changing as Mormon scholars find employment outside of church-sponsored institutions. Universities without affiliation to the LDS Church have endowed chairs for Mormon studies. Emerging trends in "Newer" Mormon History are an increase in interdisciplinary work and women's history. The LDS Church History Department hired a women's history specialist in 2011 and has recently published books focusing on women's history. Blogs focusing on Mormon history have helped make Mormon history more accessible and provided a safe space for unorthodox ideas, although they may be superficial at times. 

==Pre-1903 writings about Mormons==
Before World War II, church histories were mostly either orthodox Mormon or anti-Mormon and written by faithful Mormons or hostile non-Mormons, respectively.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=504}} A few writers in the first era of church history (1830–1905) wrote about Mormons as a curiosity and focused on their peculiar ways.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=16}}

===Anti-Mormon literature===
Non-Mormons wrote for a non-Mormon public about how "primitive and dangerous" Mormons were in "extreme terms."{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|pp=199–200}}  [[Eber D. Howe]] published ''[[Mormonism Unvailed|Mormonism Unvailed, or a Faithful Account of that Singular Imposition and Delusion]]'' in 1834, which claimed that [[Sidney Rigdon]] was the original author of the [[Book of Mormon]] and that [[Joseph Smith]] was a "vile wretch." Howe included affidavits from people who knew Joseph Smith collected by ex-Mormon [[Doctor Philastus Hurlbut|Philastus Hurlbut]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=53–54}} The book influenced future anti-Mormon literature. (by La Roy Sunderland, [[John C. Bennett|John Bennett]], and John A. Clark).{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=55}} Origen Bacheler examined the Book of Mormon itself in ''Mormonism Exposed Internally and Externally'', arguing that the book was inconsistent with the Bible and was written by Joseph Smith himself.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=56–57}}

In the 1960s, ex-Mormons [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] continued that anti-Mormon tradition by reprinting anti-Mormon works in the [[public domain]] as well as important but unflattering documents from LDS history through Utah Light House Ministry. They published their own criticisms of the LDS church as well, which, unlike early anti-Mormon works, cite historical documents.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=60–62}} [[Ed Decker]], an excommunicated Mormon, made two anti-Mormon films: ''[[The God Makers]]'' (1982) and ''[[The God Makers II]]'' (1993). The films described Mormons as being a [[cult]], abusing women and children, manipulating news outlets, and practicing [[Satanism]]. ''The God Makers II'' received criticism from other anti-Mormons, including Jerald and Sandra Tanner, who stated it contained inaccuracies.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=62–63}}

===Official church records and early histories===
[[File:Andrew Jenson.jpg|thumb|Andrew Jenson wrote the LDS Biographical Encyclopedia]]
Official recorders have existed since Joseph Smith organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] on April 6, 1830. Church records continue to the present and are kept in the LDS church archives. The first official church history was published in 1842, when Smith and his associates began writing ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of Joseph Smith]]'' as an official diary of Joseph Smith. This history was published in [[Times and Seasons]] in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], and then in [[Deseret News]] and Latter-day Saints' [[Millennial Star]] up until 1863. ''History of Joseph Smith'' was followed by ''History of Brigham Young'', which was also published in Deseret News and Millennial Star over the next two years. Church Historians and their assistants edited the material, which was published in official publications.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=1–2}} [[Andrew Jenson]] made sizable contributions to documentary church history with the [[Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia]] (1901–36), Encyclopedic History of the Church (1941), and an unpublished "Journal History of the Church" containing over 1,500 scrapbooks filled with published and unpublished records of daily activities in the church.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=1–2}} Jenson made a special report on the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]], and parts of the report were not openly used until [[Massacre at Mountain Meadows|''Massacre at Mountain Meadows'']] (2008) by [[Richard E. Turley Jr.|Richard E. Turley]], [[Ronald W. Walker]], and [[Glen M. Leonard]].{{sfn|Walker|2008|p=25}}

The first historian to attempt to summarize Mormon history on a large scale was [[Edward Tullidge]], who wrote ''Life of Brigham Young: or Utah and Her Founders'' (1876), ''History of Salt Lake City'' (1886), and History of Northern Utah and Southern Idaho (1889). [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Hubert How Bancroft]] wrote ''History of Utah'' (1889) with the help of the Historian's Office.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}} Bancroft's history of Utah portrayed Mormons favorably. Critics say that he wasn't objective since he allowed LDS Church authorities to read the book before publication. Perhaps his favorable treatment was how he obtained access to the church records.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=144–145}} Expanding on Bancroft's history, [[Orson F. Whitney]] wrote ''History of Utah'' (1898–1904) in four volumes. [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] wrote ''Essentials of Church History'' in 1922. Most of these accounts combined various testimonies into a single narrative without questioning the validity of the eyewitnesses or other observers, especially those of church authorities.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}}

Mormons wrote accounts for other Mormons, often published in church-sponsored venues like ''[[Juvenile Instructor|The Juvenile Instructor]]'' and in church-published lesson manuals. These writings were written for a Mormon audience in order to support their existing beliefs. [[B. H. Roberts|Brigham H. Roberts]] was an associate editor of the ''Salt Lake Herald'' and while on a mission to England, was the editor of the ''[[Millennial Star|Millenial Star]]''. Upon returning to Utah, he became a [[General Authority]]. After an invitation from ''Americana'', Brigham H. Roberts wrote a chapter each month from 1909 to 1915 in what later became the ''[[Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]: Century One''.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|pp=199–200}} The history had some of the first historical analysis of events in church history.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=140}} It was serialized in Americana 1909–1915.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}} 

From 1830-1930, women were victims or symbols in historical accounts.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=1}} Church historians mentioned their suffering, but rarely mentioned them by name. Anti-polygamy tracts also described Mormon women in general terms, describing them as deluded or miserable.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=2}} In an effort to combat the way anti-polygamists portrayed Mormon women, Edward Tullidge and Eliza R. Snow compiled ''The Women of Mormondom'' (1877), a book that portrayed Mormon women as hardworking and independent in a combined history, biography, and theology. ''Heroines of Mormondom'' (1884) highlighted faithful Mormon women's lives. Women wrote short biographies of other women and recorded them in [[Woman's Exponent|''Women's Exponent'']] and through publications from the [[Daughters of the Utah Pioneers]].{{sfn|Erekson|2017|pp=3–4}}

==Early Mormon studies==
[[File:Great Basin Desert 3 by Earth's beauty site.jpg|thumb|Great Basin Desert]]
Early academic writers on Mormon topics had a "naturalistic" approach to history, using theory from economics, psychology, and philosophy to guide their study.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=155}} Richard Ely contributed to the professionalization of Mormon studies with his early dissertation "Economic Aspects of Mormonism" (1903). In the work, he praised Mormon irrigation and communalism as a good model of economic development.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=146–147}} He influenced [[Leonard J. Arrington|Leonard Arrington']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s interest in economics and Mormons.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=160}} Andrew Love Neff wrote "The Mormon Migration to Utah," which he finished in 1918 but had started over ten years earlier. He was interested in how Mormons helped colonize the West.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=19}} Mormon [[E. E. Ericksen|Ephraim Edward Ericksen]] wrote "The Psychological and Ethical Aspects of Mormonism" (1922) while studying at the University of Chicago. His dissertation, influenced by functionalist theory, argued that Mormonism was a product of conflicts with non-Mormons and harsh environments.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=147–148}} Lowry Nelson, also a Mormon, studied at the University of Wisconsin in the 1920s. He worked in agriculture and was dean of BYU's College of Applied Science and director of the Utah Agriculture Experiment stations. He wrote articles about how the Mormon village was designed to promote unity and sociability, which allowed Mormon settlers to colonize the Great Basin Desert. He left Utah in 1937.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=149–150}} [[Nels Anderson]] studied at the University of Chicago, and studied hobos in Utah, where he converted to Mormonism. His book ''Desert Saints'' (1944) recounted the history of saints in the St. George, Utah area.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=150–151}} Other scholars publishing on Mormonism from this time period include I. Woodbridge Riley, [[Walter Franklin Prince|Walter F. Prince]], Franklin D. Daines, Hamilton Gardner, Joseph Geddes, [[Feramorz Y. Fox|Feramorz Fox]], Arden Beal Olsen, William McNiff, [[Kimball Young]], [[Austin E. and Alta S. Fife|Austin Fife and Alta Fife]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=151–154}}

In the 1950s after World War II, an increasing number of Mormons studied history professionally and wrote dissertations about Mormon history. Non-Mormon sociologist Thomas F. O'Dea wrote a dissertation entitled "Mormon Values: The Significance of a Religious Outlook for Social Action" after living in a rural Mormon farming village in New Mexico for six months and subsequently teaching at Utah State University.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=22}} This study of Mormon culture "stunned Mormon readers with its objectivity and sympathetic insight," according to Mormon scholar [[Richard Bushman]].{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=203}} [[Bernard DeVoto]], [[Dale Morgan|Dale L. Morgan]], [[Fawn M. Brodie|Fawn McKay Brodie]], Stuart Ferguson, and [[Juanita Brooks]] did not have graduate degrees in history, but made significant contributions to the foundations of Mormonism's "New History" movement.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=499–500}}{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=151–154}} Brodie wrote [[No Man Knows My History|''No Man Knows My History'']] (1945), which contemporary reviews praised as definitive and scholarly. Other LDS scholars, notably [[Hugh Nibley]], criticized Brodie's biography.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=499–500}} In 1950, Juanita Brooks, an educated Mormon housewife, published a scholarly book on the Mountain Meadows Massacre, which is well-researched and balanced even by contemporary standards. Brooks's Mormon neighbors did not like "the frankness" of her book.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=202}}

==Apologetics and polemics==
{{anchor|Apologetics}}
&lt;!--Please don't edit text within above anchor template. Thanks.--&gt;
{{see also|Apologetics#Mormonism|Criticism of Mormonism}}

Mormon scholars are divided on whether apologetics should be considered part of Mormon studies or not. Brian D. Birch argues that it should be a part of Mormon studies, as long as apologetic authors concede that their arguments are objective and subject to academic debate.{{sfn|Birch|2014}} Apologists write defensively, and view their polemical responses to criticism as a battle for their faith.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|pp=518–519}} [[Parley P. Pratt]] responded to ''Mormonism Unveiled'' in detail in his 1838 pamphlet ''Mormonism Unveiled: Zion's Watchman Unmasked and Its Editor Mr. L.R. Sunderland Exposed, Truth Vindicated, the Devil Mad, and Priestcraft in Danger!'' Pratt argued against Sunderland's character, quoting Hurlbut, who stated that Sunderland has a "notorious character."{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=69}}

Hugh Nibley's ''No Ma'am, That's Not History'' set a standard for apologetics to use academic language, and criticized Brodie's use of sources in her controversial biography of Joseph Smith, ''No Man Knows My History''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} The [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS) aimed to support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon and respond to criticism, and used Nibley's style{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} to counter research that contradicted the Book of Mormon's ancient origins.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=517}} FARMS collaborated with [[Deseret Book Company|Deseret Book]] to publish the complete works of Hugh Nibley starting in 1984.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} In 1997, LDS church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] invited FARMS to be officially affiliated at BYU, and in 2006 it was subsumed by the [[Neal A. Maxwell Institute of Religious Scholarship]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} In 2012, Daniel C. Petersen, the editor of ''[[FARMS Review]]'', started publishing a new journal called [[Interpreter (journal)|''Interpreter'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|title=The Role of Apologetics in Mormon Studies|date=December 14, 2012|url=http://www.mormoninterpreter.com/the-role-of-apologetics-in-mormon-studies/|work=Mormoninterpreter.com|accessdate=2013-09-04|authorlink=Daniel C. Peterson}} — Note: this is a reprint of Peterson's August 2012 FAIR speech "Of 'Mormon Studies' and Apologetics".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FairMormon|Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research]] (FAIR), a group including both laypeople and academics, attempts to answer criticisms of the Mormon faith.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=517}} in 2013, it changed its name to [[FairMormon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/about|title=About FairMormon – FairMormon|work=FairMormon|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some other Mormon "insiders" countered the Book of Mormon's ancient origins through the Smith-Pettit Foundation in Salt Lake City and George Smith's [[Signature Books]] publishing company. Signature Books published ''New Approaches to the Book of Mormon'' by Brent Metcalfe and ''American Apocrypha'' by Dan Vogel and Metcalfe.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=73–74}} These insider views of the Book of Mormon's origins were diverse. ''American Apocrypha'' described the Book of Mormon as a work of fiction reflecting its environment. Ostler argued that the Book of Mormon was partially inspired.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=75}} FARMS's responses were at times patronizing, and even descending into veiled name-calling in William Hamblin's 1994 critique of a Metcalfe essay.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=76–77}}

===Counter-apologetics===
{{see also|Counter-apologetics}}
In the 1990s and 2000s, [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] Carl Mosser and Paul Owen encouraged other Evangelicals to respond to Mormon apologetics. Evangelical [[Craig Blomberg|Craig L. Blomberg]] discussed whether or not Mormons were Christian with Mormon [[Stephen E. Robinson]] in ''How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and Evangelical in Conversation''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=79}} Richard Bushman encouraged fellow Mormon historians to be less defensive and more open to criticism, and also to do research on Mormon history from a consciously Mormon point of view.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=521}}

==New Mormon history==
In the 1960s, a new generation of Mormon scholars emerged. The publication of [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'']], the newly-established Mormon History Association, and the professionalization of LDS and RLDS history departments provided spaces for historians to do new research in Mormon topics.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=498–499}} RLDS scholars founded the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] in 1972.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In 1974, [[Claudia Bushman]] and [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]] founded the magazine ''[[Woman's Exponent|Exponent II]]''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=164}} The first issue of [[BYU Studies Quarterly|''BYU Studies'']] was published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard|title=An Economic Interpretation of the "Word of Wisdom"|journal=BYU Studies|date=1959|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/economic-interpretation-word-wisdom|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonard Arrington 1950s.jpeg|thumb|Leonard Arrington]]
Also in 1972, the LDS Church hired Leonard Arrington as their historian.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=501}} During Arrington's time as historian, Mormon and non-Mormon historians were allowed to access the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]]. Much of the research in the 1970s used these newly-available sources to examine church history, sometimes in great detail.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=502}} Leonard Arrington influenced important scholars of Mormon history, including [[Richard L. Jensen|Richard Jensen]], [[William G. Hartley|William Hartley]], and [[Ronald W. Walker|Ronald Walker]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=164}} In 1969, Jewish historian [[Moses Rischin]] named the increasing amount of Mormon scholarship "the New Mormon history."{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=203}} The "New Mormon History" movement included non-Mormons Thomas F. O'Dea, P.A.M. Taylor, [[Mario De Pillis]], Lawrence Foster, Community of Christ member Robert Flanders, and Mormon scholar Klaus Hansen.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=5}}{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} 

[[Maureen Ursenbach Beecher]] was a leading researcher in women's studies.{{sfn|Whittaker|2013}}{{sfn|Cope|2012|p=102}} In the 1970s women's biographies were published, but not integrated into larger narratives.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=2}} Other women hired by the Church Historical Department included Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Edyth Romney. Journals dedicated special issues to Mormon women, and the increased interest in Mormon women led to more publications focused on them. Scholars published biographies of Emma Smith, Eliza Snow, Emmeline B. Wells, and Amy Brown Lyman.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=5}} 

Some writers looked at Mormon women's history with the goal of restructuring historical narratives. Mormon feminist articles on Mormon history started with the special Summer 1971 issue of ''Dialogue'' on women's issues and continued in publications like ''Exponent II'' (starting in 1974), and ''Mormon Sisters: Women in Early Utah'' (1976), edited by [[Claudia Bushman]]. Beecher and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich edited another volume about Mormon women's history in ''Sisters in Sprit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective'' (1987). ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism'' (1992) was another milestone in feminist publications, and it encouraged Mormon women to be empowered by their history and "reclaim lost opportunities."{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=6}}

Most New Mormon historians were LDS.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=6}} Their audience was Mormon intellectuals{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=5}} and non-Mormons.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} They maintained their respect for the Mormon faith, admitted to flaws in people and policies, and avoided taking a defensive stance,{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} a tone which non-Mormon historian [[Jan Shipps]] wrote "made them seem more secular than they actually were."{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=504–505}} Mormon history by non-Mormons at this time had a similar detached tone.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} New Mormon historians often published with the [[University of Illinois Press]] in order to publish for an academic audience independent of the church.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=206}} Charles S. Peterson argued in ''The Great Basin Kingdom Revisited'' that Arrington took an exceptionalist view of Mormon history, which he then taught to other New Mormon Historians. This exceptionalist view was that they could believe in both secular history and orthodox Mormon views of the restoration.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=234–235}}

==LDS church reaffirms orthodoxy and New Mormon Faith Historians==
The LDS church stopped funding so much research and limited access to the church archives.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Apostle [[Ezra Taft Benson]] warned employees in the [[Church Educational System]] against New Mormon History in a 1976 speech. He said that writing history in a neutral style undermined "prophetic history."  [[Boyd K. Packer]]'s 1981 article, "The Mantle is Far, Far Greater than the Intellect" was published in ''BYU Studies.'' He wrote that contemporary historians were too eager to focus on the faults of church leaders and dismiss spiritual inspiration.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=215}} In 1982, historians from Arrington's department were transferred to Brigham Young University, where they were assigned to teach in the history department and worked in the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History.{{sfn|Anderson|2005}}

[[File:Carol C. Madsen (41596667191).jpg|thumb|Carol Cornwall Madsen]]
After Arrington's death in 1999, [[Ronald K. Esplin]] and [[Jill Mulvay Derr]] led the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History at BYU. [[Carol Cornwall Madsen]] led research in the Women's History Initiative at the institute, where she wrote an important biographical study of [[Emmeline B. Wells]].{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=512}} In 2001,{{sfn|Bushman|2009|137}} [[Richard Bushman]] retired from full-time teaching at [[Columbia University]] and was a research director at the Smith Institute.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=513}} [[Dean C. Jessee]] started editing Joseph Smith's papers in ''The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith''. The Smith Institute closed in 2005, and institute staff along with the Smith papers project moved to the [[Church Office Building]].{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=512}} The [[The Joseph Smith Papers|Joseph Smith Papers]] project, started by the LDS church in 2001, aimed to publish Joseph Smith's papers with rigorous accuracy, and was validated by the National Historic Public Records Commission.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=205}} 

[[Jan Shipps]] asserts that this reluctance to support new Mormon history was a response to the [[Mark Hofmann]] document forgeries. Also, some church authorities disliked the books and articles produced by the history department, which noted flaws as well as strengths of people in church history.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Shipps states that the increase in new converts to the LDS Church led General Authorities to emphasize the need for "palatable" versions of church history in museums and historic sites rather than in-depth articles in church-sponsored publications.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=511}} Mormon sociologist [[Armand Mauss]] argued that Mormonism was a struggle between remaining distinctive and assimilating to accepted American cultural practices; scholar Ronald Helfrich speculates that the change in General Authority's reception to Arrington's research was because they feared assimilating too much.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=218}} General interest in Mormon studies continued during the 1980s, with over 2,000 books, articles, and other material published on Mormon history during that decade.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} 

''BYU Studies'' and Deseret Books published more "New Mormon Faith Historians" after General Authority pushback against New Mormon History. One of these New Mormon Faith Historians was [[Louis C. Midgley|Louis Midgely]], who argued that from a relativist, postmodern theory, the Mormon view that the LDS Church had divine origins was just as valuable and valid as others. New Mormon Faith Historians said that the New Mormon scholars left faith out of their analyses.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=219–220}} Many were members of FARMS, and often saw writers of New Mormon History as the same as other anti-Mormons, even though most writers of New Mormon History were Mormon.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=221–222}} The difference between the New Mormon Faith Historians and New Mormon scholars was hard to define.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=219–220}} 

Along with Arrington's transfer and a subsequent increase in restrictions in the LDS Church Archives, several other incidents led to an intellectual chilling of Mormon history by Mormons in the 1990s.{{sfn|Schuessler|2012}} In 1992, Arrington wrote that "the church cannot afford to place its official stamp of approval on any 'private' interpretation of its past," and this kind of history must be not sponsored by the LDS Church.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=4–5}} In September 1993, the LDS church excommunicated the [[September Six]], which included two historians: [[Lavina Fielding Anderson]] and [[D. Michael Quinn]]. These excommunications served as a warning to other Mormon historians.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Quinn's excommunication was perhaps tied to his idea that Mormon women had been given the priesthood in 1843, which he published in an essay in ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=224–225}} In 2003, he was scheduled to give a speech at a conference at Yale which was co-sponsored by BYU, and BYU stated they would withdraw their funding if Quinn presented his paper. That same year, Quinn applied to work as a professor at the University of Utah and Arizona State University. He was not hired as a professor, possibly because of fears that LDS people in power would retaliate against the university.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=227–228}} In 1986, administrators were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or present at the [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] symposium; around 1990, BYU professors were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or ''Sunstone''.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|pp=40–41}} [[Eugene England]], one of the founders of ''Dialogue'' and then a professor at BYU, spoke out against these prohibitions. He was asked not to write for the ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' in 1990, and in 1998 he was asked to retire from BYU without justification. England saw this as stemming from his publicly anti-war stance, and for his attention to Mormon racism and sexism. He viewed his differences as a potential source of learning for himself and others. After retiring from BYU, he started one of the first Mormon studies programs at [[Utah Valley University|Utah Valley State College]]. According to a 1997 report by the [[American Association of University Professors]] on academic freedom at BYU, Alan Wilkins was questioned about his motives for contributing to ''Dialogue'' and ''Sunstone'' in a tenure review. The report also mentioned other incidents where BYU administration criticized speakers and articles for criticism of the church, among other complaints.{{sfn|Pratt|1997|p=63}} 

In 1997, [[Joanna Brooks]] argued that the goal of Mormon studies was to critically examine Mormonism, not to determine religious truths.{{sfn|Brooks|1997|p=135}} She postulated that Mormon studies done as a type of cultural studies will help scholars in the field feel less defensive and more productive.{{sfn|Brooks|1997|p=138}} Outside of Brigham Young University and Utah, the [[University of North Carolina Press]], [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], and the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] published books on Mormonism.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In the 2000s, Jan Shipps was a large influence on news articles about Mormons; often she is the only expert cited for an entire article.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In 2005, the National Endowment for the Humanities held a seminar at Brigham Young University on the bicentennial of Joseph Smith's birth.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=197}}  [[Terryl Givens]], a comparative literature scholar, analyzed discourse about the Book of Mormon in ''By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion'' in 2002. {{sfn|McLemee|2002}}

Mormon women's history has not been well-integrated in general histories. Arrington and Davis Bitton discussed women's issues in two chapters on marriage and sisterhood in ''The Mormon Experience'' (1992). ''The Story of the Latter-day Saints'' (1992) by James Allen and Glen Leonard mentioned women in the context of auxiliaries like Relief Society and Primary, plural marriage, suffrage, and the ERA. ''The Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History'' (2000) contained 435 entries about men, but only 64 about women, with three-quarters of the women receiving less than a page of description. Church publication ''Our Heritage'' (1996) only mentioned a few women. Women's history remained in a "separate sphere."{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=7–8}} ''Daughters in My Kingdom'' (2011), an official history of the Relief Society, is mostly used in women's meetings. Outside of Mormon history specialists, Mormon women are rarely mentioned.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=9}}

==Newer Mormon history==
Non-Mormon scholars are still often suspicious of LDS scholars' work.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=3}} That is gradually changing as non-Mormon scholars increase and universities not affiliated with the LDS Church have endowed chairs for Mormon studies.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=4}} [[Kathleen Flake]] is the first Richard L. Bushman Chair of Mormon Studies at [[University of Virginia]], and [[Patrick Q. Mason|Patrick Mason]] is the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California.{{sfn|Walker|2013}}

[[File:Church History Library in Salt Lake City.jpg|thumb|Church History Library in Salt Lake City]]
The Church History Library still restricts access to certain documents for most scholars. Scholars may self-censor their research for fear of losing access to documents from the Church History Library. Previous excommunications of Mormon historians give Mormon researchers the sense that they are being watched.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=4}} Scholars from various disciplines see the "New Mormon History" movement as ending, bring replaced by "Post New Mormon History" or "Newer Mormon History." This emerging movement is interdisciplinary and endeavors to place Mormon studies in a broader historical context, further eroding boundaries between disciplines.{{sfn|Newell|2013|pp=6–7}} Mormon women's history has not been well-integrated with other Mormon studies topics.{{sfn|Coles|2018}} Contemporary historians like [[R. Marie Griffith]], [[Grant Wacker]], and [[Robert Orsi]] encourage the use of interdisciplinary tools in Mormon studies.{{sfn|Cope|2012|p=100}}

Included in these interdisciplinary tools are oral histories. In 1972, an the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies was established at BYU, where Jessie L. Embry directed an extensive oral history project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=John |last2=Ainsworth |first2=GlendaLynn |last3=Casper |first3=Zann |last4=Balif |first4=Elizabeth |title=Charles Redd Center for Western Studies oral history project records|url=https://findingaid.lib.byu.edu/viewItem/MSS%207752 |website=findingaid.lib.byu.edu |publisher=L.

Tom Perry Special Collections |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church History Department started their own oral history project in 2009.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=6}} Claudia L. Bushman and her students started the Claremont Oral History collection in 2009, and papers using the oral history data were published in ''Mormon Women Have Their Say: Essays from the Claremont Oral History Collection''.{{sfn|Bushman|Kline|2013b}}

The LDS Church History Department hired a specialist in women's history in 2011, Kate Holbrook. She co-authored ''The First Fifty Years of Relief Society: Key Documents in Latter-Day Saint Women's History'' with Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Matthew J. Grow. Laurel Thatcher Ulrich said the book was "the most important work to emerge from a Mormon Press in the last 50 years." Jenny Reeder, specializing in 19th century women's history, was hired in 2013. Brittany Chapman Nash and Lisa Tait also specialize in women's history and work in the LDS Church history department. Nash works in public services and helps researchers to be aware of women's sources the archive offers. She co-authored ''Women of Faith in the Latter Days'' with [[Richard E. Turley Jr.|Richard Turley]]. Tait works on the web team, helping to add a "Women of Conviction" section to church history website.{{sfn|Walch|2016}} In 2017, Reeder and Holbrook edited a compilation of women's speeches called ''At the Pulpit: 185 Years of Discourses by Latter-day Saint Women.'' {{sfn|Walch|2017}}

==Blogs and Mormon studies==
The [[Mormon blogosphere]] influences Mormon studies. In 2011, Patrick Mason surveyed 113 Mormon blog readers who were also graduate students.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=13}} Most respondents viewed blogs as a way to democratize Mormon studies. Since blogs are independent from Church institutions, many felt that blogs were a safe space to test more unorthodox ideas.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=17}} A few observed that men's voices are more prominent in the blogging community, though a few prominent blogs have all-women authors.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=18}} Other respondents felt that blogs made Mormon studies "more of an echo chamber," and were "superficial," and "glorified navel-gazing."{{sfn|Mason|2012|pp=18–19}}  One of the most popular blogs, By Common Consent, had over two million page visitors in 2011. It and other blogs are influential on Mormon studies.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=20}}

== Archives ==
Archives with significant Mormon collections include the [[L. Tom Perry Special Collections]] at BYU, the Church Archives in Salt Lake, the J. Willard Marriott Library at the [[University of Utah]] in Salt Lake, Utah State University Libraries, and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=165}}

== Awards ==
Awards for writing or service in the field of Mormon studies are presented annually by scholarly societies.  The [[Mormon History Association]] (MHA) and the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] (JWHA) each present annual awards for various categories within Mormon history, such as books, biographies, documentary history, journal articles, and lifetime achievement.&lt;ref name=mha_awards&gt;{{cite web | title=MHA Awards | work=mormonhistoryassociation.org | publisher=Mormon History Association | url=https://www.mormonhistoryassociation.org/awards | accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Awards | work=jwha.info | publisher=John Whitmer Historical Association | url=http://www.jwha.info/awards | accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The MHA also gives awards for theses and student papers.&lt;ref name=mha_awards/&gt;  The [[Utah State Historical Society]] (USHS), which frequently engages Mormon history, also presents awards for books, articles, and student papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NEWS: Utah State History Announces 2013 Annual Awards | date=September 17, 2013 | work=Utah Cultural Alliance: Unifying Utah's Cultural Community | url=http://ut-cultural-alliance.blogspot.com/2013/09/news-utah-state-history-announces-2013.html

== Academic programs ==
Several universities have programs in the study of Mormonism, with professors named to oversee coursework, research, and events on Mormon studies.  While independent academic programs have emerged in recent years, devotional religious education programs have existed far longer.  Additional colleges have also taught courses on Mormonism without having institutionally sponsored programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Series: Mormon Studies in the Classroom | author=Benjamin Park | date=April 21, 2014 | work=Juvenile Instructor | url=http://juvenileinstructor.org/new-series-mormon-studies-in-the-classroom/ | accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not included in the list below.

The first '''Oxford Dance Symposium''' at [[New College, Oxford]] took place on 21 April 1999 with Dance on the English Stage, and has become an annual, international event which attracts scholars and practitioners from many parts of the world. Each symposium is designed to explore different aspects of dance, with particular reference to its musical, theatrical, literary and social context in Britain and Europe during the long 18th century; and as such has embraced subjects ranging from the 17th-century Stuart Masque and French ballet de cour to early 19th-century opera and ballet. There is a particular emphasis on new research or new appraisals of existing sources, and although the symposium issues no Proceedings, some of the papers from several symposia have been published as books of essays or as individual papers in academic journals. The symposium is organised each year by [[Michael Burden]] and Jennifer Thorp.

'''Pansophic Learning''' is a for-profit [[charter management organization]] with schools in the [[United States]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]].  Pansophic is based in [[McLean, Virginia]]. Its [[Accel Schools]] subsidiary is the largest charter school operator in Ohio.

==History==
Pansophic was founded in 2014 by Ronald J. Packard, who had founded [[K12 (company)|K12]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="abj150612"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Livingston|first1=Doug|title=White Hat Management reportedly selling Ohio charter school operations to out-of-state company|url=https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/politics/state/white-hat-management-reportedly-selling-ohio-charter-school-operations-to-out-of-state-company|accessdate=23 January 2018|publisher=Akron Beacon Journal|date=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 acquisition made Pansophic the largest charter school operator in Ohio, with twelve schools and 3,286 students.

Gardner served on the board of the company from 1986 to 1994 but did not take an active role in the company. Nace and Gardner named the company Peachpit because at the time, Nace and several of his friends were "living and working in a peach colored house in [[Berkeley, Ca|Berkeley]] that was such a dump it was considered a 'pit.'" &lt;ref&gt;[http://jtchatter.blogspot.nl/2008/01/another-bedtime-story-for-designers.html jtChatter]&lt;/ref&gt; Computer writer Elaine Weinmann described how Nace let authors typeset and illustrate their own books and described his publishing approach as user-friendly and innovative.&lt;ref name=twsNovS23&gt;{{cite news

'''RR Donnelley''' is a [[Fortune 500]] integrated communications company that provides marketing and business communications, commercial printing, and related services. Its corporate headquarters are located in [[Chicago, Illinois]], United States.

== History==
R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company was founded in Chicago in 1864 by Richard Robert Donnelley. His son, Reuben H. Donnelley, founded the otherwise unrelated company formerly known as [[R. H. Donnelley]].&lt;ref name="gd001"&gt;Donnelley, Gaylord. ''To Be A Good Printer'' (Lakeside Press, 1977) ASIN B000S5KF9I&lt;/ref&gt; 

Richard Robert Donnelley established his company in downtown Chicago, which in 1870 became the Lakeside Printing and Publishing Company. The business was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. After a series of reorganizations and expansions, Donnelley built the [[Lakeside Press Building]] on Plymouth Court, and in 1902 began construction of the [[R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co. Calumet Plant]] on 21st Street and Calumet Avenue. The company aimed to produce books and periodicals with impressive modern design and mass printed commercial and reference materials. Lakeside Press produced [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', ''[[Life Magazine]]'', promotional literature for the [[Model T Ford]], catalogs for [[Sears Roebuck]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rrdonnelley.com/timeline/index.aspx R.R. Donnelley Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The Press produced high quality collectible editions for the Chicago [[Caxton Club]] and the [[Limited Editions Club]]. Donnelly was the official printer for the 1933-1934 [[Century of Progress|World's Fair, "A Century of Progress]]," which took place on the Lake Michigan lakefront just to the east of the plant. The company designed and printed official tickets, postcards, posters, brochures, and magazines which displayed the company's distinctive modernist design. "&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/PrintingForTheModernAge/PrinterToTheModernistMovement.html Printer to the Modernist Movement: A Century of Progress]" [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/PrintingForTheModernAge/index.html University of Chicago Library] (Accessed May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The company eventually became a global provider of printing and print-related services.{{sfnb|Davis|1922|p = 25-29}} From 1922-1945, the Director of Design and Typography was [[William A. Kittredge (designer)|William A. Kittredge]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/kittredge.xml Biography of William A. Kittredge]  [http://www.newberry.org/ The Newberry]&lt;/ref&gt; who commissioned other well-regarded artists and designers, such as [[Rudolph Ruzicka]], [[Edward A. Wilson (illustrator)|Edward A.

RR Donnelley's [[cartography|cartographic]] production facility grew to be one of the largest custom mapmaking companies in the [[United States]]. In the early 1990s, the division successfully integrated routing technology with its digital map databases and launched a separate company, Geosystems, which several years later became [[MapQuest]].

The Calumet Plant, a building which also included company headquarters, was closed in 1993.
 
==Lakeside Press Apprentice School and labor relations==
In 1908 T.E. Donnelley, son of the founder, opened Lakeside Press Apprentice School. Donnelley, a Yale graduate and a trustee of the University of Chicago, felt that the recent revival of the ancient practice of apprenticeship was unsatisfactory because unions dominated the rules. He determined to open a program modeled on the [[Apprenticeship|apprentice training program]] at the Chaix Printing Company in Paris, France, which combined instruction and practical experience. "The whole plant," in the words of one official description, "is the laboratory of the school" {{sfnb|Davis|1922|p = 25-29}} The inscription for the 1913 handbook for apprentices stated that "The employer should realize that engaging an apprentice is a much more important task than hiring a journeyman." {{sfnb|Lakeside Press|1913| p = iii }} A 1933 pamphlet bragged that the apprentices "learn the ancient craft of printing on the finest of modern equipment" and "are imbued with the conviction that the better they do their work, the more they will earn and the higher they will rise.{{sfnb||1933| p = 6-7}}

The company was one of many which at the time offered apprenticeship courses of this type, ranging from the [[American Bridge Company]] and the [[American Locomotive Company]] to the [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]].{{sfnb|Davis|1922|p = 119}}

In the early years, ome 90 percent of the company's executives and supervisors were graduates of the Apprentice Training School and were either college graduates who had gone through a training program or had come up through the ranks. The firm’s turnover remained low. As Chicago became home to a northward migration of blacks, the workforce became stratified as non-whites found it hard to attain management positions. Racial tensions in the 1960s further weakened the company's ability to meet technological challenges and global competition. Declining fortunes led to layoffs and contention, and the school closed in 1993.{{sfnb|Reingold|2002| p = 191}}

==The Four American Books Campaign==
Donnelley  launched a "Four American Books" campaign in 1926 which culminated with their publication in 1930. The aim was to establish that the company's modern commercial machinery could produce illustrated books to rival high-quality presses in Europe and to establish a reputation as a printer of fine trade editions in order to enter the mass-market book industry. The choice of American authors reflected a growing pride in and market for American literature. C. G. Littell, vice president and treasurer, and William A. Kittredge, head of the department of design and typography, organized the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/PrintingForTheModernAge/PromotingTheCraftAmericanBooks.html Promoting the Craft: The Four American Books Campaign] [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/PrintingForTheModernAge/index.html Printing for the Modern Age: Commerce, Craft, and Culture in the RR Donnelley Archive] (Accessed May 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

When Kittredge approached [[William Addison Dwiggins]] about illustrating a book for the project, Dwiggins, who was a well-established designer of magazine and newspaper advertisements, replied that he welcomed the chance to "do something besides waste-basket stuff" which would be "promptly thrown away." After he turned down several suggestions, Dwiggins agreed to illustrate the ''Tales'' of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. The Press considered his fee of $2,000 low for an illustrator of his commercial power.{{sfnb|Benton|2000  | p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WbpOcowMfCIC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Rockwell+Kent+Moby-dick+lakeside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFHUVK3lGoWQyAT84YDQCg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rockwell%20Kent%20Moby-dick%20lakeside&amp;f=false 132]}}  Edward A. Wilson illustrated [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.|Richard Henry Dana]]'s mid-19th century sea-adventure [[Two Years Before the Mast]] and Rudolph Ruzicka [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s [[Walden]].{{sfnb|Benton|2000  | p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WbpOcowMfCIC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Rockwell+Kent+Moby-dick+lakeside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFHUVK3lGoWQyAT84YDQCg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rockwell%20Kent%20Moby-dick%20lakeside&amp;f=false 162]}}

The best known of the publications in the series was [[Rockwell Kent]]'s edition of  [[Herman Melville]]'s novel, [[Moby-Dick]], which at that point was not yet accepted as an American classic. Kittredge commissioned Kent to perform the design and illustrations in 1926, and the book appeared four years later in a three-volume limited edition of one-thousand copies issued in an aluminum slipcase. Kittredge called it "the greatest book done in this generation" and declared that "we will all go jump in the lake" if "it is not the greatest illustrated book ever done in America." {{sfnb|Benton|2000  | p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WbpOcowMfCIC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Rockwell+Kent+Moby-dick+lakeside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFHUVK3lGoWQyAT84YDQCg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rockwell%20Kent%20Moby-dick%20lakeside&amp;f=false 132, 200]}} (In fact, the book is considered one of the finest of the 20th century.{{sfnb|Hutner|2004| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=On2cttWtZ9AC&amp;pg=PR37&amp;dq=Rockwell+Kent+Moby-dick+lakeside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFHUVK3lGoWQyAT84YDQCg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rockwell%20Kent%20Moby-dick%20lakeside&amp;f=false XXXVII]}})  [[Random House]] quickly issued a one-volume trade edition, which was also printed by Lakeside Press, bound in black cloth with silver print and decorations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedpo.com/BookDetail.php?bk=232 Moby-Dick] ''First Edition Points'' (accessed February 6, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The book's cover and the first advertisements both featured Kent's name but did not mention Melville's. Kent's design, especially in the [[Modern Library]] edition of 1943, helped the novel to find a wider audience.{{sfnb|Benton|2000  | p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WbpOcowMfCIC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Rockwell+Kent+Moby-dick+lakeside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFHUVK3lGoWQyAT84YDQCg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rockwell%20Kent%20Moby-dick%20lakeside&amp;f=false 105-107]}}

Kent's illustrations give the impression of being woodcuts but are in fact ink and wash. Kent counselled Kittredge that the "whole book is a work that should be read slowly, reflectively; the large page and type induce such reading. The character of the type should be homely, rather than refined and elegant, for homeliness flavors every line that Melville wrote." He wrote that he had thought of using a fourteen-point [[Caslon]] type-face, and he did make the pages rather large. The artist considered his illustrations "literary woodcutting, not engraving," and added that the illustrations show the "midnight darkness enveloping human existence, the darkness of the human soul, the abyss, -- such is the mood of Moby-Dick."{{sfnb|Benton|2000  | p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WbpOcowMfCIC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Rockwell+Kent+Moby-dick+lakeside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFHUVK3lGoWQyAT84YDQCg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rockwell%20Kent%20Moby-dick%20lakeside&amp;f=false 105-107]}}

In 1992, the [[Library of Congress]] held an exhibition devoted to the Four American Classics series. {{sfnb|Badaracco|1992| p = }}

==Lakeside Press Galleries==
in 1929, the company opened the Lakeside Galleries on the eight floor of their newly completed building on 22nd Street, near the shores of Lake Michigan. From 1930 to 1961, when corporate headquarters were moved, the galleries devoted exhibitions to the works of American and European artists and photographers, as well as to typography and book design.&lt;ref&gt;University of Chicago Library, "[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/PrintingForTheModernAge/PromotingTheCraftExhibitions.html Printing for the Modern Age]."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business acquisitions and mergers ==
Throughout its history, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s, RR Donnelley purchased a number of other companies outright, steadily increasing in size. In February 2004, RR Donnelley [[merger|merged]] with Moore Wallace Inc., keeping the name RR Donnelley as the name of the combined companies. Donnelley went on to purchase OfficeTiger, a major publishing and financial outsourcing company, as well as printing company [[Banta Corporation]] in 2007. In May 2007, RR Donnelley also acquired book and educational materials printer Von Hoffmann (and  creative/ pre-press subsidiary Anthology Inc.) from Visant Corporation.&lt;ref name="bos001"&gt;{{cite news | last = The Associated Press | title = RR Donnelley to buy Van Hoffmann | url = http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2007/01/03/rr_donnelley__sons_to_buy_van_hoffmann/ | accessdate = 2007-12-29}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional purchase at the beginning of 2007 was Perry Judd's Holdings Inc., a private catalog and magazine printer.

In 2006 it acquired [[Canadian Bank Note Company]]'s financial printing business, consisting of documentation for initial public offerings.

In 2007, RR Donnelley was also named as an interested party in an attempt to purchase [[Quebecor World]].&lt;ref name="reu001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/071218/business/business_quebecorworld_report_col_1|title=At least four firms eyeing Quebecor World: report|author=Reuters|date=2007-12-18|publisher=''Yahoo!

== Lakeside press ==
'''Lakeside Press''' was a Chicago [[Imprint (trade name)|publishing imprint]] under which the RR Donnelley Company produced fine-quality books as well as mail order catalogs, telephone directories, encyclopedias, and advertising. The Press was best known for its high quality editions for the Chicago [[Caxton Club]] as well as the  Lakeside Classics, a series of fine reprints produced annually, at [[Christmas]] time, by RR Donnelley.&lt;ref name="lc001"&gt;{{cite web | last = RRD Corporate Website | title = Lakeside Classics | url = http://www.rrdonnelley.com/wwwRRD/AboutUs/LakesideClassics/LakesideClassics.asp | accessdate = 2007-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakeside Classics tradition began in 1903 by Thomas E. Donnelley, who was then the company president. The basic format of these books remained essentially the same since inception, as a hardcover, cloth wrapped and gold embossed. Subject matter tended to cover elements of American history. Many early volumes contained speeches and writings of noted Americans, including [[Benjamin Franklin]], whose [[autobiography]] was published as the first Lakeside Classic.

===Lakeside Classics===
[[RR Donnelly#Lakeside Classics|Lakeside Classics]] is a series started in 1903 that reprints neglected classic works. Thomas E. Donnelley, then president of the company, was impressed by a set of seven razors presented to him by one of the company's suppliers, and wanted to create a gift that would similarly represent his own company's product and could not be purchased on the open market.&lt;ref name="Levy " /&gt; The company did not sell the books to the public, but gave each of the company employees a copy at Christmas, making the series valued collectors items.&lt;ref name="Lakeside Classics" &gt;[http://www.rrdonnelley.com/about/lakeside-classics/ Lakeside Classics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Donnelley wrote in the introduction to ''[[Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]'', the first volume in the series, that  "If, in a modest way this volume conveys the idea that machine-made books are not a crime against art, and that books may be plain but good, and good though not costly, its mission has been accomplished."  Following volumes featured speeches and writings of noted Americans, then in the 1910s selections turned to first-person narratives of American history, especially those which were rare or out of print. Themes included the Civil War, the Old West, exploration and frontier life. In the 1990s, several changes were introduced. Partly to acknowledge the company's global markets, narratives by Americans abroad were included.&lt;ref name="Lakeside Classics" /&gt;

An early admirer wrote in 1923 that the printing, binding, and finishings were all done by the apprentice class to "illustrate the ideals of a well-made book," and that "not only are these books well made, but they contain historical works, autobiographies, and early travels unforgettable to him who loves this fair land." He concluded that the series is becoming "an institution near and dear to the collector of books of intrinsic value and beauty." {{sfnb|Bay|1923| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=UJg8AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA100&amp;dq=lakeside+press+history+volume+1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3p3SVJ_aA8LjsAT_q4G4BA&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=lakeside%20press%20history%20volume%201&amp;f=false 101]}}

Minor design changes were made occasionally and a major redesign every quarter century. In 1995, the date line on the title page was changed from "Christmas" to "December." For the redesign in 2003, [[Bruce Campbell (book designer)|Bruce Campbell]], known for his work on  [[The Library of America]], was engaged. Among other changes, the gold-framing on the cover was restored and the typeface was changed from [[Bulmer (typeface)|Bulmer]] to [[Garamond]] &lt;ref name="Levy "&gt;Susan Levy [http://www.caxtonclub.org/reading/2012/dec12.pdf The Lakeside Classics: A Christmas Gift that Keeps on Coming] ''The Caxtonian'' 20.12 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company did not keep detailed records on how many copies were printed. The preface to the 1935 volume says that the print run for the first volume was 1,500 copies, but no further information was included in later editions. In the 1970s printings were in the tens of thousands. The hardest volume to find is the 1904 ''Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents, Washington to Lincoln''. It is not known whether the run was smaller or whether collectors of Washington and Lincoln have kept them off the market by retaining them. The second scarcest is ''Fruits of Solitude'', which may have been easy to lose because it had the fewest number of pages. The difficulty of finding the volume ''Memorable Speeches'' led one family member to joke that the speeches were so unmemorable that everyone threw them out. The Chicago publisher Reilly &amp; Britton, a Chicago publisher, was given rights to reissue some of the earliest titles as “The Patriotic Classics.”&lt;ref name="Levy " /&gt;

By 2015, the series included 113 volumes.&lt;ref name="Lakeside Classics" /&gt;

Lakeside Classics were not sold to the public and only made available to RR Donnelley employees, clients and others associated with the company.&lt;ref name="lc001" /&gt; The week before Christmas, each employee was given one copy of that year's volume. As such, some of the volumes have become scarce, and are in demand on the collectors' market. [[Antiquarian]] bookstores often have a section devoted to Lakeside Classics, and early volumes command large sums from book collectors.&lt;ref name="lc001" /&gt;

==Research Areas==
Millstein is best known for her claim that within [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]], [[natural selection]] can be distinguished from [[Genetic drift|random genetic drift]] if both are properly understood as causal processes rather than outcomes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{ISBN|0199596271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0226668371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DOI 10.1007/s10539-004-1070-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/population-genetics Population Genetics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She is also known for the claim that natural selection is a population-level causal process &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fitness Fitness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DOI 10.1007/s10539-008-9137-7&lt;/ref&gt; but (in a paper co-authored with Robert A.

'''Ruth Westheimer''' (born June 4, 1928), better known as '''Dr. Ruth''', is a [[Germany|German]]-born, Jewish immigrant to the United States who became a fixture in late-night television and a major pop culture figure as a [[sex therapy|sex therapist]], media personality, and author. Her media career began in 1980 with the radio show, ''Sexually Speaking'', which continued until 1990. She also hosted at least five television shows on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] and other [[cable television]] from 1984 to 1993. She is also the author of approximately 40 [[book]]s on a variety of topics about [[sex]] and [[sexuality]].

==Early life and education==
Westheimer was born Karola Ruth Siegel on June 4, 1928, in [[Wiesenfeld (Karlstadt)|Wiesenfeld]] (near [[Karlstadt am Main]]), [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] Irma (née Hanauer), a housekeeper and Julius Siegel, a notions wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/westheimer-ruth|title=Ruth Westheimer|publisher=JWA.org|date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given an early grounding in [[Judaism]] by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in [[Frankfurt]], where they lived. In January 1939, she was sent to an orphanage in [[Switzerland]] by her mother and grandmother as part of the ''[[Kindertransport]]'' after her father had been taken by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].&lt;ref name="snopes-sniper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GAH"&gt;{{cite web|title=German-American Corner: Ruth Westheimer|url=http://www.germanheritage.com/biographies/mtoz/westheimer.html|website=www.germanheritage.com|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Dullea, Georgia.

October 26, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; She stopped receiving her parents' letters in September 1941. In 1945, Westheimer learned that her parents had been killed in [[the Holocaust]], possibly at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter-Survivors-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flax|first1=Peter|last2=Baum|first2=Gary|last3=Roxborough|first3=Scott|last4=Guthrie|first4=Marisa|last5=Lewis|first5=Andy|title=Hollywood's Last Survivors of the Holocaust share their stories|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/holocaust-survivors/dr_ruth_westheimer/|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. There, at 17, she "first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception." She later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Westheimer joined the [[Haganah]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Because of her diminutive height of {{height|ft=4|in=7|abbr=MOS}},&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; she was trained as a [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[sniper]].&lt;ref name="snopes-sniper"&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/medical/doctor/drruth.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Dr. Ruth Was a Sniper] by Barbara Mikkelson, March 1, 2007, Retrieved March 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this experience, she said, "I never killed anybody, but I know how to throw hand grenades and shoot."&lt;ref name="2013_usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jayson|first1=Sharon|title=Dr. Ruth, pushing age 85, still talking about sex.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/15/dr-ruth-westheimer-sex/2162073/|accessdate=March 25, 2017|publisher=''USA Today''|date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Westheimer was seriously wounded in action by an exploding [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] during the [[Israeli War of Independence]] in 1948, and it was several months before she was able to walk again.&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;Foreman, Tom (June 11, 2003).

In 1950, Westheimer moved to France, where she studied and then taught psychology at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1956, she [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated to the United States]], settling in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;"Morris, Bob.

==Early career==

After receiving her Ed.D., she briefly worked for [[Planned Parenthood]] and this experience encouraged her to continue studying [[human sexuality]]. She went on to work as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] for [[Helen Singer Kaplan]] at [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]].&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt; She continued to work there as an Adjunct Associate Professor for five years.

==Media career==
Dr. Ruth's media career began in 1980 when her radio show, ''Sexually Speaking'', debuted on [[WQHT#WYNY|WYNY-FM]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sterling|first1=Christopher H.|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of American Radio|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-415-99549-8|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mdQq-663faAC&amp;pg=PA423&amp;lpg=PA423&amp;dq=dr.+ruth+WYNY+1980#v=onepage&amp;q=dr.%20ruth%20WYNY%201980&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was offered this opportunity after she gave a lecture to New York broadcasters about the need for [[sex education]] programming to help deal with issues of [[contraception]] and unwanted pregnancies. Betty Elam, the community affairs manager at WYNY, was impressed with her talk and offered Westheimer [[United States dollar|$]]25 per week to make ''Sexually Speaking'', which started as a 15-minute show airing every Sunday at midnight.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff Writers|title=Dr. Ruth Westheimer Biography.|url=http://www.biography.com/people/dr-ruth-westheimer-9542073|website=Biography.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, her show was the top-rated radio show in the area, and in 1984, [[NBC Radio]] began [[Broadcast syndication|syndicating]] it nationwide, renaming the show to the ''Dr. Ruth Show''. She went on to produce her radio show until 1990.&lt;ref name="Makers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Dr. Ruth Westheimer.|url=http://www.makers.com/dr-ruth-westheimer|website=www.makers.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as the, "[[Sister Wendy]] of Sexuality", Dr. Ruth helped to revolutionize talk about sex and sexuality on radio and television, and she was noted for having, "an accent only a psychologist could love."&lt;ref name="Barron"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=James|title=ART/ARCHITECTURE; Some Things Never Age.

In 1984, Westheimer began hosting several television programs on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] TV network and one in syndication. Her first show was ''Good Sex! With Dr. Ruth Westheimer'', airing for a half hour at 10&amp;nbsp;pm on weeknights. This show was expanded in 1985 to a full hour and its name was changed to ''The Dr. Ruth Show''. In 1987, she began a separate half hour syndicated series on many broadcast stations called, ''Ask Dr. Ruth'', which was co-hosted by Larry Angelo. Dr. Ruth returned to the Lifetime network in 1988 with ''The All New Dr. Ruth Show'', which was followed in 1989 by two teen advice shows called ''What's Up, Dr. Ruth?'' and a call-in show, ''You're on the Air with Dr. Ruth'' in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Tim|last2=Marsh|first2=Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present|date=2007|publisher=Ballentine Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-345-49773-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq=dr.+ruth+lifetime+tv+show#v=onepage&amp;q=dr.%20ruth%20lifetime%20tv%20show&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Westheimer and Israeli TV host, Arad Nir, hosted a talk show in Hebrew, titled ''Min Tochnit'', on the newly opened Israeli Channel 2. The show was similar to her US ''Sexually Speaking'' show. The name of the show, ''Min Tochnit'', is a play of words: literally "Kind of a program", but "Min" (מין) in Hebrew also means "[[sex]]" and "[[gender]]".&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Min Tochnit|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332951/|website=IMDB|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, "Dr. Ruth", became a household name and she made guest appearances on several [[network television]] shows, including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=Michelle Andrea|last2=Kielwasser, Aldred P.|title=Gay People, Sex, and the Media|date=1991|publisher=The Haworth Press|location=New York City; London|isbn=0-86656-936-7|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y_Hd0F2J7LEC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=david+letterman+westheimer#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20letterman%20westheimer&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also made frequent appearances on the syndicated revival of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' that ran from 1986 to 1989. In the 1990s, Westheimer appeared as herself in [[Quantum Leap (season 5)|episode 89]] of ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'', the episode title being "Dr. Ruth". She appeared on [[Tom Chapin]]'s album ''This Pretty Planet'', in the song "Two Kinds of Seagulls", in which she and Chapin sing of various animals that reproduce sexually.  "It takes two to tingle", says the song. Dr. Ruth also appeared in several commercial advertisements, including a 1994 [[Honda Prelude]] ad, and an ad for [[Clairol]] [[Herbal Essences]] [[shampoo]] and body wash.&lt;ref name="prelude"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dr. Ruth pilots Prelude ad.|journal=''Advertising Age''|date=October 1994|volume=65|issue=42|page=45|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9410190935/dr-ruth-pilots-prelude-ad|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clairol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clairol Herbal Essences - Dr. Ruth (1990)|url=http://www.retrojunk.com/commercial/show/1653/clairol-herbal-essences-dr-ruth|website=www.retrojunk.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2007, Westheimer made regular appearances on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Television children's show ''[[Between the Lions]]'' as "Dr. Ruth Wordheimer" in a parody of her therapist role, in which she helps anxious readers and spellers overcome their fear of long words. In the January 2009, the 55th anniversary issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine includes Westheimer as #13 in the list of the 55 most important people in sex from the past 55 years.&lt;ref name="Geller"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geller|first1=Adam|title=At 84, legendary sex therapist Dr. Ruth still has lots to talk about.|url=http://www.masslive.com/living/index.ssf/2012/07/post_134.html|accessdate=March 25, 2017|publisher=''Masslive''|date=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, the play, ''Becoming Dr. Ruth'' opened Off Broadway. Actress [[Debra Jo Rupp]] played the role of Dr. Ruth. The play showcased the sex therapist's life from fleeing the Nazis in the Kindertransport and joining the [[Haganah]] in Jerusalem as a scout and sniper, to her struggles to succeed as a single mother coming to America.&lt;ref name="Rooney"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title=The Sex Therapist's Story, From Calamity to Cliché.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/theater/reviews/becoming-dr-ruth-with-debra-jo-rupp-at-westside-theater.html|accessdate=March 25, 2017|publisher=''New York Times''|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen DeSandre]] played Dr. Ruth in the Virginia Repertory Theatre production of ''Becoming Dr. Ruth''.&lt;ref name="Wren"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wren|first1=Celia|title=Virginia Rep production brings Dr. Ruth, and her story, to Richmond.|url=http://www.richmond.com/entertainment/theater/virginia-rep-production-brings-dr-ruth-and-her-story-to/article_403aceea-1446-54f6-8f37-5ce2a6bbafb7.html|accessdate=March 25, 2017|publisher=''Richmond Times-Dispatch''|date=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westheimer has delivered [[commencement speech]]es at the [[Hebrew Union College]] [[seminary]], [[Lehman College]] of the [[City University of New York]], and, in 2004, at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], where she has been awarded [[honorary degree]]s.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Jane|title=WORTH NOTING; Calling Dr. Ruth (To Speak at Trinity).|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/09/nyregion/worth-noting-calling-dr-ruth-to-speak-at-trinity.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 25, 2017|publisher=''New York Times''|date=May 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dr_ruth_dot_com"/&gt; She also taught courses and seminars at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale University|Yale]],&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; and was the guest speaker at the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in New York in commemoration of [[Yom HaShoah]] 2008. Westheimer spoke about her life story and the audience of 500 sang "[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]" in honor of her 80th birthday. At the ceremony she received an honorary Bronx High School of Science diploma. In 2002, she received the [[Leo Baeck Institute|Leo Baeck Medal]] for her humanitarian work promoting tolerance and [[social justice]].&lt;ref name="dr_ruth_dot_com"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Dr. Ruth Westheimer 2009.jpg|thumb|Dr. Ruth Westheimer in 2009.]]
Westheimer has been married three times.&lt;ref name="NatGeo" /&gt; She said that each of her marriages played an important role in her relationship advice, but after two divorces, it was her third marriage, to Manfred Westheimer, that was the "real marriage".&lt;ref name="2013_usatoday"/&gt; This lasted until his death in 1997. She has two children, Miriam and [[Joel Westheimer|Joel]], and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name="2013_usatoday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dr_ruth_dot_com"/&gt; In December 2014, Westheimer was a guest at an Orthodox Jewish wedding in the Bronx, NY. The groom, Rabbi Benjamin Goldschmidt, is the great-grandson of the woman who had helped rescue Westheimer from Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=Brawarsky&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brawarsky|first1=Sandee|title=Vows Taking Their Sweet Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/fashion/weddings/taking-their-time.html|accessdate=December 27, 2014|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She still lives in the "cluttered three-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights where she raised her two children and became famous, in that order."&lt;ref name="residence"&gt;{{cite news| author =Joanne Kaufman| title =Dr. Ruth Westheimer: Her Bedrooms Are Off Limits| quote =| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| date =November 29, 2013| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/realestate/dr-ruth-westheimer-her-bedrooms-are-off-limits.html| accessdate =July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite news| author =Vanita Salisbury| title =Dr. Ruth Has Seen the Play About Her Life More Than Fifteen Times| quote =| newspaper =[[New York (magazine)|New York]]| date = November 27, 2013| url =http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/dr-ruth-21-questions.html| accessdate = July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the two [[synagogue]]s she belongs to, the [[Jewish Community Center|YMHA]] she was president of for three years, and a "still sizable community of German Jewish World War II refugees", she remains in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Morris"/&gt; She speaks English, German, French, and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

'''School fundraising''' or '''school fund raising''' is the practice of raising money to support educational enrichment programs by schools or school groups mostly known from the [[United States]] (e.g., parent-teacher organizations, booster clubs, etc.). One of the most prevalent practices in the United States is product fundraising. Schools and other non-profits raise $1.7 billion each year by selling popular consumer items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrds.org/news_4_18_06.html Association of Fund-Raising Distributors and Suppliers (AFRDS)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603121526/http://www.afrds.org/news_4_18_06.html |date=June 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight out of 10 Americans support these types of programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrds.org/news_20070509_01.html Association of Fund-Raising Distributors and Suppliers (AFRDS)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603121648/http://www.afrds.org/news_20070509_01.html |date=June 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, schools and school groups such as their [[Parent Teacher Organization]] and [[Parent Teacher Association]] find many creative ways to raise funds—from bake sales, dinner events, auctions and school carnivals to more aggressive advertising, affinity programs, grant writing and straight forward donation requests.

== Product fundraisers ==
Product fundraising has its origins in the early 20th century.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The practice typically involves the purchase and re-sale of popular consumer products by a non-profit group whereupon the group sponsoring the sale keeps a portion of the gross sales. Products can be purchased in bulk and paid for in advance by the organization, then re-sold to supporters. Products may also be ordered using a catalog, order forms and other methods. Supporters pay for the product when the order is placed or upon final delivery. Under some product fundraising models, the school or non-profit organization is required to pay for a fixed number of products in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pedersen|first1=Jason|title=School Fundraising|url=http://www.schoolawards.net/school-fundraising/|publisher=SchoolAwards.net|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of product fundraisers that schools use to generate revenue. (1) Pre-sales Fundraising, (2) Product In-Hand Fundraising, (3) Online Fundraising, with online fundraising rising in popularity over the course of the past decade.

As of 2010, there are over a thousand fundraising companies in the United States offering their products and services to schools and their associated nonprofit parent teacher groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundraising-ideas.org/ Fundraising Companies Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past year, many changes have occurred in the school fundraising industry. A few online fundraising companies, like [[Piggybackr]], are now using [[social media]] web apps, such as Facebook and Twitter, to make online fundraising easier for schools and the parents and students who promote them. Additionally, Fundraising Software is also now available allowing a school to have their own platform that makes it easy to engage students, parents, faculty, donors, and alumni with compelling communication campaigns.

==Self-organized school fundraisers ==

Other school fundraisers that generate substantial revenue for schools include [[auction]]s and [[raffle]]s. With these types of fundraising activities, the school requests donations from local restaurants and businesses in their area, that are then offered at the event. In the case of an auction, people are allowed to bid on the dinner, limousine ride, or whatever was donated by the local businesses in the community. In the case of a raffle, people purchase raffle tickets that are then later picked randomly from a container. Often the donations are solicited by parents acting on behalf of the school, who make phone calls, write letters, or know of other parents who work for companies who may be willing to donate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundraising-ideas.org/DIY/ Fundraising Ideas &amp; Products Center - Do It Yourself Fundraising]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scrip fundraising==
Scrip fundraising offers an alternative to fundraisers that rely on selling products or raffle tickets. The scrip fundraising concept was pioneered by St. Vincent DePaul Parish in Petaluma CA in 1988, and quickly grew to a powerful fundraising method for schools across the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/2835321-181/following-the-scriphow-a-sr-based?page=3 Santa Rosa Press Democrat, "Following the Scrip: How an SR-Based Group Revolutionized the Hottest Method of School Fundraising"]&lt;/ref&gt;

With scrip fundraising, retailers offer gift cards (“scrip”, or “substitute money”) at a discount to non-profit organizations. The non-profit organizations then sell the gift cards to member families at full face value. The families redeem the gift cards at full face value, and the discount or rebate is retained by the non-profit organization as revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptotoday.com/pto-today-articles/article/1031-managing-your-scrip-program PTO Today, "Managing Your Scrip Program"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Lakes Scrip Center reports that more than 17,000 non-profit organizations have raised more than $500 million with scrip fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shopwithscrip.com/Support/about-us/our-company GLSC: About our Company]&lt;/ref&gt; Scrip fundraising differs from other school fundraising programs because there is no selling. Families do their normal household shopping at scrip retailers with scrip gift cards. A family that regularly does their shopping with scrip gift cards can easily raise $500 to $1000 or more per year. Participating schools use these funds for field trips, scholarships, tuition assistance or fee reductions.

One persistent and basic question has been whether or not any portion of the funds that are raised through a scrip program and applied to a family’s tuition account should be considered taxable income to the parent who purchases the scrip. According to Great Lakes Scrip Center, scrip is a reduction in purchase price from the face value, and is in effect a rebate from the retailer, and as such is not considered gross income.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shopwithscrip.com/N2Upload/tax_info/TaxMemo.pdf Overview of Scrip Tax Issues, Private Letter Ruling-118535-09 -]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shopwithscrip.com/Support/scrip-program-management/are-there-scrip-tax-implications-for-my-non-profit-organization "Are there scrip tax implications for my non-profit organization?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic pressures ==
Some parents and schools are now having to resort to extensive fundraising, including in one case having to raise $300,000 in six months to close budget gaps in order to keep Cordova Lane Elementary School in [[Sacramento]], [[California]] open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2010/02/10/2525715/as-school-funding-falls-fundraisers.html Sacramento Bee, Oct 3, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, general economic hardships can cause school fundraisers to earn less, as volunteer time is spread thin with more families requiring dual incomes. A survey done by national fundraising association in 2007 determined that on average the most labor-intensive school wide fundraisers, in terms of the number of volunteers needed is school carnivals, with an average of 59 volunteers needed. Other labor-intensive fundraisers included: auctions (28), "thons" such as walk-a-thons (22), breakfasts or dinners (17) and raffles (17). By contrast the least labor-intensive fundraisers for schools included: product fundraisers (7), direct donations (7), restaurant nights (6) and student portraits (2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundraising-newsletters.com/product-sales-out-perform-other-school-fundraisers.html Fundraising Newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey from the same source showed 71% of parents are "concerned and overwhelmed" with having to do more fundraisers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrds.org/fundraising_logistics.html#3 AFRDS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813133943/http://www.afrds.org/fundraising_logistics.html#3 |date=August 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Door-to-door fundraising and in hand product fundraising sales (out side local stores) has been a regular part of societal activities since the early 1970s. However, door-to-door sales came under scrutiny in 1997 following the murder of an 11-year-old New Jersey boy who was killed while fundraising unsupervised in his neighborhood. Due to this fundraisers do not allow kids to go door to door.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/09/nyregion/a-plan-to-ban-door-to-door-sales-by-schoolchildren-is-praised-by-educators.html?partner=rssnyt New York Times, Dec 9, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most product sales are made to parents, family members, co-workers, friends and close neighbors. The fundraising industry strongly discourages unsupervised door-to-door sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrds.org/fundraisingfaq.html#6 AFRDS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502062637/http://www.afrds.org/fundraisingfaq.html#6 |date=May 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Hard Knocks''' — or '''University of Hard Knocks''' — is an [[idiom]]atic phrase meaning the (sometimes painful) education one gets from life's usually negative experiences, often contrasted with [[formal education]]. The term is frequently misattributed to [[George Ade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=school+hard+knocks&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was actually coined by [[Elbert Hubbard]] in a piece he wrote on himself for [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=An Interesting Personality: Elbert Hubbard |magazine=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|The Cosmopolitan]] |page=317 |date=January 1902 |volume=XXXII |issue=3 |last=Hubbard |first=Elbert |quote=''So that is how I got my education, such as it is. I am a graduate of the University of Hard Knox, and I've taken several postgraduate courses.'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcNZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA317&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;dq=Cosmopolitan+%22elbert+hubbard%22+%22university+of+hard+knocks%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=px6XaQ0Cp_&amp;sig=RqS4AaSfUPBoYw1IVVXwoFcNU8k&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Cosmopolitan%20%22elbert%20hubbard%22%20%22university%20of%20hard%20knocks%22&amp;f=false |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/TheCosmopolitanNovember1901-April1902 |archivedate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Elbert Hubbard and his Critics |date=May 10, 1902 |page=638 |magazine=[[The Literary Digest]] |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/LiteraryDigest-1902may10-00638a02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2017}}

It is a phrase which is most-typically used by a person to claim a level of [[wisdom]] imparted by life experience, which should be considered at least equal in merit to [[academic]] knowledge. It is a response that may be given when one is asked about his or her education, particularly if they do not have an extensive formal education but rather life experiences that should be valued instead. It may also be used facetiously, to suggest that formal education is not of practical value compared with "street" experience. In the [[UK]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the phrases "University of Life" and "School of Hard Knocks" may be used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=1293018 NZ Herald - David Hill: Struggling for right meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, newspaperman [[James Franklin Comstock]] ("Jim" Comstock) founded the “University of Hard Knocks”, an honorary society with a mission to recognize people who have made a success of their life without the benefit of higher education. [[Alderson Broaddus College]] in [[Philippi, West Virginia]], USA, sponsored the organization, which moved its offices to the A-B campus in 1976. The society was dissolved in 2014.

'''Siviløkonom''' (literally "civil economist") is an [[academic degree]] issued within the field of [[business administration]] and a professional title in [[Norway]] (with corresponding titles in [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], see below under "See also"), obtained after 3 to 5 years of studies. The title is protected and can only be used by persons having met certain qualifications as directed by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]]. It is mainly offered by nine institutions after the completion of a [[Master of Science in Business Administration]].

Master of Science in Business Administration programs entitling the Siviløkonom in Norway are:
* [[Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences]] (HiOA) ([[Oslo]])
* [[Bodø Graduate School of Business]] ([[University of Nordland|UiN]]) ([[Bodø]])
* [[NHH|Norwegian School of Economics]] (NHH) ([[Bergen]])
* [[BI Norwegian Business School]] (BI) ([[Oslo]])
* [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] ([[Ås, Akershus|Ås]])
* [[Buskerud University College]] ([[Hønefoss]])
* [[Molde University College]] ([[Molde]])
* [[Trondheim Business School]] ([[Sør-Trøndelag University College|HiST]]) ([[Trondheim]])
* [[University of Agder]] ([[Kristiansand]])
* [[University of Stavanger]] ([[Stavanger]])
* [[University of Tromsø]] ([[Tromsø]])

Additionally, the title can be granted to candidates with foreign education meeting certain criteria, through application to the NHH. Due to changes in the Norwegian educational system, granting of the title based on foreign education will be phased out on 12/31/2008, and can through that date only be granted to persons who started their qualifying education prior to 1/1/2003.

==History==
Traditionally the siviløkonom degree was only offered at NHH in [[Bergen]], and was originally a two-year, then three-year program.  In 1975 it became a four-year business administration degree at the level equivalent to a [[cand.mag.]] degree. NHH had a monopoly on awarding the degree until 1985 when the Norwegian School of Management BI and the Bodø Graduate School of Business was allowed to offer the degree. After the [[Norwegian higher education quality reform|quality reform]] all institutions of higher education were allowed to issue the title to all master graduates, and the requirements for the degree increased from four to five years of study.

The SACS Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) accredits [[universities]] and [[college]]s in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Latin America (Extraterritorial).

Every six months, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges publishes an online report on its accreditation actions, including reaffirmations of accreditation and public sanctions of institutions of higher learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacscoc.org/ |title=Commission on Colleges |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports include specific public sanctions of schools and statements disclosing why those institutions have been placed on sanction.

The Commission on Colleges accredits both public and private institutions of higher education in the United States, including some [[community college]]s as well as four-year institutions. As a [[regional accreditation|regional accreditor]], SACSCOC accreditation extends to all of the educational programs offered at the accredited institution.

Institutions in Latin America accredited by SACSCOC include the Mexican universities of [[Fundación Universidad de las Américas, Puebla]]; [[Universidad de las Americas, A.C.]]; [[Universidad de Monterrey]]; [[Tecnológico de Monterrey]]; [[INCAE|Instituto Centroamericano de Administración de Empresas]] (INCAE or the Central American Institute of Business Administration) in Costa Rica and Nicaragua; and Keiser University Latin American Campus in Nicaragua. The SACSCOC has also accredited the [[American University in Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacscoc.org/pdf/webmemlist.pdf |title=Member, Candidate and Applicant List |publisher=Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges |date=January 2013 |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Council on Accreditation and School Improvement==
SACS CASI accredits over 13,000 [[primary school|primary]], [[middle school|middle]], and [[secondary school]]s, as well as [[school systems]] located in the SACS region.

'''''The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students''''' is a 1987 book by the philosopher [[Allan Bloom]]. In the book, Bloom criticizes the "openness" of [[relativism]], in academia and society in general, as leading [[paradox]]ically to the great "closing" referenced in the book's title. In Bloom's view, "openness" and absolute understanding undermine [[critical thinking]] and eliminate the "point of view" that defines cultures. Bloom's book became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback, but drew divided reactions from reviewers.

==Summary==
Bloom critiques the contemporary [[higher education in the United States|American university]] and how he sees it as failing its students, criticizing modern movements in [[philosophy]] and the [[humanities]]. Throughout the book, he attacks the "moral relativism" that he claims has taken over American universities for the barrier it constructs to the notions of truth, critical thinking, and genuine knowledge. Bloom claims that students in the 1980s have prioritized the immediate, blind relegation of prejudice as inferiority of thought, and therefore have "closed" their mind, as the title suggests, to asking the right questions, so that prejudice may be eradicated through logic and critical thinking, as opposed to empty, baseless instinct.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bloom writes, "Prejudices, strong prejudices, are visions about the way things are.&amp;nbsp;... Error is indeed our enemy, but it alone points to the truth and therefore deserves our respectful treatment. The mind that has no prejudices at the outset is empty."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=43}}

==="Students"===

In part one, titled "Students",{{sfnm |1a1=Bloom |1y=1987 |1p=45 |2a1=Dixon |2y=1987 |2p=348}} Bloom details how the young American mindset, the books, music, relationships, and other aspects of American [[popular culture]] contribute to the sanctimony of what he perceives to be dull, lazy minds in American universities today.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bloom contends that the "clean slate" with which students enter universities{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=47}} at first made them more susceptible to genuinely embracing the studies of philosophy and logic.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} But soon, because of "[t]he improved education of the vastly expanded middle class [that] weakened the family's authority",{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=59}} there came a "gradual stilling of the old political and religious echoes" in the students Bloom encountered later in his teaching career. He credits the narrowing and flattening of the American college experience to these phenomena.

Bloom then delves into what he believes is the "[[Great books|Great Books]]" dilemma. He believes that the "great books" of [[Western thought]] have been devalued as a source of wisdom—but more importantly, that "our students have lost the practice of and the taste of reading". Because of this, students are unable to derive their beliefs from evidence, from central texts, or any print source at all. Bloom contends that without an understanding of important older texts, such as [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' or [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', modern students lack any reference point with which they can critically think about or address current events. Students are instead left with vague and abstract ideas of "good" and "evil".

Bloom notes that the "addiction to music" he observes in modern students is unparalleled, and has been for centuries.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=68}} But even this, he says, contributes to the closing of the young American mind.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} He notes that fewer and fewer students have a surface level, let alone nuanced, understanding of [[classical music]], and that instead, "rock music is as unquestioned and un-problematic as the air the students breathe."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=69}} [[Pop music]], he believes, employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young and to persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when, in fact, they are being controlled by the money-managers whom successful performers like [[Mick Jagger]] quietly serve. He regards the ubiquity of overly sexual overtones in [[1980s in music#Rock|1980s rock music]] and what he perceives to be a subsequent corruption of young minds{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} as a signal of "parents' loss of control over the children's moral education at a time when no one else is seriously concerned with it."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=76}} Bloom's conclusion about the effects of music on education is that its oversexualization in the late 20th century{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} makes it "very difficult for [students] to have a passionate relationship with the art and thought that are the substance of liberal education, [since] [i]t only artificially induces the exaltation attached to the completion of the greatest endeavors&amp;nbsp;... like discovery of the truth."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|pp=79–80}} Students no longer seek pleasure from the pursuit of learning.

Bloom concludes in "Students" that because of the relationships students have with popular culture, their family, and their peers, they no longer come to university asking questions, seeking instruction, or with imagination.

==="Nihilism, American Style"===

Bloom titles the second part of the book "Nihilism, American Style".{{sfnm |1a1=Bloom |1y=1987 |1p=140 |2a1=Dixon |2y=1987 |2p=348}} He introduces in further detail the concept of "value relativism", mentioned previously only in the introduction. Value [[relativism]], he says, plagues most elite institutions of higher learning. For Bloom, this dissolved into [[nihilism]]. He notices that students follow the path of least resistance when developing their values.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} For students, he writes, "values are not discovered by reason, and it is fruitless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=143}} Ironically, when travelling this path without reason, Bloom opines, students still "adopt strong poses and fanatic resolutions."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=143}}

Philosophy professors involved in [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language analysis]] or [[logical positivism]] disregard important "humanizing" ethical and political issues and fail to pique the interest of students.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=378}} Literature professors involved in [[deconstructionism]] promote irrationalism and skepticism of standards of truth and thereby dissolve the moral imperatives which are communicated through genuine philosophy and which elevate and broaden the intellects of those who engage with these imperatives.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=379}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} To a great extent, Bloom's critique extends beyond the university to speak to the general crisis in American society.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} He draws analogies between the United States and the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn|Bloom|1987|pp=147–155}} The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought of [[John Locke]]—that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought—had led to this crisis. Bloom cites [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s actions of telling "modern man that he was free-falling in the abyss of nihilism",{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=143}} and continues to espouse Nietzsche's commentary that nihilism in our contemporary democracy stems from value relativism.

For Bloom, this created a void in the souls of Americans, into which demagogic radicals as exemplified by 1960s student leaders could leap.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} (Bloom made the comparison to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] brownshirts,{{sfn|Littleford|1988|p=169}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wolff |first=Robert Paul |author-link=Robert Paul Wolff |year=1987 |title=Review of ''The Closing of the American Mind'' by Allan Bloom |magazine=Academe |volume=73 |issue=5 |location=Washington |publisher=American Association of University Professors |page=65 |doi=10.2307/40250092 |issn=2162-5247}}&lt;/ref&gt; who once similarly filled the gap created in German society by the [[Weimar Republic]].) In the second instance, he argued, the higher calling of philosophy and reason understood as [[freedom of thought]], had been eclipsed by a pseudo-philosophy, or an [[ideology]] of thought. [[Relativism]] was one feature of [[modern liberalism in the United States#Philosophy|modern American liberal philosophy]] that had subverted the Platonic–Socratic teaching.

==="The University"===

Bloom contends that the failure of contemporary [[liberal education]] leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory. In "The University", he discusses how the environment in elite institutions has cultivated mere ambition over the search for truth. He says that proclaiming an affinity for reason does not alone define a university's worth, as the statement alone does not constitute true commitment to scholastic pursuits in the name of a greater truth.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} He contends that "the mere announcement of the rule of reason does not create the conditions for the full exercise of rationality".{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=251}} Universities serve as a reflection of the public and democracy at large.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Because of this, they are slave to public opinion (per [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]).{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=246}} The public opinion—which serves as the final gatekeeper and the final headsmen for any movements the university may actually try to implement to advance the pursuit of critical thinking.

Bloom also explains what he believes is the dichotomy between the "spirit of the university"{{sfn|Bloom|1987}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} and the university itself.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} "The philosophic life is not the university."{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=272}} He alludes to early philosophers, who, up until the nineteenth century, including [[Socrates]], who he firmly believes is "of the essence of the university", never once made use of such institutions at all.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=272}} Bloom posits that maybe, after all, free thought and commitment to a greater truth need not exist within the metaphorical four walls of a university.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} What matters instead, he says, what is "uniquely human", is the "philosophic experience".{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=273}}

Bloom also notices a trend in which students notice the devaluing of free thought in universities. He writes about students at [[Cornell University]], that "these students discerned that their teachers did not really believe that freedom of thought was necessarily a good and useful thing, that they suspected that all this was ideology protecting the injustices of our 'system'".{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=315}} Bloom asserts that American professors in the sixties "were not aware of what they no longer believed"{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=315}} and that this notion gravely endangered any capacity for progress towards free thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bloom insists that requiring from universities empty values like "greater openness", "less rigidity", and "freedom from authority" are only fashionable and do not have any substantive content.{{sfn|Bloom|1987|p=320}} And in the face of growing civil rights conflicts, universities have a duty to instead actively pursue the task of "opening American minds". It is not enough, Bloom contends, for universities to "not want trouble".{{sfn|Bloom|1987}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} It is not enough for universities to only hold reputation paramount in the face of campus disruption, and only in name espouse free thought and truth. This "unfortunate mixture of cowardice and moralism"{{sfn|Bloom|1987}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} will unseat the spirit of the university. Bloom concludes by reminding readers that the love of wisdom and truth must be kept alive in universities, particularly in this moment of world history.

His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher's modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence.

The art critic [[Roger Kimball]], writing in ''The New York Times'', called ''The Closing of the American Mind'' "an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today's intellectual and moral climate."&lt;ref name="Kimball 1987"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kimball |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Kimball |date=April 5, 1987 |title=The Groves of Ignorance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/books/the-groves-of-ignorance.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimball argues that Bloom's work should not be diminished publicly simply because it is not optimistic. Instead, he writes, "'The Closing of the American Mind' is essential reading for anyone concerned with the state of liberal education in this society. Its pathos, erudition and penetrating insight make it an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today's intellectual and moral climate."&lt;ref name="Kimball 1987"/&gt; He concludes that,
{{quote|Mr. Bloom paints a sobering if not, alas, entirely unfamiliar picture.&amp;nbsp;... [O]ne of the chief things to appreciate about "The Closing of the American Mind" is that its dominant stance is interrogative, not prescriptive. Everything problematic that the term modernity implies, all the doubts about the meaning of tradition, the legitimacy of inherited values, the point of preserving high culture—all this Mr. Bloom is perfectly cognizant of.&lt;ref name="Kimball 1987"/&gt;}}

Matt Feeney from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' also wrote in his article, "Allan Bloom's Guide to College", in 2012, that while Bloom's core arguments may have been diluted into trite conservative barbs directed at liberal educations, the essence of his argument remains true today, and his motives do too. He explains that by writing ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' "Bloom dangles the promise of an arousing and dangerous philosophical quest, which will take the student far from his (and his friends' and parents' and other professors') settled opinions about what is good and decent."&lt;ref name="Feeney 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Feeney |first=Matt |date=April 12, 2012 |title=Allan Bloom's Guide to College |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/allan-blooms-guide-to-college |work=The New Yorker |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Bloom's impact on this era of politics, Feeney suggests a reframe in the way consumers perceive Bloom's work. Feeney writes,
{{quote|Bloom's light, urgent prose makes it easy to forget how audacious this chapter is in its depth, breadth, and seriousness, and how defiant it is in its defense of liberal education. Bloom's knee-jerk opponents tend to be leftists, but these people are merely symptoms of a deeper modern distrust of liberal learning. It might be better, then, to reframe Bloom's project, from a secretly erotic quest for sublime knowledge to an existentially urgent battle for nonconformity; real weirdness in a world that wants to co-opt everything, make everything productive for and comprehensible to everyone.&lt;ref name="Feeney 2012"/&gt;}}

The [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] writer [[Norman Podhoretz]] embraced Bloom's argument, noting that the closed-mindedness in his title refers to the paradoxical consequence of the academic "open mind" found in liberal political thought—namely "the narrow and intolerant dogmatism" that dismisses any attempt, by Plato or the [[Hebrew Bible]] for example, to provide a rational basis for moral judgments. Podhoretz continued, "Bloom goes on to charge liberalism with vulgarizing the noble ideals of freedom and equality, and he offers brilliantly acerbic descriptions of the sexual revolution and the feminist movement, which he sees as products of this process of vulgarization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Podhoretz |first=Norman |author-link=Norman Podhoretz |year=1987 |title=Conservative Book Becomes a Best-Seller |work=Human Events |volume=47 |issue=28 |location=Washington |pages=5–6 |issn=0018-7194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom's work was also supported by a larger conservative movement. In 2005, [[Jim Sleeper]] wrote for ''The New York Times'' that "nothing prepared [conservatives'] movement, or the academic and publishing worlds, for the wildfire success of [the book].&amp;nbsp;... Conservatives championed Bloom then, of course, and they invoke him still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sleeper |first=Jim |author-link=Jim Sleeper |date=September 4, 2005 |title=Allan Bloom and the Conservative Mind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/books/review/allan-bloom-and-the-conservative-mind.html |url-access=limited |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1989 article, Ann Clark Fehn discussed the critical reception of the book, noting that it had eclipsed other titles that year dealing with higher education (''College'' by [[Ernest L. Boyer]] and ''Cultural Literacy'' by [[E.&amp;nbsp;D. Hirsch]]), and quoting ''Publishers Weekly'', which had described Bloom's book as a "bestseller made by reviews".{{sfn|Fehn|1989|p=384}} The poet [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]] described ''The Closing of the American Mind'' as, "The most thoughtful conservative analysis of the nation's cultural sickness."{{sfn|Turner|1995|p=277}}

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] called ''The Closing of the American Mind'' "the first shot in the culture wars", writing of Bloom that she was "confident that in the long run he will be vindicated and his critics swallowed in obscurity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paglia |first=Camille |author-link=Camille Paglia |date=July 22, 1997 |title=Ask Camille |url=http://www.salon.com/july97/columnists/paglia2970722.html |work=Salon.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991128143344/http://www.salon.com/july97/columnists/paglia2970722.html |archive-date=November 28, 1999 |access-date=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative===

In her review, [[Martha Nussbaum]] questioned whether Bloom deserved to be considered a philosopher.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2012|p=45}} The criticism of the book was continued by impassioned reviews by [[Benjamin Barber]] in ''[[Harper's]]'';&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; by the [[Nietzschean]] scholar {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=of ancient philosophy}} [[Alexander Nehamas]] in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'';&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt;{{sfn|Thompson|2010|p=181}} and by [[David Rieff]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; [[David Rieff]] called Bloom "an academic version of Lieut. Col. [[Oliver North|Oliver L. North]]: vengeful, reactionary, antidemocratic."&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; The book, he said, was one that "decent people would be ashamed of having written."&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt; The tone of these reviews led [[James Atlas]] in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' to conclude "the responses to Bloom's book have been charged with a hostility that transcends the usual mean-spiritedness of reviewers."&lt;ref name="Atlas 1988"/&gt;

[[William Greider]] wrote for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that there were two main reasons for the roaring commercial success of Bloom's work. The first, he says, is purely due to the "impassioned quality of Bloom's prose. The professor's rhetoric is laced with high-blown discourses on his great-books heroes and his enemies list&amp;nbsp;... The average reader is undoubtedly flattered by Bloom's intellectual name-dropping; it's always fun to be high-minded about someone else's ignorance."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Greider |first=William |author-link=William Greider |date=October 8, 1987 |title=Bloom and Doom: 'The Closing of the American Mind' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bloom-and-doom-19871008 |work=Rolling Stone |location=New York |issn=0035-791X |access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second reason Greider credits Bloom's success to is simply timing. He writes that "the book's appearance coincides with a surge of national concern about the disappearance of traditional education. Another current best seller, ''Cultural Literacy'', by E.D. Hirsch Jr., also taps the same anxieties."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ultimately, Greider concludes that Bloom's agenda is simply vicious attack on the values of young America. He writes,
{{quote|Bloom's real agenda is much darker—to launch a nasty, reactionary attack on the values of young people and everyone else under forty. His multi-count indictment is a laundry list of cheap slanders made to sound vaguely authoritative, because, after all, Bloom is a teacher who supposedly hangs out with students. In fact, Bloom sounds bewildered by young people—and strangely out of touch with them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}
For Greider, it is unfathomable how Bloom could devile the decline in prejudice and relegate that decline to a lack of imagination. He concludes, "Bloom apparently detests the young."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The linguist and philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] dismissed Bloom's book as "mind-bogglingly stupid" for "basically saying&amp;nbsp;... you just march the students through a canon of 'great thoughts' that are picked out for everybody" when "the effect of that is that students will end up knowing and understanding virtually nothing."{{sfn|Chomsky|2002|p=233}}

===Legacy===

The jurist [[Richard Posner]] compared Bloom's book to Paglia's ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990), finding both books to be examples of "difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public."{{sfn|Posner|2001|p=103}} Thus, since publication, ''The Closing of the American Mind'', fueled many impassioned debates about the state of culture in America. One prominent retaliation{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} came from the American historian [[Lawrence W. Levine]], whose book was titled ''The Opening of the American Mind''.{{sfn|Levine|1996}} According to ''The New York Times''{{'}} [[Edward Rothstein]], Levine's work, published ten full years later, still found it relevant to "praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised."&lt;ref name="Rothstein 1997"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rothstein |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Rothstein |date=May 27, 1997 |title=As Culture Wars Go on, Battle Lines Blur a Bit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/27/arts/as-culture-wars-go-on-battle-lines-blur-a-bit.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed it, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, "many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread."&lt;ref name="Rothstein 1997"/&gt; Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do "with current political demarcations."&lt;ref name="Rothstein 1997"/&gt;

Jerry Aaron Snyder of ''[[The New Republic]]'', however, argues that the [[culture war]]s, which Bloom's work clearly helped spark a conversation about, will consistently be relevant. While it may be argued that ''The Closing of the American Mind'' may not resign itself to a political party, this does not preclude it from the impact it had on the culture wars, and how those culture wars shape life today. Snyder argues that books like Bloom's have inspired further conversations and controversies alike, such as controversy surrounding how history is taught in high schools, or the effectiveness of [[affirmative action]] or [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Snyder |first=Jeffrey Aaron |date=April 23, 2015 |title=America Will Never Move beyond the Culture Wars |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/121627/war-soul-america-history-culture-wars-review |work=The New Republic |location=New York |access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Snyder, the discussions spawned by the initial culture wars in the 1980s because of books like Bloom's, "'the soul of America' is a bottomless well. For better or worse, it will never run dry."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education''''' is a former [[academic journal]], now an online [[magazine]], for [[African American]]s working in [[academia]] in the United States.

'''The Sphere College Project''' is a project to create a high-quality, financially accessible educational institution for adults. It was founded in April 2009 in [[Phoenixville]], [[Pennsylvania]] to provide education to adults who do not fit the prevailing model of higher education. The Sphere College Project is not currently a degree-granting institution.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Joel [http://spherecollege.org/ChronicleMay2011.pdf ''It's His Very Own College, and Welcome to It''], Chronicle of Higher Education, May 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, Leeann [http://www.phoenixvillenews.com/articles/2010/01/09/news/srv0000007282222.txt?viewmode=fullstory ''A new learning environment offered at Sphere College''], The Phoenix, January 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, Michael, ''Sphere College: Rising from the Ashes in Phoenixville?'', Yoga Living Magazine, March/April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational philosophy ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2015}}
The educational philosophy of The Sphere College Project is influenced by other experimental institutions, including Black Mountain College and Hampshire College, and incorporates elements of [[self-organization]]. The underlying principle behind the organizational structure of the institution is that no one individual is capable of having sufficient knowledge of the system to completely design it beforehand. The institution reacts to its needs in real-time and must provide sufficient infrastructure to ensure progress toward the common goal, embodied in the mission statement. Since students process information in different ways, the institution must adjust to support their individual learning styles. The philosophy is based on the following disciplines, including the sciences (human/computer interaction; digital communication networks; digital gaming); the arts; and the humanities.

== Program of study ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2015}}
The program of study proposed by The Sphere College Project proceeds in three phases:

* In Phase I, ''Self and Other'', students embark upon a journey to acquire a deeper understanding of themselves, and to develop their understanding of how similarly and differently people experience the world: to discover what motivates the beliefs and actions of humanity. This is accomplished primarily through reading, discussing and writing about works of literature and philosophy and their relationship to contemporary issues and the students’ own experiences. It also involves activities in the arts, sciences and humanities. In this phase students will seek to identify the direction of their future studies.
* Phase II, ''Tool Acquisition'', involves the acquisition of interdisciplinary knowledge and skills to support and implement the student’s goals.
* In Phase III, ''Action'', students draw upon their continually-developing knowledge to put their passion into action by implementing a project that is a good fit for the student.

Movement through the phases will proceed according to the schedule of the student. The Sphere College Project is not currently a degree-granting institution. It may, in the future, award degrees and seek accreditation.

A '''vortex ring toy''' is any of several [[toy]]s that generate [[vortex ring]]s – rolling torus-shapes of fluid, similar in structure to [[smoke ring]]s – that move through the fluid (most often air, and sometimes water).

Because of the way they rotate, a vortex ring can hold itself together and travel for quite a distance. Toys that blow air vortices, like the [[air vortex cannon]], are mainly used to tickle people or animals at a distance with an "invisible hand". An interesting demonstration is to have a smoker blow a smoke cloud into the toy just before firing, to create a large smoke ring.  Some toys have a built-in smoke generator for this purpose.
