The '''A528''' is a route on the [[United Kingdom|UK]] highway network that runs from [[Marchwiel]], near [[Wrexham]], in [[North Wales]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.0225|-2.9597|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A528 road (northern end)}}),}} to [[Shrewsbury]], [[Shropshire]], in [[England]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.7128|-2.7512|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A528 road (southern end)}}).}} On the way it passes through [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]] and [[Coton Hill, Shropshire|Coton Hill]]. The road follows an old route that was Turnpiked in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Paul|title=A watching brief on the A5124 Battlefield Link Road, Shrewsbury|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-1016-1/dissemination/pdf/A5124_BATTLIFIELD_LINK_RD.pdf|website=archaeologydataservice.ac.uk|publisher=ADS|accessdate=6 February 2017|page=4|language=en|format=PDF|date=November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
The road starts {{convert|4|km|order=flip}} south east of Wrexham at Marchwiel by a junction on the [[A525 road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|title =Wrexham &amp; Llangollen|map =256|date =2015|scale =1:25,000 |series =Explorer |publisher =Ordnance Survey|isbn = 9780319244524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It heads due south through Cock Bank and [[Overton Bridge]] before combining with the A539 road and going eastwards through the village of Overton-on-Dee.

It then heads south east through to Ellesmere, where it shares a small section of road with the [[A495 road|A495]], before heading south through Crosemere, [[Harmer Hill]], [[Albrighton, Shrewsbury|Albrighton]] and intersecting with the [[A5124 road|A5124]] at Harlescott north east of Shrewsbury.

The final short section into Shrewsbury goes over the [[Shrewsbury-Chester line|Shrewsbury-Chester]] railway line and intersects with the [[A5191 road (Great Britain)|A5191]] in Shrewsbury town centre. A small stub going northwards only (due to the one-way system in Shrewsbury) starts off the [[A458 road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|title =Collins Britain Big Road Atlas 2009|year =2008|scale =1:200,000|publisher =Collins Bartholomew|page =88|isbn =978-0-00-727240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
The A528 is one of Wales' most riskiest and dangerous routes. It is third behind the A44 and the A5 for the number of road casualties per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owen|first1=Cathy|title=The most dangerous roads in Wales revealed|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/most-dangerous-roads-wales-revealed-10056959|accessdate=6 February 2017|work=walesonline|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adams Glacier''' ({{coord|78|7|S|163|38|E|type:glacier_region:AQ|display=inline,title}}) is a small [[glacier]] immediately south of [[Miers Glacier]] in [[Victoria Land]]. The heads of Adams and Miers glaciers, both located in the [[Miers Valley]], are separated by a low ridge, and the east end of this ridge is almost completely surrounded by the snouts of the two glaciers, which nearly meet in the bottom of the [[valley]], about {{convert|1|mi}} above [[Lake Miers]], into which they drain. It was named by the [[New Zealand Northern Survey Party]] of the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] (1956–58) after Lieutenant (later Sir) [[Jameson Adams]], second in command of the shore party of the [[Nimrod Expedition|British Antarctic Expedition]] (1907–09), who was one of the men to accompany [[Ernest Shackleton]] to within {{convert|97|mi|km}} of the [[South Pole]].

'''Aperiodic frequency''' is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of incidence or occurrence of non-[[Periodic function|cyclic]] phenomena, including random processes such as [[radioactive decay]]. It is expressed in [[units of measurement]] of [[reciprocal seconds]] (s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=3UGQsi6VamwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mechatronic Systems, Sensors, and Actuators: Fundamentals and Modeling|last=Lombardi|first=Michael A.|date=2017-07-28|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=9781420009002|editor-last=Bishop|editor-first=Robert H.|location=Austin|pages=18-1|language=en|chapter=Fundamentals of Time and Frequency}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the case of radioactivity, [[becquerels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Units with special names and symbols; units that incorporate special names and symbols|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section2-2-2.html|journal=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI)|edition=8th|volume=Section 2.2.2|pages=|via=|Section=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is defined as a [[ratio]], ''f'' = ''N''/''T'', involving the number of times an [[Event (philosophy)|event]] happened (''N'') during a given time [[Time|duration]] (''T''); it is a [[physical quantity]] of type [[temporal rate]].

'''Arensky Glacier''' ({{coord|71|39|S|72|15|W|type:glacier_region:AQ_source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is an [[Antarctic]] [[glacier]], lying {{convert|3|mi|0}} east of [[Alyabiev Glacier]] and flows south from [[Beethoven Peninsula]], [[Alexander Island]], into the north end of [[Boccherini Inlet]]. The glacier was named by the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] in 1987, after [[Anton Arensky]], the Russian composer.

The '''Arges project''' was a research project in the field of [[Metal-halide lamp|metal-halide lamps]], a form of [[electric lighting]]. The aim was to achieve a higher degree of energy efficiency in comparison to lamps used at the time. The project was commissioned by [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] and [[Philips Electronics]]. One of the problems which had to be solved was to let the experimental lamps burn reliably and constantly. Scientists believed that this problem was related to gravity, and to ascertain this experiments had to be performed in zero gravity. Therefore, part of the research took place aboard the [[International Space Station]] ISS during the [[Delta Mission]] in 2004. Dutch astronaut [[André Kuipers]] operated the apparatus transported to the ISS aboard the [[Soyuz TMA-4]].

An '''astatic system''' comprises two equal and parallel magnetic needles, but with their [[Magnet#Pole naming conventions|polarities]] reversed. This arrangement protects the system from the influence of the [[terrestrial magnetic field]], as the [[magnetisms]] of the two needles cancel each other out. Because of this phenomenon, astatic needles were often used in [[galvanometer]]s.

Portland '''Bowers Basebed''' is a type of [[limestone]] from [[Bowers Quarry]] at the [[Isle of Portland]] in [[Dorset]], southern [[England]], on the [[Jurassic Coast]], a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="federation-stone"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stonefed.org.uk/index.php?page=portland-bowers-basebed | title=Portland Bowers Basebed | publisher=Federation Stone Great Britain| accessdate=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone is clear of fossils and is the cleanest of the [[Portland stone]] types. Bowers Basebed, which is quarried by Albion Stone, has a maximum bed height of 1.95 metres. It is known for being highly durable and being able to withstand the effects of weathering.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

Bowers Basebed was used to construct "7–10 [[Old Bailey]]", in the city of [[London]].{{fact|date=April 2013}}

A '''chief science officer''' ('''C.S.O.''') is a position at the head of scientific research operations at organizations or companies performing significant scientific research projects.

==Description==
A C.S.O. typically is responsible for envisioning and developing research capabilities (human, methodological, and technological), for developing evidence of the validity and utility of research products, and for communicating with the scientific and customer communities concerning capabilities and scientific product offerings. 

In some organizations, the same person may hold this title along with that of [[chief technology officer]] (C.T.O.). Alternatively, a company could have one or the other, or both occupied by separate people. Often, C.S.Os exists in heavily research-oriented companies, while C.T.Os exists in [[product development]] focused companies. The typical category of [[research and development]] that exists in many science and technology companies can be led by either post, depending upon which area is the organization's primary focus. 

A C.S.O. almost always has a pure science background and an advanced degree, whereas a C.T.O. often has a background in engineering or business development.

Some academic research organizations, such as the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Chase Cancer Center News {{!}} Fox Chase Cancer Center - Philadelphia, PA|url=http://www.fccc.edu/news/2008/2008-07-28-Jeff-Boyd.html|website=www.fccc.edu|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research - Dana-Farber Cancer Institute {{!}} Boston, MA|url=http://www.dana-farber.org/res/scientificreport/message-from-chief-scientific-officer.html|website=www.dana-farber.org|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] have adopted a similar title of C.S.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael L. Norman Appointed Chief Scientific Officer of SDSC|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/supercomputer/06-08MichealNorman.asp|website=ucsdnews.ucsd.edu|accessdate=1 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, their role is to evaluate and set scientific priorities and coordinate the administrative structure that supports scientists. A C.S.O. commonly has a scientific or academic background, yet they may or may not be practicing scientists or academics.

==England==

In the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], the C.S.O. is the head of profession for the 53,000 [[Healthcare science|healthcare scientists]] working in the organization and its associated bodies. The C.S.O. is one of six NHS professional officers (including the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|chief medical officer]] and the [[Chief Nursing Officer|chief nursing officer]]) who are employed within [[NHS England]]. These roles lead their own professional groups as well as providing expert knowledge about their specific disciplines to the NHS and wider health and care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/appointments/ |title=Appointments |publisher=NHS England |accessdate=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411073747/http://www.england.nhs.uk/appointments/ |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C.S.O. provides professional leadership and expert clinical advice across the health system, as well as working alongside senior clinical leaders within NHS England and the broader commissioning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/02/11/nhs-commissioning-board-appoints-its-first-chief-scientific-officer/ |title=NHS Commissioning Board appoints its first Chief Scientific Officer |publisher=Department of Health |date = 11 February 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The C.S.O. is also responsibility for delivering the government's strategy for a modernised healthcare science workforce, [[Modernising Scientific Careers]].

[[Professor Sue Hill|Professor Dame Sue Hill]] has been the C.S.O. since October 2002 first within the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|department of health]] and subsequently NHS England .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Aboutus/Chiefprofessionalofficers/Chiefscientificofficer/DH_63 |title=Chief Scientific Officer |publisher=Department of Health |accessdate=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was strengthened in March 2013, with the appointment of a deputy C.S.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/03/25/dr-fiona-carragher-appointed-deputy-chief-scientific-officer-by-nhs-commissioning-board/ |title=Fiona Carragher appointed Deputy Chief Scientific Officer by NHS Commissioning Board |publisher=Department of Health |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130123162412/http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/03/25/dr-fiona-carragher-appointed-deputy-chief-scientific-officer-by-nhs-commissioning-board/ |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26492">A '''classical field theory''' is a [[physical theory]] that predicts how one or more [[field (physics)|physical fields]] interact with matter through '''field equations'''. The term 'classical field theory' is commonly reserved for describing those physical theories that describe [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravitation]], two of the [[fundamental force]]s of nature. Theories that incorporate quantum mechanics are called [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]].

A physical field can be thought of as the assignment of a [[physical quantity]] at each point of [[space]] and [[time]]. For example, in a weather forecast, the wind velocity during a day over a country is described by assigning a vector to each point in space.  Each vector represents the direction of the movement of air at that point, so the set of all wind vectors in an area at a given point in time constitutes a [[vector field]].  As the day progresses, the directions in which the vectors point change as the directions of the wind change.  

The first field theories, [[Newtonian gravitation]] and [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetic fields were developed in classical physics before the advent of [[relativity theory]] in 1905, and had to be revised to be consistent with that theory.   Consequently, classical field theories are usually categorized as ''non-relativistic'' and ''relativistic''. Modern field theories are usually expressed using the mathematics of [[tensor calculus]].  A more recent alternate mathematical formalism describes classical fields as sections of mathematical objects called [[fiber bundle]]s .

In 1839 [[James MacCullagh]] presented field equations to describe [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]] in "An essay toward a dynamical theory of crystalline reflection and refraction".&lt;ref&gt;[[James MacCullagh]] (1839) [https://archive.org/stream/collectedworks00maccuoft#page/144/mode/2up An essay toward a dynamical theory of crystalline reflection and refraction], ''Transactions, [[Royal Irish Academy]] 21&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-relativistic field theories ==

Some of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. Historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with [[Michael Faraday|Faraday's]] [[lines of force]] when describing the [[electric field]]. The [[gravitational field]] was then similarly described.

===Newtonian gravitation===

The first [[field theory (physics)|field theory]] of gravity was [[Newton's theory of gravitation]] in which the mutual interaction between two [[mass]]es obeys an [[inverse square law]]. This was very useful for predicting the motion of planets around the Sun.

Any massive body ''M'' has a [[gravitational field]] '''g''' which describes its influence on other massive bodies. The gravitational field of ''M'' at a point '''r''' in space is found by determining the force '''F''' that ''M'' exerts on a small [[test mass]] ''m'' located at '''r''', and then dividing by ''m'':&lt;ref name="kleppner85"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|first1=David|last2=Kolenkow|first2=Robert|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Stipulating that ''m'' is much smaller than ''M'' ensures that the presence of ''m'' has a negligible influence on the behavior of ''M''.

According to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], '''F'''('''r''') is given by&lt;ref name="kleppner85" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{G M m}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unit vector]] pointing along the line from ''M'' to ''m'', and ''G'' is Newton's [[gravitational constant]]. Therefore, the gravitational field of '''M''' is&lt;ref name="kleppner85" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})}{m} = -\frac{G M}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to [[equivalence principle#Tests of the weak equivalence principle|unprecedented levels of accuracy]] leads to the identification of the gravitational field strength as identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the [[equivalence principle]], which leads to [[general relativity]].

For a discrete collection of masses, ''M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', located at points, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the gravitational field at a point '''r''' due to the masses is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r})=-G\sum_i \frac{M_i(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_i})}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_i|^3} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

If we have a continuous mass distribution ''ρ'' instead, the sum is replaced by an integral,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r})=-G \iiint_V \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x})d^3\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x}|^3} \, , &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the direction of the field points from the position '''r''' to the position of the masses '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;; this is ensured by the minus sign. In a nutshell, this means all masses attract.

In the integral form [[Gauss's law for gravity]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\iint\mathbf{g}\cdot d \mathbf{S} = -4\pi G M&lt;/math&gt;

while in differential form it is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot\mathbf{g} = -4\pi G\rho_m &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the gravitational field '''g''' can be written in terms of the [[gradient]] of a [[gravitational potential]] φ('''r'''):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = -\nabla \phi(\mathbf{r}).&lt;/math&gt;
This is a consequence of the gravitational force '''F''' being [[conservative field|conservative]].

=== Electromagnetism ===

==== Electrostatics ====
{{Main article|Electrostatics}}

A [[test charge|charged test particle]] with charge ''q'' experiences a force '''F''' based solely on its charge. We can similarly describe the [[electric field]] '''E''' so that {{nowrap|'''F''' {{=}} ''q'''''E'''}}. Using this and [[Coulomb's law]] the electric field due to a single charged particle is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The electric field is [[conservative field|conservative]], and hence is given by the gradient of a scalar potential, ''V''('''r''')

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = -\nabla V(\mathbf{r}) \, . &lt;/math&gt;

[[Gauss's law]] for electricity is in integral form

:&lt;math&gt;\iint\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{S} = \frac{q_e}{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

while in differential form

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot\mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

==== Magnetostatics ====
{{Main article|Magnetostatics}}

A steady current ''I'' flowing along a path ''ℓ'' will exert a force on nearby charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by ''I'' on a nearby charge ''q'' with velocity '''v''' is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}),&lt;/math&gt;
where '''B'''('''r''') is the [[magnetic field]], which is determined from ''I'' by the [[Biot–Savart law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int \frac{d\boldsymbol{\ell} \times d\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]], '''A'''('''r'''):
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

[[Gauss's law]] for magnetism in integral form is

:&lt;math&gt;\iint\mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{S} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

while in differential form it is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot\mathbf{B} = 0.  &lt;/math&gt;

The physical interpretation is that there are no [[magnetic monopole]]s.

==== Electrodynamics ====
{{Main article|Electrodynamics}}

In general, in the presence of both a charge density ρ('''r''', ''t'') and current density '''J'''('''r''', ''t''), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and both will vary in time. They are determined by [[Maxwell's equations]], a set of differential equations which directly relate '''E''' and '''B''' to the electric charge density (charge per unit volume) ''ρ'' and [[current density]] (electric current per unit area) '''J'''.&lt;ref name="griffiths326"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, one can describe the system in terms of its scalar and vector potentials ''V'' and '''A'''. A set of integral equations known as ''[[retarded potential]]s'' allow one to calculate ''V'' and '''A''' from ρ and '''J''',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is contingent on the correct choice of [[gauge fixing|gauge]]. ''φ'' and '''A''' are not uniquely determined by ''ρ'' and '''J'''; rather, they are only determined up to some scalar function ''f''('''r''', ''t'') known as the gauge. The retarded potential formalism requires one to choose the [[Lorenz gauge]].&lt;/ref&gt; and from there the electric and magnetic fields are determined via the relations&lt;ref name="wangsness469"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wangsness|first=Roald|title=Electromagnetic Fields|edition=2nd|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = -\nabla V - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Hydrodynamics===
{{Main article|Hydrodynamics}}Fluid dynamics has fields of pressure, density, and flow rate that are connected by conservation laws for energy and momentum. The mass continuity equation is a continuity equation, representing the conservation of mass

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}  + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] represent the conservation of momentum in the fluid, found from Newton's laws applied to the fluid,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial}{\partial t} (\rho \mathbf u) + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + p \mathbf I) = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho \mathbf b &lt;/math&gt;

if the density ''ρ'', pressure ''p'', [[deviatoric stress tensor]] '''τ''' of the fluid, as well as external body forces '''b''', are all given. The [[velocity field]] '''u''' is the vector field to solve for.

==Potential theory==

The term "[[potential theory]]" arises from the fact that, in 19th century physics, the fundamental forces of nature were believed to be derived from [[scalar potential]]s which satisfied [[Laplace's equation]]. Poisson addressed the question of the stability of the planetary [[orbit]]s, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation from the perturbation forces, and derived the [[Poisson's equation]], named after him. The general form of this equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi = \sigma &lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' is a source function (as a density, a quantity per unit volume) and φ the scalar potential to solve for.

In Newtonian gravitation; masses are the sources of the field so that field lines terminate at objects that have mass. Similarly, charges are the sources and sinks of electrostatic fields: positive charges emanate electric field lines, and field lines terminate at negative charges. These field concepts are also illustrated in the general [[divergence theorem]], specifically Gauss's law's for gravity and electricity. For the cases of time-independent gravity and electromagnetism, the fields are gradients of corresponding potentials

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = - \nabla \phi_g \,,\quad \mathbf{E} = - \nabla \phi_e &lt;/math&gt;

so substituting these into Gauss' law for each case obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi =  4\pi G \rho_g \,, \quad \nabla^2 \phi = - {\rho_e \over \epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[mass density]] and ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' the [[charge density]].

Incidentally, this similarity arises from the similarity between [[Newton's law of gravitation]] and [[Coulomb's law]].

In the case where there is no source term (e.g. vacuum, or paired charges), these potentials obey [[Laplace's equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For a distribution of mass (or charge), the potential can be expanded in a series of [[spherical harmonics]], and the ''n''th term in the series can be viewed as a potential arising from the 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-moments (see [[multipole expansion]]). For many purposes only the monopole, dipole, and quadrupole terms are needed in calculations.

== Relativistic field theory ==
{{Main article|Covariant classical field theory}}

Modern formulations of classical field theories generally require [[Lorentz covariance]] as this is now recognised as a fundamental aspect of nature. A field theory tends to be expressed mathematically by using [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]s. This is a function that, when subjected to an [[action principle]], gives rise to the [[field equations]] and a [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] for the theory. The [[action (physics)|action]] is a Lorentz scalar, from which the field equations and symmetries can be readily derived.

Throughout we use units such that the speed of light in vacuum is 1, i.e. ''c'' = 1.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is equivalent to choosing units of distance and time as light-seconds and seconds or light-years and years. Choosing ''c'' = 1 allows us to simplify the equations. For instance, ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reduces to ''E'' = ''m'' (since ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, without keeping track of units). This reduces complexity of the expressions while keeping focus on the underlying principles. This "trick" must be taken into account when performing actual numerical calculations.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lagrangian dynamics ===
{{Main article|Lagrangian (field theory)}}

Given a field tensor ''φ'', a scalar called the [[Lagrangian density]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\phi,\partial\phi,\partial\partial\phi, \ldots ,x)&lt;/math&gt;

can be constructed from ''φ'' and its derivatives.

From this density, the action functional can be constructed by integrating over spacetime,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} = \int{\mathcal{L}\sqrt{-g}\, \mathrm{d}^4x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as the 'jacobian' in curved spacetime. &lt;math&gt;(g\equiv \text{det}(g_{\mu\nu}))&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Lagrangian itself is equal to the integral of the Lagrangian density over all space.

Then by enforcing the [[Action (physics)|action principle]], the Euler–Lagrange equations are obtained

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta\phi}=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi} -\partial_\mu  \left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\phi)}\right)+ \cdots +(-1)^m\partial_{\mu_1} \partial_{\mu_2} \cdots \partial_{\mu_{m-1}} \partial_{\mu_m} \left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_{\mu_1} \partial_{\mu_2}\cdots\partial_{\mu_{m-1}}\partial_{\mu_m} \phi)}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Relativistic fields ==

Two of the most well-known Lorentz-covariant classical field theories are now described.

=== Electromagnetism ===
{{Main article|Electromagnetic field|Electromagnetism}}
Historically, the first (classical) field theories were those describing the electric and magnetic fields (separately). After numerous experiments, it was found that these two fields were related, or, in fact, two aspects of the same field: the [[electromagnetic field]].  [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electromagnetism]] describes the interaction of charged matter with the electromagnetic field. The first formulation of this field theory used vector fields to describe the [[electric]] and [[magnetic]] fields. With the advent of special relativity, a more complete formulation using [[tensor]] fields was found. Instead of using two vector fields describing the electric and magnetic fields, a tensor field representing these two fields together is used.

The [[electromagnetic four-potential]] is defined to be ''A&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = (-''φ'', '''A'''), and the [[four-current|electromagnetic four-current]] ''j&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = (-''ρ'', '''j'''). The electromagnetic field at any point in spacetime is described by the antisymmetric (0,2)-rank [[electromagnetic field tensor]]

:&lt;math&gt;F_{ab} = \partial_a A_b - \partial_b A_a.&lt;/math&gt;

==== The Lagrangian ====

To obtain the dynamics for this field, we try and construct a scalar from the field. In the vacuum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4\mu_0}F^{ab}F_{ab}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

We can use [[gauge field theory]] to get the interaction term, and this gives us

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4\mu_0}F^{ab}F_{ab} + j^aA_a\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==== The equations ====

To obtain the field equations the electromagnetic tensor in the Lagrangian density needs to be replaced by its definition in terms of the 4-potential ''A'', and its this potential which enter the Euler-Lagrange equations. The EM field ''F'' is not varied in the EL equations. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_b\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_b A_a\right)}\right)=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial A_a} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the field components

:&lt;math&gt;\partial\mathcal{L}/\partial A_a = \mu_0 j^a  \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the derivatives of the field components

:&lt;math&gt;\partial\mathcal{L}/\partial(\partial_b A_a) = F^{ab} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

obtains [[Maxwell's equations]] in vacuum. The source equations (Gauss' law for electricity and the Maxwell-Ampère law) are

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_b F^{ab}=\mu_0 j^a \, . &lt;/math&gt;

while the other two (Gauss' law for magnetism and Faraday's law) are obtained from the fact that ''F'' is the 4-curl of ''A'', or, in other words, from the fact that the [[bianchi identity]] holds for the electromagnetic field tensor.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BianchiIdentities.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;6F_{[ab,c]} \, = F_{ab,c} + F_{ca,b} + F_{bc,a} = 0.  &lt;/math&gt;

where the comma indicates a [[partial derivative]].

===Gravitation===

{{Main article|Gravitation|General Relativity|Einstein field equation}}

After Newtonian gravitation was found to be inconsistent with [[special relativity]], [[Albert Einstein]] formulated a new theory of gravitation called [[general relativity]]. This treats [[gravitation]] as a geometric phenomenon ('curved [[spacetime]]') caused by masses and represents the [[gravitational field]] mathematically by a [[tensor field]] called the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. The [[Einstein field equations]] describe how this curvature is produced. [[Newtonian gravitation]] is now superseded by [[Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], in which [[gravitation]] is thought of as being due to a curved [[spacetime]], caused by masses. The Einstein field equation describes how this curvature is produced by masses,

:&lt;math&gt;G_{ab} = \kappa T_{ab} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''κ'' = ''8πG/c''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is a constant which appears in the [[Einstein field equation]]s (and not the action), and

:&lt;math&gt;G_{ab} \, =R_{ab}-\frac{R}{2}g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Einstein tensor]]. An alternate interpretation, due to [[Arthur Eddington]], is that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is fundamental, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is merely one aspect of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is forced by the choice of units.

The vacuum solution can be obtained by varying the following [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] with respect to the metric

:&lt;math&gt; S[g]=k  \int R \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x &lt;/math&gt;

The ''[[vacuum field equations]]'' are the field equations written without matter (including sources). Solutions of the vacuum field equations are called [[vacuum solution]]s. The field equations may be derived by using the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]. Varying the Lagrangian

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = R \sqrt{-g} \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' = ''R&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[Ricci scalar]] written in terms of the [[Ricci tensor]] ''R&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''g'' the [[determinant]] of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] ''g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'' will yield the vacuum field equations

:&lt;math&gt;G_{ab}  =0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

==Unification attempts==
{{Main article|Classical unified field theories}}
Attempts to create a unified field theory based on [[classical physics]] are classical unified field theories. During the years  between the two World Wars, the idea of unification of [[gravity]] with [[electromagnetism]] was actively pursued by several mathematicians and physicists like [[Albert Einstein]], [[Theodor Kaluza]]&lt;ref name=kal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaluza |first=Theodor |authorlink= |date=1921 |title=Zum Unitätsproblem in der Physik |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsber. Preuss. Akad. Wiss.]] Berlin. (Math. Phys.) |volume= |issue= |pages=966–972 |issn= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Hermann Weyl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weyl, H. |title=Gravitation und Elektrizität |journal=Sitz. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. |year=1918 |pages=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Arthur Eddington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Eddington, A. S. |title=The Mathematical Theory of Relativity, 2nd ed. |publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press |year=1924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; , [[Gustav Mie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mie, G. |title=Grundlagen einer Theorie der Materie |journal=Ann. Phys. |year=1912 |volume=37 |pages=511–534 |doi=10.1002/andp.19123420306 |issue=3|bibcode = 1912AnP...342..511M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ernst Reichenbacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reichenbächer, E. |title=Grundzüge zu einer Theorie der Elektrizität und der Gravitation |journal=Ann. Phys. |year=1917 |volume=52 |pages=134–173 |doi=10.1002/andp.19173570203 |issue=2|bibcode = 1917AnP...357..134R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts to create such theory were based on incorporation of [[electromagnetic fields]] into geometry of [[general relativity]]. In 1918, the case for the first
geometrization of the electromagnetic field was proposed in 1918 by Hermann Weyl.&lt;ref name=Tilman&gt;{{Citation| last  = Sauer| first = Tilman| author-link = Sauer Tilman| chapter = Einstein’s Unified Field Theory Program| date = May 2014| editor1-last  = Janssen| editor1-first = Michel | editor2-last  = Lehner| editor2-first = Christoph | title  = The Cambridge Companion to Einstein| volume = | publisher = Cambridge University Press| publication-date = May 2014| isbn = 9781139024525}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1919, an idea of five-dimensional approach suggested by [[Theodor Kaluza]].&lt;ref name=Tilman/&gt; From that, a theory called [[Kaluza-Klein Theory]] was developed. It attempts to unify [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]], in a five-dimensional [[space-time]].
There are several ways of extending the representational framework for a unified field theory which have been considered by Einstein and other researchers. These extensions in general are based in two options.&lt;ref name=Tilman/&gt; The first option is based in relaxing the conditions imposed on the original formulation, and the second is based in introduction other mathematical objects into the theory.&lt;ref name=Tilman/&gt; An example of the first option is relaxing the restrictions to four-dimensional space-time by considering higher-dimensional representations.&lt;ref name=Tilman/&gt; That is used in [[Kaluza-Klein Theory]]. For the second, the most prominent example arises from the concept of the [[affine connection]] that was introduced into [[General relativity|the theory of general relativity]] mainly through the work of [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] and [[Hermann Weyl]].&lt;ref name=Tilman/&gt; 

Further development of [[quantum field theory]] changed the focus of searching for unified field theory from classical to quantum description. Because of that, many theoretical physicists gave up looking for a classical unified field theory.&lt;ref name=Tilman/&gt; Quantum field theory would include unification of other two [[Fundamental interactions|fundamental forces of nature]], [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]] which act on subatomic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gadzirayi Nyambuya|first1=Golden|title=Unified Field Theory – Paper I, Gravitational, Electromagnetic, Weak &amp; the Strong Force|journal=Apeiron|date=October 2007|volume=14|issue=4|page=321|url=http://redshift.vif.com/JournalFiles/V14NO4PDF/V14N4GAD.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Boer|first1=W.|title=Grand unified theories and supersymmetry in particle physics and cosmology|journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics|date=1994|volume=33|pages=201–301|url=http://www-ekp.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~deboer/html/Lehre/Susy/deboer_review3.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2017|arxiv=hep-ph/9402266|bibcode=1994PrPNP..33..201D|doi=10.1016/0146-6410(94)90045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report '''''A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture'''''&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. 2007. [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/assessment/ ''Water for Food, Water for Life, A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture'']. London: Earthscan, and Colombo: [[International Water Management Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2007 by [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[Earthscan]] in an attempt to answer the question: how can [[water]] in [[agriculture]] be developed and managed to help end [[poverty]] and [[hunger]], ensure environmentally sustainable practices, and find the right balance between food and environmental security?

==History==
Compiled after consultation with more than 700 individuals, numerous organisations and networks, it was the first critical evaluation of: 
* the benefits, costs and impacts of the past 50 years of [[water development]]
* [[water management]] challenges facing communities today 
* successful methods of managing water in farming around the world.
The assessment confirmed that [[agriculture]] [[water consumption|consumes more water resources]] than any other sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5269296.stm ''Map details global water stress''], BBC, 21 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A key finding was that a third of the [[world population|world's population]] live in water-scarce areas. More than 1.2 billion live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], lacking water resources. Parts of [[Water restrictions in Australia|Australia]] and the [[Environmental issues in the United States|United States]] suffer in this way. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas of [[economic water scarcity]], where there is insufficient human capacity or financial resources for people to effectively make use of water that is available. Here, [[sub-Saharan Africa]] is a good example; there is water in the rivers but no [[dam]]s or pumps to enable people to use it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/assessment/files_new/newsroom/AlertNet_World_2006.pdf ''World water demand surging due to rising population''], Alister Doyle, Reuters, 18 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends affecting demands for water==
The report's authors forecast that the need for water would double within 50 years, due to [[human overpopulation|global population rise]], more people choosing to eat a diet of [[meat consumption|meat]] and vegetables rather than primarily consuming cereals, and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/assessment/files_new/newsroom/NewYorkTimes_Need_2006.pdf ''Need for Water Could Double in 50 Years, U.N. Study Finds''], New York Times, August 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, about one litre of liquid water gets converted to water vapour to produce one [[calorie]] of food. We each consume between 2,000 and 5,000 liters of water every day, depending on our diet and how the [[food]] is produced. This is far more than the two to five litres we drink every day. A heavy meat diet requires much more than a vegetarian diet, because water is used to grow food for the animals as well as being used directly to support the livestock. [[Economic growth]] fuels changes in diets; for example, per capita meat demand in China has quadrupled over the last 30 years, and milk and egg products are becoming increasingly popular in India. [[urbanization|Growing cities]], expanding industry and [[biofuel]]s are increasingly competing for water with an [[agricultural expansion|expanding agriculture]].

==How feeding the future world will be possible==
[[File:Corn pivot irrigated.jpg|thumb|right|[[Irrigation]] water management in a [[maize]] field]]
The conclusion made by the report's authors was that only by changing the way we use water within agriculture would we be able to meet the acute water, environment and poverty challenges facing us over the next 50 years. They suggested that with wise policies and investments in irrigation, upgrading [[rainfed agriculture]], and trade it would be possible to limit future growth in water withdrawals to 13% and the expansion of cultivated land to 9%. However, the effects of [[climate change]] and the increased use of [[biofuels]] would complicate matters, making actions necessary to 
address these. The Assessment found the greatest potential lay in rainfed areas of the world housing the highest number of poor people. Upgrading these rainfed lands through better water management held the greatest potential to increase productivity and decrease poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/assessment/files_new/newsroom/ScienceDaily_2007.pdf Water Management: Urgent Need For More Food With Less Water], Science Daily, March 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The technology would not necessarily need to be complex; simple measures such as catching water in huge tubular plastic bags and storing roof and road run-off could double or even triple food production in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia, effectively increasing productivity from each raindrop by that amount.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Coughlan, [http://www.allbusiness.com/environment-natural-resources/natural-resources/15097788-1.html Catch every drop to fight world hunger], ''New Scientist'', August 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shaping future water policy==
The report recommended eight policy actions:
* Change the way we think about water and agriculture. [[Rain]] should be viewed as the ultimate source of water to be managed, and agriculture as part of an [[agro-ecosystem]] that provides food but also delivers other environmental services, such as maintaining [[soil fertility]].
* Fight poverty by improving access to agricultural water and its use. This would be achieved by promoting livelihood gains by smallholder farmers, for example by securing water access through rights and developing [[multiple-use water supply system]]s.
* Manage agriculture to enhance [[ecosystem services]]. This would involve using good agricultural practices to enhance other ecosystem services.
* Increase the productivity of water. The outcome would be higher yields and value from smaller volumes of water, thus reducing demand and environmental impacts.
* Upgrade [[rainfed agriculture]] by improving soil moisture and using supplemental [[irrigation]]. This holds the greatest potential for lifting people out of poverty and increasing water productivity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
* Adapt yesterday's irrigation for tomorrow's needs. Modernisation would require a mix of technological and management upgrades.
* Reform the reform process, targeting state institutions. Water managements investments should embrace irrigated and [[rainfed agriculture]], plus [[fisheries]] and livestock practices.
* Deal with trade-offs and make difficult choices. Informed multi-stakeholder negotiations would be essential.

The '''Mid-Scale Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument''' ('''DESI''') is a new instrument for conducting a spectrographic [[Astronomical survey|survey]] of distant [[galaxies]].  Its main components are a focal plane containing 5000 fiber-positioning robots, and a bank of [[spectrograph]]s which are fed by the fibers.  The new instrument will enable an experiment to probe the expansion history of the Universe and the mysterious physics of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="desiTDR"&gt;{{cite web

The instrument is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy [[Office of Science]] and currently under construction.  It will be located at 6880&amp;nbsp;ft. on the [[Mayall Telescope]] on top of [[Kitt Peak]] in the Sonoran Desert 55 miles distant from Tucson, Arizona.

== Science goals ==
The [[metric expansion of space|expansion history]] and [[large-scale structure of the Universe]] is a key prediction of [[cosmological model]]s, and DESI observations will permit scientists to probe diverse aspects of cosmology, from dark energy to [[alternatives to General Relativity]] to [[neutrino]] masses to the early Universe. The data from DESI will be used to create three-dimensional maps of the distribution of matter covering an unprecedented volume of the Universe with unparalleled detail. This will provide insight into the nature of dark energy and establish whether cosmic acceleration is due to a cosmic-scale modification of General Relativity. DESI will be transformative in the understanding of dark energy and the expansion rate of the Universe at early times, one of the greatest mysteries in the understanding of the physical laws.

DESI will measure the expansion history of the Universe using the [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) imprinted in the clustering of galaxies, quasars, and the intergalactic medium.&lt;ref name="seo/eisenstein"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seo |first=Hee-Jong |last2=Eisenstein |first2=Daniel J. |date=2003 |title=Probing Dark Energy with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations from Future Large Galaxy Redshift Surveys |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/598/2/720/pdf/58322.web.pdf |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=598 |issue=2 |pages=720–740 |arxiv=astro-ph/0307460 |doi=10.1086/379122 |bibcode=2003ApJ...598..720S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BAO technique is a robust way to extract cosmological distance information from the clustering of matter and galaxies. It relies only on very large-scale structure and it does so in a manner that enables scientists to separate the acoustic peak of the BAO signature from uncertainties in most systematic errors in the data.  BAO was identified in the 2006 Dark Energy Task Force report as one of the key methods for studying dark energy.&lt;ref name="albrecht/etal"&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=Report of the Dark Energy Task Force |last=Albrecht |first=Andreas |display-authors=etal |eprint=astro-ph/0609591 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In May 2014, the High-Energy Physics Advisory Panel, a federal advisory committee, commissioned by the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) endorsed DESI.&lt;ref name="P5 Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.energy.gov/~/media/hep/hepap/pdf/May-2014/FINAL_P5_Report_053014.pdf |title=Building for Discovery: Strategic Plan for U.S. Particle Physics in the Global Context |date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 3D map of the Universe ==
The [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] method requires a three-dimensional map of distant galaxies and quasars created from the angular and redshift information of a large statistical sample of cosmologically distant objects.  By obtaining spectra of distant galaxies it is possible to determine their distance, via the measurement of their spectroscopic redshift, and thus create a 3-D map of the Universe.&lt;ref name="SDSS/Eisenstein"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large-Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=633 |issue=2 |pages=560 |last=Eisenstein |first=Daniel |display-authors=etal |arxiv=astro-ph/0501171 |date=2005 |bibcode=2005ApJ...633..560E |doi=10.1086/466512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3-D map of the large-scale structure of the Universe also contains more information about dark energy than just the BAO and is sensitive to the mass of the neutrino and parameters that governed the primordial Universe. During its five-year survey beginning in September 2019, the DESI experiment will observe 35 million galaxies and quasars.&lt;ref&gt;http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/08/09/3-d-galaxy-mapping-project-enters-construction-phase/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instrument design ==
The DESI instrument will implement a new highly multiplexed optical spectrograph on the Mayall Telescope.&lt;ref name="levi/etal"&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=The DESI Experiment |last=Levi |first=Michael |display-authors=etal |eprint=1308.0847 |date=4 August 2013 |class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A new optical corrector design creates a very large, 8.0 square degree field of view on the sky, which combined with the new focal plane instrumentation will weigh approximately 20,000&amp;nbsp;lbs. The focal plane accommodates 5,000 small computer controlled fiber positioners on a 10.4 millimeter pitch. The entire focal plane can be reconfigured for the next exposure in less than two minutes while the telescope slews to the next field.

The instrument fabrication is managed by the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]].  Construction on the new instrument started in 2015.&lt;ref name="desinewscd2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Preuss |first=Paul |date=2015-09-21 |title=DESI, an Ambitious Probe of Dark Energy, Achieves its Next Major Milestone |url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2015/09/21/desi-cd2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Funding is provided by the Department of Energy [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] of the U.K., by the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], by the Heising-Simons Foundation, and by collaborating institutions worldwide.

'''Derain''' is a [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] named after 
[[André Derain]], a French artist, painter, sculptor and co-founder of [[Fauvism]] with [[Henri Matisse]]. It has uncommonly dark material within and surrounding the crater. The material is darker than the neighboring terrain such that this crater is easily identified even in a distant global image of Mercury. The dark halo may be material with a mineralogical composition different from the majority of Mercury’s visible surface. Craters with similar dark material on or near their rims were seen on the floor of the Caloris basin during ''[[MESSENGER]]''’s first flyby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=227 MESSENGER: MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8638">In the theory of [[stochastic processes]], the '''filtering problem''' is a mathematical model for a number of state estimation problems in [[signal processing]] and related fields. The general idea is to establish a "best estimate" for the true value of some system from an incomplete, potentially noisy set of observations on that system.  The problem of optimal non-linear filtering (even for the non-stationary case) was solved by [[Ruslan L. Stratonovich]] (1959,&lt;ref&gt;Stratonovich, R. L. (1959). ''Optimum nonlinear systems which bring about a separation of a signal with constant parameters from noise''. Radiofizika, 2:6, pp. 892-901.&lt;/ref&gt; 1960&lt;ref&gt;Stratonovich, R.L. (1960). ''Application of the Markov processes theory to optimal filtering''. Radio Engineering and Electronic Physics, 5:11, pp.1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;), see also [[Harold J. Kushner]]'s work &lt;ref&gt;Kushner, Harold. (1967). Nonlinear filtering: The exact dynamical equations satisfied by the conditional mode. Automatic Control, IEEE Transactions on Volume 12, Issue 3, Jun 1967 Page(s): 262 - 267&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Moshe Zakai]]'s, who introduced a simplified dynamics for the unnormalized conditional law of the filter&lt;ref&gt;Zakai, Moshe (1969), On the optimal filtering of diffusion processes. Zeit. Wahrsch. 11  230–243. {{MR|242552}}, {{Zbl|0164.19201}}, {{doi|10.1007/BF00536382}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[Zakai equation]].  The solution, however, is infinite-dimensional in the general case.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mireille Chaleyat-Maurel]] and Dominique Michel. Des resultats de non existence de filtre de dimension finie. Stochastics, 13(1+2):83-102, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain approximations and special cases are well understood: for example, the linear filters are optimal for Gaussian random variables, and are known as the [[Wiener filter]] and the [[Kalman-Bucy filter]]. More generally, as the solution is infinite dimensional, it requires finite dimensional approximations to be implemented in a computer with finite memory. A finite dimensional approximated [[nonlinear filter]] may be more based on heuristics, such as the [[Extended Kalman Filter]] or the Assumed Density Filters,&lt;ref&gt;Maybeck, Peter S., Stochastic models, estimation, and control, Volume 141, Series Mathematics in Science and Engineering, 1979, Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; or more methodologically oriented such as for example the Projection Filters,&lt;ref&gt;Damiano Brigo, Bernard Hanzon and François LeGland, A Differential Geometric approach to nonlinear filtering: the Projection Filter, I.E.E.E. Transactions on Automatic Control Vol. 43, 2 (1998), pp 247--252.&lt;/ref&gt; some sub-families of which are shown to coincide with the Assumed Density Filters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Damiano Brigo]], [[Bernard Hanzon]] and [[François Le Gland]], Approximate Nonlinear Filtering by Projection on Exponential Manifolds of Densities, Bernoulli, Vol. 5, N. 3 (1999), pp. 495--534&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, if the [[separation principle]] applies, then filtering also arises as part of the solution of an [[optimal control]] problem. For example, the [[Kalman filter]] is the estimation part of the optimal control solution to the [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] problem.

==The mathematical formalism==

Consider a [[probability space]] (Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;'''P''') and suppose that the (random) state ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of a system of interest at time ''t'' is a [[random variable]] ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; given by the solution to an [[Kiyoshi Itō|Itō]] [[stochastic differential equation]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} Y_{t} = b(t, Y_{t}) \, \mathrm{d} t + \sigma (t, Y_{t}) \, \mathrm{d} B_{t},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'' denotes standard ''p''-dimensional [[Brownian motion]], ''b''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the drift field, and ''σ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;times;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is the diffusion field. It is assumed that observations ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (note that ''m'' and ''n'' may, in general, be unequal) are taken for each time ''t'' according to

:&lt;math&gt;H_{t} = c(t, Y_{t}) + \gamma (t, Y_{t}) \cdot \mbox{noise}.&lt;/math&gt;

Adopting the Itō interpretation of the stochastic differential and setting

:&lt;math&gt; Z_{t} = \int_{0}^{t} H_{s} \, \mathrm{d} s,&lt;/math&gt;

this gives the following stochastic integral representation for the observations ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} Z_{t} = c(t, Y_{t}) \, \mathrm{d} t + \gamma (t, Y_{t}) \, \mathrm{d} W_{t},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' denotes standard ''r''-dimensional [[Brownian motion]], independent of ''B'' and the initial condition ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''c''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  and ''γ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;times;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;  satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\big| c (t, x) \big| + \big| \gamma (t, x) \big| \leq C \big( 1 + | x | \big)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''t'' and ''x'' and some constant ''C''.

The '''filtering problem''' is the following: given observations ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t'', what is the best estimate ''Ŷ''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; of the true state ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; of the system based on those observations?

By "based on those observations" it is meant that ''Ŷ''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[measurable function|measurable]] with respect to the [[sigma algebra|''&amp;sigma;''-algebra]] ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; generated by the observations ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''. Denote by ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''(''Z'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') be collection of all '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-valued random variables ''Y'' that are square-integrable and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;-measurable:

:&lt;math&gt;K = K(Z, t) = L^{2} (\Omega, G_{t}, \mathbf{P}; \mathbf{R}^{n}).&lt;/math&gt;

By "best estimate", it is meant that ''Ŷ''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; minimizes the mean-square distance between ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; and all candidates in ''K'':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \left[ \big| Y_{t} - \hat{Y}_{t} \big|^{2} \right] = \inf_{Y \in K} \mathbf{E} \left[ \big| Y_{t} - Y \big|^{2} \right]. \qquad \mbox{(M)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic result: orthogonal projection==

The space ''K''(''Z'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') of candidates is a [[Hilbert space]], and the general theory of Hilbert spaces implies that the solution ''Ŷ''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; of the minimization problem (M) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}_{t} = P_{K(Z, t)} \big( Y_{t} \big),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''K''(''Z'',''t'')&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[orthogonal projection]] of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) onto the [[linear subspace]] ''K''(''Z'',&amp;nbsp;''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;''G''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, it is a general fact about [[conditional expectation]]s that if ''F'' is any sub-''σ''-algebra of Σ then the orthogonal projection

:&lt;math&gt;P_{K} : L^{2} (\Omega, \Sigma, \mathbf{P}; \mathbf{R}^{n}) \to  L^{2} (\Omega, F, \mathbf{P}; \mathbf{R}^{n})&lt;/math&gt;

is exactly the conditional expectation operator '''E'''[·|''F''], i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;P_{K} (X) = \mathbf{E} \big[ X \big | F \big].&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}_{t} = P_{K(Z, t)} \big( Y_{t} \big) = \mathbf{E} \big[ Y_{t} \big | G_{t} \big].&lt;/math&gt;

This elementary result is the basis for the general Fujisaki-Kallianpur-Kunita equation of filtering theory.

'''FoldX''' is a [[Molecular design software|protein design]] algorithm that uses an empirical [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]].  It can determine the energetic effect of point [[mutations]] as well as the [[interaction energy]] of [[protein]] complexes (including Protein-[[DNA]]). FoldX can mutate protein and DNA side chains using a probability-based [[Rotamer#Protein rotamer libraries|rotamer library]], while exploring alternative conformations of the surrounding side chains.

== Applications ==
* Prediction of the effect of point mutations or human [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] on protein stability or protein complexes
* Protein design to improve stability or modify affinity or specificity
* [[Homology modeling]]

== The FoldX force field ==
The energy function includes terms that have been found to be important for protein stability, where the energy of [[Protein folding|unfolding]] (∆G) of a target protein is calculated using the equation:

∆G = ∆G&lt;sub&gt;vdw&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆G&lt;sub&gt;solvH&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆G&lt;sub&gt;solvP&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆G&lt;sub&gt;hbond&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆G&lt;sub&gt;wb&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆G&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆S&lt;sub&gt;mc&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆S&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;
 
Where ∆G&lt;sub&gt;vdw&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of the [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] contributions of all atoms with respect to the same interactions with the solvent. ∆G&lt;sub&gt;solvH&lt;/sub&gt; and ∆G&lt;sub&gt;solvP&lt;/sub&gt; is the difference in [[solvation]] energy for apolar and polar groups, respectively, when going from the unfolded to the folded state. ∆Ghbond is the free energy difference between the formation of an intra-molecular [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bond]] compared to inter-molecular [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bond]] formation (with solvent). ∆G&lt;sub&gt;wb&lt;/sub&gt; is the extra stabilizing free energy provided by a water molecule making more than one [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bond]] to the protein (water bridges) that cannot be taken into account with non-explicit solvent approximations. ∆G&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; is the electrostatic contribution of charged groups, including the [[Alpha helix|helix]] dipole.  ∆S&lt;sub&gt;mc&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[entropy]] cost for fixing the backbone in the folded state. This term is dependent on the intrinsic tendency of a particular [[amino acid]] to adopt certain dihedral angles. ∆S&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt; is the entropic cost of fixing a side chain in a particular conformation. The energy values of ∆G&lt;sub&gt;vdw&lt;/sub&gt;, ∆G&lt;sub&gt;solvH&lt;/sub&gt;, ∆G&lt;sub&gt;solvP&lt;/sub&gt; and ∆G&lt;sub&gt;hbond&lt;/sub&gt; attributed to each atom type have been derived from a set of experimental data, and ∆S&lt;sub&gt;mc&lt;/sub&gt; and ∆S&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt; have been taken from theoretical estimates. The [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] contributions are derived from vapor to water energy transfer, while in the protein we are going from solvent to protein.

For protein-protein interactions, or protein-DNA interactions  FoldX calculates ∆∆G of interaction :

∆∆G&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆G&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;- (∆G&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆G&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) + ∆G&lt;sub&gt;kon&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆S&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;

∆G&lt;sub&gt;kon&lt;/sub&gt; reflects the effect of electrostatic interactions on the k&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;. ∆S&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt; is the loss of translational and rotational entropy upon making the complex.

== Key features ==
* ''RepairPDB'': [[energy minimization]] of a [[protein structure]]
* ''BuildModel'': in silico [[Site-directed mutagenesis|mutagenesis]] or homology modeling with predicted energy changes
* ''AnalyseComplex'': interaction energy calculation
* ''Stability'': prediction of free energy changes between alternative structures
* ''AlaScan'': in silico [[alanine scan]] of a protein structure with predicted energy changes
* ''SequenceDetail'': per residue free energy decomposition into separate energy terms (hydrogen bonding, Van der Waals energy, electrostatics, ...)

== Graphical interface ==
Native FoldX is run from the [[command line]]. A FoldX plugin for the [[Yasara|YASARA]] molecular graphics program has been developed to access various FoldX tools inside a graphical environment. The results of e.g. in silico [[mutations]] or [[homology modeling]] with FoldX can be directly analyzed on screen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1598">In [[control theory]], '''gain scheduling''' is an approach to control of [[non-linear system]]s that uses a family of linear [[Controller (control theory)|controller]]s, each of which provides satisfactory control for a different operating point of the system.

One or more [[Observability|observable]] variables, called the ''scheduling variables'', are used to determine what operating region the system is currently in and to enable the appropriate linear controller.  For example, in an aircraft [[flight control system]], the [[altitude]] and [[Mach number]] might be the scheduling variables, with different linear controller parameters available (and automatically plugged into the controller) for various combinations of these two variables.

A relatively large scope state of the art about gain scheduling has been published in (Survey of Gain-Scheduling Analysis &amp; Design, D.J.Leith, WE.Leithead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nuim.ie/1834/1/1001965764_link_19992.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2012|title=Survey of Gain-Scheduling Analysis &amp; Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">The '''Genomic Standards Consortium''' (GSC) is an initiative working towards richer descriptions of our collection of genomes, [[Metagenomics|metagenomes]] and marker genes. Established in September 2005, this international community includes representatives from a range of major [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] and [[bioinformatics]] centres (including [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]], [[EMBL]], [[DDBJ]], [[J. Craig Venter Institute|JCVI]], [[Joint Genome Institute|JGI]], [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]], [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute|Sanger]], FIG) and research institutions. The goal of the GSC is to promote mechanisms for standardizing the description of (meta)genomes, including the exchange and integration of (meta)genomic data. The number and pace of genomic and metagenomic sequencing projects will only increase as the use of ultra-high-throughput methods becomes common place and standards are vital to scientific progress and data sharing.

==Mission==

Community-driven standards have the best chance of success if developed within the auspices of international working groups. Participants in the GSC include biologists, computer scientists, those building genomic databases and conducting large-scale comparative genomic analyses, and those with experience of building community-based standards. The mission of the GSC is to work with the wider community towards: 

* the implementation of a new genomic standards
* methods of capturing and exchanging metadata 
* harmonization of metadata collection and analysis efforts across the wider genomics community

==MIGS/MIMS/MIMARKS and other projects==

The GSC has published a “Minimum Information about a (Meta)Genome Sequence” specification and has now completed a "Minimum Information about an ENvironmental Sequence" specification.  MIGS/MIMS/MIMARKS provides an extension of the minimum information already captured by the primary nucleotide sequence archives ([http://www.insdc.org/ INSDC] or DDBJ/ENA/GenBank).  The development of any checklist must be an open and iterative process that involves a balanced group of participants.  Further, this development process must be supported by providing mechanisms for achieving compliance if a checklist is to be adopted as a tool for the standardization of a particular area of knowledge.  Work towards this goal has spawned a set of interlocking projects that are described in more detail here: [http://gensc.org/gc_wiki/index.php/GSC_projects GSC projects].  These include The Genomic Contextual Data Markup Language (GCDML), Genomic Rosetta Stone (GRS), Habitat-Lite.  Newer projects include the M5 project.

==Linkages to other groups==

The GSC is interested in making and building links with other communities.  As stated above, the GSC is engaged in ontology development within the [http://obofoundry.org OBO Foundry].  The GSC is also a founding member community of the [http://mibbi.org Minimum Information about a Biomedical or Biological Investigation (MIBBI)], an umbrella community for supporting and co-ordinating the development of checklists describing [[Minimum Information Standards]].

==Publications==

The GSC maintains a list of publications on its wiki - [http://gensc.org/publications-2/ GSC Publications].  This list includes reports from all workshops, articles from the special issue of the journal OMICS on data standards, and the publications describing the MIGS/MIMS and MIMARKS specifications in the journal ''Nature Biotechnology'' (May 2008 and May 2011 respectively).

'''Harry Edwin Wood''' (3 February 1881 – 27 February 1946) was an English [[astronomer]], director of the [[Union Observatory]] in [[Johannesburg]], and discoverer of [[minor planet]]s.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

Wood was born in [[Manchester]], graduating from [[Manchester University]] in 1902 with first class honours in physics, going on to gain an M.Sc in 1905.  In 1906 he was appointed the Chief Assistant at the ''Transvaal Meteorological Observatory'', which soon acquired [[telescope]]s and which became known as the Union Observatory and later [[Republic Observatory]]. In 1909, he married Mary Ethel Greengrass, also a physics graduate of Manchester University. Wood served as the observatory's director from 1928 to 1941, succeeding [[Robert T. A. Innes|Robert Innes]]. He also served as the president of the ''Astronomical Society of South Africa'' from 1929 to 1930.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;

Wood is credited by the [[Minor Planet Center]] with the discovery of 12 numbered [[asteroid]]s during 1911–1932.&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt;

He died in Mortimer, near [[Cradock, Eastern Cape]], South Africa, in 1946. The asteroid [[1660 Wood]], discovered by his colleague [[Jacobus Albertus Bruwer|Jacobus Bruwer]] at Johannesburg, is named in his honor ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 3297}}).&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

'''Historical dynamics''' broadly includes the scientific modeling of history.  This might also be termed computer modeling of history, historical simulation, or simulation of history - allowing for an extensive range of techniques in simulation and estimation.  Historical dynamics does not exist as a separate science, but there are individual efforts such as [[long range planning]], [[population modeling]], [[economic forecasting]], [[demographics]], [[global modeling]], [[country modeling]], [[regional planning]], [[urban planning]] and many others in the general categories of [[computer modeling]], [[planning]], [[forecasting]], and [[simulations]].

Some examples of "large" history where historical dynamics simulations would be helpful include; [[global history]], large structures, [[:category:histories of empires|histories of empires]], long duration history, [[philosophy of history]], [[Eurasian history]], [[comparative history]], long-range [[environmental history]], [[world systems theory]], non-Western political and economic development, and [[historical demography]].
 
==Information sources for simulations==
With the rise of technologies like wikis, and internet-wide search engines, some historical and social data can be mined to constrain models of history and society.  Data from social media sites, and busy sites, can be mined for human patterns of action.  These can provide more and more realistic behavioral models for individuals and groups of any size.  [[Agent-based model]]s and [[microsimulation]]s of [[human behavior]] can be embedded in larger historical simulations.  Related subfields are [[behavioral economics]] and [[human behavioral ecology]].
* [[Data mining]], [[web mining]], [[predictive analytics]]
* [[Social media]], [[web analytics]], [[social network]]s
* [[Automated translation]], [[natural language processing]], [[Turing test]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088 |title=BBC News - Computer AI passes Turing test in 'world first' |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2014-06-09 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Crowd computing]] has been applied to [[crowd computing#History|history]], and offers another tool for historical verification and validation.

==Sectoral databases==
In every sector of human activity, there are extensive databases for [[North american transportation statistics interchange|transportation data]], [[urban development]], [[health statistics]], [[education data]], [[social data]], [[economic data]]—along with many projections.  See [[:Category:economic databases]], [[:Category:statistical data sets]], [[:Category:social statistics data]], [[:Category:social statistics]] and [[:Category:statistics]].

Some examples of database activity include [[Asian Development Bank]] statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/data/statistics |title=Asian Development Bank - Statistics |publisher=Adb.org |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]] data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/ |title=World Bank - Data |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Monetary Fund]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/data.htm |title=International Monetary Fund - Data |publisher=Imf.org |date=2014-06-27 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time series analysis]] and [[econometrics]] are well established fields for the analysis of trends and [[forecasting]]; but, survey data and microdatasets can also be used in forecasts and simulations.
&lt;!-- This section can be expanded considerably. Many relevant datasets --&gt;

==Global, country, and sectoral models in international development==

The United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/ |title=United Nations Population Division, Economic and Social Affairs |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations routinely project the population of individual countries and regions of the world decades into the future.  These demographic models are used by other organizations for projecting demand for services in all sectors of each economy.

* [[International Monetary Fund]] - Finance, Government Accounts
* [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]
* [[World Health Organization]] - Health
* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] - Food and Agriculture
* [[International Labour Organization]] - Labour
* [[World Trade Organization]] - Trade
* [[World Bank]] - extensive modeling and data activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic#2 |title=World Bank topics by global practices |publisher=Worldbank.org |date=2014-06-30 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/0,,menuPK:476823~pagePK:64165236~piPK:64165141~theSitePK:469372,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country often has their corresponding modeling groups for each of these major sectors.  These can be grouped in separate articles according to sector.  Groups include government departments, [[List of development aid agencies|international aid agencies]], as well as nonprofit and [[non-governmental organization]]s.

A broad class of models used for economic and social modeling of countries and sectors are the [[Computable general equilibrium]] (CGE) model - also called [[applied general equilibrium]] models.  In the context of time based simulations and policy analysis, see [[dynamic stochastic general equilibrium]] models.

==Linked economic, social, and climate models==
Partly because of the controversy over [[global climate change]], there is an extensive network of global climate models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WMO Webteam |url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_models.php |title=World Meteorological Organization models |publisher=Wmo.int |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/projects/gcm/ |title=NASA global climate models |publisher=Giss.nasa.gov |date=2014-07-17 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related social and economic models.  These seek to estimate, not only the change in climate and its physical effects, but also the impact on human society and the natural environment.  See [[global economic models]], [[social model]], [[microsimulation]], [[climate model]], [[global climate models]], and [[general circulation model]].

The relationship between the environment and society is examined through [[environmental social science]].  [[human ecology]], [[political ecology]], and [[ecology]], in general, can be areas where computer and mathematical modeling over time can be relevant to historical simulation.

==Historical simulations==
Web-based historical simulations, [[simulations of history]], interactive historical simulations, are increasingly popular for entertainment and educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialstudiescentral.com/?q=content/online-interactive-simulations |title=Social Studies Central, Interactive History Simulations |publisher=Socialstudiescentral.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field is expanding rapidly and no central index seems to be available.

Several computer games allow players to interact with the game to model societies over time. The [[Civilization (series)]] is one example.  Others include [[Age of Empires]], [[Rise of Nations]], [[Spore]], [[Colonization]], [[Alpha Centauri]], [[Call to Power]], and [[CivCity: Rome]].  A longer list of games in historical context, which might include degrees of simulation, are found at [[:Category:Video games with historical settings]].

[[Military simulation]] is a well-developed field and increasingly accessible on the internet.

==Simulating society==
Computer models for simulating society fall under [[artificial society]], [[social simulation]], [[computational sociology]], [[computational social science]], and [[mathematical sociology]].  There is an interdisciplinary [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] for computer simulation of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/ |title=Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation |publisher=Jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Social Simulation Association]] promotes social simulation research in Europe; it is the publisher of JASSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essa.eu.org/ European Social Simulation Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a corresponding [[Computational Social Science Society of the Americas]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computationalsocialscience.org/ |title=Computational Social Science Society of the Americas |publisher=Computationalsocialscience.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paaa.asia/ |title=Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences |publisher=Paaa.asia |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PAAA lists some related Japanese associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paaa.asia/related-associations/ |title=Related social simulation associations |publisher=Paaa.asia |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SimSoc ([[Simulated Society]] tool) is in its fifth edition.

==Cities==
There has been extensive research in [[urban planning]], [[environmental planning]] and related fields: [[regional planning]], [[land-use planning]], [[transportation planning]], [[urban studies]], and [[regional science]].  Journals for these fields are listed at [[List of planning journals]].

[[SimCity]] is a game for simulations of artificial cities.  It has spawned a range of "sim" games.  The planning groups try to simulate changes in real cities.  The game groups allow experiments with artificial cities.  And the two are merging in such efforts as Vizicities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2013/09/simcity-with-real-data-modeling-real-cities-in-3d-in-a-web-environment.html |title=SimCity with real data: modeling real cities in 3D in a Web environment |publisher=Geospatial.blogs.com |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==
The profiling of industries is well developed, and most industries make forecasts and plans.  See [[industrial history]], [[history of steel]], [[history of mining]], [[history of construction]], [[history of the petroleum industry]], and many other histories of specific industries.  See [[cyclical industrial dynamics]] for modeling of industries in the sense of "historical dynamics of industries".  Some related terms are [[industrial planning]], [[history of industry]], [[industrial evolution]], [[technology change]], and [[technology forecasting]]. An example of "history friendly" industrial models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=F Malerba a |author2=R Nelson b |author3=L Orsenigo |author4=S Winter d |url=http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/3.abstract |title='History-friendly' models of industry evolution: the computer industry |publisher=Icc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the journal, Industrial and Corporate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/ |title=Journal: Industrial and Corporate Change |publisher=Icc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economy-wide models must take into account the interactions between industry and the rest of the economy.  See [[Input–output model]], [[economic planning]], and [[social accounting matrix]] for some relevant techniques.

==Futures==
Many of the techniques from [[futures studies]] are applicable to historical dynamics.  Whether projecting forward from a point in the past to the present for validation studies, or projecting backwards from the present into the past - many of the techniques are useful.  Likewise, simulations of the past, or alternative pasts, provide a groundwork of techniques for futures studies.

'''Human behavioral ecology''' ('''HBE''') or '''human evolutionary ecology''' applies the principles of [[evolutionary theory]] and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] to the study of [[human behavior]]al and [[cultural diversity]]. HBE examines the [[adaptation|adaptive]] design of [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s, [[behaviors]], and [[life history theory|life histories]] of humans in an [[ecological]] context. One aim of modern human behavioral ecology is to determine how ecological and [[social]] factors influence and shape behavioral flexibility within and between human [[populations]]. Among other things, HBE attempts to explain variation in human behavior as adaptive solutions to the competing life-history demands of growth, development, [[reproduction]], parental care, and mate acquisition.

HBE overlaps with [[evolutionary psychology]], [[Human ecology|human]] or [[cultural ecology]], and [[decision theory]]. It is most prominent in disciplines such as [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]] where [[human evolution]] is considered relevant for a holistic understanding of
[[human behavior]] or in [[economics]] where [[Psychological egoism|self-interest]], [[methodological individualism]], and [[Maximization (economics)|maximization]] are key elements in modeling behavioral responses to various ecological factors. 

==Evolutionary theory==

Human behavioral ecology rests upon a foundation of evolutionary theory. This includes aspects of both general evolutionary theory and established middle-level evolutionary theories, as well. Aspects of general evolutionary theory include:
*'''[[Natural selection]]''', the process by which individual [[organism]]s with favorable [[trait (biological)|traits]] are more likely to survive and [[biological reproduction|reproduce]].
*'''[[Sexual selection]]''', the [[scientific theory|theory]] that competition for mates between individuals of the same sex results in differential mating and reproduction.
*'''[[Kin selection]]''', the changes in [[gene frequency]] across generations that are driven at least in part by interactions between related individuals, and
*'''[[Inclusive fitness]]''', the sum of an individual's own reproductive success, (natural and sexual selection), plus the effects the individual's actions have on the reproductive success of that individual's kin, (kin selection).

Middle-level evolutionary theories used in HBE include:
*The theory of '''[[parental investment]]''', which predicts that the sex making the largest investment in [[lactation]], nurturing and protecting [[offspring]] will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higher investing sex.
*'''[[Parent-offspring conflict]]''', which predicts that because the genetic interests of parents and offspring are not identical, offspring will be selected to manipulate their parents in order to ensure higher investment, and that, conversely, parents will be selected to manipulate their offspring.
*The theory of '''[[reciprocal altruism]]''', a form of [[altruism]] in which one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocation]].
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents should invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''', which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species – in unstable or unpredictable environments – produce many offspring, any individual one of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood, while [[K-selected]] species – in stable or predictable environments – invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Evolutionary game theory]]''', the application of [[population genetics]]-inspired models of change in gene frequency in populations to [[game theory]].
*'''[[Evolutionarily stable strategy]]''', which refers to a [[strategy (game theory)|strategy]], which if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any competing alternative strategy.

==Basic principles==

===Ecological selectionism===

Ecological selectionism refers to the assumption that humans are highly flexible in their behaviors. Furthermore, it assumes that various ecological forces select for various behaviors that optimize humans' inclusive fitness in their given ecological context.

===The piecemeal approach===

The piecemeal approach refers to taking a [[reductionist]] approach as opposed to a [[holistic]] approach in studying human socioecological behavior. Human behavioral ecologists assume that by taking complex social phenomena, (e.g., marriage patterns, foraging behaviors, etc.), and then breaking them down into sets of components involving decisions and constraints that they are in a better position to create models and make predictions involving human behavior. An example would be examining marriage systems by examining the ecological context, mate preferences, the distribution of particular characteristics within the population, and so forth.

===Conditional strategies===

Human behavioral ecologists assume that what might be the most adaptive strategy in one environment might not be the most adaptive strategy in another environment. Conditional strategies, therefore, can be represented in the following statement:
*In environmental context X, engage in adaptive strategy A.
*In environmental context Y, engage in adaptive strategy B.

===The phenotypic gambit===

The phenotypic gambit refers to the simplifying assumption that [[complex traits]], such as behavioural traits, can be modelled as if they were controlled by single distinct alleles, representing alternate strategies. In other words, the phenotypic gambit assumes that "selection will favour traits with high fitness ...irrespective of the particulars of inheritance."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Alden Smith and Bruce Winterhalder. (1992) Natural Selection and Decision-Making: Some Fundamental Principles. In Evolution and Human Behavior, ed. Eric Alden Smith &amp; Bruce Winterhalder&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modeling===
[[Model (abstract)|Theoretical models]] that human behavioral ecologists employ include, but are not limited to:

*'''[[Optimal foraging theory]]''', which states that organisms focus on consuming the most energy while expending the least amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|title=Multiple Optima in Hoabinhian flaked stone artefact palaeoeconomics and palaeoecology at two archaeological sites in Northwest Thailand|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|date=December 2013|volume=32|issue=4|pages=553–564|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2013.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Life history theory]]''', which postulates that many of the [[physiological]] traits and behaviors of individuals may be best understood in relation to the key maturational and reproductive characteristics that define the life course.
*'''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis|Sex allocation theory]]''', which predicts that parents should bias their reproductive investments toward the offspring sex generating the greatest fitness return.
*The '''[[polygyny threshold model]]''', which suggests that [[polygyny]] is driven by female choice of mates who control more resources relative to other potential mates in the population.

'''Human interactions with microbes''' include both practical and symbolic uses of [[microbe]]s, and negative interactions in the form of human, domestic animal, and crop diseases.

Practical use of microbes began in ancient times with [[fermentation in food processing]]; [[bread]], [[beer]] and [[wine]] have been produced by [[yeast]]s from the dawn of civilisation, such as in [[ancient Egypt]]. More recently, microbes have been used in activities from [[biological warfare]] to the production of chemicals by fermentation, as industrial chemists discover how to manufacture a widening variety of organic chemicals including [[enzyme]]s and bioactive molecules such as [[hormone]]s and [[competitive inhibition|competitive inhibitors]] for use as medicines. Fermentation is used, too, to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in forms such as [[ethanol]] and [[methane]]; [[Algae fuel|fuels may also be produced by algae]]. Anaerobic microorganisms are important in [[sewage treatment]]. In scientific research, yeasts and the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' serve as [[model organism]]s especially in [[genetics]] and related fields.

On the symbolic side, an early poem about brewing is the [[Sumer]]ian "Hymn to [[Ninkasi]]", from 1800 BC. In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]'' and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'': addressed people's fear of deadly contagion and the moral decline that could result. Novelists have exploited the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic possibilities]] of [[pandemic]]s from [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1826 ''[[The Last Man]]'' and [[Jack London]]'s 1912 ''[[The Scarlet Plague]]'' onwards. [[Hilaire Belloc]] wrote a humorous poem to "The Microbe" in 1912. Dramatic plagues and mass infection have formed the story lines of many [[Hollywood]] films, starting with ''[[Nosferatu]]'' in 1922. In 1971, ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' told the tale of an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial microbe]] threatening life on Earth. [[Microbiologist]]s since [[Alexander Fleming]] have used coloured or [[fluorescence|fluorescing]] colonies of bacteria to create miniature artworks.

Microorganisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es are important as [[pathogen]]s, causing disease to humans, [[crop plant]]s, and [[domestic animal]]s.

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by microorganisms in human culture.

Since microbes were not known until the [[Early Modern]] period, they appear in earlier literature indirectly, through descriptions of [[baking]] and [[brewing]]. Only with the invention of the [[microscope]], as used by [[Robert Hooke]] in his 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooke |first1=Robert|title=Micrographia: Or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses, with Observations and Inquiries Thereupon |date=1665 |publisher=Courier Dover |isbn=0-486-49564-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0DYXk_9XX38C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=Micrographia+honeycomb#v=onepage&amp;q=Micrographia%20honeycomb&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek]] in the 1670s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Payne, A.S. |title=The Cleere Observer: A Biography of Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek |page=13 |publisher=Macmillan |date=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[germ theory of disease]], and progress in [[microbiology]] in the 19th century were microbes observed directly, identified as living organisms, and put to use on a scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germ Theory|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|publisher=Rank|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same knowledge also allowed microbes to appear explicitly in literature and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menagerie of Microbes|url=http://www.ascus.org.uk/exhibitions/menagerie-of-microbes/|publisher=Ascus|accessdate=27 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927162641/http://www.ascus.org.uk/exhibitions/menagerie-of-microbes/|archivedate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food production===
{{Main|Fermentation in food processing}}

Controlled [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] with microbes in [[brewing]], [[wine making]], [[baking]], [[pickling]] and cultured [[dairy product]]s such as [[yogurt]] and [[cheese]], is used to modify ingredients to make [[foods]] with desirable properties. The [[List of microorganisms used in food and beverage preparation|principal microbes involved]] are [[yeast]]s, in the case of beer, wine, and ordinary [[bread]]; and [[bacteria]], in the case of [[anaerobic respiration|anaerobically]] fermented [[vegetable]]s, [[dairy product]]s, and [[sourdough]] bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including [[alcohol]], [[organic acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[carbon dioxide]]. Safety is maintained with the help of [[food microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/micro.html |title= Dairy Microbiology |accessdate=9 October 2006 |publisher= University of Guelph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steinkraus&gt;{{cite book |editor=Steinkraus, K.

===Water treatment===
{{Main|Sewage treatment}}
Oxidative sewage treatment processes rely on microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents. Anaerobic microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing [[methane]] gas and a sterile mineralised residue. In [[potable water]] treatment, one method, the [[slow sand filter]], employs a complex gelatinous layer composed of a wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Biology of Wastewater Treatment | author=Gray, N.F. | publisher=Imperial College Press | year=2004 | page=1164 | isbn=1-86094-332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals, enzymes ===
[[File:Penicillin bioreactor.jpg|thumb|An early [[Penicillin]] bioreactor, from 1957, now in the [[Science Museum, London]]]]
{{main|Industrial enzymes}}

Microorganisms are used for many commercial and industrial purposes, including the production of chemicals, [[enzymes]] and other bioactive molecules, often through [[protein engineering]]. For example, [[acetic acid]] is produced by the  bacterium ''[[Acetobacter aceti]]'', while [[citric acid]] is produced by the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]''. Microorganisms are used to prepare a widening range of bioactive molecules and enzymes. For example, [[Streptokinase]] produced by the bacterium ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and modified by [[genetic engineering]] is used [[clot buster|to remove clots]] from the blood vessels of patients who have suffered a [[myocardial infarctions|heart attack]]. [[Cyclosporin A]] is an [[immunosuppressive agent]] in [[organ transplantation]], while [[statins]] produced by the yeast ''[[Monascus purpureus]]'' serve as [[blood cholesterol]] lowering agents, [[competitive inhibition|competitively inhibiting]] the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology textbook for class XII |publisher=National council of educational research and training |isbn=81-7450-639-X |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
Microorganisms are essential tools in [[biotechnology]], [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], and [[molecular biology]].

[[File:Synoptic Theory In en.svg|thumb|The independence theory rejects posits that each evangelist has independently drawn from eyewitness accounts and perhaps oral tradition.]]
The '''Independence hypothesis''' is a proposed solution to the [[synoptic problem]]. It holds that [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] are each original compositions formed independently of each other, with no documentary relationship.

Scholars have long noted that the three [[synoptic gospels]] have a great deal in common, not just in content but also in order and precise Greek wording. Most scholars have assumed that this must be due to some sort of literary interrelationship among the gospels, with fragments of text copied from one source to another, but have struggled to find a satisfactory theory of who copied from whom. The independence theory rejects this consensus of documentary dependence; rather, each evangelist has independently drawn from eyewitness accounts and perhaps liturgy and other oral tradition.

The similarities among the synoptic gospels, the whole basis for the synoptic problem, are held to be, first of all, vastly overstated, and secondly, explainable as artifacts of relying on the same witnesses or of different witnesses to the same events.

The witnesses to the gospel content, especially apostles such as [[Saint Peter|Peter]], would have preached their testimony countless times before contributing to the gospels, and such numerous rehearsals tend to make a story settle into a relatively consistent wording. Any of this material that entered public liturgy (e.g., the [[Lord's prayer]]) would become even more stabilized. On the other hand, different witnesses nearly always preserve different details and present numerous minor inconsistencies. So, too, does a single witness consulted on different occasions. Moreover, sayings and anonymous healings may have recurred many times in a similar fashion, so that seemingly similar accounts actually preserve distinct events. What we would expect to see in the gospels according to this method of composition, goes the theory, is exactly what we find: many similar accounts, often with virtually identical wording, but many additions and omissions, a somewhat different selection of content in each, and apparent inconsistencies of order and details.

Some see the independence theory as especially consistent with [[Biblical inspiration|divine inspiration]] of the gospels, with the similarities among the gospels explained by the Holy Spirit ensuring a faithful record of Christ's words and deeds.

Protestant theologian [[Eta Linnemann]] argues that the reason for four independent Gospels stems from the legal principle of {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|19:15|NASB}}: "On the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed."

The term '''information scientist''' developed in the latter part of the twentieth century to describe an individual, usually with a relevant subject degree (such as one in [[Information and Computer Science|CIS]]) or high level of subject knowledge, providing focused information to scientific and technical research staff in industry, a role quite distinct from and complementary to that of a [[librarian]]. Developments in end-user searching, together with some convergence between the roles of librarian and information scientist, have led to a diminution in its use in this context, and the term '''information officer''' or '''[[information professional]]''' are also now used.

The term was, and is, also used for an individual carrying out research in [[information science]].

Brian C. Vickery mentions that the '''[[Institute of Information Scientists]]''' (IIS) was established in London during 1958 and lists the criteria put forward by this institute "Criteria for Information Science" (appendix 1) as well as his own "Areas of study in information science" (appendix 2). The IIS merged with the Library Association in 2002 to form the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] (CILIP).

'''Kay Dickersin''' (born November 10, 1951) is an academic who trained first in cell biology and subsequently epidemiology.  She went on to a career studying factors that influence research integrity, in particular [[publication bias]] and [[Reporting bias#Outcome reporting bias|outcome reporting bias]]. She is Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] &lt;ref name=jhsph&gt;{{cite web| title = Kay Dickersin| url = http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1348/kay-dickersin| website = Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health| date = 2015| accessdate = 20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Director of the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence Synthesis there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Johns Hopkins Center for Clinical Trials| url = http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-clinical-trials-and-evidence-synthesis/ | website = Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health| date = 2015| accessdate = 20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also Director of the [[United States Cochrane Center|US Cochrane Center]] &lt;ref name=cochrane2018/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Welcome, US Cochrane Center| url = http://us.cochrane.org/| website = US Cochrane Center| date = 2015| accessdate = 20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US Satellite of the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Welcome.

Trusted evidence. Informed decisions.

==Education==

Dickersin’s formal academic and research training spans the basic, clinical, and public health sciences. Dickersin began an undergraduate degree at [[Bennington College]] in [[Bennington, Vermont]], planning to major in art.  After two years, she transferred undergraduate institutions to [[University of California, Berkeley]]. She received both a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Zoology (cell biology), from the UC Berkeley, in 1974 and 1975, respectively. She was awarded a PhD in epidemiology from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] in 1989. While an undergraduate, she received a Howard Hughes Fellowship in Medical Research in 1971, and during her PhD research she received an NIH traineeship.

==Career==

Dickersin spent two months in Dorothy and [[Claude Alvin Villee Jr.|Claude A. Villee’s]] research laboratory at [[Harvard University]] to complete a "field work term” at Bennington College. Her new interest in science led her to leave Bennington after 2 years, and to work in Allan Tobin’s lab in developmental biology at Harvard College. Subsequently, she transferred undergraduate institutions to University of California, Berkeley.  At Berkeley, where she did undergraduate and master's degree research, she worked in [[Daniel Mazia]]’s lab.  Her master’s thesis was “Increased Permeability of Sea Urchin Eggs to Adenine After Fertilization, Parthenogenetic Activation, and Exposure to Ammonia”.  After her master's degree, Dickersin taught biology at two community colleges in California ([[West Valley College]] and [[Fullerton College]]) and subsequently worked in Roger Sloboda’s lab at [[Dartmouth College]] doing developmental biology research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sloboda | first1 = R | last2 = Dickersin | first2 = K | title = Protein composition of the cytoskeleton of nucleated erythrocytes | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 87 | issue = 1 | pages = 170–179 | date = 1980 | pmid = 6774984 | doi=10.1083/jcb.87.1.170 | pmc=2110706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Fullerton College, and through her biology students, Dickersin learned about the field of [[epidemiology]], which she liked because it merges science with societal concerns and involves experimental research (clinical trials).  In addition, in the late 1970s Dickersin believed the opportunities for women in laboratory research were limited.  These two factors led her to switch research areas to public health, a field that she believed is more friendly to women.  Dickersin matriculated at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1979, focusing on clinical trials, and Curtis L. Meinert became her advisor. Her graduate education was interrupted when the family moved to Boston for 4 years in 1981 so that her husband could attend medical school. During this interlude she worked with two influential mentors, Thomas C. Chalmers and [[Iain Chalmers|Sir Iain Chalmers]], and became interested in research synthesis and related biases. When she returned to Baltimore to complete her PhD, she worked on clinical trials as well as research directly linked to publication bias. Her PhD dissertation, “Publication and the Meta-analysis of Clinical Trials,” was the first in her Department to use the model where a group of related research papers is bound together with linking text, rather than the traditional model of stand-alone document with related chapters.

After completing her PhD in 1989, Dickersin moved to the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore#University of Maryland School of Medicine|University of Maryland, School of Medicine]], in Baltimore, first to the Department of Ophthalmology and later to the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine. In 1998, she moved to [[Alpert Medical School|Brown University School of Medicine]] where she launched the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence-Based Healthcare. In 2005, she accepted a position directing the Center for Clinical Trials at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, renamed in 2014 to the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence Synthesis.

Dickersin’s research career has spanned several areas related to [[clinical trials]] and [[systematic reviews]] of trials. She has led clinical trials, for example she was principal investigator of two federally funded multicenter randomized trials, the data center for the Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial Research Group | title = Optic nerve decompression surgery for nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is not effective and may be harmful. | journal = JAMA | volume = 273 | issue = 8 | pages = 170–179 | date = 1995 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=387126 | pmid = 7844872 | accessdate = 21 June 2015|doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520320035038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Surgical Treatments Outcomes Project for Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (STOP-DUB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | last2 = Munro | first2 = MG | last3 = Clark | first3 = MA | last4 = Langenberg | first4 = P | last5 = Scherer | first5 = R | last6 = Frick | first6 = K | last7 = Zhu | first7 = Q | last8 = Hallock | first8 = L | last9 = Nichols | first9 = J | last10 = Yalcinkaya  | first10 = T | last11 = for the | first11 = STOP-DUB (Surgical Treatments Outcomes Project for Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding) Research Group | title = Hysterectomy compared with endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 110 | issue = 6 | pages = 1279–1289 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18055721 | doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000292083.97478.38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickersin became interested in systematic reviews in the mid-1980s, especially the problem of identifying all relevant research on a topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | last2 = Hewitt | first2 = P | last3 = Mutch | first3 = L | last4 = Chalmers | first4 = I | last5 = Chalmers | first5 = TC | title = Perusing the literature: comparison of MEDLINE searching with a perinatal trials database | journal = Controlled Clin Trials | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–317 | date = 1985 | pmid = 3907973| doi=10.1016/0197-2456(85)90106-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her early research focused on establishing the existence of [[publication bias]] and the difficulty of retrieving the clinical trial literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | last2 = Chan | first2 = S | last3 = Chalmers | first3 = TC | last4 = Sacks | first4 = HS | last5 = Smith | first5 = H | title = Publication bias and clinical trials | journal = Controlled Clin Trials | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 343–353 | date = 1987 | pmid =  3442991 | doi=10.1016/0197-2456(87)90155-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | title = The existence of publication bias and risk factors for its occurrence | journal = JAMA | volume = 263 | issue = 10 | pages = 1385–1389 | date = 1990 | pmid = 2406472 | doi=10.1001/jama.263.10.1385}}&lt;/ref&gt; her later research has explored how selective outcome reporting may distort knowledge from clinical trials[16]. She has also contributed to implementation of “fixes” related to these problems, aimed at increasing research integrity. For example, she has contributed to the establishment of [[clinical trials registry|clinical trial registries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | last2 = for the | first2 = Panel | title = Report from the panel on the case for registers of clinical trials at the eighth annual meeting of the society for clinical trials | journal = Controlled Clin Trials | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–81 | date = 1988 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0197245688900104 | doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(88)90010-4 | accessdate = 19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ad Hoc Working Party of the International Collaborative Group on Clinical Trial Registries | title = Position paper and consensus recommendations on clinical trials registries. | journal = Clin Trials Metaanal | volume = 28 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 255–266 | date = 1993 | url = http://ottawagroup.ohri.ca/docs/Trial_Registries_1993.pdf | pmid = 10146333 | accessdate = 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CENTRAL&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | last2 = Manheimer | first2 = E | last3 = Wieland | first3 = LS | last4 = Robinson | first4 = KA | last5 = Lefebvre | first5 = C | last6 = McDonald | first6 = S | last7 = and the | first7 = CENTRAL Development Group | title = Development of the Cochrane Collaboration's CENTRAL Register of controlled clinical trials | journal = Eval Health Professions | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–64 | date = 2002 | pmid = 11868444 | doi=10.1177/016327870202500104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | last2 = Rennie | first2 = D | title = Registering clinical trials | journal = JAMA | volume = 290 | issue = 4 | pages = 516–523 | date = 2003 | pmid = 12876095 | doi=10.1001/jama.290.4.516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | last2 = Rennie | first2 = D | title = The evolution of trial registries and their use to assess the clinical trial enterprise | journal = JAMA | volume = 307 | issue = 17 | pages = 1861–4 | date = 2012 | doi =  10.1001/jama.2012.4230 | pmid = 22550202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting public accessibility to trial findings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Wolford | first1 = B| title = Big Pharma Plays Hide-the-Ball with Data | publisher = [[Newsweek]]| date = 13 November 2014| url = http://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/21/medical-science-has-data-problem-284066.html| accessdate = 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = B | title = The pioneers of transparency | journal = BMJ | volume = 350 | issue = g7717 | date = 2015 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g7717 | pmid = 25555823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishment of the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chalmers | first1 = I | last2 = Dickersin | first2 = K | last3 = Chalmers | first3 = TC | title = Getting to grips with Archie Cochrane's agenda | journal = BMJ | volume = 305 | issue = 6857 | pages = 786–788 | date = 1992 | pmid = 1422354 | doi=10.1136/bmj.305.6857.786 | pmc=1883470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickersin | first1 = K | last2 = Manheimer | first2 = E | title = The Cochrane Collaboration: evaluation of health care and services using systematic reviews of the results of randomized controlled trials | journal = Clin Obstet Gynecol | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 315–331 | date = 1998 | pmid = 9646964 | doi=10.1097/00003081-199806000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of her career, Dickersin has served on a variety of federal advisory committees, for example, she was appointed by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] to the National Cancer Advisory Board (1994-2000).  Internationally, she was instrumental in starting the [[World Health Organization]]’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and served as Co-Chair of the Scientific Advisory Group from 2005-2008 when it was disbanded.  She has also served on numerous Institute of Medicine and National Research Council committees, which include for example: The Vaccine Safety Committee (1992-3); Committee to Advise the Department of Defense on its FY 1993 Breast Cancer Program (1993); Committee to Study the Reimbursement of Routine Patient Care Costs for Medicare Patients Enrolled in Clinical Trials (1998-9); Committee to Assess the System for Protecting Human Research Subjects (Advisory Consultant) (2001-2); Committee on the Review of Evidence on High Clinical Value Services (2005-7);  Committee on Comparative Effectiveness Research Prioritization (2009); Committee for the Handling Missing Data in Clinical Trials (2009–10); Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Clinical Effectiveness Research (2009–11).

==Cochrane collaboration==

Dickersin was a founding member of the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993, and was on the Steering Committee from 1993 to 1996. She served on the Information Management Steering Group from 2003 to 2005.  She directs the US Cochrane Center, which has evolved from one of four original centers (she headed the Baltimore Cochrane Center, the first US-based center, opening in 1994). She also has directed the [[Cochrane Collaboration#Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group|Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group]], US Satellite, since its inception in 2002.

The US Cochrane Center coordinated the development of [[United States Cochrane Center#CENTRAL|Cochrane’s Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)]] from 1994 to 2005,&lt;ref name=CENTRAL /&gt; which was then turned over to The Cochrane Library publisher for further development and maintenance. Dickersin’s papers related to the Cochrane Collaboration are at the [[National Library of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = United States Cochrane Center archives| url =http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=nlmfindaid;id=navbarbrowselink;cginame=findaid-idx;cc=nlmfindaid;view=reslist;subview=standard;didno=101575354| website =[[United States National Library of Medicine]]| date = 9 June 2015| accessdate = 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the US Cochrane Center at Johns Hopkins closed and Kay Dickerson stepped down from her position as its director.&lt;ref name=cochrane2018&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cochrane.org/news/closure-us-cochrane-center-johns-hopkins-bloomberg-school-public-health-baltimore |author= |title=Closure of the US Cochrane Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore| publisher=Cochrane |date=February 19, 2018 |accessdate=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer engagement in research==

In 1986, one year after resuming her PhD work, Dickersin was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.  This led to her starting a breast cancer support group, Arm-in-Arm, with Marsha Oakley, and engagement in national and international consumer advocacy work, as a founding mother of the [[National Breast Cancer Coalition]] in 1991. Her papers related to the start of the NBCC are at the Schlesinger Library in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Dickersin, Kay.

In 2003, Dickersin initiated a coalition of consumer and health advocacy groups (later named [[Consumers United for Evidence-based Healthcare]] or CUE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Consumers United for Evidence-Based Healthcare (CUE)| url = http://us.cochrane.org/CUE| website = US Cochrane Center| date = 2015| accessdate = 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind CUE was to bring together consumer groups, who traditionally have not worked together, to form a professional organization for learning and networking. In addition to serving these functions, CUE helps scientist groups to identify consumers for meaningful engagement in research and on advisory and guideline panels.

'''''Last Chance to See''''' is a 1989 [[BBC]] radio documentary series and its accompanying book, written and presented by [[Douglas Adams]] and [[Mark Carwardine]]. In the series, Adams and Carwardine travel to various locations in the hope of encountering [[species]] on the brink of [[extinction]]. The book was published in 1990.

In 2009, the [[BBC]] broadcast a [[Last Chance to See (TV series)|television follow-up series of the same name]], with [[Stephen Fry]] replacing the late Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/|title=BBC ''Last Chance to See'' – Home – Last Chance to See|accessdate=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Douglas Adams went to [[Madagascar]] in search of the (possibly extinct) lemur the [[aye-aye]]. The trip was part of a project by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and British Sunday newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'', sending well-known authors to remote places to seek endangered species and write articles for ''The Observer Magazine'', to help raise awareness of ecological issues.  Adams was met in Madagascar by zoologist Mark Carwardine (who was working for the WWF at the time). The ''Observer'' project was successful, and Adams and Carwardine developed a radio series around the same concept for [[BBC Radio 4]]. Carwardine later said:

:"We put a big map of the world on a wall, Douglas stuck a pin in everywhere he fancied going, I stuck a pin in where all the endangered animals were, and we made a journey out of every place that had two pins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/sites/about/last_chance_to_see.shtml|title=BBC ''Last Chance to See'' – About – Background|accessdate=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journeys undertaken were to see:
* The [[aye-aye]] in Madagascar
* The [[Komodo dragon]] on the island of [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] in Indonesia
* The [[kakapo]] in New Zealand
* The [[mountain gorilla]] in [[Zaire]]
* The [[northern white rhinoceros]] in Zaire
* The [[baiji|Yangtze river dolphin]] in China
* The [[Rodrigues flying fox|Rodrigues fruit bat]] on the island of [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]], [[Mauritius]]
* The [[Amazonian manatee]] in Brazil
* The [[Juan Fernández fur seal]] on the [[Juan Fernández Islands]], Chile
==Radio==
The aye-aye programme was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 1 November 1985 as a pilot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/sites/radio/aye_aye.shtml|title=BBC - Last Chance to See - Radio - Natural Selection: In Search of the Aye-aye|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; six further episodes were then broadcast in 1989:

The mountain gorilla and northern white rhino, although the subject of a chapter in the book, did not feature in the radio series.
==Book==
In 1990, an accompanying book was published in the UK, describing the various adventures that duo had encountered on journeys, often with a comic tone. The book covers most of the radio episodes, but excludes the Juan Fernández fur seal and the Amazonia Manatee.  It includes some colour photographs taken by Carwardine.

The first American hardcover edition was published by Harmony Books in 1991 (under {{ISBN|0-517-58215-5}}) and the first German paperback edition was published in 1992 by Heyne (under {{ISBN|3-453-06115-2}}). These editions carry slightly different photographs of the journeys. An abridged audiobook, read by Adams, was also published.

In the posthumous biography and essay collection, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', Adams describes ''Last Chance to See'' as his favourite work.

== CD ROM ==
[[File:Last Chance to See Voyager front.jpg|thumb|200px|The front cover of the CD-ROM box set edition of ''Last Chance to See'' for computers running Windows 3.1 or later.]]

[[The Voyager Company]] also published a 2 CD-ROM set (for Microsoft [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.1]] and [[System 6|Macintosh System 6]]), in 1992, featuring over 800 still photographs, Adams reading the nearly complete book, Carwardine reading fact files on the species they searched like side bars, and extracts from the BBC Radio 4 series.

== Television series ==
{{Main|Last Chance to See (TV series)}}

In 2009, the BBC broadcast a TV follow-up series, in which [[Stephen Fry]], a friend of the late Adams, accompanies Carwardine on a journey to see what has changed in the 20 years since the radio broadcasts. The series excludes the Rodrigues fruit bat, the Yangtze river dolphin, which is "in all probability extinct", and the Juan Fernandez fur seal, which had proved embarrassingly easy for Adams and Carwardine to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/sites/about/news_sept2008.shtml|title=BBC ''Last Chance to See'' – About – September 2008|accessdate=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leadbeater's possum''' (''Gymnobelideus leadbeateri'') is a critically endangered [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] largely restricted to small pockets of [[Eucalyptus delegatensis|alpine ash]], [[eucalyptus regnans|mountain ash]], and [[Eucalyptus pauciflora|snow gum]] forests in the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], Australia, north-east of Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Macfarlane |first1=Malcolm |last2=Smith |first2=Jill |last3=Lowe |first3=Kim |title=Leadbeater's Possum Recovey Plan |date=2 July 1997 |publisher=Flora and Fauna Program, Department of Natural Resources and Environment |location=Victoria |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/32bd48e9-293f-4757-bd02-1b174bddc467/files/leadbeaters-possum.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]], [[Relict (biology)|relict]], and non-gliding, and, as the only species in the [[Petauridae|petaurid]] genus ''Gymnobelideus'', represents an ancestral form. Formerly, Leadbeater's possums were moderately common within the very small areas they inhabited; their requirement for year-round food supplies and tree-holes to take refuge in during the day restricts them to mixed-age wet [[sclerophyll]] forest with a dense mid-story of ''[[Acacia]]''. The species was named  in 1867 after John Leadbeater, the then taxidermist at the [[Museum Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hackett | first = Des | authorlink=Des Hackett | title = Leadbeater's Possum: Bred To Be Wild | editor = Peter Preuss | year = 2006 | publisher=Trafford Publishing | isbn = 1-4120-8382-6 | pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also go by the common name of '''fairy possum'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyndale-Biscoe|first=Hugh|title=Life of marsupials|year=2004|publisher=CSIRO publishing|isbn=0-643-06257-2|chapter=Pygmy possums and sugar gliders: pollen eaters and sap suckers |page=[{{google books|KqtlPZJ9y8EC|page=203|plainurl=yes}} 203] |via=Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 March 1971, the State of Victoria made the Leadbeater's possum its [[List of Australian mammal emblems|faunal emblem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Delacombe |first1=Rohan |author1-link=Rohan Delacombe |last2=Bolte |first2=Henry |author2-link=Henry Bolte |date=10 March 1971 |title=Faunal Emblems for the State of Victoria |website=Victoria Government Gazette – Online Archive 1836–1997 |publisher=State Library of Victoria |url=http://gazette.slv.vic.gov.au/images/1971/V/general/20.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Milman |first=Oliver |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/26/logging-pushing-possum-towards-extinction |title=Government-backed logging 'pushing rare possum towards extinction |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Leadbeater's possum is thought to have evolved about 20 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to save a forest fairy from extinction |url=https://www.wilderness.org.au/articles/how-save-forest-fairy-extinction |work=The Wilderness Society |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not discovered until 1867 and was originally known only through five specimens, the last one collected in 1909.{{r|ley196412}}&lt;ref name="Friends"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about Leadbeater's Possum|url=http://leadbeaters.org.au/facts/|work=Help save Leadbearer's Possum|publisher=Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum Inc.|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time on, the fear that it might be extinct gradually grew into near-certainty after the swamps and wetlands in Australia around [[Bass River (Victoria)|Bass River]] in south-west [[Gippsland]] were drained for farming in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="weekes"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Weekes | first=Peter | title=State's emblem nearly extinct | newspaper=The Sunday Age |location=Melbourne | page=1 | date=5 August 2007 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/states-emblem-nearly-extinct/2007/08/04/1185648212901.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Black Friday (1939)|1939 Black Friday fires]], the species was thought to have been extinct.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lostandfoundnature.com/story_leadbeaters.html|title=Lost &amp; Found - Once upon a time, there was an adventurer|last=Lost &amp; Found|first=|date=|website=lostandfoundnature.com/story_leadbeaters.html|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on 3 April 1961, a member of the species was rediscovered by naturalist Eric Wilkinson in the forests near [[Cambarville]], and the first specimen in more than 50 years was captured later in the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindenmayer |first=David |title=Wildlife + Woodchips: Leadbeater's Possum— A Test Case for Sustainable Forestry |publisher=University of New South Wales Press |date=1996 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ley196412"&gt;{{Cite magazine

In 1961, a colony was discovered near [[Marysville, Victoria|Marysville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Anonymous--&gt; |title=Leadbeater's Possum &lt;!--|accessdate=26 September 2013 --&gt; |newspaper=Herald Sun|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive searches since then have found the existing population in the highlands. However, the availability of suitable habitat is critical: forest must be neither too old nor too young, with conservation efforts for Leadbeater’s possum involving protection of remaining old-growth stands, and maintenance of younger stands that are allowed to attain hollow-bearing age.&lt;ref name="Macfarlane MA, Smith J, Lowe K 1998"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macfarlane |first1=M.A. |last2=Smith |first2=J. |last3=Lowe |first3=K. |year=1998 |title=Leadbeater's Possum Recovery Plan, 1998–2002 |publisher=Department of Natural Resources and Environment |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of 40-year-old regrowth (for food) and large dead trees left still standing after the fires (for shelter and nesting) allowed the Leadbeater's possum population to expand to an estimated peak of about 7500 in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater's Possum"&gt;{{cite web |website=Australian Government, Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=273 |title=Leadbeater's Possum |access-date=30 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From its peak in the 1980s, the Leadbeater's possum population was expected to further decline rapidly, by as much as 90%,&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; due to a habitat bottleneck. The population has dropped sharply since 1996.&lt;ref name="weekes"/&gt;  Particularly, the February 2009 [[Black Saturday bushfires]] destroyed 43% of Leadbeater's possums' habitat in the Central Highlands, halving the wild population to 1,500.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2013"/&gt; A study in 2014 concluded there is a 92% chance the Leadbeater's ecosystem in the Victoria central highlands will collapse within 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leadbeater’s possum habitat ‘almost certain to collapse’ due to logging, fires |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/07/leadbeaters-possum-habitat-almost-certain-to-collapse-due-to-logging-fires |work=Guardian |date=7 November 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habits==
Leadbeater's possums are rarely seen as they are nocturnal, fast-moving, and occupy the upper story of some of the tallest forest trees in the world.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; They have an average body length of 33&amp;nbsp;cm (13 inches) with the tail included.&lt;ref name="helmetedhoneyeater.org.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadbeater's Possum|url=http://www.helmetedhoneyeater.org.au/leadbeaters_possum.htm|work=Leadbeater's Possum|publisher=Friends of the Helmeted Honeyeater inc.|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live in small family colonies of up to 12 individuals,&lt;ref name="Friends"/&gt; including one [[Monogamy|monogamous]] breeding pair. Mating occurs only once a year, with a maximum of two joeys being born to each pair.&lt;ref name="helmetedhoneyeater.org.au"/&gt; All members sleep together in a nest made out of shredded bark in a tree hollow, anywhere from 6 to 30 metres above ground level and roughly in the centre of a territory of 3 hectares, which they defend actively. The society of Leadbeater's possums is [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]]: each group is dominated by only one female Leadbeater's possum that is active in expelling outsiders.&lt;ref name="Friends"/&gt; Other juvenile females are weaned off before they reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref name="ADW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadbeater's Possum|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Gymnobelideus_leadbeateri/|work=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, female Leadbeater's possums are more aggressive in nature, often engaging in frequent fights with other females, including their own daughters. Due to the constant attacks, young females are forced to leave much earlier than their male brothers, which results in the extremely high male to female ratio of 3:1.&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt;

Solitary Leadbeater's possums have difficulty surviving: when young males disperse at about 15 months of age, they tend either to join another colony as a supernumerary member, or to gather together into bachelor groups while they wait to find a mate.

At dusk, Leadbeater's possums emerge from the nest and spread out to forage in the sub-canopy, often making substantial leaps from tree to tree (they require continuous [[understory]] to travel). Their diet is omnivorous: feeding on a range of wattle saps and exudates, [[lerp (biology)|lerps]], and a high proportion of [[arthropod]]s which they find under the loose bark of eucalypts, including spiders, crickets, termites and beetles. Plant exudates make up 80% of their energy intake, but the protein provided by the arthropods is essential for successful breeding.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater's Possum"/&gt;

Births are usually timed for the beginning of winter (May and June) or late spring (October and November). Most litters are of one or two young, which stay in the pouch for 80 to 90 days, and first emerge from the nest following this. Young, newly independent Leadbeater's possums are very vulnerable to [[owl]]s.

{{As of|2013|post=,}} Leadbeater's possums are found in three habitat types: lowland swamp gum, of Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve; montane ash forest, wet [[sclerophyll]] forest dominated by [[mountain ash]], [[shining gum]] and [[alpine ash]] with a dense mid-story of acacia species; sub-alpine woodlands of [[Mount Baw Baw]], [[Lake Mountain (Victoria)|Lake Mountain]] and [[Mount Bullfight]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Threats==

Leadbeater's possums and their forest habitat have been the subject of the largest [[longitudinal study]] of any species in the world—conducted by [[David Lindenmayer]], a professor at the [[Australian National University]], and his research assistants since 1983. Hundreds of peer reviewed scientific papers, journal articles and books have resulted from the years of data collection by the ANU team. Their findings show that the availability of suitable habitat is critical: forest must be neither too old nor too young, with conservation efforts for Leadbeater’s possums involving protection of remaining old-growth stands, and maintenance of younger stands that are allowed to attain hollow-bearing age.&lt;ref name="Macfarlane MA, Smith J, Lowe K 1998"/&gt; [[Clearfell logging]] and [[salvage logging]] (after bushfires) have been proven by the researchers to have been the greatest threat to the possums' conservation in the wild over the last three decades of the 20th century.

===Habitat loss===
[[File:Leadbeater's Possum called George - taxidermied 02.JPG|thumb| George was found dead but intact on the side of a logging road about 2011 in the Victorian Central Highlands. It is assumed that George's home in the mountain ash ([[Eucalyptus regnans]]) forests was a victim of logging, and as his home was being carted away he fell off the logging truck.]]
The entire Central Highlands population distribution is confined to a 70 by 80 kilometre area. With 43% of its known Central Highlands habitat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=95950 |title=Last captive Leadbeater's possum dies |website=9 News |author=AAP |author-link=Australian Associated Press |publisher=ninemsn Pty Ltd |date=15 April 2006 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 5 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405140432/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=95950 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; destroyed in the [[Black Saturday bushfires|bushfires]] of February 2009 – large areas of forest around [[Toolangi, Victoria|Toolangi]], [[Marysville, Victoria|Marysville]], [[Narbethong|Narbethong, Cambarville]] and [[Healesville]] – the species' status is currently in doubt.&lt;ref name="theaustralian 2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25040273-30417,00.html |title=A million native animals may have died in Victorian bushfires |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |date=11 February 2009 |work=The Australian |accessdate=12 February 2009 |publisher=News Limited |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214190625/http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C25040273-30417%2C00.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in December 2012,  David Lindenmayer and Zoos Victoria's threatened species biologist, Dan Harley, submitted an application to the federal government for a revision of the species status, providing evidence that it should be relisted as [[critically endangered]]. The then minister for the environment, [[Tony Burke]], agreed with the nomination and forwarded the application to the scientific committee of the EPBC Act requesting urgent consideration. On 22 April 2015, it was decided to relist the species as critically endangered.&lt;ref name=Hunt2015&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/hunt/2015/mr20150422.html |title=Government moves to save Victoria's iconic Leadbeater's possum |first=Greg |last=Hunt |author-link=Greg Hunt |date=22 April 2015 |work=Minister for the Environment | accessdate=23 April 2015 |publisher=Department of the Environment and Energy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only remaining population outside the Central Highlands is located at [[Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve]]. Harley has estimated this population to be fewer than 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morton |first=Adam |url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/conservation/hello-possum-youre-an-emblem-of-extinction-20101001-1614u.html |title=Hello possum, you're an emblem of extinction |newspaper=The Age |date=2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logging===
As the species is [[endangered]] and occupies a restricted range,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindenmayer |first1=D.B. |last2=Smith |first2=A.P. |last3=Craig |first3=S.A. |last4=Lumsden |first4=L.F. |title=A survey of the distribution of Leadbeater's possum, Gymnobelideus leadbeateri McCoy in the Central Highlands of Victoria | journal=Victorian Naturalist | volume=106 | year=1989 | pages=174–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[logging]] continues to pose a critical threat to the Leadbeater's possum. The logging in 1993 of "much of the possum's habitat, known as zone one" a five hectare reserve east of [[Powelltown, Victoria|Powelltown]], followed a "mapping error".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=O'Neill | first=Graeme | title=Rare possum's habitat destroyed by mistake | newspaper=The Age |location=Melbourne | pages=5 | date=12 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author Peter Preuss stated that the possum's population faltered in 1997 with current habitat (limited to a 50-square-kilometre area) under threat from logging. He emphasised the need to relaunch a breeding program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/death-puts-spotlight-on-leadbeater-plight/2006/04/15/1144521549747.html| last=Elder | first=John | title=Death puts spotlight on Leadbeater plight | newspaper=The Sunday Age |location=Melbourne | page=5 | date=16 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a joint federal and state government plan to save it, since the 1980s, the Leadbeater's possum population halved to around 2000{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} even before the Black Saturday fires. Many more were killed early in 2007 when the government-backed enterprise company, [[VicForests]], bulldozed large firebreaks through Leadbeater's monitoring stations following the Christmas fires – firebreaks and clear-felling also prevent breeding with nearby colonies.&lt;ref name="weekes"/&gt;

[[File:David Lindenmeyer DSC 1882.JPG|thumb|150px|[[David Lindenmayer]] talking about the preservation of the Leadbeater's possum in Melbourne]]
[[David Lindenmayer]] (Australian National University) has argued that the need for nest boxes indicates that logging practices are not ecologically sustainable for conserving hollow-dependent species like the Leadbeater's possum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = David Lindenmayer | title = Comment – Economics of a nest-box program for the conservation of an endangered species: a re-appraisal | journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research | volume = 32 | pages = 2244–2247 |date=December 2002 | doi = 10.1139/x02-142 | last1=Lindenmayer |first1=D.B. | last2 = MacGregor | first2 = C. | last3 = Gibbons | first3 = P. | issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that clear-felling operations, such as the logging run in [[state forest]] between the [[Yarra Ranges National Park]] and Mount Bullfight Conservation Reserve in February 2006, led to the deaths of most possums in the area—"Adult animals have a strong affinity with their home range and are reluctant to move".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutchison |first=Tracee |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/a-possum-stares-extinction-in-the-face-/2006/02/17/1140151809030.html |title=A possum stares extinction in the face |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=18 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salvage logging]] since the fires has posed a further risk to this extremely diminished population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindenmayer |first1=David |last2=Banks |first2=Sam |last3=McBurney |first3=Lachlan |last4=Blair |first4=David |title=After the fire: Leadbeater's long journey |journal=Ecos |issue=157 |pages=1–5 |date=25 October 2010 |url=http://www.ecosmagazine.com/?paper=EC10020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Clearcutting|clear-felling]] also approved by VicForests in the few remaining unburnt areas, such as the Kalatha Creek area of [[Toolangi State Forest]] in 2010, a move opposed by the [[Yarra Ranges Shire Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yarraranges.vic.gov.au/News_Directory/Call_to_stop_logging_Toolangi |title=Call to stop logging Toolangi |date=18 June 2010 |website=Welcome to Yarra Ranges |publisher=Yarra Ranges Shire Council |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126122010/http://www.yarraranges.vic.gov.au/News_Directory/Call_to_stop_logging_Toolangi |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leadbeaters.org.au/faunal-emblem-threatened-the-animal-victims-of-black-saturday |title=Faunal Emblem Threatened: The animal victims of Black Saturday |date=18 June 2010 |website=Friends of Leadbeater's Possum |quote=Transcript of ABC TV Broadcast: 22/05/2009 Reporter: Kate Arnott }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 MyEnvironment challenged [[VicForests]]' operations in three planned coupes in the Toolangi forest in the supreme court. The basis of their claim being that "VicForests did not undertake adequate pre-logging surveys prior to logging in an area that we claim meets Leadbeater’s habitat and therefore should not have been logged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=MyEnvironment |url=http://www.myenvironment.net.au/index.php/me/Leadbeater-s-Possum2 |title=Leadbeater's Possum |access-date=30 August 2013 |publisher=MyEnvironment Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed logging is to supply (taxpayer subsidised) pulp to manufacture 'Reflex' copy paper—a product of Australian Paper owned by the Japanese company, [[Nippon Paper Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-06/toolangi-logging-threatens-rare-possum2c-court-told/3813806 |title=Toolangi logging threatens rare possum, court told |last=Farnsworth |first=Sarah | date=6 February 2012 |work=ABC News | accessdate=16 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the case, film was recorded of a Leadbeater's possum in the contested coupe area. The case was lost by MyEnvironment due to inconsistencies in the wording of the Leadbeater's Possum Action Statement (10 years out of date) and the forestry prescriptions adhered to by VicForests. The group immediately appealed the decision by the presiding judge Justice Osborne, and the supreme court accepted there was a sound basis for an appeal to the original determination. A supreme court appeal was heard on 24 June 2013 before three judges and MyEnvironment was represented in court by [[Julian Burnside]] QC. The appeal was lost.{{citation needed |date=April 2017}}

===Feral cats===
Previously [[Cats in Australia#Feral cats|feral cats]] had only been considered a peripheral threat to Leadbeater's possums, but recent research has found video evidence of cats preying on possums leaving nesting boxes, and of possum remains in stomach contents of trapped feral cats. It is now considered that cats may be a more significant threat to possum populations, particularly in areas already disturbed by logging or bushfires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-07-26/feral-cat-leadbeaters-possum/10034052?section=science Feral cats filmed preying on nesting Leadbeater's possums] ''ABC News'', 26 July 2018. Retrieved 27 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
On 27 June 2013 the [[Denis Napthine|Napthine]] led State government passed legislative changes to allow VicForests access to Victoria's forests for the next 25 years and to be self monitoring (this follows the success of other recent cases preventing logging of remaining possum habitat). According to [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]], "the Victorian government ... [is] virtually signing the death warrant of the remaining 500 or so Leadbeater's possums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Warrick |last=Jordan |url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/native-woodchipping-sector-in-rapid-decline-20111228-1pcu0.html |title=Native woodchipping sector in rapid decline |newspaper=The Age |date=29 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes to the ''Sustainable Forests (Timber) Act 2004'' will have implications not only for the Leadbeater's possum but to the biodiversity, carbon storage and water catchments of the forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/web_notes/LDMS/PubPDocs_Arch.nsf/5da7442d8f61e92bca256de50013d008/ca2570ce0018ac6dca257b4f001cddba!OpenDocument |title=Sustainable Forests (Timber) Amendment Bill 2013 |date=28 June 2013 |website=Victorian Legislation and Parliamentary Documents |publisher=Victoria State Government }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milman|first=Oliver|title=Conservationists fear Victoria's cuts to logging green tape|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/27/conservation-victoria-logging-endangered-species|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=Guardian UK|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
On 22 April 2015, [[Greg Hunt]], the Minister for the Environment, announced that the Leadbeater's possum would be listed as a critically endangered species under the EPBC Act.&lt;ref name=Hunt2015/&gt; Of its [[Eucalyptus regnans|ash]] forest habitat about 30% is protected, while the rest is allocated to logging. The habitat of a small isolated, genetically distinct, population is protected within the [[Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve]].&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; In 2013 it was proposed to create the "[[Great Forest National Park]]" to protect the mountain ash forest habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Arup |first=Tom |url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/push-for-national-park-to-save-possum-20130828-2sqy4.html |title=Push for national park to save possum |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=29 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park would protect the area between [[Kinglake National Park|Kinglake]], [[Baw Baw National Park|Baw Baw]] and [[Lake Eildon National Park|Eildon]] [[national parks]], which is also important for Melbourne's drinking water and as a [[carbon sink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatforestnationalpark.com.au/index.html |title=Great Forest National Park |publisher=My/Forests Inc |access-date=31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, the Friends of Leadbeater's Possum community group has been active in raising the animal's profile and lobbying for its conservation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Through a joint community/government program, "Project Possum" has installed approximately 200 plastic nest boxes in the wild. Many of these nest boxes were paid for by a community fundraising campaign. The nest boxes are primarily used to assist with ongoing population monitoring and supplement the declining forest habitat. Project Possum has targeted two forest types: montane ash forest (i.e. Mt Ritchie, Dowey Spur, Ben Cairn) and sub-alpine woodland (i.e. Mount Baw Baw, Lake Mountain, and Mount Bullfight). The nest boxes are routinely checked for habitation every one or two years. Nest boxes located in the sub-alpine woodland tend to have a high uptake, while those located in montane ash forest have very limited uptake. An additional 50 nest boxes are due for installation in 2015–16.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The forestry industry and [[Barnaby Joyce]] advocate for the Leadbeater's possum to be taken off the critically endangered list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cox |first1=Lisa |title=Leadbeater's possum: conservationists say draft report proves endangered status |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/09/leadbeaters-possum-conservations-say-draft-report-proves-endangered-status |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=8 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Captive breeding ===
[[Des Hackett]] is credited as the first person to successfully breed the Leadbeater's possum in captivity.  In May 2006, the last Australian specimen at the time, held at [[Healesville Sanctuary]], died. In January 2010, Kasia, at the time the last captive Leadbeater's possum worldwide, died at [[Toronto Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadbeater's Possum |url=http://www.zoo.org.au/leadbeaters |website=Zoos Victoria |accessdate=18 September 2011 |date=19 September 2011 |archive-date=11 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011032038/http://zoo.org.au/leadbeaters |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}}  {{citation needed span|date=April 2017|text=The predation in early 2012 by a feral cat}} of the few [[Lake Mountain (Victoria)|Lake Mountain]] Leadbeater's possums remaining after the 2009 bushfire led to three remaining individuals being taken into captivity for their own protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=13 February 2012 |title= Three Leadbeater's Possums from Lake Mountain brought into care |website=Zoos Victoria |publisher=Victoria State Government |url=https://www.zoo.org.au/news/three-leadbeaters-possums-from-lake-mountain-brought-into-care }}&lt;/ref&gt; One animal has since died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Endangered possums taken to wildlife sanctuary|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-13/endangered-possums-taken-to-wildlife-sanctuary/3826642|accessdate=14 February 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}} There are no plans to release the remaining two animals despite a further two colonies of Leadbeater's possums having recently been located at Lake Mountain in remnant gully vegetation. These two Lake Mountain animals are now on public display in the Nocturnal House as ambassadors for the species. Healesville Sanctuary's captive breeding program for Leadbeater's possums recommenced in May 2012 and now comprises 6 individuals from the genetically distinct [[Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve|Yellingbo]] population. {{As of|2015|05|post=,}} they are housed as pairs in large enclosures off display, but are yet to breed.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

This list is of professional and academic credentials in the field of [[psychology]] and allied fields in [[North America]], including [[psychotherapy]], [[counseling]], [[social work]], and [[family therapy]].

==Degrees==
Although undergraduate (Bachelor's) degrees for psychology and counseling exist, in most jurisdictions the minimum requirement for professional licensure is a graduate degree (master's or doctorate).

;Associate degrees
* Associate of Art (AA) or Associate of Science (AS): Associate degrees are usually two-year degrees and are often offered at community colleges. Many choose to start with associate degrees in counseling psychology, clinical psychology, or related fields, before starting work on degrees which require further education. An associate degree is usually not required in order to enroll in a bachelor's degree program. An associate degree does not meet the requirements for clinical practice or licensure.
;Bachelor's degrees

*Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BS): Bachelor's degrees usually require four years of study and are required prior to entry into graduate programs where Master's or Doctoral degrees may be earned. Although a person may earn a bachelor's degree in counseling psychology, clinical psychology or related fields in mental health, a person may have had a major concentration in another field of study and still qualify for entry into a graduate school for study in the area of psychology. A bachelor's degree does not meet the requirements for clinical practice or licensure.
;Master's degrees
* [[Master of Arts]] (MA) or [[Master of Science]] (MS) in behavior analysis, [[counseling psychology]], [[clinical psychology]], clinical counseling, [[educational psychology]], marriage and [[family therapy]], or a related field. A master's degree in the specified area may require completion of a master's thesis, dissertation and/or project.
* Master of Science in Counseling (MSC)
* Master of Marriage and Family Therapy (MMFT)
* [[Master of Social Work]] (MSW)
* Master of Arts in Professional Counseling (MAPC)
* Masters of Science in Education (MSEd)
; Doctoral degrees
* [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD): A Doctor of Philosophy degree in psychology prepares the student to conduct independent research and to provide professional services (consultation, assessment, diagnosis, therapy). PhD degrees are also awarded in social work and marriage and family therapy. To use the title "psychologist," individuals must have graduated specifically from a psychology program and meet their state requirements and obtain a license to practice psychology.
* [[Doctor of Psychology]] (PsyD): Requires the student to create relevant and helpful research that contributes to the existing body of knowledge or scholarship in an area.  At one time, the PsyD was assumed to not require significant research activities, focusing more on advanced clinical training.  However, most academic institutions offering a PsyD today require the completion of a dissertation suitable for publishing.  To use the title "psychologist," individuals must meet their state requirements and obtain a license to practice psychology. 
* [[Doctor of Education]] (EdD) - Similar to PhD but granted by a college of education within a university.  This degree is based on the scientist-practitioner model which prepares the holder for both types of work, i.e., clinical as well as research.
* Doctor of Marriage and Family Therapy (DMFT)
* [[Doctor of Social Work]] (DSW)
* Licentiate in Psychology or Psychologist (LPsy) – professional title used in EU and Latin American countries and equivalent of PsyD in the United States

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2642">{{GeoGroup}}This '''List of impact craters in Antarctica''' includes only unconfirmed and theoretical impact sites in [[Antarctica]] and the surrounding waters of the [[Southern Ocean]]. There are not yet any confirmed impact sites in Antarctica according to the [[Earth Impact Database]].

== Unconfirmed impact craters ==
The following craters are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database.  Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those with difficulty collecting evidence generally are known for some time before becoming listed.  However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.

This is a list of '''important publications''' in [[geology]], organized by field.

Some reasons why a particular publication might be regarded as important:
*'''Topic creator''' &amp;ndash; A publication that created a new topic
*'''Breakthrough''' &amp;ndash; A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly
*'''Influence''' &amp;ndash; A publication which has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of geology.&lt;!-- The text of this lead section was substituted into this page from [[Template:List of publications intro]]. --&gt;&lt;!--An entry in this list should include citations for statements about the importance of the publication. Otherwise it may be challenged and removed.--&gt;

Compilations of important publications can be found in [[List of important publications in geology#Further reading|Further reading]].

::First publication to clearly articulate the principle of [[deep time]], and to recognize that rocks record the evidence of the past action of processes which still operate today. These ideas were to grow into the idea of [[Uniformitarianism]]. Hutton is widely regarded as the "Father of Modern Geology".

::The work's subtitle was "An Attempt to Explain the Former Changes of the Earth's Surface by Reference to Causes now in Operation", and this explains Lyell's impact on science: he was, along with the earlier [[John Playfair]], the major advocate of the then-controversial idea of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], that the Earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces acting over a very long period of time. This was in contrast to [[catastrophism]], a geologic idea that went hand-in-hand with the [[age of the Earth]] suggested by [[Bible|biblical]] chronology. In various revised editions (twelve in all, through 1872), ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' was the most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century, and did much to put geology on a modern footing. [[Charles Darwin]] frequently acknowledged his deep debt to this book.&lt;ref&gt;From the dedication in [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]]: TO CHARLES LYELL, ESQ., F.R.S.: This Second Edition Is Dedicated with Grateful Pleasure, As an Acknowledgment That the Chief Part of Whatever Scientific Merit This Journal and the Other Works of the Author May Possess, Has Been Derived from Studying the Well-Known and Admirable PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY."&lt;/ref&gt;

::The speech recorded by this volume of Transactions represents the final version of the theory of the [[age of the Earth]] which Thomson has been refining since 1862. In it, he proposed that the age of the Earth was "more than 20 and less than 40 million year old, and probably much nearer 20 than 40".&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple, G. Brent. The age of the Earth. Stanford University Press, 1994. pp. 14, 43&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis was based on the time it would take the Earth to cool from a completely molten state, and his estimate was consistent with a number of other physical estimates from, amongst others, [[George Darwin]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], and [[Simon Newcomb]]. This strikingly young age put Thomson in direct conflict with both [[Uniformitarianism|Uniformitarian]] geologists and [[evolutionary biologists]], both of whose theories required much longer spans of time to take effect.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple, 1994, p. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt; This paradox of the age of the Earth was resolved only by fuller understanding of the roles of [[convection]] and [[radioactivity]] in the planet's interior in the early 20th century, and it required understanding of [[thermonuclear fusion]] in the Sun developed only in the 1930s to fully explain the stability of the whole solar system over multi-billion year timescales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=Frank D.|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=105|pages=13155–13158|year=2000|issue=B6|doi=10.1029/2000JB900028|title=Kelvin's age of the Earth paradox revisited|bibcode = 2000JGR...10513155S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::First book to show geological evidence that some [[continents]] were linked with each other: Suess set out his belief that across geologic time, the rise and fall of sea levels were mappable across the earth—that is, that the periods of ocean transgression and regression were correlateable from one continent to another. His theory was based upon ''glossopteris'' fern fossils occurring in South America, Africa, and India. His explanation was that the three lands were once connected in a supercontinent, which he named ''Gondwána-Land'' (nowadays usually written [[Gondwana|''Gondwanaland'']]). However Suess mistakenly believed that the oceans flooded the spaces currently between those lands.
::Moreover, Suess expressed views in this book on the connection between Africa and Europe. Eventually, he concluded that the Alps to the north were once at the bottom of an ocean, of which the Mediterranean was a remnant. Suess was not correct in his analysis, which was predicated upon the notion of "contractionism"—the idea that the Earth is cooling down and, therefore, contracting. Nevertheless, he is credited with postulating the earlier existence of the [[Tethys Ocean]], which he named in 1893.
::Suess also introduced in this book the concept of the [[biosphere]], which was later extended by [[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vladimir I. Vernadsky]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sengor|first1=Thomas Hofman,Gunter Bloschl, Lois Lammerhuber, Werner E. Piller, A.M.

::''Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane'' was the second book to marshall considerable geological evidence that the [[continents]] are mobile relative to each other on the surface of the Earth. His theory was based upon numerous matches between the [[topography]], [[paleontology]] and past [[climate]] of continents now separated by [[oceans]]. At the time of publication his ideas were not taken seriously by most of the geological community as he could not provide a mechanism for continental motion, but his ideas form the foundations of the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]].

MeerKAT supports a wide range of observing modes, including deep continuum, polarisation and [[spectral line]] imaging, [[pulsar timing]] and transient searches. A range of standard data products are provided, including an imaging pipeline. A number of "data spigots" are also available to support user-provided instrumentation. Significant design and qualification efforts are planned to ensure high reliability to achieve low operational cost and high availability.

* A dense inner component containing 70% of the dishes. These are distributed in a two-dimensional fashion with a [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian uv-distribution]] with a dispersion of 300 m, a shortest baseline of 29 m and a longest baseline of 1&amp;nbsp;km.
* An outer component containing 30% of the dishes. These are also distributed in a two-dimensional Gaussian uv-distribution with a dispersion of 2 500 m and a longest baseline of 8&amp;nbsp;km.

For Phase 2, seven additional antennas will be added to extend the longest baselines to about 20&amp;nbsp;km.

==Construction schedule==
To acquire experience in the construction of interferometric telescopes, members of the Karoo Array Telescope constructed the [[South African Astronomical Observatory#Phased Experimental Demonstrator (PED)|Phased Experimental Demonstrator]] (PED) at the [[South African Astronomical Observatory]] in [[Cape Town]] between 2005 and 2007.&lt;ref name="ped"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kat.ac.za/ped/about.html|title=History of PED|publisher=Karoo Array Telescope|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2007, the {{convert|15|m}} eXperimental Development Model Telescope (XDM) was built at the [[Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory]] to serve as a testbed for MeerKAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartrao.ac.za/xdm/|title=Progress with KAT – XDM|publisher=[[Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory]]|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the MeerKAT Precursor Array (MPA – also known as KAT-7), on the site started in August 2009.&lt;ref name="mcen-May-2009"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/radio-telescope-project-advances-with-issue-of-tender-2009-05-22|title=Radio telescope project advances with issue of tender|last=Campbell|first=Keith|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Martin Creamer Engineering News|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010 four of the seven first dishes were linked together as an integrated system to produce its first interferometric image of an astronomical object. In Dec 2010, there was a successful detection of [[VLBI|very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)]] fringes between the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory 26 m dish and one of the KAT-7 dishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ska.ac.za/newsletter/issues/12/01.php First HartRAO-KAT-7 VLBI fringes signal new capability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311213531/http://www.ska.ac.za/newsletter/issues/12/01.php |date=11 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite original plans to complete MeerKAT by 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=1127&amp;tid=1146 Science and Technology Dept Budget Vote 2009/10 Speech, 18 June 2009]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; construction was suspended in late 2010 due to budget restructure. Science Minister Naledi Pandor denied the suspension marked any setback to the SKA project or 'external considerations'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121224212258/http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=14416&amp;tid=24047 Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project plans on schedule states Pandor 9 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; MeerKAT construction received no funding in 2010/11 and 2011/12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov.za/documents/national%20budget/2012/ene/FullENE.pdf South Africa National Budget – Estimates of National Expenditure, Table 34.6 "Research, Development and Innovation" page 766]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 South African National Budget projected that just 15 MeerKAT antennas would be completed by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov.za/documents/national%20budget/2012/ene/FullENE.pdf South Africa National Budget – Estimates of National Expenditure page 764]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last of the [[reinforced concrete]] foundations for the MeerKAT antennas was completed on 11 February 2014. Almost 5000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of concrete and over 570 tonnes of steel were used to build the 64 bases over a 9-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-02-meerkat-telescope-foundations.html |title=MeerKAT telescope foundations complete |publisher=Phys.org |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MeerKAT is planned to be completed in three phases. The first phase will include all the antennas but only the first receiver will be fitted. A processing bandwidth of 750&amp;nbsp;MHz is available. For the second and third phases, the remaining two receivers will be fitted and the processing bandwidth will be increased to at least 2&amp;nbsp;GHz, with a goal of 4&amp;nbsp;GHz. With construction of all sixty-four MeerKAT antennas complete, verification tests have begun to ensure the instruments are functioning correctly.&lt;ref name="SABC" /&gt; Following this, MeerKAT  will be commissioned in the second half of 2018 with the array then coming online for science operations.

MeerKAT will also participate in global VLBI operations with all major radio astronomy observatories around the world and will add considerably to the sensitivity of the global VLBI network. Further potential science objectives for MeerKAT are to participate in the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] and collaborate with [[NASA]] on downloading information from space probes.

==Overview==
The text focuses on subtle and invisible trends in demography, sociology, business, family life, technologies, human interactions, and many other areas—that are currently shaping the potential future the world and society. Overall, the authors try to categorize approximately 75 microtrends (hence the name of the book) seen in the modern world.

==WSJ column==
The book examines how small groups of people can trigger big changes. Specifically, Penn shows how a mere one percent of the American public, or 3 million people, can create a "microtrend" capable of launching a major business or even a new cultural movement, changing commercial, political and social landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.penguincatalogue.co.uk/lo/press/title.html?titleId=3877&amp;catalogueId=214|title=Microtrends |publisher=Penguin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 2008 to December 2009, Penn authored a regular online column for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' called "Microtrends", focusing on demographic trends in society and business. ''Microtrends'' appeared regularly in the Media &amp; Marketing section of the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsjmediakit.com/pdf/digital/press.20081211a.pdf|work=Wall Street Journal|title=Mark Penn to Author "Microtrends" Column for wsj.com | date=December 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote| "Microtrends" is a diligently researched tome chock-full of counterintuitive facts and findings that may radically alter the way you see the present, the future, and your places in both. The book’s 15 main chapters group microtrends in virtually every area of life, like "Love, Sex, and Relationships," "Politics," "Technology," "Education," "Food, Drink &amp; Diet" and "Looks and Fashion." ... "Microtrends" is the perfect bible for a game of not-so-trivial pursuits concerning the hidden sociological truths of modern times.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8645">'''Military art''' ({{ lang-fr|L'Art de la Guerre}}) (lit. art of war) is a field of [[Military theory|theoretical research]] and [[Military education and training|training]] methodology in [[military science]] used in the [[conduct of military operation]]s on land, in the maritime or air environments. Military art includes the study and application of the [[principles of warfare]] and [[laws of war]] that apply equally to the closely interrelated [[military strategy]], [[operational mobility|operational art]] and [[military tactics|tactics]]. Exercise of military art is highly dependent on the [[economics]] and [[logistics]] supporting the [[armed forces]], their [[military technology and equipment]], and reflects the social influences on the [[military organisation]] exercising military art. Often misunderstood due to its 19th-century perception as generally "including the entire subject of war",&lt;ref&gt;p.37, Halleck&lt;/ref&gt; it is primarily, as the term implies, the expression of [[creative thinking]] on the part of the [[Decision making|decision-makers]] in employing their forces,&lt;ref&gt;p.140, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt; with the map of the area of operations as a veritable [[Canvas#Canvas for painting|canvas]], and the movement of forces commonly marked on the map with arrows, as [[brush stroke]]s. Less imaginatively it was defined in France during the 19th century as &lt;blockquote&gt;
The art of war is the art of concentrating and employing, at the opportune moment, a superior force of troops upon the decisive point.&lt;ref&gt;p.7, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; and &lt;blockquote&gt;
The art of divining the intention of the enemy from slight indications is one which rarely misleads, and is one of the most precious attributes of [[military genius]].&lt;ref&gt;p.294, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not well known that many of the greatest military leaders in Europe and Asia, notably Japan, were themselves either accomplished [[artist]]s, or [[Art collector|collectors of art]].

In history, schools of thinking about military art can be divided during the ancient and medieval periods by the influence of [[infantry]] troops on tactics in Europe, and [[cavalry]] on tactics in [[Asia]], and the period commencing with the [[Early Modern period]] when firearms and artillery increasingly influenced employment of forces. The need for mobility, opportunity and decisiveness have tended to associate military art with offensive manoeuvre, cavalry, and therefore, before advent of late-19th century firearms, Asia.&lt;ref&gt;p.97, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe military art was primarily concerned with time of [[combat]], understanding the best way an [[occupied position]] can enhance [[Defense (military)|defensive potential]] of a small [[field army]] largely consisting of relatively [[Mobility (military)|low mobility]] troops, by often using [[high ground]], terrain [[choke point]]s or [[field entrenchment]]s. Due to relative lack of economic and logistic support, European military art theorists advocated [[Battle#Types|decisive battles]] that could bring a [[military campaign]] to a quick conclusion, thus reducing the economic cost of [[war]], notably through the [[shock tactics]] of the [[armoured cavalry]].
In Asia, due to a more developed and widespread [[horse breeding]] offering enhanced mobility, military art developed a more [[Offensive (military)|offensive-based]] way of thinking about military tactics, and military art was dominated by considerations of choosing [[point of attack]] and [[military communications]].

The confrontation between these two forms of military art that took place as a result of the [[Crusades]] and the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], and the contemporaneous introduction of [[artillery]] into warfare significantly changed thinking about military art in Europe, leading to wide-ranging experiments in [[tactical formation]] of troops, use of [[combined arms]] and exercise of [[maneuver warfare]] concepts and methods not only in tactics, but on a larger scale, including in use of naval forces. This later led to creation of European [[colonial empire]]s.

Although European military art on land can be argued not to have reached its developed stage until the 19th century in the attempt to defeat [[linear tactics]] that led to the [[First World War]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 115, Halleck&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimate sophistication during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]], great increases in the [[firepower]] of the European [[firearms]] and artillery were usually able to negate greater number and mobility of the Asian field forces, no-where more illustrated than during the [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|French Invasion of Egypt]] in 1798. The defining application of firepower and manoeuvre in military art became expressed during the conduct of [[strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II]] that sought to combine the shock of [[armoured warfare]] with mobility, and the traditional reliance on infantry in strengthened positions to first stop the German advances and during [[counter-attack]]s to achieve [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] of the enemy position, and in conducting [[deep operations]] to destroy the logistic support, literally starving German troops of supplies and ammunition, and forcing them to [[Surrender (military)|surrender]].

Military art in [[naval warfare]] likewise developed along the considerations of position versus speed, initially through use of [[galley]]s and later during the [[Age of Sail]]. However, increasingly [[naval tactics]] became dominated by the relative firepower of individual vessels, and this was demonstrated during the epic [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The use of naval forces in military art significantly expanded the [[scale of conflict]]s to global ranges. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries naval military art became concerned primarily with the firepower and the ability of ships to withstand it through use of increasing their [[armour]] until the introduction of [[naval aviation]] into consideration of [[naval battle]]s and [[naval strategy]].

Introduction of aircraft into [[warfare]] drastically altered the 19th century understanding of military art, and application of its principles. [[Aerial warfare]] became the ultimate solution to manoeuvre in delivery of firepower, and drastically increased the [[tempo of conflict]]s, making [[blitzkrieg]] possible during the Second World War. Aerial warfare also finally negated the advantage of a [[defensive position]] which left the defender as an easily detected and attacked target for the [[bomber]]s. While German [[industrial centres]] became just such targets for the Allied [[strategic bombing during World War II]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] the Soviet [[Red Army]] chose to adapt by developing concepts and methods suggested by theorists during the [[interwar period]] to a more offensive-based and dynamic conduct of operations coordinating ground and [[air offensive]]s.

The final development in military art came with the increased influence of the [[electronics]] and its implications for the ability by infantry to halt the breakthroughs using increasingly powerful [[infantry support weapon]]s, and the effect on the [[military communications]] by a new form of combat, [[electronic warfare]]. The potential of losing ability to exercise [[command and control]] over forces, particularly strategically significant forces, completely undermined much of the theoretical thinking of the Cold War. Some have argued that this was one of the factors, along with those of economic considerations, that eventually led to the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], and [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|Dissolution of the USSR]].

Since the end of the Cold War in Europe, application of military art has been sought primarily by conventional forces in combat operations against unconventional opponents, and this has many attempts to review [[military history]] in the effort to find solutions to successful conduct of operations against these forces.

PRIF. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Communities-and-Partners/Partners/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=25955 Peace Research Institute Frankfurt (PRIF)]. [[International Relations and Security Network]] Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It places special emphasis in its research work on arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament. From 1987 to 2002, the PRIF trained many young academics in countries having no non-proliferation expertise, organizing a network of European non-proliferation researchers. PRIF researchers have long-standing experience in political advice and consulting, having served, inter alia, in German delegations to [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]], [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|CTBT]], [[Chemical Weapons Convention|CWC]], [[Biological Weapons Convention|BWC]], [[Ottawa Treaty|Ottawa Convention]] and [[SALW]] gatherings, in the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Conference on Disarmament]] and in [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] Expert Groups.&lt;ref name="EU non-proliferation"/&gt;

== Organization ==
The Executive Director of the PRIF is Nicole Deitelhoff. Other members of the Executive Board are Christopher Daase, Susanne Boetsch, Peter Kreuzer, Sabine Mannitz and Jonas Wolff.

The Research Council is a body that includes all PRIF scholars. It makes decisions on the research program and on the projects of the individual research departments.

The Board of Trustees, consisting of Hesse’s Prime Minister, the Minister for Science and the Arts, and the Finance Minister of [[Hesse]], three public figures and three elected representatives from within the institute, supervises the management of the institution and approves its budget.

The Advisory Board supports the PRIF on the design and implementation of the institute's research programs. Four-year terms are by appointment of the Board of Trustees which is made up of eight scholars from Germany and abroad. The Advisory Board chairman is currently [[Thomas Risse]].

At the end of 2004, the PRIF was evaluated by a commission of the [[German Council of Science and Humanities]] and recommended for acceptance into the [[Leibniz Association]]. On January 1, 2009 the PRIF became a member institute in the scientific organization.

== Research Departments ==
Since 2009, PRIF devotes its work to the research program ''Just Democratic Peace'' which analyses justice-related conflicts and the ways in which peace and justice can be achieved at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsfk.de/en/research/research-program/|title=Research Programm|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research at the PRIF is broken down into seven departments:

* I: International Security 
* II: International Institutions 
* III: Transnational Actors 
* IV: Intrastate Conflict
* V: 'Glocal' Junctions
* VI: Non-Program-Bound Research
* VII: Knowledge Transfer

== Publications ==
In addition to anthologies and [[monograph]]s in the publication series "Studies of the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt," PRIF publishes approximately ten HSFK-Reports (PRIF Reports in English),as well as the series "HSFK-Standpunkte – Beiträge zum demokratischen Frieden" [PRIF Viewpoints – Articles on Democratic Peace, published in German only]. PRIF publications can be downloaded online or ordered directly from the institute’s web site. Print versions are also available in many libraries.

The State of Peace Report, which has been appearing since 1987, is the yearbook of five German peace research institutes. Besides PRIF, the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg (IFHS) and the Research Center of the Evangelical Studies Community in Heidelberg [[Forschungsstätte der Evangelischen Studiengemeinschaft|FEST]] are involved. Since 1999 the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) and the Institute for Development and Peace in Duisburg (INEF) have also been involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsfk.de/PRIF-Publications.179.0.html?&amp;L=1|title=PRIF Publications|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Peace Yearbook consists of an introductory statement followed by several analyses of current conflicts as well as foreign and security policy, supplemented by concrete policy recommendations. Since 2007, the [[Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung]] (German Foundation for Peace Research) has provided financial support for the State of Peace Report.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5711">In [[computer science]], a '''property testing''' algorithm for a [[decision problem]] is an [[algorithm]] whose [[query complexity]] to its input is much smaller than the [[Computational complexity theory#Measuring the size of an instance|instance size]] of the problem.  Typically property testing algorithms are used to decide if some mathematical object (such as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] or a [[boolean function]]) has a "global" property, or is "far" from having this property, using only a small number of "local" queries to the object.

For example, the following [[promise problem]] admits an algorithm whose query complexity is independent of the instance size (for an arbitrary constant ε &gt; 0):

:"Given a graph ''G'' on ''n'' vertices, decide if ''G'' is [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]], or ''G'' cannot be made bipartite even after removing an arbitrary subset of at most &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\tbinom n2&lt;/math&gt; edges of ''G''."

Property testing algorithms are central to the definition of [[probabilistically checkable proof]]s, as a probabilistically checkable proof is essentially a proof that can be verified by a property testing algorithm.

==Definition and variants==

Formally, a '''property testing algorithm''' with query complexity ''q''(''n'') and ''proximity parameter'' ε for a decision problem ''L''  is a [[randomized algorithm]] that, on input ''x'' (an instance of ''L'') makes at most ''q''(|''x''|) queries to ''x'' and behaves as follows:
* If ''x'' is in ''L'', the algorithm accepts ''x'' with probability at least ⅔.
* If ''x'' is ε-far from ''L'', the algorithm rejects ''x'' with probability at least ⅔.

Here, "''x'' is ε-far from ''L''" means that the Hamming distance between ''x'' and any string in ''L'' is at least ε|''x''|.

A property testing algorithm is said to have ''one-sided error'' if it satisfies the stronger condition that the accepting probability for instances ''x ∈ L'' is 1 instead of ⅔.

A property testing algorithm is said be ''non-adaptive'' if it performs all its queries before it "observes" any answers to previous queries. Such an algorithm can be viewed as operating in the following manner.  First the algorithm receives its input.  Before looking at the input, using its internal randomness, the algorithm decides which symbols of the input are to be queried.  Next, the algorithm observes these symbols.  Finally, without making any additional queries (but possibly using its randomness), the algorithm decides whether to accept or reject the input.

==Features and limitations==

The main efficiency parameter of a property testing algorithm is its query complexity, which is the maximum number of input symbols inspected over all inputs of a given length (and all random choices made by the algorithm).  One is interested in designing algorithms whose query complexity is as small as possible. In many cases the running time of property testing algorithms is [[Time complexity#Sub-linear time|sublinear]] in the instance length.  Typically, the goal is first to make the query complexity as small as possible as a function of the instance size ''n'', and then study the dependency on the proximity parameter ε.

Unlike other complexity-theoretic settings, the asymptotic query complexity of property testing algorithms is affected dramatically by the representation of instances.  For example, when ε = 0.01, the problem of testing bipartiteness of ''dense graphs'' (which are represented by their adjacency matrix) admits an algorithm of constant query complexity. In contrast, sparse graphs on ''n'' vertices (which are represented by their adjacency list) require property testing algorithms of query complexity &lt;math&gt;\Omega(\sqrt{n})&lt;/math&gt;.

The query complexity of property testing algorithms grows as the proximity parameter ε becomes smaller for all non-trivial properties.  This dependence on ε is necessary as a change of fewer than ε symbols in the input cannot be detected with constant probability using fewer than O(1/ε) queries.  Many interesting properties of dense graphs can be tested using query complexity that depends only on ε and not on the graph size ''n''.  However, the query complexity can grow enormously fast as a function of ε.  For example, for a long time the best known algorithm for testing if a graph does not [[Triangle-free graph|contain any triangle]] had a query complexity which is a [[Tetration|tower function]] of ''poly''(1/ε), and only in 2010 this has been improved to a tower function of ''log''(1/ε).  One of the reasons for this enormous growth in bounds is that many of the positive results for property testing of graphs are established using the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], which also has tower-type bounds in its conclusions.

{{italic title}}

'''''Quantum Philosophy''''' is a 2002 book by the physicist [[Roland Omnès]], in which he aims to show the non-specialist reader how modern developments in [[quantum mechanics]] allow the recovery of our common sense view of the world.

== Book contents ==
* '''Section I''' - a review of mathematics, epistemology and science from the classical to the early modern period.
* '''Section II''' - a review of the ineluctable rise of formalism in mathematics and in fundamental physical science, which, Omnès argues, was not a choice, but was forced on researchers by the nature of the subject matter.
* '''Section III''' - the central section of the book, in which the recovery of common sense, as outlined below, is presented.
* '''Section IV''' - a short section of reflections on possible future steps.

== Brief summary of Omnès' central argument ==
Omnès' project is not quite as it at first sounds. He is not trying to show that quantum mechanics itself can be understood in a common sense framework, quite the opposite. He argues that modern science has, necessarily, become more and more formal, and more and more remote from common sense, as it strives to make itself an accurate reflection of the physical world. But he argues that we have now come near enough to scaling the 'magnificent peaks' of the formal mathematics needed to describe reality for one thing to have finally become clear: it is now possible to demonstrate, formally, and starting from the underlying principles of quantum mechanics, that the laws of classical logic, classical probability and classical dynamics apply to objects at the macroscopic level.

As Omnès makes explicit, this is the exact opposite of the classical [[epistemology|epistemological]] project. It has always, up to now, been necessary to access reality by first presupposing the laws of classical common sense. Now finally, we can enter the world either at the formal level, or at the classical level, and we find that each entails the other: experiment has led to the quantum formalism; the quantum formalism now, finally, allows the recovery of the framework of classical reasoning under which the experiments took place.

Omnès emphasises throughout that no new principles, other than those described when quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s, are needed. Moreover, some additional principles which seemed to be required then (such as [[wavefunction collapse]], or its slightly more formal sister, wavefunction reduction) are no longer needed. ''Classical behaviour can now be recovered in a system described entirely by a single, [[Unitarity (physics)|unitary]] (time-reversible) wavefunction.''

The mathematical developments which allowed this progress have taken place in two fields: [[quantum decoherence]] and the [[consistent histories]] approach to quantum mechanics.

The consistent histories approach makes mathematically explicit which sets of classical questions can be consistently asked of a single quantum system, and, conversely, which sets of questions are fundamentally inconsistent, and thus meaningless when asked together. We can therefore demonstrate formally why it is that the questions which [[EPR paradox|Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen]] assumed could be asked together, of a single quantum system, simply cannot be asked together. On the other hand, we can demonstrate that classical, logical reasoning often does apply, even to quantum experiments – but we can now be mathematically exact about the limits of classical logic.

Quantum decoherence, on the other hand (in combination with the consistent histories approach), recovers classical behaviour at the macroscopic level. The formal mathematics of this approach allows us to demonstrate, finally, that is impossible (or rather, massively improbable) for a macroscopic [[Schrödinger's cat]] to exist for longer than a minuscule time (related to the macroscopic energy dissipation time by a factor involving the square of [[Planck's constant]]) in a quantum superposition of its |alive&gt; and |dead&gt; states. Even for a cat otherwise isolated from the rest of the Universe, ''and even with no observer present'', there are so many unknowns in the quantum state of the whole cat, that the relevant mathematics determine that only the normally observed classical states of the cat are at all probable, except over the very shortest of timescales. This reasoning is developed formally within [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement theory]], and applies to any macroscopic, non-super cooled measuring device, whether or not there is an observer to watch it.

== Collaborators ==

Omnès makes clear that others contributed materially to the research described in his book, including [[Robert Griffiths (physicist)|Robert Griffiths]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], and [[James Hartle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8349">'''Radical theory''' is an [[obsolete scientific theory]] in [[chemistry]] describing the structure of [[organic compounds]]. The theory was pioneered by [[Justus von Liebig]], [[Friedrich Wöhler]] and [[Auguste Laurent]] around 1830 and is not related to the modern understanding of [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''
John L. Heilbron Ed. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic chemistry in the nineteenth century'', Rochelle Forrester 2006 [http://www.rochelleforrester.ac.nz/organic-chemistry.html Link]&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, organic compounds were thought to exist as combinations of radicals that could be exchanged in chemical reactions just as chemical elements could be interchanged in inorganic compounds.

==Preamble==
The term radical was already in use when radical theory was developed. [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] introduced the phrase "radical" in 1785 and the phrase was employed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789 in his [[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]. A radical was identified as the root base of certain acids (The Latin word "radix" meaning "root"). The combination of a radical with oxygen would result in an acid. For example the radical of [[acetic acid]] was called "acetic" and that of [[muriatic acid]] ([[hydrochloric acid]]) was called "muriatic". [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] found evidence for the '''cyanide radical''' in 1815 in his work on [[hydrogen cyanide]] and a number of cyanide salts he discovered. He also isolated [[cyanogen]] ((CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) not realizing that cyanogen is the cyanide dimer NC-CN. [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] proposed the '''ethylene radical''' from investigations into [[diethyl ether]] and [[ethanol]]. In his '''Etherin theory''' &lt;ref name=gomberg&gt;CHANDLER LECTURE M. Gomberg Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry 1928 20 (2), 159-159 {{DOI|10.1021/ie50218a018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he observed that ether consisted of two equivalents of ethylene and one equivalent of water and that ethylene and ethanol could interconvert in chemical reactions. Ethylene was also the base fragment for a number of other compounds such as [[ethyl acetate]]. This Etherin theory was eventually abandoned by Dumas in favor of radical theory. As a radical it should react with an oxide to form the hydrate but it was found that ethylene is resistant to an oxide like [[calcium oxide]]. [[Henri Victor Regnault]] in 1834 reacted [[ethylene dichloride]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] forming [[vinyl chloride]], water, and KCl. In etherin theory it should not be possible to break up the ethylene fragment in this way.

Radical theory replaced [[electrochemical dualism]] which stated that all molecules were to be considered as salts composed of basic and acidic oxides.

==Theory==
Liebig and Wöhler observed in 1832 &lt;ref&gt;Wöhler and Liebig Annale der Pharmacie, 3, 1832, 249&lt;/ref&gt; in an investigation of [[benzoin resin]] ([[benzoic acid]]) that the compounds [[almond oil]] ([[benzaldehyde]]), "''Benzoestoff''" ([[benzyl alcohol]]), [[benzoyl chloride]] and [[benzamide]] all share a common C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O fragment and that these compounds could all be synthesized from almond oil by simple substitutions. The C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O fragment was considered a "radical of benzoic acid" and called '''benzoyl'''. Organic radicals were thus placed on the same level as the inorganic elements. Just like the inorganic elements (''simple radicals'') the organic radicals (''compound radicals'') were indivisible. The theory was developed thanks to improvements in [[elemental analysis]] by von Liebig. Laurent contributed to the theory by reporting the isolation of benzoyl itself in 1835,&lt;ref&gt;Annales de chimie , '''59''', 397 1835&lt;/ref&gt; however the isolated chemical is today recognised at its dimer [[dibenzoyl]]. [[Raffaele Piria]] reported the '''salicyl radical''' as the base for [[salicylic acid]]. Liebig published a definition of a radical in 1838 &lt;ref&gt;Liebig, J. (1838), ''Ueber Laurent's Theorie der organischen Verbindungen''. Ann. Pharm., 25: 1–31. {{doi|10.1002/jlac.18380250102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Keen, ''The Life and Work of Friedrich Wohler''. 1800 - 1883 Vol 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jöns Jacob Berzelius|Berzelius]] and [[Robert Bunsen]] investigated the radical [[cacodyl]] (reaction of cacodyl chloride with zinc) around 1841, now also known as a dimer species (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;As—As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Frankland first reported [[diethylzinc]] in 1848. Frankland and Kolbe together investigated the reaction of [[ethyl cyanide]] and zinc in 1849 &lt;ref name=Kolbe&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Hermann|last1 = Kolbe|first2= Edward|last2= Frankland|year = 1849|title = On the products of the action of potassium on cyanide of ethyl|journal = Journal of the Chemical Society|volume = 1 |pages = 60–74|doi=10.1039/QJ8490100060}}&lt;/ref&gt; reporting the isolation of not the ethyl radical but the methyl radical (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which in fact was ethane. Kolbe also investigated the [[electrolysis]] of potassium salts of some fatty acids. [[Acetic acid]] was regarded as the combination of the methyl radical and [[oxalic acid]] and electrolysis of the salt yielded as gas again ethane misidentified as the liberated methyl radical.
In 1850 Frankland investigated ethyl radicals.&lt;ref name=Frankland&gt;{{cite journal|first= Edward|last = Frankland |year = 1850|title = On the isolation of the organic radicals|journal = Journal of the Chemical Society|volume = 2|pages =263–296|doi=10.1039/QJ8500200263}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of this work butane formed by reaction of [[ethyl iodide]] and zinc was mistakenly identified as the ethyl radical.

==Demise==
[[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]], [[Auguste Laurent]] and [[Charles Frédéric Gerhardt]] challenged Frankland and Kolbe by suggesting that the ethyl radical was in fact a dimer called dimethyl. Frankland and Kolbe countered that ethyl hydride was also a possibility &lt;ref name=gomberg /&gt; and in 1864 [[Carl Schorlemmer]] proved that dimethyl and ethyl hydride were in fact one and the same compound.

Radical theory was eventually replaced by a number of theories each advocating specific entities. One adaptation of radical theory was called [[theory of types (chemistry)|theory of types]] (theory of residues), advocated by [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz]], [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] and [[Charles Frédéric Gerhardt]]. Another was [[water type]] as promoted by [[Alexander William Williamson]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] and [[Auguste Laurent]] (an early supporter of radical theory) challenged radical theory in 1840 with a '''Law of Substitution''' (or '''Theory of Substitution''').&lt;ref name=gomberg /&gt; This law acknowledged that any hydrogen atom even as part of a radical could be substituted by a [[halogen]].

Eventually Frankland in 1852 &lt;ref&gt;Frankland, E. (1852). Phil. Trans., vol. cxlii, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[August Kekulé]] in 1857 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Legacy==
In 1900 [[Moses Gomberg]] unexpectedly discovered true trivalent carbon and the first [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] in the modern sense of the word in his (unsuccessful) attempt to make [[hexaphenylethane]]. In current organic chemistry concepts such as [[benzoyl]] and [[acetyl]] persist in chemical nomenclature but only to identify a [[functional group]] having the same fragment.

* 2008 Presented the [[Bernard Price Memorial Lecture]] in South Africa

In 2011, Solanki delivered a lecture, “Is the Sun to Blame for Global Warming?,” at the first [[Starmus Festival]] in the Canary Islands. His talk was subsequently published in the book ''Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/starmus-festival-and-stephen-hawking-launch-the-book-starmus-50-years-of-man-in-space-274263251.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Solanki's research has been quoted as being part of the [[Global warming controversy]], for instance in an article in the [[Telegraph.co.uk]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Leidig |author2=Roya Nikkhah  | publisher=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] | date=18 July 2004 | accessdate=18 April 2007 | title=The truth about global warming – it's the Sun that's to blame | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3325679/The-truth-about-global-warming-its-the-Sun-thats-to-blame.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Leidig | publisher=[[The Washington Times]] | date=18 July 2004 | accessdate=18 April 2007 | title=Hotter-burning sun warming the planet | url=http://www.washtimes.com/world/20040718-115714-6334r.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; as taking a sceptical position:{{cquote|the impact of more intense sunshine on the ozone layer and on cloud cover could be affecting the climate more than the sunlight itself}} But the same research has been quoted as being evidence for [[global warming]] in a news release from the [[Max Planck Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title=How Strongly Does the Sun Influence the Global Climate? – Studies at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research reveal: solar activity affects the climate but plays only a minor role in the current global warming | publisher=[[Max Planck Society]] | date=2 August 2004 | accessdate=16 April 2007 | url=http://www.mpg.de/english/illustrationsDocumentation/documentation/pressReleases/2004/pressRelease20040802/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; though he is quoted as calling for further investigation, saying:{{cquote| "Just how large this role is, must still be investigated, since, according to our latest knowledge on the variations of the solar magnetic field, the significant increase in the Earth's temperature since 1980 is indeed to be ascribed to the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide,"}}

'''Science [[education]]''' is the field concerned with sharing science content and [[Process (science)|process]] with individuals not traditionally considered part of the scientific community. The learners may be children, college students, or adults within the general public; the field of science education includes work in science content, science process (the [[scientific method]]), some [[social science]], and some teaching [[pedagogy]]. The standards for science education provide expectations for the development of understanding for students through the entire course of their [[K–12 (education)|K-12 education]] and beyond. The traditional subjects included in the standards are [[Physical science|physical]], [[Life science|life]], [[Earth science|earth]], [[space science|space]], and [[human science]]s.

==Historical background==
The first person credited with being employed as a Science teacher in a British [[public school (privately funded)|public school]] was [[William Sharp (homeopath)|William Sharp]] who left the job at [[Rugby School]] in 1850 after establishing Science to the curriculum. Sharp is said to have established a model for Science to be taught throughout the British Public Schools.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Bernard Leary, ‘Sharp, William (1805–1896)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25223, Retrieved 22 May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step came when the British Academy for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) published a report in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Layton, D. |chapter=The schooling of science in England, 1854–1939 |editor1-first=R.M. |editor1-last=MacLeod |editor2-first=P.D.B. |editor2-last=Collins |title=The parliament of science |publisher=Science Reviews |location=Northwood, England |year=1981 |isbn=0905927664 |pages=188–210 |oclc=8172024}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAAS promoted teaching of "pure science" and training of the "scientific habit of mind." The progressive education movement of the time supported the ideology of mental training through the sciences. BAAS emphasized separately pre-professional training in secondary science education. In this way, future BAAS members could be prepared.

The initial development of science teaching was slowed by the lack of qualified teachers. One key development was the founding of the first London School Board in 1870, which discussed the school curriculum; another was the initiation of courses to supply the country with trained science teachers. In both cases the influence of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was critical (see especially [[Thomas Henry Huxley#Educational influence|Thomas Henry Huxley educational influence]]). [[John Tyndall]] was also influential in the teaching of physical science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bibby, Cyril |title=T.H. Huxley: scientist, humanist and educator |publisher=Watts |location=London |year=1959 |oclc=747400567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, science education was a scatter of subjects prior to its standardization in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Del Giorno, B.J. |title=The impact of changing scientific knowledge on science education in the United States since 1850 |journal=Science Education |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=191–5 |date=April 1969 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730530304 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730530304/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a science curriculum in the US emerged gradually after extended debate between two ideologies, citizen science and pre-professional training. As a result of a conference of 30 leading secondary and college educators in Florida, the National Education Association appointed a Committee of Ten in 1892 which had authority to organize future meetings and appoint subject matter committees of the major subjects taught in U.S. secondary schools. The committee was composed of ten educators (all men) and was chaired by Charles Eliot of Harvard University. The Committee of Ten met, and appointed nine conferences committees (Latin, Greek, English, Other Modern Languages, Mathematics, History, Civil Government and Political Economy, and three in science). The three conference committees appointed for science were: physics, astronomy, and chemistry (1); natural history (2); and geography (3). Each committee, appointed by the Committee of Ten, was composed of ten leading specialists from colleges and normal schools, and secondary schools.  Each committee met in a different location in the U.S. The three science committees met for three days in the Chicago area. Committee reports were submitted to the Committee of Ten, which met for four days in New York, to create a comprehensive report.&lt;ref name="nea"&gt;National Education Association (1894). Report of the Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies With The Reports of the Conferences Arranged by The Committee. New York: The American Book Company [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=1WYWAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=report+of+the+committee+of+ten+on+secondary+school+studies&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UtOEeTn35f&amp;sig=iJfll5ftJ4TPNu3uHl_cB12-Jv8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPR1,M1 Read the Book Online]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, the NEA published the results of work of these conference committees.&lt;ref name="nea"/&gt;

According to the Committee of Ten, the goal of high school was to prepare all students to do well in life, contributing to their well-being and the good of society. Another goal was to prepare some students to succeed in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weidner, L |title=The N.E.A. Committee of Ten  |url=http://www3.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/neacom10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This committee supported the citizen science approach focused on mental training and withheld performance in science studies from consideration for college entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurd, P.D. |title=Closing the educational gaps between science, technology, and society |journal=Theory into Practice |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=251–9 |year=1991 |doi=10.1080/00405849109543509 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00405849109543509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAAS encouraged their longer standing model in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jenkins, E. |chapter=History of science education |editor1-first=T. |editor1-last=Husén |editor2-first=T.N. |editor2-last=Postlethwaite |title=International encyclopedia of education |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=Oxford |year=1985 |isbn=0080281192 |pages=4453–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US adopted a curriculum was characterized as follows:&lt;ref name="nea"/&gt;

* Elementary science should focus on simple natural phenomena (nature study) by means of experiments carried out "in-the-field."
* Secondary science should focus on laboratory work and the committee's prepared lists of specific experiments
* Teaching of facts and principles
* College preparation

The format of shared mental training and pre-professional training consistently dominated the curriculum from its inception to now. However, the movement to incorporate a humanistic approach, such as inclusion of the arts [[STEAM_fields|(S.T.E.A.M.)]], [[science, technology, society and environment education]] is growing and being implemented more broadly in the late 20th century (Aikenhead, 1994).  Reports by the American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), including Project 2061, and by the National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment detail goals for science education that link classroom science to practical applications and societal implications.

{{See also|Branches of science}}Science is a universal subject that spans the branch of knowledge that examines the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/science|title=science {{!}} Definition of science in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science education is most commonly broken down into the following three fields: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.

=== Physics Education ===
[[File:Free body diagram.png|thumb|Demonstrates a free body]]
{{See also|Physics education}}Physics education is characterized by the study of science that deals with matter and energy, and their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/physics|title=Definition of PHYSICS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physics First]], a program endorsed by the American Association of [[Physics]] Teachers, is a curriculum in which 9th grade students take an introductory physics course. The purpose is to enrich students' understanding of physics, and allow for more detail to be taught in subsequent high school biology and chemistry classes. It also aims to increase the number of students who go on to take 12th grade physics or AP Physics, which are generally elective courses in American high schools.&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;

Physics education in high schools in the United States has suffered the last twenty years because many states now only require three sciences, which can be satisfied by earth/physical science, chemistry, and biology. The fact that many students do not take physics in high school makes it more difficult for those students to take scientific courses in college.

At the university/college level, using [[appropriate technology]]-related projects to spark non-physics majors’ interest in learning physics has been shown to be successful.&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt; This is a potential opportunity to forge the connection between physics and social benefit.

=== Chemistry Education ===
{{See also|Chemistry education}}Chemistry education is characterized by the study of science that deals with the composition, structure, and properties of substances and the transformations that they undergo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chemistry|title=Definition of CHEMISTRY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Festival of Science in Samara.jpg|thumb|Children mix different chemicals in test tubes as part of a science education program.]]

Chemistry is the study of chemicals and the elements and their effects and attributes. Students in chemistry learn [[The periodic table of the elements|the periodic table.]] The branch of science education known as "chemistry must be taught in a relevant context in order to promote full understanding of current sustainability issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jegstad|first=Kirsti Marie|last2=Sinnes|first2=Astrid Tonette|date=2015-03-04|title=Chemistry Teaching for the Future: A model for secondary chemistry education for sustainable development|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2014.1003988|journal=International Journal of Science Education|volume=37|issue=4|pages=655–683|doi=10.1080/09500693.2014.1003988|issn=0950-0693}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this source states chemistry is a very important subject in school as it teaches students to understand issues in the world. As children are interested by the world around them [[chemistry]] teachers can attract interest in turn educating the students further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azmat|first=R.|title=Manufacturing of High Quality Teachers for Chemistry Education at Higher Secondary Level in Current Era|url=http://chempublishers.com/Journals/pjchm/vol_3/I_3/3_3_Paper_8.pdf|journal=Pakistan Journal of Chemistry|volume=3|issue=3|pages=140–141|doi=10.15228/2013.v03.i03.p08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of chemistry is a very practical based subject meaning most of class time is spent working or completing experiments.

=== Biology Education ===
Biology education is characterized by the study of structure, function, heredity, and evolution of all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/advising/career-and-major-exploration/major-to-career/biology-education|title=Major to Career: Biology Education|website=www.byui.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biology itself is the study of living organisms, through different fields including morphology, physiology, anatomy, behavior, origin, and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/biology|title=the definition of biology|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Depending on the country and education level, there are many approaches to teaching biology. In the United States, there is a growing emphasis on the ability to investigate and analyze biology related questions over an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csun.edu/science/ref/curriculum/reforms/nses/|title=National Science Education Standards|website=www.csun.edu|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
While the public image of science education may be one of simply learning facts [[by rote]], science education in recent history also generally concentrates on the teaching of science [[concept]]s and addressing [[Scientific misconceptions|misconception]]s that learners may hold regarding science concepts or other content. Science education has been strongly influenced by constructivist thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith S. |last=Taber |title=Progressing Science Education: Constructing the Scientific Research Programme Into the Contingent Nature of Learning Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96tslSL3UfwC |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constructivism in science education]] has been informed by an extensive research programme into student thinking and learning in science, and in particular exploring how teachers can facilitate conceptual change towards canonical scientific thinking. Constructivism emphasises the active role of the learner, and the significance of current knowledge and understanding in mediating learning, and the importance of teaching that provides an optimal level of guidance to learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taber, K.S. |chapter=Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction |chapterurl=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html |editor=J. Hassaskhah |title=Educational Theory |publisher=Nova |year=2011 |isbn=9781613245804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The guided-discovery approach to science education ===
Along with [[John Dewey]], [[Jerome Bruner]], and many [[Discovery learning|others,]] [[Arthur Koestler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Act of Creation|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1964|isbn=|location=London|pages=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a critique of contemporary science education and proposes its replacement with the guided-discovery approach: &lt;blockquote&gt;To derive pleasure from the art of discovery, as from the other arts, the consumer—in this case the student—must be made to re-live, to some extent, the creative process. In other words, he must be induced, with proper aid and guidance, to make some of the fundamental discoveries of science by himself, to experience in his own mind some of those flashes of insight which have lightened its path. . . . The traditional method of confronting the student not with the problem but with the finished solution, means depriving him of all excitement, [shutting] off the creative impulse, [reducing] the adventure of mankind to a dusty heap of theorems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Specific hands-on illustrations of this approach are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/teaching_methods/guided_discovery/examples.html|title=Guided discovery problems: Examples (in: Teaching Methods: A Collection of Pedagogic Techniques and Example Activities)|last=Carleton University|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/SCIEX.htm|title=Science exercises and instructional materials: Teaching science as if minds mattered!|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The practice of science education has been increasingly informed by research into science teaching and learning.  Research in science education relies on a wide variety of methodologies, borrowed from many branches of science and engineering such as computer science, cognitive science, cognitive psychology and anthropology. Science education research aims to define or characterize what constitutes learning in science and how it is brought about.

[[John D. Bransford]], et al., summarized massive research into student thinking as having three key findings:

; Preconceptions : Prior ideas about how things work are remarkably tenacious and an educator must explicitly address a students' specific misconceptions if the student is to reconfigure his misconception in favour of another explanation. Therefore, it is essential that educators know how to learn about student preconceptions and make this a regular part of their planning.
; Knowledge Organization: In order to become truly literate in an area of science, students must, "(a) have a deep foundation of factual knowledge, (b) understand facts and ideas in the context of a conceptual framework, and (c) organize knowledge in ways that facilitate retrieval and application."[http://www.nap.edu/html/howpeople1/]
; Metacognition : Students will benefit from thinking about their thinking and their learning. They must be taught ways of evaluating their knowledge and what they don't know, evaluating their methods of thinking, and evaluating their conclusions. Some educators and others have practiced and advocated for discussions of [[pseudoscience]] as a way to understand what it is to think scientifically and to address the problems introduced by pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duncan |first1=Douglas |title=Teaching the Nature of Science using Pseudoscience |url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~dduncan/pseudoscience/ |website=Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy |publisher=University of Colorado Boulder |accessdate=18 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618183715/http://casa.colorado.edu/~dduncan/pseudoscience/ |archivedate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borgo |first1=Alejandro |title=Why Pseudscience Should Be Taught in College |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=9-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational technologies are being refined to meet the specific needs of science teachers.  One research study examining how cellphones are being used in post-secondary science teaching settings showed that mobile technologies can increase student engagement and motivation in the science classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tremblay|first=Eric|year=2010|title=Educating the Mobile Generation – using personal cell phones as audience response systems in post-secondary science teaching|url=http://editlib.org/p/32314|journal=Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching|volume=29|issue=2|pages=217–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a bibliography on [[Social constructivism|constructivist]]-oriented research on teaching and learning science in 2005, about 64 percent of studies documented are carried out in the domain of physics, 21 percent in the domain of biology, and 15 percent in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/|title=Bibliography—STCSE (Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education)|year=2006|publisher=Kiel:IPN—Leibniz Institute for Science Education|author=Duit, R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The major reason for this dominance of physics in the research on teaching and learning appears to be that understanding physics includes difficulties due to the particular nature of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Science Education|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8058-4713-0|page=599|chapter=Teaching Physics|author=Duit, R.; Niedderer, H.; Schecker, H.|editor1-first=Sandra K.|editor1-last=Abell|editor2-first=Norman G.|editor2-last=Lederman|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd31m3_RU3oC&amp;pg=PA599}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research on students' conceptions has shown that most pre-instructional (everyday) ideas that students bring to physics instruction are in stark contrast to the physics concepts and principles to be achieved – from kindergarten to the tertiary level.  Quite often students' ideas are incompatible with physics views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Science Teaching and Learning|publisher=Macmillan|year=1994|isbn=0028970055|location=New York|chapter=Research on alternative conceptions in science|author1=Wandersee, J.H.|author2=Mintzes, J.J.|author3=Novak, J.D.|editor=Gabel, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also holds true for students’ more general patterns of thinking and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1984|title=Students' patterns of thinking and reasoning|journal=Physics Teacher|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–26|doi=10.1119/1.2341444|author=Arons, A.}} pp. 89–93 {{DOI|10.1119/1.2341474}}; 576–581.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science education in different countries ==

=== Australia ===
As in England and Wales, science education in Australia is compulsory up until year 11, where students can choose to study one or more of the branches mentioned above. If they wish to no longer study science, they can choose none of the branches. The science stream is one course up until year 11, meaning students learn in all of the branches giving them a broad idea of what science is all about. [[Australian Curriculum|The National Curriculum Board of Australia]] (2009) stated that "The science curriculum will be organised around three interrelated strands: science understanding; science inquiry skills; and science as a human endeavour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acara.edu.au/verve/_resources/australian_curriculum_-_science.pdf|title=Shape of the Australian Curriculum: Science|last=National Curriculum Board|first=|date=2009|website=|publisher=ACARA|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528111727/http://www.acara.edu.au/verve/_resources/australian_curriculum_-_science.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strands give teachers and educators the framework of how they should be instructing their students.

A major problem that has befallen science education in Australia over the last decade is a falling interest in science. Fewer year 10 students are choosing to study science for year 11, which is problematic as these are the years where students form attitudes to pursue science careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Ghali|date=2011|title=Students' views of science: A comparison between tertiary and secondary school students|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Students%27+Views+of+Science%3A+A+Comparison+between+Tertiary+and+Secondary+School+Students&amp;rft.jtitle=Science+Educator&amp;rft.au=Ghali+Hassan&amp;rft.date=2011-10-01&amp;rft.pub=National+Science+Education+Leadership+Association&amp;rft.issn=1094-3277&amp;rft.volume=20&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=54&amp;rft.externalDocID=2674689111&amp;paramdict=en-AU|journal=Science Educator|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is not unique in Australia, but is happening in countries all over the world.

=== China ===
Educational quality in China suffers because a typical classroom contains 50 to 70 students. With over 200 million students, China has the largest educational system in the world.  However, only 20% percent of students complete the rigorous ten-year program of formal schooling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As in many other countries, the science curriculum includes sequenced courses in physics, chemistry, and biology.  Science education is given high priority and is driven by textbooks composed by committees of scientists and teachers.  Science education in China places great emphasis on memorization, and gives far less attention to problem solving, application of principles to novel situations, interpretations, and predictions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artofteachingscience.org/countries/china.html|title=Science Curriculum- A Global Perspective: China|last=Price|first=Ronald F.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Science education in England}}

In English and Welsh schools, science is a compulsory subject in the National Curriculum. All pupils from 5 to 16 years of age must study science. It is generally taught as a single subject science until sixth form, then splits into subject-specific [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]]). However, the government has since expressed its desire that those pupils who achieve well at the age of 14 should be offered the opportunity to study the three separate sciences from September 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7245529.stm|title='Poor lacking' choice of sciences|date=15 February 2008|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 February 2008|author=Kim Catcheside|work=BBC News website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland the subjects split into chemistry, physics and biology at the age of 13–15 for [[Education in Scotland|National 4/5s]] in these subjects, and there is also a combined science standard grade qualification which students can sit, provided their school offers it.

In September 2006 a new science program of study known as 21st Century Science was introduced as a [[GCSE]] option in UK schools, designed to "give all 14 to 16 year old's a worthwhile and inspiring experience of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyscience.org/ |title=Welcome to Twenty First Century Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=15 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101055026/http://www.21stcenturyscience.org/ |archive-date=1 January 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, Ofsted's survey of science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/maintaining-curiosity-survey-science-education-schools|title=Maintaining curiosity: a survey into science education in schools|date=21 November 2013|publisher=Ofsted|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in schools revealed that practical science teaching was not considered important enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/we-cannot-afford-to-get-science-education-wrong-20667|title=We cannot afford to get science education wrong|last=Holman|first=John|date=22 November 2013|publisher=The Conversation|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the majority of English schools, students have the opportunity to study a separate science program as part of their GCSEs, which results in them taking 6 papers at the end of Year 11; this usually fills one of their option 'blocks' and requires more science lessons than those who choose not to partake in separate science or are not invited. Other students who choose not to follow the compulsory additional science course, which results in them taking 4 papers resulting in 2 GCSEs, opposed to the 3 GCSEs given by taking separate science.

===United States===
In many U.S. states, [[K-12]] educators must adhere to rigid standards or [[Conceptual framework|frameworks]] of what content is to be taught to which age groups. This often leads teachers to rush to "cover" the material, without truly "teaching" it. In addition, the ''process'' of science, including such elements as the [[scientific method]] and [[critical thinking]], is often overlooked. This emphasis can produce students who pass [[Standardized test#United States|standardized tests]] without having developed complex problem solving skills. Although at the college level American science education tends to be less regulated, it is actually more rigorous, with teachers and professors fitting more content into the same time period.&lt;ref name="Glavin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k12academics.com/education-subjects/science-education/united-states#.VzpsDk-qqko|title=United States {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] of the [[U.S. National Academies]] produced the [[National Science Education Standards]], which is available online for free in multiple forms. Its focus on [[inquiry-based science]], based on the theory of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] rather than on [[direct instruction]] of facts and methods, remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Glavin" /&gt; Some research suggests that it is more effective as a model for teaching science. &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Standards call for more than 'science as process,' in which students learn such skills as observing, inferring, and experimenting. Inquiry is central to science learning. When engaging in inquiry, students describe objects and events, ask questions, construct explanations, test those explanations against current scientific knowledge, and communicate their ideas to others. They identify their assumptions, use critical and logical thinking, and consider alternative explanations. In this way, students actively develop their understanding of science by combining scientific knowledge with reasoning and thinking skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Research Council|first=National Academy of Sciences|title=National Science Education Standards|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4962&amp;page=2|work=Science Teaching Standards|publisher=National Academy Press|date=December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concern about science education and science standards has often been driven by worries that American students lag behind their peers in [[international rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mullis, I.V.S. |author2=Martin, M.O. |author3=Gonzalez, E.J. |author4=Chrostowski, S.J. |title=TIMSS 2003 International Mathematics Report: Findings from IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study at the Fourth and Eighth Grades |publisher=TIMSS &amp; PIRLS International Study Center |year=2004 |isbn=1-8899-3834-3 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED494650&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED494650}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example was the wave of [[education reforms]] implemented after the [[Soviet Union]] launched its [[Sputnik]] [[satellite]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rutherford, F.J. |title=Sputnik and Science Education |year=1997 |work=Reflecting on Sputnik: Linking the Past, Present, and Future of Educational Reform |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/sputnik/ruther1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most prominent of these reforms was led by the [[Physical Science Study Committee]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].  In recent years, business leaders such as Microsoft Chairman [[Bill Gates]] have called for more emphasis on science education, saying the United States risks losing its economic edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Citing "Critical Situation" in Science and Math, Business Groups Urge Approval of New National Agenda for Innovation |date=27 July 2005 |publisher=Business Roundtable |url=http://www.businessroundtable.org/newsroom/Document.aspx?qs=5876BF807822B0F1AD1448722FB51711FCF50C8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208164558/http://www.businessroundtable.org/newsroom/Document.aspx?qs=5876BF807822B0F1AD1448722FB51711FCF50C8 |archivedate=2007-12-08 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |author=Borland, J. |title=Gates: Get U.S. schools in order |date=2 May 2005 |work=CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Gates-Get-U.S.-schools-in-order/2100-1022_3-5692845.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Tapping America's Potential is an organization aimed at getting more students to graduate with science, technology, engineering and mathematics degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tapping America's Potential |url=http://www.tapcoalition.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion surveys, however, indicate most U.S. parents are complacent about science education and that their level of concern has actually declined in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicagenda.org/research/pdfs/rc0601.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614211608/http://www.publicagenda.org/research/pdfs/rc0601.pdf|date=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof Sreyashi Jhumki Basu &lt;ref&gt;[[Sreyashi Jhumki Basu]]&lt;/ref&gt; published extensively on the need for equity in Science Education in the United States.

Furthermore, in the recent National Curriculum Survey conducted by ACT, researchers uncovered a possible disconnect among science educators.  "Both middle school/junior high school teachers and post secondary science instructors rate(d) process/inquiry skills as more important than advanced science content topics; high school teachers rate them in exactly the opposite order."  Perhaps more communication among educators at the different grade levels in necessary to ensure common goals for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.act.org/research/policymakers/pdf/NationalCurriculumSurvey2009.pdf |title=National Research Leader in College and Workforce Readiness |publisher=ACT |date=2009 |accessdate=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 science education framework====

According to a report from the National Academy of Sciences, the fields of science, technology, and education hold a paramount place in the modern world, but there are not enough workers in the United States entering the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professions. In 2012 the National Academy of Sciences Committee on a Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards developed a guiding framework to standardize K-12 science education with the goal of organizing science education systematically across the K-12 years. Titled ''A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas'', the publication promotes standardizing K-12 science education in the United States. It emphasizes science educators to focus on a "limited number of disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting concepts, be designed so that students continually build on and revise their knowledge and abilities over multiple years, and support the integration of such knowledge and abilities with the practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design." &lt;ref&gt;[http://research.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/gradresearch.cc.lehigh.edu/files/documents/VPRO/Workshops/NRC%20Framework%20for%20K.12%20Science%20Education.pdf A Framework For K-12 Science Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report says that in the 21st century Americans need science education in order to engage in and "systematically investigate issues related to their personal and community priorities," as well as to reason scientifically and know how to apply science knowledge. The committee that designed this new framework sees this imperative as a matter of [[educational equity]] to the diverse set of schoolchildren. Getting more diverse students into [[STEM fields|STEM education]] is a matter of social justice as seen by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;A Framework For K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013 Next Generation Science Standards====

In 2013 a new standards for science education were released that update the national standards released in 1996. Developed by 26 state governments and national organizations of scientists and science teachers, the guidelines, called the [[Next Generation Science Standards]], are intended to "combat widespread scientific ignorance, to standardize teaching among states, and to raise the number of high school graduates who choose scientific and technical majors in college...." Included are guidelines for teaching students about topics such as climate change and evolution. An emphasis is teaching the scientific process so that students have a better understanding of the methods of science and can critically evaluate scientific evidence. Organizations that contributed to developing the standards include the [[National Science Teachers Association]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], and Achieve, a nonprofit organization that was also involved in developing math and English standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Gillis |title=New Guidelines Call for Broad Changes in Science Education |newspaper=New York Times |date=9 April 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/science/panel-calls-for-broad-changes-in-science-education.html |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Informal science education====
[[File:Argonne lab education.jpg|right|thumb|Young women participate in a conference at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]].]]

Informal science education is the science teaching and learning that occurs outside of the formal school curriculum in places such as museums, the media, and community-based programs. The [[National Science Teachers Association]] has created a position statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/informal.aspx |title=NSTA Position Statement: Informal Science Education |publisher=National Science Teachers Association |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Informal Science Education to define and encourage science learning in many contexts and throughout the lifespan. Research in informal science education is funded in the United States by the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5361 National Science Foundation funding for informal science education]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education]] (CAISE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE) |url=http://www.informalscience.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides resources for the informal science education community.

Examples of informal science education include science centers, [[science museums]], and new digital learning environments (''e.g.'' [[Global Challenge Award]]), many of which are members of the [[Association of Science and Technology Centers]] (ASTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Association of Science-Technology Centers |url=http://astc.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco and The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia are the oldest of this type of museum in the United States.  Media include TV programs such as ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'', ''Newton's Apple'', "[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]","[[Beakman's World]]", ''[[The Magic School Bus]]'', and ''[[Dragonfly TV]]''. Early examples of science education on American television included programs by [[Daniel Q. Posin]], such as "Dr. Posin's Universe", "The Universe Around Us", "On the Shoulders of Giants", and "Out of This World".  Examples of community-based programs are [[4-H]] Youth Development programs, [[Hands On Science Outreach, Inc.|Hands On Science Outreach]], NASA and After school Programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.nasa.gov/divisions/informal/overview/R_NASA_and_Afterschool_Programs.html |title=NASA and Afterschool Programs: Connecting to the Future |publisher=NASA |date=3 April 2006 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027023742/http://education.nasa.gov/divisions/informal/overview/R_NASA_and_Afterschool_Programs.html |archive-date=27 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Girls at the Center. Home education is encouraged through educational products such as the former (1940-1989) [[Things of Science]] subscription service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1hwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QKQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4985,4298460&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=Thing-of-the-Month Club will provide remarkable objects|last=Othman|first=Frederick C.|date=7 October 1947|work=[[San Jose Evening News]]|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the National Academies released ''Surrounded by Science: Learning Science in Informal Environments'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fenichel, M.; Schweingruber, H.A.; National Research Council |title=Surrounded by Science in Informal Environments |publisher=The National Academies Press |location=Washington DC |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-309-13674-7 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12614}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the National Research Council study, ''Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee on Learning Science in Informal Environments, National Research Council |title=Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits |publisher=The National Academies Press |location=Washington DC |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-309-11955-9 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12190}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Surrounded by Science'' is a resource book that shows how current research on learning science across informal science settings can guide the thinking, the work, and the discussions among informal science practitioners. This book makes valuable research accessible to those working in informal science: educators, museum professionals, university faculty, youth leaders, media specialists, publishers, broadcast journalists, and many others.

'''''Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals about Our Everyday Deceptions''''' is a 2010 popular science book, written by neuroscientists [[Stephen Macknik]] and [[Susana Martinez-Conde]], with science writer [[Sandra Blakeslee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/sleightsofmind/stephenlmacknik|title=Sleights of Mind|author=World Archipelago|work=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working alongside some of the world’s greatest magicians, Macknik and Martinez-Conde studied how [[magic (illusion)|conjuring techniques]] trick the brain. ''Sleights of Mind'' considers the greater implications of magic and misdirection for clinical conditions such as autism, and for everyday life situations, including choice and trust in personal and business relationships.

''Sleights of Mind'' is the result of Macknik and Martinez-Conde’s yearlong, world-wide exploration of magic and how its principles apply to human behavior.  ''Sleights of Mind'' introduces Neuromagic as a new area of scientific endeavor, a discipline aimed to uncover the interaction between brain science and the art of magic. Macknik and Martinez-Conde propose that understanding how the mind perceives magic and illusion will provide a greater understanding of perception and cognition at large.

==Synopsis==

Macknik and Martinez-Conde say that magic tricks fool us because humans have hardwired processes of attention and awareness that are hackable.  Good magicians use our inherent mental and neural limitations against us by leading us to perceive and feel what we are neurologically inclined to.  Working with renowned magicians like [[Apollo Robbins]], [[Teller (magician)|Teller]], [[Mac King]], and [[James Randi]], Macknik and Martinez-Conde research the ways in which the perceptual and cognitive elements of magic relate to more than simple deceits.&lt;ref name="sleightsofmind.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleightsofmind.com/about-the-book/|title=About the Book, Sleights of Mind by Stephen Macknik &amp; Susana Martinez-Conde with Sandra Blakeslee|work=sleightsofmind.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors reveal the neural underpinnings of the magical methods that explain how our brains perceive magic.

Through their exploration, Macknik and Martinez-Conde uncover how our brains work in everyday situations.  They describe how if you have ever bought an expensive item you had sworn you would never buy, the salesperson was creating the “illusion of choice,” a core technique of magic.  They also relate the use of magic to Bernie Madoff’s “illusion of trust”.  Through these examples, Macknik’s and Martinez-Conde’s Sleights of Mind illuminates the reasons for studying magic, and its implications for research on, and renewed understanding of, perceptual and cognitive processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2344">A '''spectrohelioscope''' is a type of [[solar telescope]] designed by [[George Ellery Hale]] in 1924 to allow the Sun to be viewed in a selected [[wavelength]] of light. The name comes from three Latin-based words: Spectro, referring to the [[optical spectrum]], Helio, referring to the Sun and Scope, as in telescope.

[[Image:Spectrohelioscope-003c.svg|thumb|500px|Schematic of typical spectrohelioscope. The two slits oscillate rapidly to allow a portion of the Sun to be seen in monochromatic light. Many variations are possible: collimation can be done with concave mirrors, dispersion can be achieved with glass prisms, and scanning can be achieved with fixed slits and spinning square prisms. Because they are large (usually more than 3 meters long) and delicate, spectrohelioscopes are usually fixed, with moving mirrors to track the Sun]]

The basic spectrohelioscope is a complex machine that uses a [[spectroscope]] to scan the surface of the Sun. The image from the [[objective lens]] is focused on a narrow slit revealing only a thin portion of the Sun's surface. The light is then passed through a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] or [[diffraction grating]] to spread the light into a spectrum. The spectrum is then focused on another slit that allows only a narrow part of the spectrum (the desired wavelength of light for viewing) to pass. The light is finally focused on an eyepiece so the surface of the Sun can be seen. The view, however, would be only a narrow strip of the Sun's surface. The slits are moved in unison to scan across the whole surface of the Sun giving a full image. Independently nodding mirrors can be used instead of moving slits to produce the same scan: the first mirror selects a slice of the Sun, the second selects the desired wavelength.

The [[Spectroheliograph]] is a similar device, but images the Sun at a particular wavelength photographically and is still in use&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbso.njit.edu/Research/Halpha/ha_inst.html Information on observatories including Meudon]&lt;/ref&gt; in professional observatories.

It was on the [[New York Times]] [[New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]] for three weeks following its debut.&lt;ref name="bestseller"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-03-27/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|title=Best Sellers|date=27 May 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''The Information'' has also been published in [[ebook]] formats by [[HarperCollins|Fourth Estate]] and [[Random House]], and as an [[audiobook]] by [[Random House Audio]]. 

==Synopsis==

Gleick begins with the tale of colonial European explorers and their fascination with African [[talking drums]] and their observed use to send [[Complexity|complex]] and widely understood messages back and forth between villages far apart, and over even longer distances by relay. Gleick transitions from the information implications of such drum signaling to the impact of the arrival of long distance [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] and then [[telephone]] communication to the commercial and social prospects of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial age]] west. Research to improve these technologies ultimately led to our understanding the essentially [[Digital data|digital]] nature of [[information]], quantized down to the unit of the [[bit]] (or [[qubit]]).

Starting with the development of symbolic written language (and the eventual perceived need for a [[dictionary]]), Gleick examines the history of intellectual insights central to [[information theory]], detailing the key figures responsible such as [[Claude Shannon]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[Ada Byron]], [[Samuel Morse]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]]. The author also delves into how digital information is now being understood in relation to [[Digital physics|physics]] and [[genetics]]. Following the circulation of [[Claude Shannon]]'s ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]'' and [[Norbert Wiener]]'s ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine|Cybernetics]]'' many disciplines attempted to jump on the information theory bandwagon to varying success. Information theory concepts of [[data compression]] and [[error correction]] became especially important to the computer and electronics industries.

Gleick finally discusses [[Wikipedia]] as an emerging internet based [[Library of Babel]], investigating the implications of its expansive user generated content, including the ongoing [[Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|struggle]] between inclusionists, deletionists, and [[Vandalism on Wikipedia|vandals]]. Gleick uses the [[Jimmy Wales]] created article for the Cape Town butchery restaurant [[Mzoli's]] as a case study of this struggle. The flood of information humanity is now exposed to presents new challenges Gleick says, as we retain more of our information now than at any previous point in human history, it takes much more effort to delete or remove unwanted information than to accumulate it. This is the ultimate [[entropy]] cost of generating additional information and the answer to slay [[Maxwell's Demon]].

==Reception==

In addition to winning major awards for science writing and history, ''The Information'' received mostly positive reviews. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] said it is "so ambitious, illuminating and sexily theoretical that it will amount to aspirational reading for many of those who have the mettle to tackle it." Other admirers were [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] for ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=Nicholas|title=Drowning in Beeps|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-03-01/the-information-by-james-gleick-review-by-nicholas-carr/|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]] for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=How We Know|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/how-we-know/|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction author [[Cory Doctorow]] in his [[BoingBoing]] review called Gleick "one of the great science writers of all time", "Not a biographer of scientists... but a biographer of the ''idea'' itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|title=James Gleick's tour-de-force: The Information, a natural history of information theory|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2011/03/24/james-gleicks-tour-d.html|accessdate=15 June 2011|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Wu]] for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] praised "a mind-bending explanation of theory" but wished Gleick had examined the economic importance of information more deeply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wu|first=Tim|title=Bit by Bit: James Gleick on the fascinating quest to understand and wield information.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/03/bit_by_bit.html|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Pindar writing for ''[[The Guardian]]''  complained that ''The Information'' does not fully address the relationship between social control of information ([[censorship]], [[propaganda]]) and access to [[political power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pindar|first=Ian|title=How a costly toy came to transform our world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/30/information-history-james-gleick-review|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2382">'''ZINDO''' is a [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods|semi-empirical quantum chemistry method]] used in [[computational chemistry]]. It is a development of the [[INDO]] method. It stands for Zerner's Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap, as it was developed by [[Michael Zerner]] and his coworkers in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ridley, M. Zerner, Theor. Chim. Acta '''1973''', ''32'', 111–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- actually as referred to in: A. Schueller, G. B. Goh, H. Kim et al. Molecular Informatics 2010, 29(10), 717–729 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Zerner, [[Reviews in Computational Chemistry]], Volume 2, Eds. K. B. Lipkowitz and D. B. Boyd, VCH, New York, 313, (1991)ю&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[INDO]], which was really restricted to organic molecules and those containing the atoms [[Boron|B]] to [[Fluorine|F]], ZINDO covers a wide range of the [[periodic table]], even including the [[rare-earth element]]s. There are two distinct versions of the method:
* ZINDO/1 – for calculating ground-state properties such as bond lengths and bond angles. It refers to a [[Hartree–Fock method|SCF]] (RHF or ROHF) calculation with the INDO/1 level as suggested by Pople, which provides the reference state MO coefficients. Ground-state dipole moments and ionization potentials are in general very accurate. Geometry optimizations are erratic, what prompted Zerner's group to improve the performance of the code in the late 1990s&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Da Motta Neto, M. Zerner, Int. J. Quantum Chem. '''2001''', ''81'', 187–201.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ZINDO/S (sometimes just called INDO/S) – use the INDO/1 [[molecular orbital]]s for calculating excited states and hence electronic spectra. It consists of a [[Configuration interaction|CI]] calculation including only the reference state plus a small set of single-electron excitations within a selected active space, typically five HOMOs and five LUMOs.

The original BIGSPEC program from the Zerner group is not widely available, but the method is implemented in HyperChem, [[ORCA (Quantum Chemistry Program)|ORCA]], in part, in [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], and in [[Scigress|SCIGRESS]].

To obtain good results, it is frequently necessary to fit the parameters to a given molecule, thereby making it ideal only in semi-empirical calculations.
