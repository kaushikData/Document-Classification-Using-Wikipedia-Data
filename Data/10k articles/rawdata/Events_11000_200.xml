The '''Alhambra''' was a popular theatre and [[music hall]] located on the east side of [[Leicester Square]], in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of [[London]]. It was built originally as the Royal Panopticon of Science and Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Odeon Leicester Square: Formerly – The Royal Panopticon of Science and Art / The Alhambra Theatre | url =http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Alhambra.htm | website = arthurlloyd.co.uk | publisher = Arthur Lloyd Theatres | access-date = 12 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opening on 18 March 1854. It was closed after two years and reopened as the Alhambra. The building was demolished in 1936. The name was also adopted by many other British music hall theatres located elsewhere; in [[Bradford Alhambra|Bradford]], in Hull and in [[Alhambra Theatre Glasgow|Glasgow]] etc. The name comes from association with the Moorish splendour of the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]], Spain.

==History==
===Origins===
The Alhambra was originally known as the [[Royal Panopticon]] and was a landmark building at 23–27 Leicester Square, completed in 1854 by T. Hayter Lewis as a venue for showcasing the finest in the arts and for [[scientific]] demonstrations and popular education. This lasted for two years, and then the decision to add a circus ring was taken. When it reopened on 3 April 1858 it was renamed the Alhambra.

The 1858 building  conversion to the ''Alhambra Circus'', was also by T. Hayter Lewis. It had a {{convert|104|ft|m|1}} frontage and was very tall for the time. It was built in a [[Moorish]] style, with lavish fenestration, two towers and a dome, similar to the eponymous [[Bradford]] theatre in architectural style. It was a complete contrast with the neighbouring buildings. Inside there was a central rotunda {{convert|94|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|94|ft|m}} high. There was a secondary entrance to the rear on [[Charing Cross Road]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Alhambra.htm ''Alhambra Theatre'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 23 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jules Léotard2.jpg|thumb|upright|left| [[Jules Léotard]], ''[[The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze]]'', performed his aerial act at the Alhambra.]]
The Leicester Square theatre's name was changed frequently, but usually reflected the building's (very loose) stylistic associations with the celebrated [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], [[Spain]]. By 1864, the circus had become the Alhambra [[Music Hall]]. Rebuildings occurred in 1866 and 1881, by Perry and Reed. From 1871, when it obtained a licence, an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] [[ballet]] was performed. The Alhambra was destroyed by fire in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/12/07/102935454.pdf ''A London theatre burned: The Alhambra, the home of pageants, totally destroyed'' 7 December 1882 (''NY Times'')] accessed 23 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and was rebuilt in a more restrained style by Reed, reopening in 1884 as the Alhambra Theatre. Further rebuildings were in 1888 by Edward Clark, 1892 by Clark and Pollard, 1897 by [[W. M. Brutton]], and in 1912 by the prolific theatre architect, [[Frank Matcham]]. Other names used during the life of the theatre were the Royal Alhambra Palace; Alhambra Theatre of Varieties; Theatre Royal, Alhambra; Great United States Circus and New Alhambra Theatre.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

===Entertainments===
London's Alhambra was predominantly used for the popular entertainment of the day, [[music hall]]. The usual music hall acts were performed, as well as the début of [[Jules Léotard]] performing his aerial act, above the heads of diners in May 1861. Other entertainments included "patriotic demonstrations" celebrating the [[British Empire]] and British military successes. The theatre also staged [[ballet]] and light [[opera]].  In the 1860s, [[John Hollingshead]] took over management at the Alhambra and made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring [[corps de ballet]] and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. "The spark that lit the bonfire", in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  At its bars, the attractions of the Alhambra's ballet were not merely artistic:
{{quote|You must please imagine yourself a man about town, with money in your pocket and a fancy for a night of pleasure. It is early in the year 1870. You find a congenial companion with similar inclination, and after a leisurely dinner at the club you find yourself looking at the Alhambra. You are purposely too late for the strident 'variety' with which the programme opens, but in easy time for the Ballet which concludes the first half and is followed by a long&amp;nbsp;– a very long&amp;nbsp;– interval. The interval is one of the main features of the show, for the huge basement canteen is open to any of the audience who think a visit worth while&amp;nbsp;... You wander down after the ballet, pick up a couple of dancers and buy them champagne. They are cheerful young women still wearing their scanty ballet costumes and with plenty to say for themselves. Nearly an hour passes in telling stories and gossiping about the crowd of swells and chorines who skirmish and lounge and laugh in the long, bare but well lighted room. It is now nearly time for the notorious [[Can-Can]], and you prepare to return to your seats. The ladies wish to say thank you for their wine, and each, with an arm round your neck or his, puts unmistakable provocation into her kiss. She probably ventures other familiarities, and certainly asks softly if you will be near the stage-door when the show is over.&lt;dd&gt;—[[Michael Sadleir]], ''[[Fanny by Gaslight (novel)|Fanny by Gaslight]]'' (1940)&lt;/dd&gt;}}
The ''[[Can-Can]]'' as presented at the Alhambra by the 'Parisian Colonna' troupe proved so sexually provocative that in October 1870 the Alhambra was deprived of its dancing licence.

Another example of the fare on offer was this 1882 production, written by [[Dion Boucicault]]{{efn|It may be that his diminutive son ([[Dion Boucicault Jr.]]) played opposite this statuesque woman.}} and [[James Planche|J. R. Planche]]:

This young lady was born on the 31st January, 1866, at [[Salzwedel-Land|Benkendorf]], a village near the Thuringia Mountains, Germany, and has attained the remarkable height of {{convert|8|ft|2|in|m}}, and is still growing.|sign=Alhambra Theatre poster. Marian the Giant Amazon Queen, 1882&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/evanion/RECORD.ASP?EvanID=4707 British Library Collection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127112212/http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/evanion/RECORD.ASP?EvanID=4707 |date=27 January 2007 }} accessed: 26 Nov 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early films were also a part of the entertainment, with [[Robert W. Paul]], a former collaborator of [[Birt Acres]], presenting his first theatrical programme on 25 March 1896. This included films featuring cartoonist [[William Mecham|Tom Merry]] drawing caricatures of the German Emperor [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (1895),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/23159 ''Tom Merry Lightning Cartoonist, sketching Kaiser Wilhelm II'', Birt Acres (1895) (BFI)] accessed 3 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prince Bismarck]] (1895).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/565486 ''Tom Merry Lightning Cartoonist, sketching Bismarck'', Birt Acres (1895) (BFI)] accessed 3 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Merry had previously performed his lightning fast drawing as part of a music hall stage act.

During World War I, a series of hit [[revues]] played at the Alhambra that included ''[[The Bing Boys Are Here]]'' (1916), which featured the first performances of the song ''[[If You Were The Only Girl In The World]]'', performed by [[Violet Lorraine]] and [[George Robey]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070129065521/http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/Violet%20Lorraine%20and%20George%20Robey%20-%20If%20You%20Were%20The%20Only.mp3]. This was followed by ''The Bing Boys on Broadway'' (1917) and ''The Bing Boys are There'' (1918).  The music for the revues was written by [[Nat D. Ayer]] with lyrics by Clifford Grey, and the text was by [[George Grossmith, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstworldwar.com/audio/ifyouweretheonlygirl.htm ''If You Were The Only Girl In The World'' (First World War)] accessed 24 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other theatres, the Alhambra went into decline after World War I owing to the increasing popularity of cinema and radio. It was demolished in 1936 to make way for the [[Odeon Leicester Square]], which remains on the site. The entrance on [[Charing Cross Road]] has also been demolished and is now a modern office block.

A '''bachelor party''', also known as a '''stag party''', '''stag night''', '''stag do''', '''stag weekend''' (in the United Kingdom, [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]], and [[Ireland]]), or a '''buck's night''' (in Australia)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theknot.ninemsn.com.au/wedding-planning/pre-wedding-events/bucks-party/10-great-bucks-night-ideas|title=10 Great Bucks Night Ideas|date=2014|accessdate=25 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320042150/http://theknot.ninemsn.com.au/wedding-planning/pre-wedding-events/bucks-party/10-great-bucks-night-ideas|archivedate=20 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[party]] held for the man who is to shortly enter [[marriage]].
  
A bachelor party is usually planned by the [[groomsman]], occasionally with the assistance of a [[Party service|bachelor party planning company]]. 

The first references to Western bachelor parties in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] date to the 19th century.&lt;ref name="BradshawBishop2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Graham|last2=Bishop|first2=Tom|last3=Kishi|first3=Tetsuo|title=Special Section, Updating Shakespeare|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|language=English |isbn=9780754690139|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, bachelor parties involved a [[black tie]] banquet hosted by the father of the groom that included a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] in honour of the groom and bride.&lt;ref name="Haire2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1904885,00.html|title=A Brief History Of Bachelor Parties|journal=Time|last=Haire|first=Meaghan|date=16 June 2009|language=English|accessdate=15 December 2017|quote=In the past, a bachelor party could commonly involve a black-tie dinner hosted by the groom's father, with toasts to the groom and the bride.

==History==
The bachelor party dates back as early as the 5th century B.C. The ancient [[Spartans]] celebrated the groom's last night as a single man in which they held a dinner and made toasts on his behalf.

In 1896, Herbert Barnum Seeley, a grandson of [[P. T. Barnum]], threw a stag party (known as the "Awful Seeley Dinner") for his brother at restaurant [[Sherry's]] in New York City. The party had a dancer, nicknamed "Little Egypt", who allegedly danced naked in desserts. The party was dissolved in the early morning by an officer. Afterwards, the Seeley family brought the police officer to the police board trial for "conduct unbecoming to an officer of the law." At that time, that incident brought the light to the "behind closed doors" matters with bachelor parties.

The term "bachelor", originally meaning "a young knight-in-training", was firstly mentioned in the 14th century to refer to an unmarried man in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. In 1922, the term "bachelor party" was published in [[William Chambers (publisher)|William Chambers]]'s ''Journal of Literature, Science and Arts'' and was described as a "jolly old" party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1904885,00.html|title=Bachelor Parties|journal=Time|date=16 June 2009|access-date=12 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101015353/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1904885,00.html|archivedate=1 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent event for the bride-to-be is known as a [[bachelorette party]] or hens' night.

Some also choose instead to hold a so-called ''[[stag and doe]]'' party in the US, or a ''hag party'' or ''hag do'' in the UK ("hag" being a combination of the words "hen" and "stag"), in which both the bride and groom attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11864506/Hens-and-stags-So-last-century.-Its-all-about-the-hag-do.html |title=Hens and stags?

===Germany===
In Germany, this event is called ''Junggesellenabschied'', which literally means "bachelor farewell". There is also a separate event that the couple celebrates together on the evening prior to their wedding, called ''[[Polterabend]]''. At the Polterabend, the guests break old porcelain and earthenware to bring luck to the couple's marriage. The tradition is said to go back to pre-Christian times; by noisily breaking ceramics, evil spirits – especially spirits of envy – are supposed to be driven out. In the last couple of years, Anglo-style bachelor parties have become more and more popular among bachelors. In parts of northern Germany that lack a [[Carnival]] tradition, funny costuming has become a popular part of bachelor or bachelorette parties.

Some parts of Germany have a related custom, in which a person who is not yet married by their 30th birthday, is made to dress up in an embarrassing fashion by their friends and to do silly tasks that most often include some kind of cleaning work.

===France===
In France and in many French-speaking regions such as [[Quebec]], the bachelor party is called ''{{lang|fr|enterrement de vie de garçon}}'', which literally means "(the) burial of the life as a boy" or "burial/funeral of the life as a bachelor". For women it is ''{{lang|fr|enterrement de vie de jeune fille}}'', translated as "burial/funeral of the life as a young girl/maiden". As in English-speaking countries, such parties often feature heavy drinking and various (although gentle) humiliations, and sometimes the presence of a stripper.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Israel===
In Israel, the bachelor party is called ''{{lang|he|מסיבת רווקים}}'', literally meaning a party of single men. {{clarify|date=August 2016}} Such parties may feature heavy drinking and sometimes the presence of strippers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Very Israeli Bachelor Party|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/a-very-israeli-bachelor-party/|newspaper=[[Times of Israel]]|accessdate=18 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160220052857/http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/a-very-israeli-bachelor-party/|archivedate=20 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or else other recreational bonding activities undertaken together, such as paintball or an overseas trip lasting a few days.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
In the United Kingdom, it is now common for the party to last for more than one evening, hence the increasing prevalence of the phrase "stag weekend", or "stag do". A spin-off has been the growth of the stag weekend industry in the UK with various companies taking over the preparation of the event.{{cn|date=May 2018}}&lt;!-- An individual company is not a source, see [[WP:REFSPAM]] --&gt;

In the UK, stag weekend trips are becoming mini-holidays with the groups taking part in various day-time activities as well as the expected night out on the town. They may involve travelling to another location in the UK or going abroad,&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;Boyer, David.

===United States and Canada===

In the United States, [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://las-vegas-bachelor-party.com/las-vegas-bachelor-party-packages/|title=Las Vegas Bachelor Party|website=Bachelor Party site|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911155238/http://las-vegas-bachelor-party.com/las-vegas-bachelor-party-packages/|archivedate=11 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is both a popular bachelor party destination and location for the wedding itself.&lt;ref name="boyer"/&gt; Increasingly, "destination bachelor parties" are replacing standard nights out, with Americans traveling to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] or [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Michael. "Bachelor parties skip town". ''Crain's Chicago Business''. 7 May 2007. p.&amp;nbsp;53–58. ''MasterFILE Premier'' EBSCOHost. Retrieved 23 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachelor parties in the US stereotypically entail the mass consumption of alcohol, hiring a [[stripper]], and general rowdiness toward which the bride might not have a positive reaction; in fact, the defining feature of the bachelor party is that the fiancée is not present. Increasingly, bachelor parties have come to symbolize the last time when the groom is free of the influence of his new wife/partner. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  [[Pop out cake]]s are sometimes associated.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Canadian bachelor parties generally consist of a group of bachelors celebrating their singleness.

Canadian cities such as [[Vancouver]] or [[Niagara Falls]] are popular stag party destinations due to their large number of [[strip club]]s with "dance contact" ([[lap dance|lap dancing]]). Montreal in particular is popular for this purpose with both Canadians and Americans alike.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

As an alternative, the best man may plan an activity in secret with friends that they feel the groom will enjoy. Many grooms-to-be have been treated to camping trips with friends, fishing trips, sporting events, video games, poker, barbecuing, and other activities.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The 2008 documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May. "Ben Hammott" relating to his alleged discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; Burgess claims Ben Hammott would have found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: a mummified corpse, which he believed were [[Mary Magdalene]]. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio'', entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borley Rectory''' was a Victorian house that gained infamy as "the most haunted house in England" after being described as such by [[parapsychology|psychic researcher]] [[Harry Price]].{{sfnp|Floyd|2002|p=36}} Built in 1862 to house the [[rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]] of the parish of [[Borley]] and his family, it was badly damaged by fire in 1939 and demolished in 1944.

The large [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]]-style rectory in the village of Borley had been alleged to be haunted ever since it was built. These reports multiplied suddenly in 1929, after the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' published an account of a visit by paranormal researcher Harry Price, who wrote two books supporting claims of paranormal activity.

The uncritical acceptance of Price's reports prompted a formal study by the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.

A short programme commissioned by the [[BBC]] about the alleged manifestations, scheduled to be broadcast in September 1956, was cancelled owing to concerns about a possible legal action by Marianne Foyster, widow of the last rector to live in the house.{{r|HauntedRectory}}
{{TOC limit|2}}

==History==
Borley Rectory was constructed on Hall Road near [[Borley Church]] by the Reverend Henry Dawson Ellis Bull in 1862;&lt;ref&gt;''Bury and Norwich Post'', August 1862&lt;/ref&gt; he moved in a year after being named [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the parish.&lt;ref&gt;''Suffolk Free Press'', February 20, 1862&lt;/ref&gt; The house replaced an earlier rectory on the site that had been destroyed by fire in 1841.{{sfnp|Downes|2012|loc=Background to Borley Rectory}} It was eventually enlarged by the addition of a wing to house Bull's family of fourteen children.{{r|Glanville}}

The nearby church, the nave of which may date from the 12th century,{{sfnp|Pevsner|1973|p=95|ps=none}} serves a scattered rural community of three hamlets that make up the parish. There are several substantial farmhouses and the fragmentary remains of Borley Hall, once the seat of the [[Waldegrave family]]. Ghost hunters quote the legend of a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] supposedly built in this area in about 1362, according to which a monk from the monastery conducted a relationship with a nun from a nearby convent. After their affair was discovered, the monk was executed and the nun bricked up alive in the convent walls. It was confirmed in 1938 that this legend had no historical basis and seemed to have been fabricated by the rector's children to romanticise their Gothic-style red-brick rectory. The story of the walling-up of the nun may have come from [[Rider Haggard]]'s novel ''[[Montezuma's Daughter]]'' (1893) or [[Walter Scott]]'s epic poem "[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]" (1808).{{r|Bullsheet}}

==Hauntings==
[[File:Borley3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alleged sighting in the grounds of the rectory]]
The first paranormal events reportedly occurred in about 1863, since a few locals later remembered having heard unexplained footsteps within the house at about that time. On 28 July 1900, four daughters of the rector, Henry Dawson Ellis Bull, saw what they thought was the ghost of a nun at twilight, about {{convert|40|yard}} from the house; they tried to talk to it, but it disappeared as they got closer.{{sfnp|Price|2006|pp=28–30}} The local organist, Ernest Ambrose later said that the family at the rectory were "very convinced that they had seen an apparition on several occasions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ernest |last=Ambrose |title=Organs and Organists |work=Melford Memories |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various people claimed to have witnessed a variety of puzzling incidents, such as a phantom coach driven by two [[Headless Horseman|headless horsemen]], during the next four decades. Bull died in 1892 and his son, the Reverend Henry ("Harry") Foyster Bull, took over the living.{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=16}}

On 9 June 1928, Harry Bull died and the rectory again became vacant.{{sfnp|Price|2006|pp=16–17}} In the following year, on the second day October,{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=17}} the Reverend Guy Eric Smith and his wife moved into the house. Soon after moving in, Smith's wife, while cleaning out a cupboard, came across a brown paper package containing the skull of a young woman.{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=20}} Shortly after, the family reported a variety of incidents including the sounds of servant bells ringing despite their being disconnected, lights appearing in windows and unexplained footsteps. In addition, Smith's wife believed she saw a [[horse-drawn carriage]] at night. The Smiths contacted the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' asking to be put in touch with the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR). On 10 June 1929 the newspaper sent a reporter, who promptly wrote the first in a series of articles detailing the mysteries of Borley. The paper also arranged for [[Harry Price]], a paranormal researcher, to make his first visit to the house. He arrived on 12 June{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=19}} and immediately phenomena of a new kind appeared, such as the throwing of stones, a vase and other objects. "Spirit messages" were tapped out from the frame of a mirror. As soon as Price left, these ceased. Smith's wife later maintained that she already suspected Price, an expert conjurer, of falsifying the phenomena.{{sfnp|Dingwall|Goldney|Hall|1956|p=44}}

The Smiths left Borley on 14 July 1929 and the parish had some difficulty in finding a replacement. The following year the Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster (1878–1945), a first cousin of the Bulls, and his wife Marianne (née Marianne Emily Rebecca Shaw) (1899–1992) moved into the rectory{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=17}} with their adopted daughter Adelaide, on 16 October 1930.{{sfnp|Dingwall|Goldney|Hall|1956|p=75}} Lionel Foyster wrote an account of various strange incidents that occurred between the time the Foysters moved in and October 1935, which was sent to Harry Price. These included bell-ringing, windows shattering, throwing of stones and bottles, wall-writing and the locking of their daughter in a room with no key. Marianne Foyster reported to her husband a whole range of [[poltergeist]] phenomena that included her being thrown from her bed.{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=36}} On one occasion, Adelaide was attacked by "something horrible".{{sfnp|O'Neal|1994|p=80}} Foyster tried twice to conduct an [[exorcism]], but his efforts were fruitless; in the middle of the first exorcism, he was struck in the shoulder by a fist-size stone. Because of the publicity in the ''Daily Mirror'', these incidents attracted the attention of several [[psychic researcher]]s, who after investigation were unanimous in suspecting that they were caused, consciously or unconsciously, by Marianne Foyster. She later said that she felt that some of the incidents were caused by her husband in concert with one of the psychic researchers, but other events appeared to her to be genuine paranormal phenomena. She later admitted that she was having a [[sexual relationship]] with the lodger, Frank Pearless,{{r|Lawless}}{{efn|Pearless styled himself François D'Arles, and in his diaries Lionel Foyster refers to him as "Frank Lawless".{{r|Lawless}}}} and that she used paranormal explanations to cover up her liaisons.{{sfnp|Wood|1992|p=}} The Foysters left Borley in October 1935 as a result of Lionel Foyster's ill health.{{sfnp|Dingwall|Goldney|Hall|1956|p=75}}

==Price investigation==
Borley remained vacant for some time after the Foysters' departure. In May 1937, Price took out a year-long rental agreement with [[Queen Anne's Bounty]], the owners of the property.{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=}}&lt;ref name=nicholas1&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholas |first=Margaret |year=1986 |title=World's Greatest Psychics &amp; Mystics |publisher=Octopus |isbn=978-0-600-58612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through an advertisement in ''[[The Times]]'' on 25 May 1937{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=38}} and subsequent personal interviews, Price recruited a corps of 48 "official observers", mostly students, who spent periods, mainly during weekends, at the rectory with instructions to report any phenomena that occurred. In March 1938 Helen Glanville (the daughter of S. J. Glanville, one of Price's helpers) conducted a [[planchette]] [[séance]] in Streatham in south London.{{sfnp|Price|2006|pp=276–80}} Price reported that she made contact with two spirits, the first of which was that of a young nun who identified herself as Marie Lairre.{{sfnp|Price|2006|pp=276–80}} According to the planchette story Marie was a French nun who left her religious order and travelled to England to marry a member of the Waldegrave family, the owners of Borley's 17th-century manor house, Borley Hall. She was said to have been murdered in an older building on the site of the rectory, and her body either buried in the cellar or thrown into a disused well.{{sfnp|Fanthorpe|Fanthorpe|1997|p=52}} The wall writings were alleged to be her pleas for help; one read "Marianne, please help me get out".{{sfnp|Floyd|2002|p=37}}

The second spirit to be contacted identified himself as Sunex Amures,{{sfnp|Price|2006|pp=279–80}} and claimed that he would set fire to the rectory at nine o'clock that night, 27 March 1938.{{sfnp|Karl|2007|p=33}} He also said that, at that time, the bones of a murdered person would be revealed.{{sfnp|Wood|1992|p=50}}

===Fire===
[[File:Borley Rectoy2.jpg|thumb|right|Rectory after the fire]]
On 27 February 1939 the new owner of the rectory, Captain W. H. Gregson, was unpacking boxes and accidentally knocked over an [[oil lamp]] in the hallway.{{sfnp|Price|2006|p=13}}{{efn|The house was never connected to a gas or electricity supply, and water was obtained from a well in the courtyard.{{r|Glanville}}}} The fire quickly spread and the house was severely damaged. After investigating the cause of the blaze the insurance company concluded that the fire had been started deliberately.{{sfnp|Wood|1992|pp=3–4}}

A Miss Williams from nearby Borley Lodge said she saw the figure of the ghostly nun in the upstairs window and, according to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story.{{sfnp|Dingwall|Goldney|Hall|1956|p=147}} In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman.{{sfnp|Dingwall|Goldney|Hall|1956|p=154}} The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.{{sfnp|Fielding|O'Keeffe|2011|loc=chapter 4}}

==Society for Psychical Research investigation==

After Price's death in 1948, ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reporter Charles Sutton accused him of faking phenomena. Sutton claimed that whilst visiting the rectory with Price in 1929 he was hit on the head by a large [[pebble]]. Sutton stated that he seized Price and found his coat pockets filled with different sized stones.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Paul. (2000). ''A History of Terror: Fear &amp; Dread Through the Ages''. Sutton. p. 192. {{ISBN|978-0750931861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, [[Eric J. Dingwall|Eric Dingwall]], [[K. M. Goldney]] and [[Trevor H. Hall]], three members of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR), two of whom had been Price's most loyal associates, investigated his claims about Borley. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, ''The Haunting of Borley Rectory'', which concluded that Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.&lt;ref name="Dingwall1956"&gt;Dingwall, E. J.; Goldney, K. M.; Hall, T. H. (1956). [http://www.harrypricewebsite.co.uk/Borley/PriceatBorley/HBR/hbr-contents.htm ''The Haunting of Borley Rectory'']. Duckworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Borley Report", as the SPR study has become known, stated that many of the phenomena were either faked or due to natural causes such as rats and the strange acoustics attributed to the odd shape of the house. In their conclusion, Dingwall, Goldney, and Hall wrote "when analysed, the evidence for haunting and poltergeist activity for each and every period appears to diminish in force and finally to vanish away."&lt;ref name="Dingwall1956"/&gt; [[Terence Hines]] wrote that "Mrs. Marianne Foyster, wife of the Rev. Lionel Foyster who lived at the rectory from 1930 to 1935, was actively engaged in fraudulently creating [haunted] phenomena. Price himself 'salted the mine' and faked several phenomena while he was at the rectory."&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 94–95. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marianne Foyster, later in her life, admitted she had seen no apparitions and that the alleged [[ghost]]ly noises were caused by the wind, friends she invited to the house and in other cases by herself playing practical jokes on her husband.&lt;ref name="Hoggart1995"&gt;Hoggart, Simon., Hutchinson, Mike. (1995). ''Bizarre Beliefs''. Richard Cohen Books. p. 186. {{ISBN|978-1573921565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the legends about the rectory had been invented. The children of the Rev. Harry Bull who lived in the house before Lionel Foyster claimed to have seen nothing and were surprised they had been living in what was described as England's most haunted house.&lt;ref name="Hoggart1995"/&gt;

Robert Hastings was one of the few SPR researchers to defend Price.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, Robert. (1969).    [http://www.harrypricewebsite.co.uk/Borley/PriceatBorley/Hastings/hastings-contents.htm ''An Examination of the Borley Report'']. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 55: 66–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Price's literary executor [[Paul Tabori]] and [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]] have also defended Price against accusations of fraud. A similar approach was made by Ivan Banks in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Tabori, Paul., [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Underwood, Peter]]. (1973). ''Ghosts of Borley: Annals of the Haunted Rectory''. David &amp; Charles. {{ISBN|978-0715361184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Ivan. (1996). ''The Enigma of Borley Rectory''. Foulsham &amp; Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0572021627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Coleman in an SPR report in 1997 wrote Price's defenders are unable to rebut the criticisms convincingly.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Michael. (1997). ''The Flying Bricks of Borley''. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. Volume. 61, No. 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Business''''' ({{lang-ru|Би́знес}}; {{lang-uk|Бізне с}}) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Russian language|Russian-language]] weekly business newspaper published every Monday. Web-Site https://business-journal.com.ua

==1992–1994==
The newspaper was first published in [[Kiev]] in November 1992. The idea was put forward by Sergey Melnichuk. The motto of the publication was "Read! Think! Do!" The first two years of ''Business'' was a collection of leaflets about buying and selling. Sergei Melnichuk directly supervised the release.

==1994–1998==
In 1994 he decided to broaden the focus to provide economic news and analysis material. That same year Konstantin Donin became editor in chief. Melnichuk tried to expand to three regions, issuing three regional newspapers: ''Business-Donbass'', ''Business-Kharkov'' and ''Business-Crimea''. All publications were issued in Russian. 

During 1994–1995, the newspaper developed rapidly working with advertisers. 

In 1996 the newspaper added a colored cover and raised ad rates. Profitability reached 300% and monthly advertising revenues reached $1.5 million.

In 1996–1997 a group of journalists left ''Business'' to work in the newspaper ''Business Week'', but the financial crisis in 1998 buried the rival. 

==1998–2002==
In February 1998 the producing editor of ''Business'' was intended to be Kramaranko Alexander, who also headed the department "of the Company and the markets." The 1998 financial crisis hit Ukrainian business media, but was overcome in 2000.

Today, weekly circulation is over 60,000 copies, including 44,000 delivered subscriptions.

In April 2002 the chief editor left for ''Kostyanstyn Donin'', a newspaper headed by Igor Vlasjuk.

==2003–present==
In 2003, ''Business'' began to change the concept design and started color printing.

Khmers living abroad may choose to celebrate during a weekend rather than just specifically April 13th through 16th. The Khmer New Year coincides with the traditional solar new year in several parts of India, [[Nepal]], Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos  and Thailand. 

Khmer New Year's celebration dates back to ancient times and long ago, and a large part is linked to [[Hinduism]] in [[India]] . "Khmer New Year" is the name of Cambodian festivals, which celebrate New Year's Eve in the traditional lunar calendar. In fact, the ancient year of the ancient year, in January, according to the diary of [[Zhou Daguan]] which came to the [[Khmer Empire]] in 1296 AD, the 13th century later, changed in April to [[lunar calendar]]. right, and the months of the harvest season. The three-day holiday begins on New Year's Day, usually on April 13th or 14th, at the end of the harvest season when farmers enjoy their crops before the beginning of the rainy season. Cambodians living abroad may choose to celebrate during the weekend instead of on April 13 to April 16. The Khmer New Year coincided with the new year of sunlight in parts of [[India]], [Nepal], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Khmer New Year there are also related legends by Cambodian Owner Professors' 'Treong Ngea' '' 1969 about the parable of the three Parallels between the god of [[Brahmā]] (four faces) with the god of [[Vishnu]] has been born into a boy named "Tommabal Komar" has both aesthetic animal language and has learned many other scriptures and turned to [[Buddhism ]].[http://www.cam-cc.org/calendar/newyear.php] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Daguan] 

Cambodians also use Buddhist Era to count the year based on the [[Buddhist calendar]]. For 2018, it will be 2562 BE (Buddhist Era).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utbf.org/en/resources/calendar/?y=2016&amp;m=4|title=Buddhist Calendar|date=April 2016|publisher=UTBF.ORG|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
{{main|Trial of Clay Shaw}}

New Orleans District Attorney [[Jim Garrison]] prosecuted Clay Shaw on the charge that Shaw and a group of activists, including [[David Ferrie]] and [[Guy Banister]], were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]]. Garrison arrested Shaw on March 1, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthors= |title=New Orleans Civic Leader Accused. Quizzed for Five Hour's About Conspiracy in Assassination |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/510216142.html?dids=510216142:510216142&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+02,+1967&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=JFK+PLOT+ARREST&amp;pqatl=google |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 2, 1967 |accessdate=April 12, 2010 | first=Nicholas C | last=Chriss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison believed that Shaw was the man named as "[[Clay Bertrand]]" in the [[Warren Commission]] Report. Garrison said that Shaw used the [[pseudonym|alias]] Clay Bertrand in New Orleans' [[homosexual|gay]] society.&lt;ref&gt;James Phelan, ''Scandals, Scamps, and Scoundrels'', pp. 150-51. ({{ISBN|0-394-48196-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Garrison|Garrison, Jim]]. ''On The Trail of the Assassins'', (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), pp. 85-86. {{ISBN|0-941781-02-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, which took place in January–February 1969, Garrison called insurance salesman Perry Russo{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} as his main witness. Russo testified that he had attended a party at the apartment of anti-Castro activist [[David Ferrie]]. At the party, Russo said that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] (who Russo said was introduced to him as "Leon Oswald"), David Ferrie, and "Clay Bertrand" (who Russo identified in the courtroom as Shaw) had discussed killing Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Testimony of Perry Raymond Russo"&gt;[http://www.jfk-online.com/pr01.html Testimony of Perry Raymond Russo], State of Louisiana vs. Clay L. Shaw, February 10, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation included plans for the "triangulation of crossfire" and alibis for the participants.&lt;ref name="Testimony of Perry Raymond Russo"/&gt;

Critics of Garrison argue that his own records indicate that Russo's story had evolved over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfkassassination.net/willing.htm |title=Way Too Willing Witness |publisher=Jfkassassination.net |date= |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key source was the "Sciambra Memo," which recorded Assistant D.A.

On March 1, 1969, Shaw was found not guilty on all charges after the jury deliberated for less than one hour. Despite his acquittal, Shaw's reputation and public image never fully recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Clay Shaw Interview, ''Penthouse'', November 1969, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/garr/trial/Feb_28e/html/Feb_28e_0048a.htm |title=Clay Shaw Trial Transcripts, February 28, 1969, page 47 |publisher=Aarclibrary.org |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The Times-Picayune archive |url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2010/07/andrew_moo_moo_sciambra_who_wo.html |title=John Pope, "Andrew 'Moo Moo' Sciambra, who worked on Jim Garrison investigation of JFK assassination, dies at age 75."

The '''debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki''' concerns the [[Nuclear ethics|ethical]], legal, and military controversies surrounding the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] on 6 August and 9 August 1945 at the close of [[World War II]] (1939–45). The [[Soviet–Japanese War|Soviet Union declared war on Japan]] an hour before 9 August&lt;ref name="avalon"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Avalon Project : Soviet Declaration of War on Japan|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/s4.asp|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] at one minute past midnight; [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] on 15 August.

On 26 July 1945, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], and [[President of the Republic of China|Chairman]] of the Chinese [[Nationalist Government]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] issued the [[Potsdam Declaration]], which outlined the terms of surrender for the [[Empire of Japan]] as agreed upon at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. This ultimatum stated if Japan did not surrender, it would face "prompt and utter destruction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/etc/c06.html "Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender issued at Potsdam Germany"], 26 July 1945. Retrieved on 15 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some debaters focus on the presidential decision-making process, and others on whether or not the bombings were the proximate cause of Japanese surrender.

Over the course of time, different arguments have gained and lost support as new evidence has become available and as new studies have been completed. A primary and continuing focus has been on the role of the bombings in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s justification for them based upon the premise that the bombings precipitated the surrender. This remains the subject of both [[Scholarly method|scholarly]] and popular debate. In 2005, in an overview of historiography about the matter, J. Samuel Walker wrote, "the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue".&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Walker stated, "The fundamental issue that has divided scholars over a period of nearly four decades is whether the use of the bomb was necessary to achieve victory in the war in the Pacific on terms satisfactory to the United States."&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{Harvnb|Walker|2005|p=334}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the bombings generally assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties on both sides in the [[Operation Downfall|planned invasion]] of Japan: [[Kyūshū]] was to be invaded in November 1945 and [[Honshū]] four months later. It was thought Japan would not surrender unless there was an overwhelming demonstration of destructive capability. Those who oppose the bombings argue it was militarily unnecessary,&lt;ref&gt;''The Collins Encyclopedia of Military History'', Dupuy &amp; Dupuy, BCA 1994, p. 1308&lt;/ref&gt; inherently immoral, a [[war crime]], or a form of [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stohl|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=R60c_2nCcnYC&amp;pg=PA279 279]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics believe a naval blockade and conventional bombings would have forced Japan to surrender unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Ronald C; Kauzlarich, David (2011), Rothe, Dawn; Mullins, Christopher W, eds., "Nuclear weapons, international law, and the normalization of state crime", State crime: Current perspectives, pp. 94–121, {{ISBN|978-0-8135-4901-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics believe Japan was more motivated to surrender by the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria and other Japanese-held areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tanner |first=Harold Miles |date=2013 |title=The Battle for Manchuria and the Fate of China: Siping, 1946 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3sG_BDCnKIC&amp;pg=PA30 |location=Bloomington, IN |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages=30–31 |isbn=978-0-253-00734-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hasegawa |first=Tsuyoshi |date=2007 |title=The End of the Pacific War: Reappraisals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjW49VTRhxQC&amp;pg=PA142 |location=Stanford, CA |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=142 |isbn=978-0-8047-5427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. anticipated losing many combatants in Downfall, although the number of [[Operation Downfall#Estimated casualties|expected fatalities and wounded]] is subject to some debate. U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] stated in 1953 he had been advised U.S. casualties could range from 250,000 to one million combatants.&lt;ref&gt;President Truman to James L. Cate, January 12, 1953. http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/small/mb18g.htm {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203193510/http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/small/mb18g.htm |date=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/giangrec.htm | title= Transcript of "Operation Downfall [U.S. invasion of Japan&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: US Plans and Japanese Counter-Measures" | last= Giangreco | first= Dennis M. | date= 1998-02-16 | work= Beyond Bushido: Recent Work in Japanese Military History |publisher= | accessdate= 2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Ralph Bard]], a member of the [[Interim Committee]] on atomic matters, stated that while meeting with Truman in the summer of 1945 they discussed the bomb's use in the context of massive combatant and non-combatant casualties from invasion, with Bard raising the possibility of a million Allied combatants being killed. As Bard opposed using the bomb without warning Japan first, he cannot be accused of exaggerating casualty expectations to justify the bomb's use, and his account is evidence that Truman was aware of, and government officials discussed, the possibility of one million casualties.&lt;ref name=maddox&gt;{{Harvnb|Maddox|2004|pp=69–71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A quarter of a million casualties is roughly the level the Joint War Plans Committee estimated, in its paper (JWPC 369/1) prepared for Truman's 18 June meeting. A review of documents from the Truman Library shows Truman's initial draft response to the query describes Marshall only as saying "one quarter of a million would be the minimum". The "as much as a million" phrase was added to the final draft by Truman's staff, so as not to appear to contradict an earlier statement given in a published article by Stimson (former Secretary of War).&lt;ref&gt;The Final Months of the War With Japan.

Marshall]] and [[Douglas MacArthur]] signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carroll|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yAxVS2R0WUC&amp;pg=PA48 48]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a large number of Japanese combatant and non-combatant casualties were expected as a result of such actions. Contemporary estimates of Japanese deaths from an invasion of the Home Islands range from several hundreds of thousands to as high as ten million. General MacArthur's staff provided an estimated range of American deaths depending on the duration of the invasion, and also estimated a 22:1 ratio of Japanese to American deaths. From this, a low figure of somewhat more than 200,000 Japanese deaths can be calculated for a short invasion of two weeks, and almost three million Japanese deaths if the fighting lasted four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdoEpslpoi8C&amp;pg=PA79 |page=79 |title=The Invasion of Japan: Alternative to the Bomb |first=John Ray |last=Skates |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-1570033544}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely cited estimate of five to ten million Japanese deaths came from a study by [[William Shockley]] and [[Quincy Wright]]; the upper figure was used by Assistant Secretary of War [[John J.

The great [[World War II casualties#Military casualties by branch of service|loss of life]] during the [[battle of Iwo Jima]] and [[List of naval and land-based operations in Pacific Theater during World War II|other Pacific islands]] gave U.S. leaders an idea of the casualties that would happen with a mainland invasion. Of the 22,060 Japanese combatants entrenched on Iwo Jima, 21,844 died either from fighting or by ritual suicide. Only 216 Japanese POWs were held at the hand of the Americans during the battle. According to the official Navy Department Library website, "The 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead" with 19,217 wounded.&lt;ref name= Burrell83&gt;{{Harvnb|Burrell|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8J4wkgcqCIC&amp;pg=PA83 83]}}, talks about how many historians have overestimated the number Japanese defenders, with 20,000 and even 25,000 listed. Burrell puts the range between 18,061 and 18,591, with exactly 216 of these taken prisoner. The rest were KIA or MIA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/battleiwojima.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206014141/http://history.navy.mil/library/online/battleiwojima.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 December 2006 |title=Battle for Iwo Jima, 1945 |publisher=The Navy Department Library |date=16 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put this into context, the 82-day [[Battle of Okinawa]] lasted from early April until mid-June 1945 and U.S. casualties (out of five Army and two Marine divisions) were above 62,000, of which more than 12,000 were killed or missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Appleman|Burns|Gugeler|Stevens|2000|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military had nearly 500,000 [[Purple Heart]] medals manufactured in anticipation of potential casualties from the planned invasion of Japan. To date, all American military casualties of the 60 years following the end of World War II, including the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War]]s, have not exceeded that number. In 2003, there were still 120,000 of these Purple Heart medals in stock.&lt;ref name="surplus hearts"&gt;Giangreco, Dennis M. &amp; [[Kathryn Moore|Moore, Kathryn]], [http://hnn.us/articles/1801.html "Are New Purple Hearts Being Manufactured to Meet the Demand?"]; ''History News Network'' (December 1, 2003), Retrieved December 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the number available, combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan were able to keep Purple Hearts on hand for immediate award to wounded soldiers on the field.&lt;ref name="surplus hearts"/&gt;

===Speedy end of war saved lives===
Supporters of the bombings argue waiting for the Japanese to surrender would also have cost lives. "For China alone, depending upon what number one chooses for overall Chinese casualties, in each of the ninety-seven months between July 1937 and August 1945, somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 persons perished, the vast majority of them noncombatants. For the other Asian states alone, the average probably ranged in the tens of thousands per month, but the actual numbers were almost certainly greater in 1945, notably due to the mass death in a famine in Vietnam. Historian Robert P. Newman concluded that each month that the war continued in 1945 would have produced the deaths of 'upwards of 250,000 people, mostly Asian but some Westerners.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|1999|p=163}}.&lt;br&gt;This justification of "saving lives" was never used by Truman in the weeks following the strikes, and there was no need to: the American public viewed the nuclear attacks positively. It did surface years afterwards in his memoirs: during the interim, of course, questions had been raised about the necessity and morality of his decision to atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. See {{Harvnb|Miles|1985|p=1}}: "Even when secret wartime documents were declassified, historians did not focus on the striking inconsistencies between these documents and those parts of the principal decision-makers' memoirs that dealt with estimates of lives saved." Miles, a veteran governmebhnt official and former senior fellow of the [[Wilson Center]], described the notion that Hiroshima saved 500,000 American military and numerous other deaths simply as a "myth".&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the war limited the expansion of the Japanese controlled [[Vietnamese famine of 1945]], stopping it at 1–2 million deaths and also liberated millions of Allied [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and civilian laborers working in harsh conditions under a forced mobilization. In the [[Dutch East Indies]], there was a "forced mobilization of some 4 million—although some estimates are as high as 10 million—''romusha'' (manual laborers)&amp;nbsp;... About 270,000 romusha were sent to the Outer Islands and Japanese-held territories in Southeast Asia, where they joined other Asians in performing wartime construction projects. At the end of the war, only 52,000 were repatriated to [[Java]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, "Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45"] Access date: 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=August 2010}}&lt;!-- This paragraph is missing comparable data, 270,000 forced laborers from "Dutch East Indies" were exported to other Japanese held areas. "At the end of the war, only 52,000 were repatriated to Java." Java is only one island in what was the "Dutch East Indies". The comparison makes it seem that there were almost 220,000 missing laborers. What about laborers who returned to other DEI islands? --&gt;

Supporters also point to an order given by the Japanese War Ministry on August 1, 1944, ordering the execution of Allied POWs, "when an uprising of large numbers cannot be suppressed without the use of firearms" or when the POW camp was in the combat zone, in fear that "escapees from the camp may turn into a hostile fighting force".&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Document_No._2701, The only existing original copy of this general order was found by [[Jack Edwards (Hong Kong)|Jack Edwards]] after the war, in the ruins of the [[Kinkaseki]] prisoner of war camp in [[Formosa]]. ([[Jack Edwards (Hong Kong)|Edwards]] [[#References|References]] p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Operation Meetinghouse]]'' firebombing raid on Tokyo alone killed 100,000 civilians on the night of March 9–10, 1945, causing more civilian death and destruction than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;ref name="hanson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/17724/page5/ Freeman Dyson.

Because the [[United States Army Air Forces]] wanted to use its [[Nuclear fission|fission]] bombs on previously undamaged cities in order to have accurate data on nuclear-caused damage, [[Kokura]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Nagasaki]], and [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]] were preserved from conventional bombing raids. Otherwise, they would all have been [[firebombing|firebombed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Groves|1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Intensive conventional bombing would have continued or increased prior to an invasion. The submarine blockade and the United States Army Air Forces's [[Naval mine|mining]] operation, [[Operation Starvation]], had effectively cut off Japan's imports. A complementary operation against Japan's railways was about to begin, isolating the cities of southern Honshū from the food grown elsewhere in the Home Islands. "Immediately after the defeat, some estimated that 10&amp;nbsp;million people were likely to starve to death", noted historian Daikichi Irokawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|1999|p=351}}; citing Irokawa, ''The Age of Hirohito: In Search of Modern Japan'' (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, fighting continued in the [[Philippines]], [[New Guinea]] and [[Borneo]], and offensives were scheduled for September in southern China and [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. The [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] had, in the week before the surrender, caused over 80,000 deaths.&lt;ref name="hanson"&gt;{{cite web | first= Victor Davis | last= Hanson | authorlink= Victor Davis Hanson | url= http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson200508050714.asp | title= 60 Years Later: Considering Hiroshima | date= 2005-08-05 | work= [[National Review]] | accessdate= 2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1945, nuclear physicist [[Karl Taylor Compton]], who himself took part in the Manhattan Project, visited MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo, and following his visit wrote a defensive article, in which he summarized his conclusions as follows: {{Quote|''If the atomic bomb had not been used'', evidence like that I have cited points to the practical certainty that there would have been many more months of death and destruction on an enormous scale.&lt;ref&gt;Karl T. Compton, [https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/46dec/compton.htm "If the Atomic Bomb Had Not Been Used"], ''The Atlantic Monthly'', December 1946. (Italics in the original.)&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Philippine justice Delfin Jaranilla, member of the [[Tokyo tribunal]], wrote in his judgment:
{{Quote|If a means is justified by an end, the use of the atomic bomb was justified for it brought Japan to her knees and ended the horrible war. If the war had gone longer, without the use of the atomic bomb, how many thousands and thousands of helpless men, women and children would have needlessly died and suffered&amp;nbsp;...?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dower|1998|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Lee Kuan Yew]], the Former [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] concurred:{{cq|date = June 2018}}

{{Quote|But they also showed a meanness and viciousness towards their enemies equal to the [[Huns]]'. [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol Empire|hordes]] could not have been more merciless. I have no doubts about whether the two atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were necessary. Without them, hundreds of thousands of civilians in Malaya and Singapore, and millions in Japan itself, would have perished.}}

Lee witnessed his home city being invaded by the Japanese and was nearly executed in the [[Sook Ching Massacre]].

[[File:Chinese killed by Japanese Army in a ditch, Hsuchow.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese civilians massacred during Japan's campaign of [[total war]] in [[Xuzhou]]]]

Supporters of the bombings have argued the Japanese government had promulgated a [[National Mobilization Law]] and waged [[total war]], ordering many civilians (including women, children, and old people) to work in [[Factory|factories]] and other [[infrastructure]] attached to the [[war effort]] and to fight against any invading force. Unlike the United States and Nazi Germany, over 90% of the Japanese war production was done in unmarked [[workshop]]s and [[Cottage industry|cottage industries]] which were widely dispersed within residential areas in cities and thus making them more extensively difficult to find and attack. In addition, the dropping of [[high explosives]] with [[precision bombing]] was unable to penetrate Japan's dispersed industry, making it entirely impossible to destroy them without causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, ''The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945,'' Random House, 1970, p. 671.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. McFarland, ''A Concise History of the U.S. Air Force,'' Air Force History and Museums Program, October 20, 1997, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. General|General]] [[Curtis LeMay]] stated why he ordered the systematic [[carpet bombing]] of Japanese cities:
{{Quote|We were going after military targets. No point in slaughtering civilians for the mere sake of slaughter. Of course there is a pretty thin veneer in Japan, but the veneer was there. It was their system of dispersal of industry. All you had to do was visit one of those targets after we'd roasted it, and see the ruins of a multitude of houses, with a drill press sticking up through the wreckage of every home. The entire population got into the act and worked to make those airplanes or munitions of war&amp;nbsp;... men, women, children. We knew we were going to kill a lot of women and kids when we burned [a] town. Had to be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Curtis LeMay and his bombing strategy during World War II | url=http://www.basicincome.com/bp/weweregoingafter.htm |accessdate= 21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For six months prior to the use of nuclear weapons in [[combat]], the [[United States Army Air Forces]] under LeMay's command undertook a major [[strategic bombing]] campaign [[Air raids on Japan|against Japanese cities]] through the use of [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], destroying 67 cities and killing an estimated 350,000 civilians. The ''Operation Meetinghouse'' raid on Tokyo on the night of 9/10 March 1945 stands as the deadliest air raid in human history, killing 100,000 civilians and destroying {{convert|16|sqmi}} of the city that night, which caused more civilian deaths and damage to urbanized land than any other single air attack, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution of Cyber War: International Norms for Emerging-Technology Weapons |date=November 1, 2015 |author= Brian M. Mazanec |page=96 |publisher=Potomac Books |isbn= 978-1612-3476-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Harry F. Cunningham, an [[intelligence officer]] of the [[Fifth Air Force]], noted that in addition to civilians producing weapons of war in cities, the Japanese government created [[Volunteer Fighting Corps|a large civilian militia organization]] in order to train millions of civilians to be armed and to resist the American invaders. In his official intelligence review on July 21, 1945, he declared that:
{{Quote|The entire population of Japan is a proper military target&amp;nbsp;... There are no civilians in Japan. We are making war and making it in the all-out fashion which saves American lives, shortens the agony which war is and seeks to bring about an enduring peace. We intend to seek out and destroy the enemy wherever he or she is, in the greatest possible numbers, in the shortest possible time.&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, ''The Last Great Victory: The End of World War II, July/August 1945,'' Dutton Adult, 1995, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Supporters of the bombings have emphasized the strategic significance of the targets. Hiroshima was used as headquarters of the [[Second General Army (Japan)|Second General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]], which commanded the defense of southern Japan with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. The city was also a communication center, an assembly area for combatants, a storage point, and had major industrial factories and workshops as well, and its air defenses consisted of five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Hiroshima Before the Bombing |publisher= [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] | url= http://www.hiroshima-spirit.jp/en/museum/morgue_e11.html | accessdate= 2008-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/showArticle3.cfm?article_id=15045 Hiroshima: Hubertus Hoffmann meets the only U.S. Officer on both A-Missions and one of his Victims] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623060644/http://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/showArticle3.cfm?article_id=15045 |date=2008-06-23 }}, Dr. Hubertus Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt; Nagasaki was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, warships, military equipment, and other war material.

On 30 June 2007, Japan's defense minister [[Fumio Kyūma]] said the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan by the United States during World War II was an inevitable way to end the war. Kyūma said: "I now have come to accept in my mind that in order to end the war, it could not be helped ([[shikata ga nai]]) that an atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and that countless numbers of people suffered great tragedy." Kyūma, who is from Nagasaki, said the bombing caused great suffering in the city, but he does not resent the U.S. because it prevented the Soviet Union from entering the war with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287453,00.html |title=Japanese Defense Chief: Atomic Bombing 'Couldn't Be Helped' |date=30 June 2007 |publisher= [[Fox News]] |accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyūma's comments were similar to those made by [[Emperor Hirohito]] when, in his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, he was asked what he thought of the bombing of Hiroshima, and answered: "It's very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn't be helped (shikata ga nai) because that happened in wartime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bix|2000|p=676}}; {{Harvnb|Dower|1998|p=606}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July 1945, on his way to Potsdam, Truman had re-examined the decision to use the bomb. In the end, he made the decision to drop the atomic bombs on strategic cities. His stated intention in ordering the bombings was to save American lives, to bring about a quick resolution of the war by inflicting destruction, and instilling fear of further destruction, sufficient to cause Japan to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|Polmar|1995|pp=266–70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech to the Japanese people presenting his reasons for surrender on August 15, the Emperor referred specifically to the atomic bombs, stating if they continued to fight it would not only result in "an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/hirohito.htm |title=Emperor Hirohito, Accepting the Potsdam Declaration, Radio Broadcast |date=14 August 1945 |accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the use of the atomic bomb, then-[[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] stated, "The atomic bomb was more than a weapon of terrible destruction; it was a psychological weapon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886289,00.html "Least Abhorrent Choice"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, 3 February 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, [[Mitsuo Fuchida]], the pilot who led the first wave in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]], met with General [[Paul Tibbets]], who piloted the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and told him that:
{{quote|You did the right thing. You know the Japanese attitude at that time, how fanatic they were, they'd die for the Emperor&amp;nbsp;... Every man, woman, and child would have resisted that invasion with sticks and stones if necessary&amp;nbsp;... Can you imagine what a slaughter it would be to invade Japan? It would have been terrible. The Japanese people know more about that than the American public will ever know.&lt;ref&gt;Clear Conscience: The Atom Bomb Vs. the Super Holocaust, p. 87, Raymond Davis&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Japan's leaders refused to surrender===
Some historians see ancient Japanese warrior traditions as a major factor in the resistance in the Japanese military to the idea of surrender. According to one Air Force account,
{{quote|The Japanese code of [[Bushido]]—the way of the warrior'—was deeply ingrained. The concept of ''[[Yamato-damashii]]'' equipped each soldier with a strict code: never be captured, never break down, and never surrender. Surrender was dishonorable. Each soldier was trained to fight to the death and was expected to die before suffering dishonor. Defeated Japanese leaders preferred to take their own lives in the painful [[samurai]] ritual of ''[[seppuku]]'' (called ''hara kiri'' in the West). Warriors who surrendered were deemed not worthy of regard or respect.&lt;ref name="afa-enola-gay"/&gt;}}

[[Japanese militarism]] was aggravated by the [[Great Depression]], and had resulted in countless assassinations of reformers attempting to check military power, among them [[Takahashi Korekiyo]], [[Saitō Makoto]], and [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]]. This created an environment in which opposition to war was a much riskier endeavor.&lt;ref name="Long Day"&gt;{{cite book| author= The Pacific War Research Society | title=Japan's Longest Day | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Richard B. Frank]],
{{quote|The intercepts of Japanese Imperial Army and Navy messages disclosed without exception that Japan's armed forces were determined to fight a final [[Armageddon]] battle in the homeland against an Allied invasion. The Japanese called this strategy Ketsu Go (Operation Decisive). It was founded on the premise that American morale was brittle and could be shattered by heavy losses in the initial invasion. American politicians would then gladly negotiate an end to the war far more generous than unconditional surrender.&lt;ref name="ws-frank"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Why Truman Dropped the Bomb |last= Frank |first= Richard B. |author-link= Richard B.

The [[United States Department of Energy]]'s history of the [[Manhattan Project]] lends some credence to these claims, saying that military leaders in Japan
{{quote|also hoped that if they could hold out until the ground invasion of Japan began, they would be able to inflict so many casualties on the Allies that Japan still might win some sort of negotiated settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Japan Surrenders, August 10–15, 1945 | url= http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/surrender.htm | first= David | last= Rezelman | first2= F.G. | last2= Gosling | first3= Terrence R. | last3= Fehner | year= 2000 | work= [http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/index.htm The Manhattan Project: An Interactive History] | publisher= [[U.S. Department of Energy]] | accessdate= 2008-03-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060929115512/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/surrender.htm | archive-date= 2006-09-29 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While some members of the civilian leadership did use covert diplomatic channels to attempt peace negotiation, they could not negotiate surrender or even a cease-fire. Japan could legally enter into a peace agreement only with the unanimous support of the Japanese cabinet, and in the summer of 1945, the Japanese Supreme War Council, consisting of representatives of the Army, the Navy, and the civilian government, could not reach a consensus on how to proceed.&lt;ref name="Long Day"/&gt;

A political stalemate developed between the military and civilian leaders of Japan, the military increasingly determined to fight despite all costs and odds and the civilian leadership seeking a way to negotiate an end to the war. Further complicating the decision was the fact no cabinet could exist without the representative of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. This meant the Army or Navy could veto any decision by having its Minister resign, thus making them the most powerful posts on the SWC. In early August 1945, the cabinet was equally split between those who advocated an end to the war on one condition, the preservation of the ''[[kokutai]]'', and those who insisted on three other conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bix|2000|p=512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Leave disarmament and demobilization to [[Imperial General Headquarters]]
# No occupation of the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], [[Korea]], or [[Formosa]]
# Delegation to the Japanese government of the punishment of war criminals

The "hawks" consisted of [[Korechika Anami|General Korechika Anami]], [[Yoshijirō Umezu|General Yoshijirō Umezu]], and [[Soemu Toyoda|Admiral Soemu Toyoda]] and were led by Anami. The "doves" consisted of Prime Minister [[Kantarō Suzuki]], Naval Minister [[Mitsumasa Yonai]], and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Shigenori Tōgō]] and were led by Togo.&lt;ref name="Long Day"/&gt; Under special permission of Hirohito, the president of the Privy council, [[Hiranuma Kiichirō]], was also a member of the imperial conference. For him, the preservation of the ''kokutai'' implied not only the Imperial institution but also the Emperor's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bix|2000|p=513}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had an example of unconditional surrender in the [[German Instrument of Surrender]]. On 26 July, Truman and other Allied leaders—except the Soviet Union—issued the [[Potsdam Declaration]] outlining terms of surrender for Japan. The declaration stated, "The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction." It was [[Mokusatsu|not accepted]], though there is debate on Japan's intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coughlin|1953}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bix|1996|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[PBS]] documentary "Victory in the Pacific" (2005), broadcast in the ''[[American Experience]]'' series, historian Donald Miller argues, in the days after the declaration, the Emperor seemed more concerned with moving the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]] to a secure location than with "the destruction of his country". This comment is based on declarations made by the Emperor to [[Kōichi Kido]] on 25 and 31 July 1945, when he ordered the [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan]] to protect "at all cost" the Imperial Regalia.&lt;ref&gt;''Kido Koichi nikki'', Tokyo, Daigaku Shuppankai, 1966, pp.&amp;nbsp;1120–21&lt;/ref&gt;

It has sometimes been argued Japan would have surrendered if simply guaranteed the Emperor would be allowed to continue as formal head of state. However, Japanese diplomatic messages regarding a possible Soviet mediation—intercepted through [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]], and made available to Allied leaders—have been interpreted by some historians to mean, "the dominant militarists insisted on preservation of the old militaristic order in Japan, the one in which they ruled."&lt;ref name="ws-frank"/&gt; On 18 and 20 July 1945, Ambassador [[Naotake Satō|Sato]] cabled to [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Foreign Minister]] [[Shigenori Tōgō|Togo]], strongly advocating that Japan accept an unconditional surrender provided that the U.S. preserved the imperial house (keeping the emperor). On 21 July, in response, Togo rejected the advice, saying that Japan would not accept an unconditional surrender under any circumstance. Togo then said that, "Although it is apparent that there will be more casualties on both sides in case the war is prolonged, we will stand as united against the enemy if the enemy forcibly demands our unconditional surrender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/correspondence/togo-sato/corr_togo-sato.htm |title=Between: Naotaki Sato, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Togo Shigenori, Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs (Togo) |publisher=[[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]] |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gruhl|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0LDWaKwSCNIC&amp;pg=PA215 215]}}; {{Harvnb|Lee|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CAN54NcnjcMC&amp;pg=PA524 521]}}; {{Harvnb|Wainstock|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yDTws6tXo9wC&amp;pg=PA70 71]}}; {{Harvnb|Lynn|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rcr6_8oePYwC&amp;pg=PT209 209]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They also faced potential death sentences in trials for [[Japanese war crimes]] if they surrendered.&lt;ref name="rising-downfall"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~insrisg/bookmarks/bk01/1108downfall.htm | title= Book review: ''Downfall'' [by Richard B.

History professor Robert James Maddox wrote:
{{Quote|
Another myth that has attained wide attention is that at least several of Truman's top military advisers later informed him that using atomic bombs against Japan would be militarily unnecessary or immoral, or both. There is no persuasive evidence that any of them did so. None of the Joint Chiefs ever made such a claim, although one inventive author has tried to make it appear that Leahy did by braiding together several unrelated passages from the admiral's memoirs. Actually, two days after Hiroshima, Truman told aides that Leahy had 'said up to the last that it wouldn't go off.'

Neither MacArthur nor Nimitz ever communicated to Truman any change of mind about the need for invasion or expressed reservations about using the bombs. When first informed about their imminent use only days before Hiroshima, MacArthur responded with a lecture on the future of atomic warfare and even after Hiroshima strongly recommended that the invasion go forward. Nimitz, from whose jurisdiction the atomic strikes would be launched, was notified in early 1945. 'This sounds fine,' he told the courier, 'but this is only February. Can't we get one sooner?'

The best that can be said about Eisenhower's memory is that it had become flawed by the passage of time.

Notes made by one of Stimson's aides indicate that there was a discussion of atomic bombs, but there is no mention of any protest on Eisenhower's part.&lt;ref name="Maddox"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maddox|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Maddox also wrote, "Even after both bombs had fallen and Russia entered the war, Japanese militants insisted on such lenient peace terms that moderates knew there was no sense even transmitting them to the United States. Hirohito had to intervene personally on two occasions during the next few days to induce hardliners to abandon their conditions."&lt;ref name="Maddox"/&gt; "That they would have conceded defeat months earlier, before such calamities struck, is far-fetched to say the least."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maddox|2004|p=xvii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the triple shock of the Soviet intervention and two atomic bombs, the Japanese cabinet was still deadlocked, incapable of deciding upon a course of action due to the power of the Army and Navy factions in cabinet, and of their unwillingness to even consider surrender. Following the personal intervention of the emperor to break the deadlock in favour of surrender, there were no less than three separate coup attempts by senior Japanese officers to try to prevent the surrender and take the Emperor into 'protective custody'. Once these coup attempts had failed, senior leaders of the air force and Navy ordered bombing and ''[[kamikaze]]'' raids on the U.S. fleet (in which some Japanese generals personally participated) to try to derail any possibility of peace. It is clear from these accounts that while many in the civilian government knew the war could not be won, the power of the military in the Japanese government kept surrender from even being considered as a real option prior to the two atomic bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|1999|p=331}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument is that it was the Soviet declaration of war in the days between the bombings that caused the surrender. After the war, Admiral [[Soemu Toyoda]] said, "I believe the Russian participation in the war against Japan rather than the atom bombs did more to hasten the surrender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toland|2003|p=807}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Suzuki also declared that the entry of the USSR into the war made "the continuance of the war impossible".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bunting, World War II Day by Day (Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2001) p. 652&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing news of the event from Foreign Minister Togo, Suzuki immediately said, "Let us end the war", and agreed to finally convene an emergency meeting of the Supreme Council with that aim. The official British history, ''The War Against Japan'', also writes the Soviet declaration of war "brought home to all members of the Supreme Council the realization that the last hope of a negotiated peace had gone and there was no alternative but to accept the Allied terms sooner or later".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The "one condition" faction, led by Togo, seized on the bombing as decisive justification of surrender. [[Kōichi Kido]], one of Emperor Hirohito's closest advisers, stated, "We of the peace party were assisted by the atomic bomb in our endeavor to end the war." [[Hisatsune Sakomizu]], the chief Cabinet secretary in 1945, called the bombing "a golden opportunity given by heaven for Japan to end the war".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Kristof |first= Nicholas D. |authorlink= Nicholas D.

===Militarily unnecessary===
Assistant Secretary Bard was convinced that a standard bombardment and naval blockade would be enough to force Japan into surrendering. Even more, he had seen signs for weeks that the Japanese were actually already looking for a way out of the war. His idea was for the United States to tell the Japanese about the bomb, the impending Soviet entry into the war, and the fair treatment that citizens and the Emperor would receive at the coming [[Allies of World War II#Major affiliated state combatants|Big Three]] [[List of World War II conferences|conference]]. Before the bombing occurred, Bard pleaded with Truman to neither drop the bombs (at least not without warning the population first) nor to invade the entire country, proposing to stop the bloodshed.&lt;ref name=maddox/&gt;

The 1946 United States [[Strategic Bombing Survey]] in Japan, whose members included [[Paul Nitze]],{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} concluded the atomic bombs had been unnecessary to win the war. After reviewing numerous documents, and interviewing hundreds of Japanese civilian and military leaders after Japan surrendered, they reported:

{{quote|There is little point in attempting precisely to impute Japan's unconditional surrender to any one of the numerous causes which jointly and cumulatively were responsible for Japan's disaster. The time lapse between military impotence and political acceptance of the inevitable might have been shorter had the political structure of Japan permitted a more rapid and decisive determination of national policies. Nevertheless, it seems clear that, even without the atomic bombing attacks, air supremacy over Japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.&lt;ref&gt;

And I believe there is a reason why, if the author or authors of that opinion had this evidence in mind, they chose not to refer to it explicitly. The additional evidence submerged within the USSBS reports concerns the new August 11 strategic bombing directive. This reoriented the B-29 campaign away from urban incendiary attacks in favor of a massive attack on Japan's railroad system. This new bombing campaign coupled with Japan's extremely dire food situation does raise a legitimate question as to whether Japan
might have surrendered without the atomic bombs or Soviet entry.''&lt;/ref&gt; One of Nitze's most influential sources was Prince [[Fumimaro Konoe]], who responded to a question asking whether Japan would have surrendered if the atomic bombs had not been dropped by saying resistance would have continued through November or December 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gentile|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ileEUxbAizAC&amp;pg=PA116 116]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians such as Bernstein, Hasegawa, and Newman have criticized Nitze for drawing a conclusion they say went far beyond what the available evidence warranted, in order to promote the reputation of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Air Force]] at the expense of the Army and Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gentile|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ileEUxbAizAC&amp;pg=PA115 115]}}: "[[Paul Nitze]] recalled in his memoirs that he believed in July 1945 that Japan would surrender [in a matter of months] 'even without the atomic bomb.'&amp;nbsp;... It was natural for Nitze to begin his analysis with a hypothesis concerning the effects of the atomic bombs on ending the war with Japan. Yet Nitze remained committed to that notion even when the evidence—the interrogations of Japanese officials—did not reasonably support his conclusions. And Nitze's bold statement that his conclusions on why Japan surrendered were based on 'all the facts', after a mere three months of evidence gathering, stretches the limits of believability."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] wrote in his memoir ''The White House Years'':

{{Quote|In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenhower|1963|pp=312–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Other U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]],&lt;ref&gt;Manchester, William. ''[[American Caesar|American Caesar: Douglas MacArthur 1880–1964]]'', Dell, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Cousins writes, "When I asked General MacArthur about the decision to drop the bomb, I was surprised to learn he had not even been consulted. What, I asked, would his advice have been? He replied that he saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor."

Historian [[Tsuyoshi Hasegawa]] wrote the atomic bombings themselves were not the principal reason for Japan's capitulation.&lt;ref name = "Hasegawa 2005 298"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hasegawa|2005|p=298}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he contends, it was the Soviet entry in the war on 8 August, allowed by the [[Potsdam Declaration]] signed by the other Allies. The fact the Soviet Union did not sign this declaration gave Japan reason to believe the Soviets could be kept out of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hasegawa|2005|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 25 July, the day before the declaration was issued, Japan had asked for a diplomatic envoy led by Konoe to come to Moscow hoping to mediate peace in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hasegawa|2005|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Konoe was supposed to bring a letter from the Emperor stating:

{{Quote|His Majesty the Emperor, mindful of the fact that the present war daily brings greater evil and sacrifice of the peoples of all the belligerent powers, desires from his heart that it may be quickly terminated. But as long as England and the United States insist upon unconditional surrender the Japanese Empire has no alternative to fight on with all its strength for the honour and existence of the Motherland&amp;nbsp;... It is the Emperor's private intention to send Prince Konoe to Moscow as a Special Envoy&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hasegawa|2005|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hasegawa's view is, when the Soviet Union declared war on 8 August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/PTO/Dip/USSR-Jap-DoW.html|title=HyperWar: USSR Decl War Japan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it crushed all hope in Japan's leading circles that the Soviets could be kept out of the war and also that reinforcements from Asia to the Japanese islands would be possible for the expected invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hasegawa|2005|loc=chapter 6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hasegawa wrote:

{{Quote|On the basis of available evidence, however, it is clear that the two atomic bombs&amp;nbsp;... alone were not decisive in inducing Japan to surrender. Despite their destructive power, the atomic bombs were not sufficient to change the direction of Japanese diplomacy. The Soviet invasion was. Without the Soviet entry in the war, the Japanese would have continued to fight until numerous atomic bombs, a successful allied invasion of the home islands, or continued aerial bombardments, combined with a naval blockade, rendered them incapable of doing so.&lt;ref name = "Hasegawa 2005 298"/&gt; }}

[[Ward Wilson (nuclear policy analyst)|Ward Wilson]] wrote that "after Nagasaki was bombed only four major cities remained which could readily have been hit with atomic weapons", and that the Japanese Supreme Council did not bother to convene after the atomic bombings because they were barely more destructive than previous bombings. He wrote that instead, the Soviet declaration of war and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] and [[Sakhalin#Second World War|South Sakhalin]] removed Japan's last diplomatic and military options for negotiating a ''conditional'' surrender, and this is what prompted Japan's surrender. He wrote that attributing Japan's surrender to a "miracle weapon", instead of the start of the Soviet invasion, saved face for Japan and enhanced the United States' world standing.&lt;ref name="The Bomb Didn't Beat Japan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Ward|title=The Bomb Didn't Beat Japan&amp;nbsp;...

Early critics of the bombings were [[Albert Einstein]], [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[Leó Szilárd]], who had together spurred the first bomb research in 1939 with a [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|jointly written letter]] to President Roosevelt.

Szilárd, who had gone on to play a major role in the [[Manhattan Project]], argued:

[[File:Cenotaph Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|right|The [[cenotaph]] at the [[Hiroshima Peace Park]] is inscribed with the sentence: "''Let all the souls here rest in peace; this mistake shall not be repeated''." Although the sentence may seem ambiguous, it has been clarified that its intended [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] is all of humanity, and the mistake referred to is war in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/shimin/heiwa/q7e.html|title=Q&amp;A about the Atomic Bombing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A number of scientists who worked on the bomb were against its use. Led by Dr. [[James Franck]], seven scientists submitted a report to the Interim Committee (which advised the President) in May 1945, saying:
{{quote|If the United States were to be the first to release this new means of indiscriminate destruction upon mankind, she would sacrifice public support throughout the world, precipitate the race for armaments, and prejudice the possibility of reaching an international agreement on the future control of such weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toland|2003|p=762}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Mark Selden]] writes, "Perhaps the most trenchant contemporary critique of the American moral position on the bomb and the scales of justice in the war was voiced by the Indian jurist [[Radhabinod Pal]], a dissenting voice at the [[Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal]], who balked at accepting the uniqueness of Japanese war crimes. Recalling [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s account of his duty to bring [[World War I]] to a swift end—"everything must be put to fire and sword; men, women and children and old men must be slaughtered and not a tree or house be left standing." Pal observed:

{{Quote|This policy of indiscriminate murder to shorten the war was considered to be a crime. In the Pacific war under our consideration, if there was anything approaching what is indicated in the above letter of the German Emperor, it is the decision coming from the Allied powers to use the bomb. Future generations will judge this dire decision&amp;nbsp;... If any indiscriminate destruction of civilian life and property is still illegal in warfare, then, in the Pacific War, this decision to use the atom bomb is the only near approach to the directives of the German Emperor during the first World War and of the Nazi leaders during the second World War.}}

Selden mentions another critique of the nuclear bombing, which he says the U.S. government effectively suppressed for twenty-five years, as worth mention. On 11 August 1945, the Japanese government filed an official protest over the atomic bombing to the U.S. State Department through the Swiss Legation in Tokyo, observing:

{{Quote|Combatant and noncombatant men and women, old and young, are massacred without discrimination by the atmospheric pressure of the explosion, as well as by the radiating heat which result therefrom. Consequently there is involved a bomb having the most cruel effects humanity has ever known&amp;nbsp;... The bombs in question, used by the Americans, by their cruelty and by their terrorizing effects, surpass by far gas or any other arm, the use of which is prohibited. Japanese protests against U.S. desecration of international principles of war paired the use of the atomic bomb with the earlier firebombing, which massacred old people, women and children, destroying and burning down Shinto and Buddhist temples, schools, hospitals, living quarters, etc&amp;nbsp;... They now use this new bomb, having an uncontrollable and cruel effect much greater than any other arms or projectiles ever used to date. This constitutes a new crime against humanity and civilization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Selden|Selden|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Selden concludes, despite the war crimes committed by the Empire of Japan, nevertheless, "the Japanese protest correctly pointed to U.S. violations of internationally accepted principles of war with respect to the wholesale destruction of populations".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1963, the bombings were the subject of a [[judicial review]] in ''[[Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpicrc.org/ihl-nat.nsf/46707c419d6bdfa24125673e00508145/aa559087dbcf1af5c1256a1c0029f14d?OpenDocument Shimoda et al. v.

In the opinion of the court, the act of dropping an atomic bomb on cities was at the time governed by international law found in [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare of 1907]] and the Hague Draft Rules of Air Warfare of 1922–1923&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyle|2002|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was therefore illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''op. cit.'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please see talk page for details.

In the documentary ''[[The Fog of War]]'', former U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert S. McNamara]] recalls General [[Curtis LeMay]], who relayed the Presidential order to drop nuclear bombs on Japan,&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/obituaries/gen-curtis-lemay-an-architect-of-strategic-air-power-dies-at-83.html |title=NY Times: Gen.

{{Quote|"If we'd lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals." And I think he's right. He, and I'd say I, were behaving as war criminals.

The main difference was that they were sent to jail or hanged as war criminals, while I went free.' It can seem outrageous to equate Allied officers with perpetrators of the anti-Jewish genocide, but the obligation to maintain a moral standard in war is universal, even if the Nazi violation of that standard was unique in its barbarity."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the first combat use of nuclear weapons, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki represent to some the crossing of a crucial barrier. [[Peter Kuznick]], director of the [[American University Nuclear Studies Institute|Nuclear Studies Institute]] at [[American University]], wrote of President Truman: "He knew he was beginning the process of annihilation of the species."&lt;ref name="New Scientist"&gt;

[[Takashi Hiraoka]], mayor of Hiroshima, upholding [[nuclear disarmament]], said in a hearing to [[The Hague]] [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ): "It is clear that the use of nuclear weapons, which cause indiscriminate mass murder that leaves [effects on] survivors for decades, is a violation of international law".&lt;ref name="Hearing"&gt;[http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/Lawlibrary/cijwww/icjwww/icases/ianw/iANW_cr/iANW_iCR9527_19951107.PDF November 1995 Public Sitting, in the Case of Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflicts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040711070015/http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/lawlibrary/cijwww/icjwww/Icases/ianw/iANW_cr/iANW_iCR9527_19951107.PDF |date=2004-07-11 }} at La Hague [[International Court of Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.csi.ad.jp/ABOMB/mayor.html 1995 Peace Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813225030/http://www.csi.ad.jp/ABOMB/mayor.html |date=2007-08-13 }}, by Takashi Hiraoka, Mayor of Hiroshima&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iccho Itoh]], the mayor of Nagasaki, declared in the same hearing:
{{quote|It is said that the descendants of the atomic bomb survivors will have to be monitored for several generations to clarify the genetic impact, which means that the descendants will live in anxiety for [decades] to come&amp;nbsp;... with their colossal power and capacity for slaughter and destruction, nuclear weapons make no distinction between combatants and non-combatants or between military installations and civilian communities&amp;nbsp;... The use of nuclear weapons&amp;nbsp;... therefore is a manifest infraction of international law.&lt;ref name="Hearing"/&gt;}}

Although bombings do not meet the definition of [[genocide]], some consider the definition too strict, and argue the bombings do constitute genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frey|2004}}.&lt;br&gt;Reviewed by {{Harvnb|Rice|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dower|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[University of Chicago]] historian [[Bruce Cumings]] states there is a consensus among historians to [[Martin Sherwin]]'s statement, "[T]he Nagasaki bomb was gratuitous at best and genocidal at worst".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cumings|1999|p=54}}; {{Harvnb|Sherwin|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar [[R. J. Rummel]] instead extends the definition of genocide to what he calls [[democide]], and includes the major part of deaths from the atom bombings in these. His definition of democide includes not only genocide, but also an excessive killing of civilians in war, to the extent this is against the agreed rules for warfare; he argues the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes, and thus democide.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Rummel quotes among others an official protest from the US government in 1938 to Japan, for its bombing of Chinese cities: "The bombing of non-combatant populations violated international and humanitarian laws." He also considers excess deaths of civilians in [[conflagration]]s caused by conventional means, such as in Tokyo, as acts of democide.&lt;!--Then perhaps he'd like to explain why the U.S. doing it in Germany wasn't "democide" or a war crime&amp;nbsp;...? And why nobody on the Allied side was ever charged?--&gt;

In 1967, [[Noam Chomsky]] described the atomic bombings as "among the most unspeakable crimes in history". Chomsky pointed to the complicity of the American people in the bombings, referring to the bitter experiences they had undergone prior to the event as the cause for their acceptance of its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|1967a}}; {{Harvnb|Chomsky|1967b}}: "And, quite properly, he turns the question back to us: To what extent are the British or American people responsible for the vicious terror bombings of civilians, perfected as a technique of warfare by the Western democracies and reaching their culmination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, surely among the most unspeakable crimes in history. To an undergraduate in 1945–46—to anyone whose political and moral consciousness had been formed by the horrors of the 1930s, by the war in Ethiopia, the Russian purge, the 'China Incident', the Spanish Civil War, the Nazi atrocities, the Western reaction to these events and, in part, complicity in them—these questions had particular significance and poignancy.{{' "}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a group of intellectuals in Hiroshima established an unofficial body called International Peoples' Tribunal on the Dropping of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On 16 July 2007, it delivered its verdict, stating:
{{quote|The Tribunal finds that the nature of damage caused by the atomic bombs can be described as indiscriminate extermination of all life forms or inflicting unnecessary pain to the survivors.}}
About the legality and the morality of the action, the unofficial tribunal found:
{{quote|The&amp;nbsp;... use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was illegal in the light of the principles and rules of International Humanitarian Law applicable in armed conflicts, since the bombing of both cities, made civilians the object of attack, using nuclear weapons that were incapable of distinguishing between civilians and military targets and consequently, caused unnecessary suffering to the civilian survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.k3.dion.ne.jp/~a-bomb/Judgment-07-7-16.pdf |title=Judgement of the International Peoples' Tribunal on the Dropping of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki |access-date=2010-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050733/http://www.k3.dion.ne.jp/~a-bomb/Judgment-07-7-16.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===State terrorism===
Historical accounts indicate the decision to use the atomic bombs was made in order to provoke a surrender of Japan by use of an awe-inspiring power. These observations have caused [[Michael Walzer]] to state the incident was an act of "war terrorism: the effort to kill civilians in such large numbers that their government is forced to surrender. Hiroshima seems to me the classic case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This type of claim eventually prompted historian Robert P. Newman, a supporter of the bombings, to say "there ''can'' be justified terror, as there can be just wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|2004|pp=xiv–xv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain scholars and [[historians]] have characterized the atomic bombings of Japan as a form of "state terrorism". This interpretation is based on a [[definition of terrorism]] as "the targeting of innocents to achieve a political goal". As [[Frances V. Harbour]] points out, the meeting of the Target Committee in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]] on 10 and 11 May 1945 suggested targeting the large population centers of [[Kyoto]] or [[Hiroshima]] for a "psychological effect" and to make "the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of [[Nuclear weapon|the weapon]] to be internationally recognized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size and with possible focusing from nearby mountains that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed. The Emperor's palace in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic value.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harbour&gt;{{Harvnb|Harbour|1999|pp=133ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Professor Harbour suggests the goal was to create terror for political ends both in and beyond Japan.&lt;ref name=Harbour/&gt; However, [[Burleigh Taylor Wilkins]] believes it stretches the meaning of "[[terrorism]]" to include [[War|wartime acts]].&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilkins|1992|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote that the bombings were terrorism.&lt;ref name="ZinnBreakingSilence"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Personal/zinn.html |title=Hiroshima; Breaking the Silence |accessdate=2008-01-30 |author=Howard Zinn |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071201172331/http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Personal/zinn.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn cites the sociologist [[Kai Erikson]] who said that the bombings could not be called "combat" because they targeted civilians.&lt;ref name="ZinnBreakingSilence" /&gt; [[Just War]] theorist [[Michael Walzer]] said that while taking the lives of civilians can be justified under conditions of 'supreme emergency', the war situation at that time did not constitute such an emergency.&lt;ref name=justice&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice Beyond Borders: A Global Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KhuyAtfeecIC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=walzer+hiroshima+emergency&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=walzer%20hiroshima%20emergency&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=197|year=2006|author=Simon Caney|isbn=9780199297962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Coady]], [[Frances V. Harbour]], and [[Jamal Nassar]] also view the targeting of civilians during the bombings as a form of terrorism. Nassar classifies the atomic bombings as terrorism in the same vein as the [[Bombing of Tokyo|firebombing of Tokyo]], the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], and [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=jamal&gt;{{Harvnb|Nassar|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KVgUGDJGGl4C&amp;pg=PA30 30]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Steven Poole]] said that the "people killed by terrorism" are not the targets of the intended terror effect. He said that the atomic bombings were "designed as an awful demonstration" aimed at Stalin and the government of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;2006 Poole, Steven 'Unspeak', Little Brown, London. {{ISBN|0 316 73100 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Werth]], historian and [[BBC]] Eastern Front war correspondent, suggests that the nuclear bombing of Japan mainly served to demonstrate the new weapon in the most shocking way, virtually at the Soviet Union's doorstep, in order to prepare the political [[post-war]] field.&lt;ref&gt;Russia At War, 1941–1945. London: Barrie &amp; Rockliff, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cuthbert Thicknesse]], the [[Dean of St Albans]], prohibited using [[St Albans Abbey]] for a thanksgiving service for the war's end, calling the use of atomic weapons "an act of wholesale, indiscriminate massacre".&lt;ref name="guardian19450815"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/century/1940-1949/Story/0,,127725,00.html | title=No abbey service | work=The Guardian | date=1945-08-15 | accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, a report by the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] entitled ''Atomic Warfare and the Christian Faith'', includes the following passage:

{{Quote|As American Christians, we are deeply penitent for the irresponsible use already made of the atomic bomb. We are agreed that, whatever be one's judgment of the war in principle, the surprise bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are morally indefensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marty|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iiocy75lR6cC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22deeply+penitent%22 117]}}; {{Harvnb|Cox|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WWW9FyNl3t8C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22deeply+penitent%22 26–7]}}.&lt;br&gt;Some American educationalists have argued that their country's failure to accept the profound immorality of the attacks and to understand the suffering they caused has led to "insane scenarios" of celebrating the bombs' use. See, for example, {{Harvnb|Kazemek|1994|p=531}}: "Martin Luther King, Jr., contended that 'it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends.'&amp;nbsp;... [D]uring Desert Storm, many Americans saw nothing wrong with using tactical nuclear weapons if necessary. And in a frighteningly insane scenario that might have come straight from Kurt Vonnegut, the crew of the ''Enola Gay'' has made a national tour of shopping malls – signing autographs and selling ''Enola Gay'' coffee mugs, photographs, videos, and copies of the order authorizing the use of the atomic bomb. We can only shake our heads in wonder."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The bombers' chaplain, Father [[George Benedict Zabelka]], would later renounce the bombings after visiting Nagasaki with two fellow chaplains.

====Continuation of previous behavior====
{{Main|Air raids on Japan}}

American historian [[Gabriel Kolko]] said certain discussion regarding the moral dimension of the attacks is wrong-headed, given the fundamental moral decision had already been made:

{{Quote|During November 1944 American B-29s began their first incendiary bomb raids on Tokyo, and on 9 March 1945, wave upon wave dropped masses of small incendiaries containing an early version of [[napalm]] on the city's population—for they directed this assault against civilians. Soon small fires spread, connected, grew into a vast firestorm that sucked the oxygen out of the lower atmosphere. The bomb raid was a 'success' for the Americans; they killed 125,000 Japanese in one attack. The Allies bombed Hamburg and [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]] in the same manner, and Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, and Tokyo again on May 24. The basic moral decision that the Americans had to make during the war was whether or not they would violate international law by indiscriminately attacking and destroying civilians, and they resolved that dilemma within the context of conventional weapons. Neither fanfare nor hesitation accompanied their choice, and in fact the atomic bomb used against Hiroshima was less lethal than massive fire bombing. The war had so brutalized the American leaders that burning vast numbers of civilians no longer posed a real predicament by the spring of 1945. Given the anticipated power of the atomic bomb, which was far less than that of fire bombing, no one expected small quantities of it to end the war. Only its technique was novel—nothing more. By June 1945 the mass destruction of civilians via strategic bombing did impress [[Henry L. Stimson|Stimson]] as something of a moral problem, but the thought no sooner arose than he forgot it, and in no appreciable manner did it shape American use of conventional or atomic bombs. "I did not want to have the United States get the reputation of outdoing Hitler in atrocities", he noted telling the [[Harry S. Truman|President]] on {{Nowrap|June 6}}. There was another difficulty posed by mass conventional bombing, and that was its very success, a success that made the two modes of human destruction qualitatively identical in fact and in the minds of the American military. "I was a little fearful", Stimson told Truman, "that before we could get ready the Air Force might have Japan so thoroughly bombed out that the new weapon would not have a fair background to show its strength." To this the President "laughed and said he understood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1990|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Japanese nuclear weapon program===
{{Main|Japanese nuclear weapon program}}

During the war, and 1945 in particular, due to state secrecy, very little was known outside Japan about the slow progress of the [[Japanese nuclear weapon program]]. The US knew that Japan had requested materials from their German allies, and {{convert|560|kg|abbr=on}} of unprocessed [[uranium oxide]] was dispatched to Japan in April 1945 aboard the submarine [[German submarine U-234|''U-234'']], which however surrendered to US forces in the Atlantic following Germany's surrender. The uranium oxide was reportedly labeled as "U-235", which may have been a mislabeling of the submarine's name; its exact characteristics remain unknown.

If post-war analysis had found that Japanese nuclear weapons development was near completion, this discovery might have served in a [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] sense to justify the atomic attack on Japan. However, it is known that the poorly coordinated Japanese project was considerably behind the US developments in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maga | first = Timothy P. | title = Judgment at Tokyo: the Japanese War Crimes Trials | publisher = University Press of Kentucky| year = 2001 | location = | nopp = | pages = 51–52 | url = | isbn = 978-0-8131-2177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Snell | first = David | title = Japan Developed Atom Bomb; Russia Grabbed Scientists | newspaper = [[Atlanta Constitution]] | pages = | date = 3 October 1946 | url =http://www.reformation.org/atlanta-constitution.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dees2021&gt;Dees, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; and also behind the unsuccessful [[German nuclear energy project]] of WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Home | first = R.W. | author-link = | last2 = Low | first2 = Morris F. | author2-link = | title = Postwar Scientific Intelligence Missions to Japan | journal = Isis | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 527–37 | date = September 1993 | url = | doi = 10.1086/356550| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Grunden | first = Walter E. | title = Hungnam and the Japanese Atomic Bomb: Recent Historiography of a Postwar Myth | journal = Intelligence and National Security | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 32–60 | year = 1998 | url = | doi = 10.1080/02684529808432475| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in 1986 of the fringe hypothesis that Japan had ''already'' created a nuclear weapon, by [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] employee Roger M. Anders, appeared in the journal ''Military Affairs'':

{{Quote|Journalist Wilcox's book describes the Japanese wartime atomic energy projects. This is laudable, in that it illuminates a little-known episode; nevertheless, the work is marred by Wilcox's seeming eagerness to show that Japan created an atomic bomb. Tales of Japanese atomic explosions, one a fictional attack on Los Angeles, the other an unsubstantiated account of a post-Hiroshima test, begin the book. (Wilcox accepts the test story because the author [Snell], "was a distinguished journalist"). The tales, combined with Wilcox's failure to discuss the difficulty of translating scientific theory into a workable bomb, obscure the actual story of the Japanese effort: uncoordinated laboratory-scale projects which took paths least likely to produce a bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anders|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Nagasaki bombing unnecessary===
[[File:Nagasaki Ground Zero C2117.jpg|thumbnail|The black marker indicates "ground zero" of the Nagasaki atomic bomb explosion.]]

The second atomic bombing, on Nagasaki, came only three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, when the devastation at Hiroshima had yet to be fully comprehended by the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Okamoto"&gt;{{cite web

{{Quote|Some historians have argued that while the first bomb might have been required to achieve Japanese surrender, dropping the second constituted a needless barbarism. However, the record shows otherwise. American officials believed more than one bomb would be necessary because they assumed Japanese hard-liners would minimize the first explosion or attempt to explain it away as some sort of natural catastrophe, which is precisely what they did. In the three days between the bombings, the Japanese minister of war, for instance, refused even to admit that the Hiroshima bomb was atomic. A few hours after Nagasaki, he told the cabinet that "the Americans appeared to have one hundred atomic bombs&amp;nbsp;... they could drop three per day. The next target might well be Tokyo."&lt;ref name="Maddox"/&gt; }}

Jerome Hagen indicates that War Minister Anami's revised briefing was partly based on interrogating captured American pilot Marcus McDilda. Under torture, McDilda reported that the Americans had 100 atomic bombs, and that Tokyo and Kyoto would be the next atomic bomb targets. Both were lies; McDilda was not involved or briefed on the Manhattan Project and simply told the Japanese what he thought they wanted to hear.&lt;ref name=Hagen&gt;Jerome T. Hagen. ''War in the Pacific: America at War, Volume I.'' Hawaii Pacific University, {{ISBN|0-9762669-0-3}}. Chapter, "The Lie of Marcus McDilda", 159–62&lt;/ref&gt;

One day before the bombing of Nagasaki, the Emperor notified Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō of his desire to "insure a prompt ending of hostilities". Tōgō wrote in his memoir that the Emperor "warned [him] that since we could no longer continue the struggle, now that a weapon of this devastating power was used against us, we should not let slip the opportunity [to end the war] by engaging in attempts to gain more favorable conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Tōgō, Shigenori: The Cause of Japan, page 315. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor then requested Tōgō to communicate his wishes to the Prime Minister.

===Dehumanization===
Historian James J. Weingartner sees a connection between the [[American mutilation of Japanese war dead]] and the bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weingartner|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. "[T]he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands."&lt;ref name=Weingartner67&gt;{{Harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: "The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true".&lt;ref name=Weingartner54&gt;{{Harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
{{See also|Aerial bombardment and international law}}

At the time of the atomic bombings, there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft.&lt;ref name="ICRC"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Law of Air Warfare |journal=International Review of the Red Cross |number=323 |pages=347–63 |date=June 30, 1998 |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jpcl.htm |accessdate=June 21, 2013 |author=Javier Guisández Gómez |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425044944/http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jpcl.htm |archivedate=April 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics of the atomic bombings point to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] as setting rules in place regarding the attack of civilian populations. The Hague Conventions contained no specific [[air warfare]] provisions but it prohibited the targeting of undefended civilians by [[naval artillery]], [[field artillery]], or [[Siege engine#Modern siege engines|siege engines]], all of which were classified as "[[bombardment]]". However, the Conventions allowed the targeting of military establishments in cities, including military depots, industrial plants, and workshops which could be used for war.&lt;ref name=Protocol&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVdYaSUDKysC&amp;pg=PA67 |page=67 |title=The Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions for the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: Repercussions on the Law of Naval Warfare |journal=Veröffentlichungen Des Instituts für Internationales Recht an der Universität Kiel |volume=90 |author=Elmar Rauch |location=Berlin |year=1984 |isbn=978-3-428-05703-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of rules was not followed during [[World War I]] which saw bombs dropped indiscriminately on cities by [[Zeppelin]]s and multi-engine bombers. Afterward, another series of meetings were held at The Hague in 1922–23, but no binding agreement was reached regarding air warfare. During the 1930s and 1940s, the [[aerial bombing of cities]] was resumed, notably by the German [[Condor Legion]] against the cities of [[Bombing of Guernica|Guernica]] and [[Bombing of Durango|Durango]] in Spain in 1937 during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. This led to an escalation of various cities bombed, including [[Bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing]], [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|Warsaw]], [[Rotterdam Blitz|Rotterdam]], [[The Blitz|London]], [[Coventry Blitz|Coventry]], [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Hamburg]], [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]], and [[Bombing of Tokyo|Tokyo]]. All of the major belligerents in [[World War II]] dropped bombs on civilians in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Haf2g1mbsH8C&amp;pg=PA121 121–25]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern debate over the applicability of the Hague Conventions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki revolves around whether the Conventions can be assumed to cover modes of warfare that were at the time unknown; whether rules for artillery bombardment can be applied to rules for aerial bombing. As well, the debate hinges on to what degree the Hague Conventions was being followed by the warring countries.

If the Hague Conventions is admitted as applicable, the critical question becomes whether the bombed cities met the definition of "undefended". Some observers consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki undefended, some say that both cities were legitimate military targets, and others say that Hiroshima could be considered a legitimate military target while Nagasaki was comparatively undefended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9R9BQPKKfQC&amp;pg=PA167 |page=167 |chapter=Acting Out Against Terrorism, Torture and Other Crimes |author=Christopher L.

Cherif Bassiouni |publisher=BRILL |year=2008 |isbn=9789004166318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiroshima has been argued as not a legitimate target because the major industrial plants were just outside the target area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Axinn|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gYmPp6lZqtMC&amp;pg=PA277 277]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued as a legitimate target because Hiroshima was the headquarters of the regional [[Second General Army (Japan)|Second General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]] with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. Both cities were protected by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]], which is an argument against the definition of "undefended".

The Hague Conventions prohibited poison weapons. The radioactivity of the atomic bombings has been described as poisonous, especially in the form of [[nuclear fallout]] which kills more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Newman 2011, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bomb: A Life |last=Degroot |first=Gerard |page=95 |publisher=Random House |year=2011 |isbn=9781446449615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTOzgJbf9KkC&amp;pg=PA95 |pages=95–98 |title=The Nuclear Taboo: The United States and the Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons |last=Tannenwald |first=Nina |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=9781139467469}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view was rejected by the [[International Court of Justice]] in 1996, which stated that the primary and exclusive use of ([[air burst]]) nuclear weapons is not to poison or asphyxiate and thus is not prohibited by the [[Geneva Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYqtmngpglIC&amp;pg=PA24 |title=The legality of Threat Or Use of Nuclear Weapons: A Guide to the Historic Opinion of the International Court of Justice |author=John Burroughs |year=1997 |pages=24–25 |publisher=Lit Verlag |isbn=978-3-8258-3516-3 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3pF4APqcjFIC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=International+Court+of+Justice+Hiroshima+poison+weapons#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Court%20of%20Justice%20Hiroshima%20poison%20weapons&amp;f=false |title=Nuclear Disarmament in International Law |author=Haralambos Athanasopulos |year=2000 |pages=163–64 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |isbn=978-0-7864-0587-9 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnfl.htm |title=The Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Conventions also prohibited the employment of "arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering". The Japanese government cited this prohibition on 10 August 1945 after submitting a letter of protest to the United States denouncing the use of atomic bombs.&lt;ref name="PRO"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bdHGklbI6AAC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=The+Japanese+government+August+10+employ+arms+atomic+bombings+international+law#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Japanese%20government%20August%2010%20employ%20arms%20atomic%20bombings%20international%20law&amp;f=false |title=The Human Dimension of International Law: Selected Papers of Antonio Cassese |author=Antonio Cassese |year=2008 |page=178 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-1992-3291-8 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prohibition only applied to weapons as lances with a barbed head, irregularly shaped bullets, projectiles filled with glass, the use of any substance on bullets that would tend unnecessarily to inflame a wound inflicted by them, along with [[Expanding bullet|grooving bullet tips]] or the creation of [[soft point bullet]]s by filing off the ends of the hard coating on [[Full metal jacket bullet|full metal jacketed bullets]].

It however did not apply to the use of explosives contained in artillery projectiles, mines, [[aerial torpedo]]es, or [[hand grenades]].&lt;ref&gt;Indian Study Group of International Affairs. "The Indian Year Book of International Affairs, Volume 7". 1958&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 and in 1963, the Japanese government retracted its previous statement by saying that there was no international law prohibiting the use of atomic bombs.&lt;ref name="PRO" /&gt;

The Hague Conventions stated that religious buildings, art and science centers, charities, hospitals, and historic monuments were to be spared as far as possible in a bombardment, unless they were being used for military purposes.&lt;ref name=Protocol/&gt; Critics of the atomic bombings point to many of these kinds of structures which were destroyed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xuz6GngdaVsC&amp;pg=RA1-PT271 |pages=270–71 |last=Bevan |first=Robert |title=The Destruction of Memory: Architecture at War |publisher=Reaktion Books |year=2007 |isbn=9781861896384}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Hague Conventions also stated that for the destruction of the enemy's property to be justified, it must be "imperatively demanded by the necessities of war".&lt;ref name="Sienho Yee"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gpqa9smhWqcC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=World+War+2+imperatively+demanded+by+the+necessities+of+war+Hague+Convention#v=onepage&amp;q=World%20War%202%20imperatively%20demanded%20by%20the%20necessities%20of%20war%20Hague%20Convention&amp;f=false |title=International Crime And Punishment: Selected Issues, Volume 2 |editor=Sienho Yee |year=2004|publisher=[[University Press of America]] |isbn=978-0-7618-2887-7 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}} Because of the inaccuracy of heavy bombers in World War II, it was not practical to target military assets in cities without damage to civilian targets.&lt;ref name="Sienho Yee"/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwNIbHQzVUUC&amp;pg=PA97 |title=Choices Under Fire: Moral Dimensions of World War II |author=Michael Bess |year=2008 |page=97 |publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |isbn=978-0-3072-7580-6 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GqYWmUae5h8C&amp;pg=PA301 |title=The Real History of World War II: A New Look at the Past |author=[[Alan Axelrod]] |year=2011 |page=301 |publisher=[[Sterling Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-4027-7999-2 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7jTHA7UvEAC&amp;pg=PA70 |title=The Second World War (2): Europe 1939–1943 |author=Robin Havers |year=2003 |page=70 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-4159-6846-1 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, no international treaty banning or condemning [[nuclear warfare]] has ever been ratified. The closest example is a resolution by the [[UN General Assembly]] which stated that nuclear warfare was not in keeping with the UN charter, passed in 1953 with a vote of 25 to 20, and 26 abstentions.&lt;ref name="ICRC"/&gt;

==Impact on surrender==
{{See also|Soviet–Japanese War#Importance and consequences}}

Varying opinions exist on the question of what role the bombings played in Japan's surrender: some regard the bombings as the deciding factor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=50}}: "[Hiroshima and Nagaski] brought about the Japanese surrender".&lt;/ref&gt; others see the bombs as a minor factor, and yet others assess their importance as unknowable.&lt;ref name=unknown&gt;"The Japanese leaders themselves do not know the answer to that question [whether Japan would have surrendered absent the atomic bombings], and if they cannot answer it, neither can I." {{Harvnb|Butow|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream position in the United States from 1945 through the 1960s regarded the bombings as the decisive factor in ending the war; commentators have termed this the "traditionalist" view, or pejoratively the "patriotic orthodoxy".&lt;ref name=Frank2005&gt;{{Cite journal |authorlink=Richard B.

Robert Pape also argues that:

{{Quote|Military vulnerability, not civilian vulnerability, accounts for Japan's decision to surrender. Japan's military position was so poor that its leaders would likely have surrendered before invasion, and at roughly the same time in August 1945, even if the United States had not employed strategic bombing or the atomic bomb. Rather than concern for the costs and risks to the population, or even Japan's overall military weakness vis-a-vis the United States, the decisive factor was Japanese leaders' recognition that their strategy for holding the most important territory at issue—the home islands—could not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pape|1993|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In Japanese writing about the surrender, many accounts consider the Soviet entry into the war as the primary reason or as having equal importance with the atomic bombs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~diplo/roundtables/PDF/Alperovitz-HasegawaRoundtable.pdf Review of ''Racing the Enemy''] by [[Gar Alperovitz]] in [http://www.h-net.org/~diplo/roundtables/#7.2 H-Diplo Roundtable Volume VII, No. 2], 2006, p. 2, footnote 1, citing research by Ayako Doi and Kimi Yoshida (bottom of page 7).&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as the work of Sadao Asada, give primacy to the atomic bombings, particularly their impact on the emperor.&lt;ref name=asada&gt;[http://www.hnn.us/roundup/entries/28318.html Tsuyoshi Hasegawa vs. Sadao Asada: Debating Hiroshima], in the History News Network&lt;/ref&gt; The primacy of the Soviet entry as a reason for surrender is a long-standing view among some Japanese historians, and has appeared in some Japanese junior high school textbooks.&lt;ref name=asada/&gt; Notably however, the Soviet Navy was well regarded as [[Project Hula#Soviets still lack naval capability to invade Japan|chronically lacking the naval capability to invade the home islands of Japan]], despite having received numerous [[Project Hula|ships under loan from the US]].

The argument about the Soviet role in Japan's surrender has a connection with the argument about the Soviet role in America's decision to drop the bomb:&lt;ref name=hasegawa2005/&gt; both arguments emphasize the importance of the Soviet Union. The former suggests that Japan surrendered to the US out of fear of the Soviet Union, and the latter emphasizes that the US dropped the bombs to intimidate the Soviet Union. Soviet accounts of the ending of the war emphasised the role of the Soviet Union. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' summarised events thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In August 1945 American military air forces dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima (6 August) and of Nagasaki (9 August). These bombings were not caused by military necessity, and served primarily political aims. They inflicted enormous damage on the peaceable population.

Fulfilling the obligations entered into by agreement with its allies and aiming for a very speedy ending of the second world war, the Soviet government on 8 August 1945 declared that from 9 August 1945 the USSR would be in a state of war against J[apan], and associated itself with the 1945 Potsdam declaration&amp;nbsp;... of the governments of the USA, Great Britain and China of 26 July 1945, which demanded the unconditional capitulation of J[apan] and foreshadowed the bases of its subsequent demilitarization and democratization. The attack by Soviet forces, smashing the Kwantung Army and liberating Manchuria, Northern Korea, Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, led to the rapid conclusion of the war in the Far East. On 2 September 1945 J[apan] signed the act of unconditional capitulation.

Эти бомбардировки не вызывались военной необходимостью и преследовали прежде всего политические цели. Они повлекли огромные жертвы среди мирного населения. Выполняя обязательства, взятые на себя по соглашениям с союзниками, и стремясь к быстрейшему окончанию 2-й мировой войны, Советское правительство 8 августа 1945 объявило, что с 9 августа 1945 СССР будет находиться в состоянии войны с Я., и присоединилось к Потсдамской декларации 1945&amp;nbsp;... правительств США, Великобритании и Китая от 26 июля 1945, требовавшей безоговорочной капитуляции Я. и намечавшей основы её последующей демилитаризации и демократизации.

However contrary to the narrative presented by the Soviet Encyclopedia, Japan had already declared its surrender 3 days ''before'' the August 18th [[Invasion of the Kuril Islands|Soviet invasion of the Kuril Islands]], where Soviet forces received [[Invasion of the Kuril Islands|comparatively little]] military opposition due to the earlier declaration of surrender.

Still others have argued that war-weary Japan would likely have surrendered regardless, due to a collapse of the economy, lack of army, food, and industrial materials, threat of internal revolution, and talk of surrender since earlier in the year, while others find this unlikely, arguing that Japan may well have, or likely would have, put up a spirited resistance.&lt;ref name=Frank2005 /&gt;

The Japanese historian Sadao Asada argues that the ultimate decision to surrender was a personal decision by the emperor, influenced by the atomic bombings.&lt;ref name=asada/&gt;

==Atomic diplomacy==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
A further argument, discussed under the rubric of "atomic diplomacy" and advanced in a 1965 book of that name by [[Gar Alperovitz]], is that the bombings had as primary purpose to intimidate the Soviet Union, being the opening shots of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alperovitz|2004}}.&lt;br&gt;Alperovitz's thesis met with disagreement from across the spectrum, though subsequent research did confirm key parts of it. See {{Harvnb|Walker|1996|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ptgudYEFOM0C&amp;pg=PA13 13ff]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines some{{Who|date=December 2010}} argue that the United States raced the Soviet Union and hoped to drop the bombs and receive surrender from Japan before a Soviet entry into the Pacific War.
However, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom came to an agreement at the [[Yalta Conference]] on when the Soviet Union should join the war against Japan, and on how the territory of Japan was to be divided at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/yalta.asp|title=The Avalon Project : Yalta (Crimea) Conference|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that such considerations played little or no role, the United States being instead concerned with the surrender of Japan, and in fact that the United States desired and appreciated the Soviet entry into the Pacific War, as it hastened the surrender of Japan.&lt;ref name = "Kort 2006"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kort|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs Truman wrote: "There were many reasons for my going to Potsdam, but the most urgent, to my mind, was to get from Stalin a personal reaffirmation of Russia's entry into the war against Japan, a matter which our military chiefs were most anxious to clinch. This I was able to get from Stalin in the very first days of the conference."&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs by Harry S. Truman, Volume One: Year of Decisions, p. 411, [http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~theed/Cold_War/b_Stalin_era/c_Potsdam/readings/Truman_Ch_24_25_ocr.pd]&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell Craig and [[Fredrik Logevall]] argue the two bombs were dropped for different reasons:

{{Quote|Truman's disinclination to delay the second bombing brings the Soviet factor back into consideration. What the destruction of Nagasaki accomplished was Japan's immediate surrender, and for Truman this swift capitulation was crucial in order to preempt a Soviet military move into Asia.&amp;nbsp;... In short, the first bomb was dropped as soon as it was ready, and for the reason the administration expressed: to hasten the end of the Pacific War. But in the case of the second bomb, timing was everything. In an important sense, the destruction of Nagasaki—not the bombing itself but Truman's refusal to delay it—was America's first act of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|Logevall|2009|pp=55–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== US public opinion on the bombings ==
The Pew Research Center conducted a 2015 survey showing that 56% of Americans support the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki from WWII, while only 34% oppose the bombings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/04/70-years-after-hiroshima-opinions-have-shifted-on-use-of-atomic-bomb/|title=70 years after Hiroshima, opinions have shifted on use of atomic bomb|date=2015-08-04|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study highlighted the impact of the respondent’s generation, showing that 70% of Americans 65 and older support the bombings, while only 47% of 18- to 29-year-olds support the bombings. Younger generations of Americans are less supportive of the bombings, according to the Pew Research Center statistics. Political leanings also impacted responses according to the survey. 74% of Republicans support the bombings while 52% of Democrats support the bombings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American approval of the US dropping the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki has decreased steadily since 1945. A 1945 Gallup poll showed that 85% of Americans approved of using atomic weapons on Japanese cities, while only 10% disapproved.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/vault/191897/gallup-vault-americans-mindset-hiroshima.aspx|title=Gallup Vault: Americans' Mindset After Hiroshima|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty five years later in 1990, Gallup conducted another poll and recorded 53% of Americans approving the bombings with 41% disapproving the bombings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another 2005 Gallup poll echoes the findings of the 2015 Pew Research Center study by finding 57% of Americans approved the bombings while 38% disapproved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While the poll data from The Pew Research Center and Gallup show a stark drop in support for the bombings over the last half century, Stanford political scientists have conducted research supporting their hypothesis that US public support for the use of nuclear force would be just as high today as in 1945 if a similar yet contemporary real life scenario presented itself.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2017/08/08/americans-weigh-nuclear-war/|title=Americans weigh in on nuclear war {{!}} Stanford News|last=University|first=Stanford|date=2017-08-08|work=Stanford News|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 study conducted by political scientists Scott D. Sagan and Benjamin A. Valentino, it was found that 67% of Americans support the conventional strike with use of atomic force in a hypothetical situation that killed 100,000 Iranian civilians over the other hypothetical option of an invasion that would kill 20,000 American soldiers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagan|first=Scott D.|last2=Valentino|first2=Benjamin A.|date=2017-08-10|title=Revisiting Hiroshima in Iran: What Americans Really Think about Using Nuclear Weapons and Killing Noncombatants|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/667391|journal=International Security|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=41–79|issn=1531-4804}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a 2010 Pew survey showed that 64% of Americans approved of Barack Obama’s declaration of US abstinence of nuclear weapons against a nation that did not have them, showing that most Americans have a conflicted view on use of atomic force.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.people-press.org/2010/04/28/section-4-foreign-policy/|title=Section 4: Foreign Policy|date=2010-04-28|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doris Patty Rosenthal''' (July 10, 1889 – November 26, 1971) was an American painter, printmaker, designer, and educator, who made solitary explorations into remote areas of [[Mexico]] in search of indigenous peoples. Over several decades beginning in the 1930s, Rosenthal made hundreds of sketches in charcoal and pastel depicting the everyday life and domestic activities of Indian and mestizo peasant culture, which she later used to create large-scale studio paintings. [[LIFE magazine]] featured Rosenthal’s art and travels in Mexico in a five-page spread in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;"Doris Rosenthal: Schoolteacher Paints Lovable Pictures of Mexicans," Life (November 22, 1943): 64–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doris Rosenthal setting out on a sketching trip, Pátzcuaro, Mexico, 1943.jpg|thumb|right|Doris Rosenthal setting out on a sketching trip, Pátzcuaro, Mexico, 1943]]

The [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] awarded Rosenthal a fellowship in 1931 to do creative work in painting in Mexico, where she was to live for two years beginning in August 1931.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;“Doris Rosenthal,” Guggenheim: www.gf.org/fellows/12542-doris-rosenthal&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, she made yearly trips to the country residing in small villages during the summer months. The Guggenheim Foundation awarded her a second fellowship for further work in Mexico in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/doris-rosenthal/|title=John Simon Guggenheim Foundation -   Doris Rosenthal|author=|date=|website=www.GF.org|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Guggenheim Fund Makes 60 Awards,” ''New York Times'' (March 30, 1936):13.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenthal moved permanently to Mexico in 1957, and died in the city of [[Oaxaca]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;“Doris Rosenthal, an Art Teacher and Painter of Mexico, is Dead,” ''New York Times'' (November 28, 1971): 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Early life and career==
Rosenthal was born in [[Riverside, California]], in 1889 into a prosperous Jewish family and raised on a ranch. Her father, Emil Julius Rosenthal, had settled in Riverside in 1872 from Müelhasen, Thüringen, Prussian (Germany), and married Anna Jane Unruh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmaw.org/jews-pioneer-riverside/|title=The Early Pioneer Jews of Riverside, California - JMAW - Jewish Museum of the American West|author=|date=|website=www.JMAW.org|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenthal launched her career as an artist in Los Angeles in the 1910s, when progressive trends were emerging in southern California art.  Rosenthal was close to Helena Dunlap, the pioneer Los Angeles modernist and founder in 1916 of the Los Angeles Modern Art Society, one of the first modernist groups to form in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Anderson, ''California Progressives'', 1910-1930 (Newport Beach, California: Orange County Museum of Art, 1996), 10–11; and Sarah Vure,"A Passion to Create: Impressionism to Modernism in Southern California Art 1910-1930" in ''Circles of Influence: Impressionism to Modernism in Southern California Art, 1910-1930'' (Newport Beach, California: Orange County Museum of Art, 2000), 60–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenthal and Dunlap traveled to Taos, New Mexico, in 1917. There, they briefly resided and exhibited alongside the leading American painters [[George Bellows]], [[Robert Henri]] and others in the inaugural exhibition in Santa Fe’s new Fine Arts Museum.&lt;ref&gt;"El Palacio, Journal of the Museum of New Mexico", (Vol. IV, January 1917): 104; and "El Palacio" (Vol. IV November 1917): 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenthal exhibited in the [[California Art Club]] spring exhibitions at the Los Angeles Museum in 1917 and 1919, showing ''Indian Women of Taos'' in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaartclub.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions-1909-2000/|title=Past Exhibitions 1909-2000 – California Art Club|author=|date=|website=www.CaliforniaArtClub.org|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenthal went to New York to study at the [[Art Students League]] with Bellows and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] in 1917–1918, and attended classes in the studio of the broad-minded bohemian [[George Luks]].&lt;ref&gt;Oral history interview with Phil Dike, 1965 June 9, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, she worked as a commercial designer of silks in order to fund a trip to Europe.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Scheper, Jeanne, "Doris Rosenthal," Jewish Women's Archive. (Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009):  &lt;http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rosenthal-doris&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Rosenthal studied first at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] in Paris, and then went on a sketching trip to Berlin, Rome, and Munich, staying throughout 1921 and 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Wardle, ed. ''American Women Modernists: The Legacy of Robert Henri, 1910-1945'' (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Museum of Art, 2005), 187-188&lt;/ref&gt; Following her European tour, she married Charles “Jack” Charash, a press agent, theatrical manager, dramatist, and co-founder of the Anglo-Jewish Theatre, a unit of the [[WPA Federal Theatre Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/520|title=archives.nypl.org -- Jacob Charash papers|author=|date=|website=archives.NYPL.org|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s, Rosenthal published a series of portfolios featuring design motifs drawn from the art and artifacts of an international array of museum collections. The ''Prim-Art Series'' portfolios are arranged around themes such as transportation, costumes, and animal motifs. The series signaled her study of ethnographic or “primitive” art and culture and were instrumental in winning her two Guggenheim awards to work in Mexico. The portfolios helped introduce new aesthetics to design, and were acclaimed as useful resources for professional designers and as teaching tools for art instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rosenthal-doris|title=Doris Rosenthal - Jewish Women's Archive|author=|date=|website=JWA.org|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenthal was a lifelong art instructor and educator, having earned a degree in teaching from Los Angeles State Teachers College in 1910, and Teachers College of [[Columbia University]] in 1913.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She taught painting and drawing in Columbia University’s Teacher’s College from 1924 to 1931, and at [[James Monroe High School (New York City)|James Monroe High School]] in the Bronx thereafter.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Doris Rosenthal produced a large body of work over a six-decade career. Her Depression-era American Scene paintings focusing on Mexican life and culture were nationally respected and covered by major art publications and popular magazines such as ''LIFE'', ''Newsweek'', ''Harper’s Bazaar'', and the ''New Yorker''.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''South of the Border: Mexico in the American Imagination, 1914–47'' (Smithsonian Books, 1993), 99-105.&lt;/ref&gt; She had the support of the eminent critics and historians Edward Alden Jewel, [[Lewis Mumford]], and [[Carleton Beals]]; and the Midtown Galleries in New York handled her paintings and works on paper.&lt;ref&gt;Carleton Beals, “The Mexican Odyssey of An American Painter: Doris Rosenthal,” ex. cat. (New York: Midtown Galleries, n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; Her work was included in important exhibitions such as ''American Painting Today'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]

According to Mexican art critic Gulliermo Rivas: "Doris Rosenthal is not striving to escape her work, but rather to go out and meet it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rosenthal-doris|title=Doris Rosenthal {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=JWA.org|language=en|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the Eurovision Young Musicians took place in [[Manchester]], United Kingdom on 11 May 1982 and six countries took part.

The BBC Young Musician of the Year is a televised national music competition. Broadcast originally on [[BBC Two]] biennially, and then on [[BBC Four]] years later.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/youngmusician/history/|title=History.

The competition was established in 1978 by [[Humphrey Burton]] and Walter Todds, both of whom are former members of the BBC Television Music Department.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; [[Michael Hext]], a trombonist, was the inaugural winner. In 1994, the usage of percussion instruments was first permitted, alongside the existing keyboard, string, brass and woodwind categories.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The competition has five stages, which consist of regional auditions, category auditions, category finals, semi-finals and the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/youngmusician/entrydetails/stages.shtml|title=Stages of the Competition|accessdate=3 March 2008|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manchester Free Trade Hall (Radisson Edwardian Hotel).jpg|150 px|thumb|left|The façade of the Free Trade Hall]]
The Free Trade Hall in Peter Street, [[Manchester]], England, was the host venue for the first edition of the Eurovision Young Musicians.&lt;ref name=Show/&gt; The Italian [[Palazzo style architecture|palazzo-style]] hall was built on a [[trapeziform]] site in [[ashlar]] [[sandstone]]. It has a two-storey, nine-bay [[facade]] and concealed roof. On Peter Street, its ground floor [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] has rectangular [[pier]]s with round-headed arches and [[spandrel]]s bearing the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of Lancashire towns that took part in the [[Anti-Corn Law League|Anti-Corn Law movement]]. The upper floor has a [[colonnade]]d arcade, its [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] [[frieze]] is richly decorated with carved figures representing free trade, the arts, commerce, manufacture and the continents. Above the tympanum is a prominent cornice with [[balustrade]]d [[parapet]]. The upper floor has paired [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[column]]s to each bay and a tall window with a [[pediment]]ed [[architrave]] behind a [[balustrade]]d [[balcony]]. The return sides have three bays in a matching but simpler style of blank arches. The rear wall was rebuilt in 1950–51 with [[pilaster]]s surmounted by relief figures representing the entertainment which took place in the old hall. The Large Hall was in a classical style with a [[coffer]]ed ceiling, the walls had wood panelling in oak, walnut and sycamore.
[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] described it as "the noblest monument in the [[Cinquecento]] style in England", whilst Hartwell considered it "a classic which belongs in the canon of historic English architecture."{{sfnp|Hartwell|2001|p=93|ps=}}

'''Excite''' (stylized as '''excite''') is an [[web portal|internet portal]] launched in December 1995 that provides a variety of content including [[news]] and [[weather]], a [[metasearch engine]], a [[web-based email]], [[instant messaging]], [[Financial quote|stock quotes]], and a customizable user [[homepage]]. The content is collated from over 100 different sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Yoskovitz |date=14 March 1997 |title=The Best Way to Surf the Web: Niche Search Engines and Guides |url=http://www.webdevelopersjournal.com/columns/niche.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980117133537/http://webdevelopersjournal.com/columns/niche.html |archivedate=17 January 1998 |publisher=Web Developer's Journal |accessdate=3 April 2017}} Reprinted from ''Net Worth'' (February–March 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Excite's portal and services are owned by Excite Networks, but in the US, Excite is a personal portal, called '''My Excite''', which is operated by Mindspark and owned by [[IAC (company)|IAC Search and Media]].

In the 1990s, Excite was one of the most recognized brands on the [[Internet]], before its decline in the early 2000s.

Excite search formerly obtained results from several other popular [[search engines]], but now, like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]], it is powered by [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]].

== History ==

===Early years===
Excite was founded as ''Architext'' in 1994 by [[Graham Spencer (entrepreneur)|Graham Spencer]], [[Joe Kraus]], Mark VanHaren, Ryan McIntyre, Ben Lutch and Martin Reinfried, who were all students at [[Stanford University]]. In July 1994, [[International Data Group]] paid them US$80,000 to develop an online service. In January 1995, [[Vinod Khosla]] (a former Stanford student), a partner at the venture capital firm, [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], arranged a US$250,000 "first round" backing for the project, with US$1.5 million provided over a ten-month period. Soon thereafter, Geoff Yang, of [[Institutional Venture Partners]], introduced an additional US$1.5 million in financing and Excite was formally launched in December 1995. In January 1996, George Bell joined Excite as its [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO). Excite also purchased two search engines ([[Magellan (search engine)|Magellan]] and [[WebCrawler]]) and signed exclusive distribution agreements with [[Netscape]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Computer|Apple]], in addition to other companies. In 1994, Excite hired [[Jim Bellows]], then 72, to figure out how to present the content in a journalistic manner. He paid good journalists to write brief reviews of web sites. However, users wanted to get directly to the content and skipped the reviews, so the partnership with Bellows ended in 1998.

On April 4, 1996, Excite went public with an [[initial public offering|initial offering]] of two million shares. In June 1997, [[Intuit]], maker of [[Quicken]] and [[TurboTax]], purchased a 19% stake in Excite and finalized a seven-year partnership deal. On October 16, 1997, Excite purchased Netbot, a [[comparison shopping agent]].  At the same time Intuit announced the launch of ''Excite Business &amp; Investing''. Later that year a deal was finalized with [[Ticketmaster]] to provide direct online ticketing. On March 31, 1998, Excite reported a net loss of approximately $30.2 million and according to its first quarter report it had only enough available capital to meet obligations through December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sec.edgar-online.com/excite-inc/10-k-annual-report/1999/02/09/section22.aspx "EXCITE INC Annual Report (10-K) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"]. ''Excite.com (Ernst &amp; Young LLP)''. Securities and Exchange Commission. March 31, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, [[Yahoo!]] was in negotiations to purchase Excite for $5.5 billion to $6 billion. However, prompted by Kleiner Perkins, [[@Home Network]]'s Chairman and [[CEO]], Thomas Jermoluk met with Excite's chairman and CEO George Bell on December 19, and Excite was subsequently acquired by @Home Network, on January 19, 1999.

===Excite@Home===
{{Main|@Home Network}}
[[File:Excite@Home headquarters for sale.jpg|thumb|left|Excite@Home headquarters for sale. The buildings have since been re-purposed as a medical facility]]

The US$6.7 billion merger of Excite and [[@Home Network]] in 1999 became one of the largest mergers of two [[Internet]] companies at the time. @Home's high-speed Internet services and existing portal were combined with Excite's search engine and portal, with a move towards personalized web portal content following the merger.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The new company was named "Excite@Home" (the [[Ticker symbol|stock symbol]] and the company's name in regulatory filing records remained as "At Home Corporation" (ATHM)) and, six months after the merger, Tom Jermoluk stepped down as CEO of Excite@Home. Excite's George Bell, who was the President of the Excite division of @Home after the merger, became the new CEO of the combined Excite@Home, whilst Jermoluk remained [[Chairman]] of the Board.

Following the merger, the Excite division purchased iMall, as well as [[e-card|online greeting card]] company, Blue Mountain Arts. Excite also acquired [[photo sharing]] company [[Webshots]]. Excite furthermore paid for sponsorship of [[Infiniti]] [[IndyCar Series|Indy car]] driver [[Eddie Cheever, Jr.]], through the 2000 and 2001 racing seasons.  However, the merger between Excite and @Home fell disastrously short of expectations.  Online advertising revenue plummeted, while cable network ISP revenue continued to grow. On September 21, 2000, after stock value had dropped 90%, George Bell announced plans to step down as CEO within six months. On April 23, 2001, Excite@Home announced Patti S. Hart, the former CEO of Telocity, would become its third CEO in three years. In the same announcement, George Bell resigned and left the company completely. The company also reported first-quarter net loss of $61.6 million, compared with a loss of $4.6 million in the same period the prior year.

On June 11, 2001, Excite@Home announced that it had raised $100 million in financing from Promethean Capital Management and [[Angelo Gordon &amp; Co.]]  Part of the deal was that the loan was repayable immediately if Excite@Home stock was delisted by [[NASDAQ]].  The loan, structured as a note convertible into shares of Excite, had an interest rate of zero.  By August 20 of that year, Excite@Home had replaced its auditors [[Ernst &amp; Young]] with [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].  This triggered a demand from Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon &amp; Co for the immediate repayment of $50 million in debt. Furthermore, [[Cox Cable]] and [[Comcast]] announced that they would separate from Excite@Home by the first quarter of 2002.

On September 13, 2001, Excite@Home sold Blue Mountain Arts to [[American Greetings]] for less than 5% of what it had paid less than two years earlier. On October 1, 2001, Excite@Home filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District]] of [[California]]. The company's remaining 1,350 employees were [[layoff|laid off]] over the following months. As part of the agreement, @Home's national high-speed fiber network access would be sold back to [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]. @Home Liquidating Trust became the successor company to Excite@Home, charged with the sale of all assets of the former company.

At the end of 2001, the Webshots assets were purchased by the company's founders for $2.4 million in cash from the Bankruptcy Court.

===Excite Network===
During the collapse of Excite@Home, [[IWon|iWon.com]], an Irvington, New York–based venture, had surreptitiously commenced the design of a new Excite website; iWon.com planned to acquire the Excite.com [[domain name]] and brand in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. IWon.com eventually made a joint bid with Seattle's [[InfoSpace]] to purchase the domain name and brand. On November 28, 2001, the court accepted the bid and gave iWon less than three weeks to launch a new Excite portal. Bill Daugherty, iWon's founder and co-chief executive at the time, told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "I feel like a guy who lived through a hurricane, got pounded and pounded and managed to survive when everyone else was destroyed.  Suddenly you walk outside and because of the storm you have beachfront property. That's what Excite is to us."

On December 16, 2001, iWon launched the new Excite portal and transferred millions of Excite users to its new home.  iWon changed its corporate name to ''Excite Network'', and continued to operate Excite, iWon, and a third portal, MyWay.  Outside of the United States, Excite Italia took control of portals in [[UK]], Germany, Spain, France, Italy, [[Netherlands]],  [[Poland]], Switzerland, and Austria.  Infospace, for its part, owned and operated the web search function on Excite.  This proved to be a short-sighted arrangement as searching became big business on the Internet in the ensuing years.

===Acquisition by Ask Jeeves===
Excite continued to operate until the Excite Network was acquired by Ask Jeeves (now [[Ask.com]]) in March 2004.  Ask Jeeves promised to rejuvenate iWon and Excite, but did not. Ask Jeeves management became distracted, according to the ''East Bay Business Times'', first by a search feature arms race with [[Google]] and Yahoo!, and then by its merger with [[Barry Diller]]'s [[IAC/InterActiveCorp]], announced in March 2005.  "Hopefully, as we start to invest more and get the staff in place and some of the changes to the portal properties that we want, we hope to see (revenue) grow back in the latter half of the year," said Ask Jeeves CEO Steve Berkowitz during a conference call with analysts on April 27, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2005, Ask Jeeves made two announcements regarding the rejuvenation of the Excite brand. It first announced that it had acquired Excite Italia B.V. (the operator of Excite Europe), from [[Tiscali]], S.p.A.; and, secondly, the company reported that it had reached a comprehensive settlement with InfoSpace regarding Excite in the United States, whereby Ask Jeeves and InfoSpace would share marketing costs and revenue from the Excite web search function. Regarding the acquisition, Ask Jeeves CEO, Steve Berkowitz, said, "We look forward to working with InfoSpace to enhance the search experience on Excite, now that our interests are aligned." On October 17, 2007, [[GOADV]], a media company specializing in the generation of Internet "traffic", announced the completion of its acquisition of the European Excite group of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Other services==

===FreeLane by Excite===
[[File:Freelane logo.png|right|thumb|100px|Historical logo of the no-cost Excite '''FreeLane''' Internet service.]]

In a bid to compete against Internet Service Providers like [[NetZero]] and [[Juno Online]], which offered free or low-cost [[dial-up]] access in the United States, Excite started offering its own "no-pay" service for private customers by partnering with 1stUp.com to create FreeLane by Excite: 1stUp would allow Excite customers to [[download]] software in order for them to be able to log-on to the Internet.  The software would then rotate a series of sponsored banner advertisements on the user's computer while they surfed the Internet.  1stUp.com soon went out of business, and Excite switched to another partner named [[WorldShare]], rebranding FreeLane as FreeLane version 2.0.  As of March 1, 2001 FreeLane was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/10/excite.free.idg/index.html | work=CNN | title=Excite offers free Net access | date=January 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excite Tickets Portal===
Excite.com features a number of domains that cater to different services. Their events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excite.com/events |title=Excite.com/events |publisher=Excite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://excite.com/events portal] is essentially a ticket selling website where users can buy tickets and search through thousands of events and venues. The powerful search engine capabilities of the Excite server are utilized on this website to help the user search for tickets and events.

===Excite Education Portal===
Recently Excite.com has also started an education portal that can be used by people to search for and apply for different degrees and online courses. The Excite Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excite.com/education |title=Excite.com/education |publisher=Excite.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; portal features a list of thousands of educational institutes across America for prospective students to browse through and apply at.

[[File:Great Blue Hill in Milton.jpg|thumb|right|Great Blue Hill ]]
On April 1, 1980, [[WNAC-TV (defunct)|WNAC-TV]] aired a fake news bulletin that stated that [[Great Blue Hill]] was erupting. Intended as an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke, the prank resulted in panic in [[Milton, Massachusetts]] and the surrounding area.

==News report==

WNAC-TV ended its 6 pm news broadcast with a bulletin reporting that Great Blue Hill in Milton had erupted and was spraying lava and ash onto nearby homes. The report showed footage of lava flowing down a hillside (taken from the March 27 eruption of [[Mount St. Helens]]) and edited remarks from President [[Jimmy Carter]] (who expressed concern) and Governor [[Edward J. King]] (who called the situation "serious"). According to reporter Jan Harrison, the disaster had been caused by a geological chain reaction set off by the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|eruption of Mount St. Helens a week earlier]]. At the end of the bulletin, Harrison held up a card that read "April Fool".&lt;ref name=Loohauls&gt;{{cite news|last=Loohauls|first=Jackie|title=These practical jokers didn't fool around|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19840330&amp;id=-2caAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1843,6882515|accessdate=May 12, 2014|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=March 30, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Off beat: April Fool’s joke had people blowing their tops weeks before mountain did|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2010/may/24/april-fools-joke-had-people-blowing-their-tops-wee/|accessdate=May 12, 2014|newspaper=The Columbian|date=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sabulis&gt;{{cite news|last=Sabulis|first=Thomas|title=Ch. 7 reacts, cans jokester|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=April 3, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

WNAC-TV received dozens of calls from angry viewers. The station issued an apology during its 11 pm newscast.&lt;ref name=McNamara /&gt; The next day, the executive producer of the 6 o'clock news, Homer Cilley, was fired by the station for "his failure to exercise good news judgment" and for violating the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s rules about showing [[stock footage]] without identifying it as such.&lt;ref name=Sabulis /&gt;&lt;ref name=BGDN /&gt;&lt;ref name=Piot /&gt;

'''H. Louis Nichols''' (November 7, 1916 – April 25, 2010) was an attorney who resided in [[Dallas]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/obituary.aspx?pid=142285982 H. Louis Nichols], ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the only known attorney who visited [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], while Oswald was in custody by the Dallas Police Department after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="Oswald"&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/obituary-headlines/20100427-H-Louis-Nichols-Dallas-3239.ece H. Louis Nichols: Dallas lawyer visited Oswald in jail], ''The Dallas Morning News'', April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nichols was a graduate of the [[Southern Methodist University]] Law School, class of 1940. He was a lawyer in Dallas for over 60 years, practicing Civil Law. Nichols was a member of the [[American Bar Association]]; Texas Bar Association and other legal associations. During World War II, he served in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] (1941–1946), and later retired from the [[United States Army Reserve]] in 1968, holding the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://restland.tributes.com/our_obituaries/H.-Louis-Nichols-88406984 H. Louis Nichols Obituary], restland.tributes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lee Harvey Oswald==
Nichols stated that by 2:00 pm on Saturday, November 23, 1963, he began receiving telephone calls from Dallas attorneys who were concerned that Oswald was stating he had no legal representation while being questioned by the Dallas Police Department. Oswald was being questioned at the time with regards to the assassination of President Kennedy as well as the shooting of Dallas Police officer [[J. D. Tippit]].&lt;ref name="Oswald"/&gt; Law school deans were contacting the Dallas Bar Association expressing concern that "only a legal backwater would deny an attorney to a murder suspect".&lt;ref name="Oswald"/&gt;

Nichols, who practiced civil law in the Dallas area was the president of the Dallas Bar Association at the time. In 1963, criminal suspects in Texas had no right to a lawyer while being questioned.&lt;ref name="Oswald"/&gt; However, Nichols was concerned and believed that Oswald needed legal representation, despite the fact that it was clear Oswald was unable to pay for an attorney to represent him. He decided to go to the Dallas Police Department and offer his services, despite the fact he was unfamiliar with criminal law.&lt;ref name="Oswald"/&gt;

Upon arrival at the Police Department, he announced to police officials he was an attorney and was there to speak to Oswald. He was accompanied to Oswald's cell, where he found him sitting by himself between two empty adjacent cells, with a police officer just outside the door of the cell. Oswald was calm and rested in the cell with a bruise over one eye. He stated that the police were holding him "incommunicado" and denied killing either Kennedy or Officer Tippit.&lt;ref name="Oswald"/&gt;

Oswald stated to Nichols that he wanted [[John Abt]], an attorney from New York to represent him. Abt was associated with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Nichols asked Oswald if he wanted him or a Dallas lawyer to represent him. Oswald stated "No, not right now."&lt;ref name="Oswald"/&gt;

Nichols then left Oswald to be alone in his cell and departed from the Dallas Police station.&lt;ref name="Oswald"/&gt; Nichols' visit with Oswald lasted approximately two minutes.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune; November 24, 1963&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomis |first1=Wayne |date=November 24, 1963 |title=Suspect Purchased Rifle in Chicago |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1963/11/24/page/1/article/suspect-purchased-rifle-in-chicago |work=Chicago Tribune |volume=116 |issue=328 |edition=Final |at=Section 1, pp. 1-2 |access-date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald was killed the next day by [[Jack Ruby]].

The rites of ''Santa Sumana'' are a popular religious event typical of the Italian town of [[Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto]].

== Origins ==

The rites of '''Sumana Santa''' or '''Santa Sumana''' are rooted in the [[history of Spanish Sicily]] 1516 - 1713 when the entire island subject to the domination of [[Crown of Aragon]], combined with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] passes under the jurisdiction of the [[Crown of Spain]]. In 1571 "Pozzogottesi" obtained from the Grand Court of the Archbishop of [[Messina]] permission to elect their chaplain stationed in [[Saint Vitus]] no longer depend from the Archpriest of [[Milazzo]]. The first procession is carried out in 1621 as a movement of protest against the Jurors of the city of [[Milazzo]], under whose jurisdiction Pozzo di Gotto depended politically and physically by providing a distant village and as a vow and promise to break the bond of subordination constraint which will be permanently discontinued on the 22 of May 1639. Initially it is carried in procession the ''Catafalco with the Dead Christ'', after 5 will be the statues that depict respectively Mysteries: the ''Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane'', the ''Lord to the column'', the ''Fall'', the ''Lord's Cross'', the ''Urn''. Then will be added the statue of ''Our'' and gradually, other scenes representing the [[Stations of the Cross]] until you reach the current number. A first suspension of the Sacred Representation occurs following a seismic event, known as the [[southern Calabria Earthquake of 1783]], after which the statuary groups suffered significant damage. The interruption is prolonged until 1800, and in 1801 a similar procession is organized in the core of Barcellona. The village to the west of [[Longano]] in turn under the jurisdiction of [[Castroreale]] and had already followed the example of the neighboring community rebelling against Jurors [[castrensian]] doing in the Church recognize their independence. The autonomy of the village of Barcellona is decided by the [[Sicilian Parliament]], recognized by the King 15 May 1815 and ratified in Vienna on February 28, 1823 by King [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]]. The administrative union decreed January 5, 1835 comes into force on the 1 st. June 1836 at the behest of King [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]], deciding that the new municipality formed by the merger of the two ancient districts bore the full name of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto. Since [[Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto]] has two Archpriests and boasts the occasion of Holy Friday two separate processions, parades and routes. During the [[Crimean War]] broke out in 1854 in [[Europe]] a violent epidemic [[cholera]] which soon transcends the boundaries of [[Alps]] and upsets the whole of the peninsula, reaching rates high mortality in the provinces of [[Messina]] and [[Palermo]]. Even on this occasion, the celebrations are not made for fear of infections due to numerous outbreaks.

Spanish flu remain clear even footprints in the etymological definition: from the Spanish ''Semana Santa'' to the local '' Santa Sumana''. Not the baroque splendor of the [[Holy Week in Seville]] or [[Holy Week in Málaga|Málaga]] or [[Cordoba, Spain|Cordoba]] or [[Granada]], not the incessant processional marches always clearly of Iberian [[Trapani]] or [[Caltanissetta]], but one of the prettiest and for number of simulacra, certainly the most rich and varied.

== Events ==

* '''Holy Wednesday''': Rite of ''Ecce Homo'' and meeting of the [[Visillanti]] Barcelona and Pozzo di Gotto, at the Church of Jesus and Mary in Pozzo di Gotto.
* '''Holy Thursday''': in all the churches [[Mass in Cena Domini]] with the rite of [[washing of the feet]], procession of the Apostles and a visit to the Altars of Repose improperly called [[Tomb]]. See [[Altar of Repose]].
* '''Holy Friday''': in all the parishes [[Passion of the Lord]], ligation of the Bells replaced by traccole, stripping of the altars. In Pozzo di Gotto: dressing of the [[Jews]]. [[Procession of Vare]] followed by the singing of Visillanti Visilla ("[[Vexilla Regis prodeunt ....]]") of [[Venantius Fortunatus]] and meeting on the bridge at the eventide Longano.
* '''Holy Saturday''': in every parish: Easter Vigil.
* '''Monday''': at the Church of Jesus and Mary, in Pozzo di Gotto: Solemn Mass and Replacement Teca in Ecce Homo.
* '''Low Sunday''': at the Parish of the Oreto Procession for the meeting between the Risen Christ with Mary.

== The Vare ==

In similar events is still in use [[Cataletto]] or [[Catafalco]] with Dead Christ, often veiled in the colors of mourning. In the representations of the Holy Week rites of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, in both the processions Catafalco is replaced with urns or coffins of wood and glass, from which the etymology "Bara" and "Baretta."
The terms "[[vara (folklore)|vara]]", "Varetta" and "varare" are derived from Latin and Spanish that means to lead, carry with rods or shafts, promoting sustainable through the use of stands. The transport and the stops along the processional route followed the trend of the times: the long poles for carrying on the shoulder carried by porters and trestles were replaced with more comfortable wagons, which have kept only the rods for directing or entrainment of simulacra.

==1851–1971==


In 1851, Indiana adopted its second and current constitution, which banned governors from serving consecutive terms and lengthened terms to four years. Elections since then have been held on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] in November during years divisible by four, concurrent with presidential elections.&lt;ref name = g1n2/&gt;

October 28, the '''International Animation Day''' (IAD) was proclaimed in 2002 by the [[ASIFA]] as the main global event to celebrate the art of [[animation]].

This day commemorates the first public performance of [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]]'s [[Théâtre Optique]] at the Grevin Museum in Paris, 1892. In 1895, the [[Cinematograph]] of the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] outshone Reynaud's invention, driving Émile to bankruptcy. However, his public performance of animation entered the history of optical entertainments as shortly predating the camera-made [[movies]].

In recent years, the event has been observed in more than 50 different countries with more than 1000 events, on every continent, all over the world. IAD was initiated by [[ASIFA]], [[International Animated Film Association]], a member of [[UNESCO]]. During International Animation Day cultural institutions are also invited to join in by screening animated films, organizing workshops, exhibiting artwork and stills, providing technical demonstrations, and organizing other events helping to promote the art of animation. Such a celebration is an outstanding opportunity of putting animated films in the limelight, making this art more accessible to the public.

ASIFA also commissions an artist to create an [[original poster|original art poster]] announcing the event each year.  It is then adapted for each country in order to guarantee a worldwide view of the event. Previous editions involved the work of animators such as Iouri Tcherenkov, [[Paul Driessen (animator)|Paul Driessen]], Abi Feijo, Eric Ledune, [[Noureddin Zarrinkelk]], [[Michel Ocelot]], [[Nina Paley]], [[Raoul Servais]], Ihab Shaker and Gianluigi Toccafondo.

Full length animation films, historical features, animated shorts, and student films, all variety of animation art are shown in the workshops. These films display an extraordinary range of techniques – drawing, painting, animating puppets and objects, using clay, sand, paper, and computer.  Because many animated films are non-verbal, it is a rich opportunity for cross cultural expression and [[cross-cultural communication|communication]].

IACA was launched in 2010 by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], Interpol, the [[European Anti-Fraud Office]] (OLAF), the Republic of Austria, and other stake-holders to help implement the [[UN Convention against Corruption]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: UK backs new corruption-fighting academy - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-backs-new-corruption-fighting-academy|work=www.gov.uk|date=3 September 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As fo 2013,  61 countries had signed the IACA membership agreement, and 38 of those had ratified it.&lt;ref name=Zeit2013/&gt; There was no fee for membership.&lt;ref name=News2016/&gt;  IACA started its first Masters program in February 2013; at that time the tuition was 24,700 euros and the coursework was run in seven twelve-day blocks, taken over two years.&lt;ref name=Zeit2013&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gottsauner-Wolf |first1=Moritz |last2=Zotter |first2=Christoph |title=Wo die Korruptionsjäger büffeln |publisher=[[Die Zeit]] |url=https://www.zeit.de/2013/06/Antikorruptionsakademie-Laxenburg-Oesterreich/komplettansicht |date=31 January 2013 |language=de |accessdate=2018-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian news magazine, ''[[NEWS (Austrian magazine)|News]]'', reported that IACA posted a budget of €12.98 million for the 2014 financial year and a budget of €13.24M for 2015; while noting that the actual revenues for 2013 were €2.3M and expenditures were around €2.1M.&lt;ref name=News2016/&gt; IACA told the ''News'' that the higher numbers were based on their fund-raising goals.&lt;ref name=News2016/&gt; At the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 IACA underwent a turnover in staff.&lt;ref name=News2016&gt;{{cite news|title=Das Luftschloss: Über die Internationale Anti-Korruptionsakademie|url=https://www.news.at/a/luftschloss-internationale-korruptionsakademie|work=News.at|date=16 February 2016|language=de|last=Melichar|first= Stefan|accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IACA's relations with [[Azerbaijan]] and the [[Russian Federation]] were criticized after IACA held its 2014 annual conference in [[Baku]] at the time of a governmental crackdown on [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and anti-corruption activists.&lt;ref name=corrective/&gt; According to [[Correctiv]], one of the students at IACA was an Azerbaijani public prosecutor, who worked for the investigating authority that was prosecuting the Azerbaijani anti-corruption activist and journalist [[Khadija Ismayilova]].&lt;ref name=corrective&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richter|first1=Frederik|title=How the Siemens bribery settlement funds opacity|url=https://correctiv.org/en/investigations/stories/2017/06/29/how-siemens-bribery-settlement-funds-opacity/|work=Correct!V|date=29 June 2017|language=en|accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Faegre &amp; Benson, he worked as chief counsel to [[List of United States Senators from Minnesota|U.S. Senator from Minnesota]] [[Amy Klobuchar]].,&lt;ref name="Henry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; who connected him to Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2016/02/we-just-go-jake-how-southwest-high-grad-became-hillary-clinton-s-go-guy&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Sullivan was originally an advisor to Hillary Clinton during the primary cycle, and then to Barack Obama during the general election campaign. He prepared Clinton and Obama for debates.&lt;ref name="WhoRunsGov" /&gt; When Clinton became U.S. Secretary of State, Sullivan joined as her deputy chief of staff and [[Director of Policy Planning]], and he travelled with her to 112 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MARK LANDLER|title=Biden Adviser Leaving Washington, but It May Not Be for Long|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/21/us/for-departing-biden-aide-and-clinton-confidant-another-political-choice-looms.html?_r=1|accessdate=11 December 2016|work=The New York Times|date=June 20, 2014|quote=he was one of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s closest advisers, at her side in all 112 countries she visited as secretary of state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran nuclear negotiations===
{{main article|Comprehensive agreement on Iranian nuclear program}}
In November 2013, the [[Associated Press]] reported that officials in the [[Obama administration]] had been in secret contact with Iranian officials throughout 2013 about the feasibility of an agreement over the Iranian nuclear program. The report stated that American officials, including [[United States Deputy Secretary of State|U.S. Deputy Secretary of State]] [[William Joseph Burns|William Burns]], Senior White House Iran Advisor Puneet Talwar,  and Sullivan, had secretly met with their Iranian counterparts at least five times face-to-face in [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/24/report-claims-secret-us-iran-talks-laid-groundwork-for-nuclear-deal/|title=Report Claims Secret US–Iran Talks Laid Groundwork for Nuclear Deal|date= November 24, 2013|agency= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]| access-date = November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those efforts paved the way for the [[Geneva interim agreement on the Iranian nuclear program]], known officially as the Joint Plan of Action, signed by [[Iran]] and the [[P5+1|P5+1 countries]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, on November 24, 2013.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/timeline-key-events-us-iran-negotiations-051720553--politics.html|title=A Timeline of Key Events in US–Iran Negotiations|date=November 25, 2004|agency= [[Associated Press]]|publisher= [[Yahoo!

The {{Nihongo|'''''Jidai Matsuri'''''|時代祭|extra="Festival of the Ages"}} is a traditional Japanese festival (also called [[matsuri]]) held annually on October 22 in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. It is one of Kyoto's renowned three great festivals, with the other two being the ''[[Aoi Matsuri]]'', held annually on May 15, and the ''[[Gion Matsuri]]'', which is held annually from 17 to July 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kyoto Jidai Matsuri|accessdate=2009-01-19|publisher=Japan Atlas|url=http://web-japan.org/atlas/festivals/fes15.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a festival enjoyed by people of all ages, participating in its [[historical reenactment]] parade dressed in authentic costumes representing various periods, and characters in Japanese feudal history.&lt;ref name="fashions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=Don|title=Old fashions: a proud parade of period costumes brings Japanese history to life at Jidai Matsuri|journal=Gain: Hitachi electronic component news|publisher=Hitachi Inc.|location=Tokyo, Japan|volume=16|issue=4|date=Nov 1997|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jidai Matsuri traces its roots to the relocation of the Japanese capital from Kyoto to [[Tokyo]] during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868. This involved the relocation of the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace, and thousands of government officials and subjects to the new city. Fearing for Kyoto's loss of glory and interest from her people, and to commemorate its history, the city government and the Kyoto prefectural government commemorated the 1100th anniversary of the founding of Heian-kyō (平安京), which was the former name of Kyoto, in 794 by {{nihongo|[[Emperor Kanmu]]|桓武天皇|''Kanmu-tennō''}} (737–806). To inaugurate the first Jidai celebration in 1895, the city government built the {{nihongo|Heian Shrine|平安神宮|Heian jingū}} to enshrine the spirit of Emperor Kanmu. To add meaning to the festival, it staged a costume procession representing people of each era in Kyoto history. In 1940, the local government decided that on top of honouring Emperor Kanmu, the Jidai festival was also to be held in honour of {{nihongo|[[Emperor Kōmei]]|孝明天皇|''Kōmei-tennō''}} (July 22, 1831&amp;nbsp;– January 30, 1867) for his work in unifying the country, the power of the imperial court and the affirmation of Kyoto as the center of Japan at the decline of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the end of the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name="fashions"/&gt;

The Jidai Matsuri begins in early morning with the [[mikoshi]] (portable shrines) brought out of the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] so that people may pay their respects. The mikoshi represents both Emperor Kanmu and Emperor Kōmei. The five-hour, two-kilometer costume procession begins in the afternoon, with approximately 2,000 performers dressed as [[samurai]], military figures, and common people, from the earliest eras to the [[Meiji era]]. These are followed by Japanese women who are dressed in elaborate {{nihongo|'''[[jūnihitoe]]'''|十二単衣|''juunihitoe''}}. Finally, the mikoshi are carried from the palace and are accompanied by a costumed military band that plays the [[gagaku]]. The procession ends at the [[Heian Shrine]].&lt;ref name="fashions"/&gt;

'''Joseph William Kittinger II''' (born July 27, 1928) is a retired [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and a USAF [[Command Pilot]]. Following his initial operational assignment in fighter aircraft, he participated in [[Project Manhigh]] and [[Project Excelsior]] in 1960, setting a world record for the highest [[skydive]] from a height greater than {{convert|31|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PyGmTV0q2kY|Mission to the edge of Space&amp;nbsp;— Red Bull Stratos&amp;nbsp;— Trailer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first man to make a solo crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a gas balloon, and the first man to fully witness the curvature of the [[Earth]].

Serving as a [[fighter pilot]] during the [[Vietnam War]], he achieved an aerial kill of a North Vietnamese [[MiG-21]] jet fighter and was later shot down himself, spending 11 months as a [[prisoner of war]] in a [[North Vietnam]]ese prison.

In 2012, at the age of 84, he participated in the [[Red Bull Stratos]] project as [[capsule communicator]], directing [[Felix Baumgartner]] on his record-breaking {{convert|39|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} freefall from Earth's [[stratosphere]], exceeding Kittinger's earlier freefall in 1960.

==Early life and military career==
{{BLP sources section|date=May 2017}}
Born in [[Tampa, Florida]], and raised in [[Orlando, Florida]], Kittinger was educated at [[The Bolles School]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the [[University of Florida]]. He became fascinated with planes at a very young age and soloed in a [[Piper Aircraft#1940s|Piper Cub]] by the time he was 17. After racing [[speedboat]]s as a teenager, he entered the [[U.S. Air Force]] as an aviation cadet in March 1949.  On completion of [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|aviation cadet training]] in March 1950, he received his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|pilot wings]] and a commission as a [[second lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=93 |title= Joseph  W.  Kittinger,  Jr. |publisher= veterantributes.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently assigned to the [[86th Airlift Wing|86th Fighter-Bomber Wing]] based at [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[West Germany]], flying the [[F-84 Thunderjet]] and [[F-86 Sabre]].&lt;ref&gt;Come Up and Get Me: An Autobiography of Colonel Joe Kittinger; Ryan, Craig and Kittinger, Joseph; University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, NM; c2010; ISBN-10: 9780826348043; ISBN-13: 978-0826348043&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 Kittinger was transferred to the [[Air Force Missile Development Center]] (AFMDC) at [[Holloman Air Force Base|Holloman AFB]], [[New Mexico]].  It was during this assignment that he flew the observation/chase plane that monitored flight surgeon Colonel [[John Stapp]]'s [[rocket sled]] run of {{convert|632|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1955. Kittinger was impressed by Stapp's dedication and leadership as a pioneer in aerospace medicine. Stapp, in turn, was impressed with Kittinger's skillful jet piloting, later recommending him for space-related aviation research work. Stapp was to foster the high-altitude balloon tests that would later lead to Kittinger's record-setting leap from over {{convert|102,800|ft|m}}. In 1957, as part of ''[[Project Manhigh]]'', Kittinger set an interim [[balloon]] altitude record of {{convert|96,760|ft|m}} in ''Manhigh I'', for which he was awarded his first [[Distinguished Flying Cross (USA)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Come Up and Get Me: An Autobiography of Colonel Joe Kittinger; Ryan, Craig and Kittinger, Joseph; University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, NM; c2010; ISBN-10: 9780826348043; ISBN-13: 978-0826348043&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project Excelsior==
{{Main|Project Excelsior}}
Captain Kittinger was next assigned to the [[311th Human Systems Wing|Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson AFB]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. For ''Project Excelsior'' (meaning "ever upward"), a name given to the project by Colonel Stapp as part of research into [[high-altitude]] bailouts,&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum.af.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=562 |title=Factsheets: Excelsior Gondola |publisher=National Museum of the USAF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331012902/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=562 |archivedate=2010-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he made a series of three extreme altitude [[parachute]] jumps from an open gondola carried aloft by large helium balloons. These jumps were made in a "rocking-chair" position, descending on his back, rather than in the usual face-down position familiar to skydivers.&lt;!--then why does the photo show him face-down?--&gt;  This was because he was wearing a {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}} "kit" on his behind, and his [[pressure suit]] naturally formed a sitting shape when it was inflated, a shape appropriate for sitting in an airplane cockpit.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum.af.mil"/&gt;

''Excelsior I'': Kittinger's first high-altitude jump, from about {{convert|76,400|ft|m}} on November 16, 1959, was a near-disaster when an equipment malfunction caused him to lose consciousness.&lt;ref name=supersonic/&gt; The automatic parachute opener in his equipment saved his life. He went into a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]] at a rotational velocity of about 120 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], the [[g-force]]s at his extremities having been calculated to be over 22 times the force of gravity, setting another record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/rams.colostate.edu/the-edge-of-engineering/|title=The Edge of Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Excelsior II'': On December 11, 1959, Kittinger jumped again from about {{convert|74,700|ft|m}}. For this leap, he was awarded the [[A. Leo Stevens Parachute Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aero.com/publications/parachutes/9601/pc0196.htm |title= The A.

''Excelsior III'': On August 16, 1960, Kittinger made the final high-altitude jump at {{convert|102800|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=supersonic&gt;{{cite news |author=John Tierney |coauthors= |title=A Supersonic Jump, From 23 Miles in the Air |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/science/16tier.html?src=me&amp;ref=general |quote=In 1960, Kittinger, then a 32-year-old air force pilot, jumped from a balloon 102,800 feet above the New Mexico desert. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=March 15, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-17 |authorlink= John Tierney (journalist) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towing a small [[drogue parachute]] for initial stabilization, he fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds, reaching a maximum speed of {{convert|614|mph}}&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum.af.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mlsandy.home.tsixroads.com/Corinth_MLSANDY/jk004.html|work= Life |date=August 29, 1960|title=Fantastic catch in the sky, record leap toward earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; before opening his parachute at {{convert|18000|ft|m}}.

Of the jumps from ''Excelsior'', Kittinger said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=[[Florida Trend]] |url=http://www.floridatrend.com/article/1935/icon-joseph-kittinger|title= Florida Icon: Joseph Kittinger |date=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's no way you can visualize the speed. There's nothing you can see to see how fast you're going. You have no depth perception. If you're in a car driving down the road and you close your eyes, you have no idea what your speed is. It's the same thing if you're free falling from space. There are no signposts. You know you are going very fast, but you don't feel it. You don't have a 614-mph wind blowing on you. I could only hear myself breathing in the helmet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kittinger set [[Flight altitude record|historical numbers]] for highest balloon ascent, highest parachute jump, longest duration drogue-fall (four minutes), and fastest speed by a human being through the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/eagles/kittnger.htm |title=Joseph W.

His records for highest parachute jump and fastest velocity stood for 52 years, until they [[Red Bull Stratos|were broken]] in 2012 by [[Felix Baumgartner]].

For this series of jumps, Kittinger was profiled in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine and the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'', decorated with a second [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and awarded the [[Harmon Trophy]] by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/kittinger/DI29.htm |title=Joseph Kittinger, Jr. |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |accessdate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609063217/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/kittinger/DI29.htm |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project Stargazer==
Back at [[Holloman Air Force Base]], Kittinger took part in ''Project Stargazer'' on December 13–14, 1960. He and the [[astronomer]] William C. White&lt;ref&gt;http://stratocat.com.ar/stratopedia/300.htm&lt;/ref&gt; took an open-[[Balloon (aircraft)|gondola]] [[helium]] balloon packed with scientific equipment to an altitude of about {{convert|82,200|ft|m}}, where they spent over 18 hours performing [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations.

==Later USAF career==
In 1965, after returning to the operational Air Force, Kittinger was approached by civilian amateur parachutist [[Nick Piantanida]] for assistance on Pintandia's ''Strato Jump'' project, an effort to break the previous freefall records of both Kittinger and [[Soviet Air Force]] officer [[Yevgeni Nikolayevich Andreyev|Yevgeni Andreyev]]. Kittinger refused to participate in the effort, believing Piantanida's approach to the project was too reckless. Piantanida was subsequently killed in 1966 during his ''Strato Jump III'' attempt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1008811/men-who-fall-earth&lt;/ref&gt;

Kittinger later served three combat tours of duty during the [[Vietnam War]], flying a total of 483 [[Aerial warfare|combat mission]]s. During his first two tours he flew as an aircraft commander in Douglas [[A-26 Invader]]s and modified [[On Mark Engineering]] [[A-26 Invader|B-26K Counter-Invader]]s as part of Operations [[Farm Gate (military operation)|Farm Gate]] and Big Eagle.

Following his first two Vietnam tours, he returned to the United States and soon transitioned to the [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II]]. During a voluntary third tour of duty to Vietnam in 1971–72, he commanded the [[555th Fighter Squadron|555th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (555 TFS), the noted "Triple Nickel" squadron, flying the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4D Phantom II]]. During this period he was credited with shooting down a North Vietnamese [[MiG-21]] while flying an F-4D, USAF Serial No. 66-7463, with his WSO, 1st Lieutenant Leigh Hodgdon.&lt;ref name="USAFheritage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Col. Joe Kittinger Jr.|publisher=USAF Heritage|url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/person.asp?dec=&amp;pid=123006518 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322014956/http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/person.asp?dec=&amp;pid=123006518|archivedate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kittinger was shot down on May 11, 1972, just before the end of his third tour of duty. While flying an F-4D, USAF Serial No. 66-0230, with his weapons systems officer, 1st Lieutenant William J. Reich, Lieutenant Colonel Kittinger was leading a flight of Phantoms approximately five miles northwest of [[Thai Nguyen]], [[North Vietnam]], when they were engaged by a flight of enemy [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters. Kittinger and his wingman were chasing a MiG-21 when Kittinger's Phantom II was hit by an air-to-air missile from another MiG-21 that damaged the Phantom's starboard wing and set the aircraft on fire. Kittinger and Reich ejected a few miles from Thai Nguyen and were soon captured and taken to the city of [[Hanoi]]. During the same engagement, Kittinger's wingman, Captain S. E. Nichols, shot down the MiG-21 they had been chasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vietnam Air Losses|first= Chris |last=Hobson|publisher= Midland Publishing|location= Hinckley UK|year=2001 |page=226|isbn=1-85780-115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kittinger and Reich spent 11 months as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) in the [[Hỏa Lò Prison]], the so-called "[[Hanoi Hilton]]". Kittinger was put through [[strappado|rope torture]] soon after his arrival at the POW compound and this made a lasting impression on him. Kittinger was the senior ranking officer (SRO) among the newer prisoners of war, ''i.e.'', those captured after 1969. In Kittinger's autobiography "''Come Up and Get Me''" (by Kittinger and Craig Ryan), Kittinger emphasized being very serious about maintaining the military structure he considered essential to survival. Kittinger and Reich were returned to American hands on March 28, 1973, and they continued their Air Force careers, with Kittinger having been promoted to full colonel while in captivity. Following his return, Colonel Kittinger attended the [[Air War College]] at [[Maxwell AFB]], [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name="Grier, Peter 2014, p.66"&gt;"Kittinger"; Grier, Peter; Air Force Magazine, August 2014, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

Following completion of the Air War College, Kittinger became the vice commander of the [[48th Fighter Wing|48th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[RAF Lakenheath]], [[United Kingdom]], where he again flew the [[F-4 Phantom II]]. In 1977, he transferred to Headquarters, [[12th Air Force]], at [[Bergstrom AFB]], [[Texas]], retiring from the Air Force in 1978.&lt;ref name="Grier, Peter 2014, p.66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAFheritage"/&gt; Kittinger accumulated 7,679 flying hours in the Air Force, including 948 combat flying hours during three tours during the Vietnam War. In addition, he has flown over 9,100 hours in various civilian aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=93 Kittinger's flying hours]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military awards and decorations==
Kittinger received the following awards and decorations during his USAF career:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Col. Joe Kittinger Awards|publisher=Sherri Lester-Aguirre and Sherry Kittinger|accessdate=2012-08-06|url=http://joekittinger.com/recordsawards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later civilian career==
Kittinger retired from the Air Force as a [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in 1978 and initially went to work for [[Martin Marietta]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]) Corporation in [[Orlando, Florida]].  He later became Vice President of Flight Operations for Rosie O'Grady's Flying Circus, part of the [[Church Street Station (Orlando)|Rosie O'Grady's/Church Street Station]] entertainment complex in Orlando, prior to the parent company's dissolution.

Still interested in ballooning, he set a gas balloon world distance record for the AA-06 size class (since broken) of 3,221.23&amp;nbsp;km in 1983.&lt;ref name=FAI&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Records" Joseph W.

Kittinger also participated in the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning]] in 1989 (ranked third) and 1994 (ranked 12th).

In the early 1990s, Kittinger played a lead role with [[NASA]] assisting [[Charles "Nish" Bruce]] to break his highest parachute jump record.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Read, Freefall (Little Brown, Edition 1, 1998). {{ISBN|0-316-64303-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was suspended in 1994.

Joining the [[Red Bull Stratos]] project, Kittinger advised [[Felix Baumgartner]] on Baumgartner's October 14, 2012 free-fall from 128,100 feet (39,045m).&lt;ref name="Paterson"/&gt; The project collected leading experts in the fields of aeronautics, medicine and engineering to ensure its success.  Kittinger eventually served as [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator .28CAPCOM.29|CAPCOM]] (capsule communicator) for Baumgartner's jump, which exceeded the altitude of Kittinger's previous jump during Project Excelsior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Col.

The actual F-4D, AF Ser. No. 66-7463, is now on permanent display at the [[USAF Academy]].]] 
In 1997, Kittinger was inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records and awards |url=http://joekittinger.com/recordsawards.html |accessdate=16 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66D6XhHuC?url=http://joekittinger.com/recordsawards.html |archivedate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2007, the [[Civil Air Patrol]] honored Kittinger by renaming the Texas CAP wing's TX-352 Squadron after him. Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]] cited Kittinger's work, as did the Texas state senate with a special resolution presented during the dedication ceremony attended by Kittinger and his wife, Sherry. The Colonel Joseph W. Kittinger Phantom Senior Squadron of CAP's Texas Wing is based at the former [[Bergstrom AFB]], the site of Kittinger's last active duty assignment in the Air Force and which is now the [[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]].

Kittinger was honored at a 2009 ceremony in [[Caribou, Maine]], the launch point for his 1984 solo Trans-Atlantic balloon flight.  He also served as the guest of honor at the community's sesquicentennial celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstflight.org/shrine/joe_kittinger.php|title=Paul E.

===Colonel Joe Kittinger Park===
[[File:F4D 650747 Kittinger.jpg|thumb|F-4D, AF Ser. No. 65-0747, on display at Colonel Joe Kittinger Park]]
In September 1992, Colonel Joe Kittinger Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoforlando.net/fpr/html/Parks/JoeKittinger.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126112912/http://www.cityoforlando.net/fpr/html/Parks/JoeKittinger.htm |archivedate=2014-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Orlando, Florida]] was completed by the [[Greater Orlando Aviation Authority]] (GOAA) for the [[City of Orlando]]. Located on the southwest corner of the [[Orlando Executive Airport]], at the corner of Crystal Lake Drive and South Street, the park was named in Kittinger's honor, but was temporarily closed and partially demolished circa 2008-2011 in order to create a stormwater runoff retention area to permit a highway expansion project of the [[Florida State Road 408|State Road 408]] East-West Expressway.  In March 2011, the park was reopened at its previous location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Aviation Hero, Colonel Joe Kittinger, Re-Opens Park in His Honor at Orlando Executive Airport |url=http://www.orlandoairports.net/press/2011/20110316.htm |accessdate=16 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66D50zow3?url=http://www.orlandoairports.net/press/2011/20110316.htm |archivedate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spring 2014, the Mayor of Orange County, the Mayor of Orlando, the GOAA Board, and other City of Orlando and GOAA officials approved inclusion in the park of a restored USAF [[F-4 Phantom II]] aircraft.  The [[National Museum of the U.S. Air Force]] identified an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4D]] previously on display in Corsicana, Texas, AF Ser. No. 65-0747, for transfer to Orlando, said aircraft to be placed on display at the park, and painted with the colors and markings of the squadron that Colonel Kittinger commanded during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoforlando.net/elected/mayor/pressreleases/11_03_15_park.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114003917/http://www.cityoforlando.net/elected/mayor/pressreleases/11_03_15_park.htm |archivedate=2013-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the transfer process, it was subsequently determined that Colonel Kittinger had also flown this particular F-4D, AF Ser. No. 65-0747, on several occasions when it was assigned to his fighter wing in [[Thailand]] during the Vietnam War, and again when it was assigned to his fighter wing in Great Britain after the war.  Disassembled in Texas and transported via two semi-trailers over a period of several days, the aircraft arrived in Orlando on July 22, 2014 and underwent a total restoration by a team of volunteers at Orlando Executive Airport.  Following restoration, it was subsequently moved to its current location on the airport, remounted on its new pylon, and formally dedicated on December 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandoairports.net/press/2014/20140722.htm|title=Orlando International Airport (MCO) - Press Release - 7/22/14 F-4 Phantom Arrives at ORL|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811232422/http://www.orlandoairports.net/press/2014/20140722.htm|archivedate=2014-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warbirdsnews.com/warbird-videos/f-4-phantom-arrives-orlando-serve-vietnam-vet-tribute.html|title=F-4 Phantom  Arrives in Orlando to Serve as Vietnam Vet Tribute|work=Warbirds News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jovian–Plutonian gravitational effect''' was a [[hoax]] phenomenon purported to cause a noticeable short-term reduction in [[gravitation|gravity]] on [[Earth]] that was invented for [[April Fools' Day]] by the [[English people|English]] [[astronomer]] [[Patrick Moore]] and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 2]] on 1 April 1976.

==Background==

[[Patrick Moore]] (4 March 1923 – 9 December 2012) was the [[wiktionary:doyen|doyen]] of British television astronomers, boasting a long career in [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]], a quick-fire manner of speech, and a number of eccentric habits, including the wearing of a [[monocle]]. A [[Second World War|wartime]] navigator in the [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1945 and presented [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[The Sky at Night]]'' programme from 1957 until his death. He was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1968. Above all, Moore had a high level of public recognition in the United Kingdom as a respected astronomer.&lt;ref name=hicelabs&gt;[http://www.hicelebs.com/profile/patrick_moore/biography.html Patrick Moore Biography] online at hicelebs.com (accessed 27 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[planet]] [[Jupiter]] is two and a half times as massive as all of the other planets in the [[Solar System]] combined.&lt;ref&gt;Beeb, Reta, ''Jupiter: The Giant Planet'' (Washington, D.C., Smithsonian Institution Press, 2nd edition, 1996, {{ISBN|1-56098-685-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pluto]] is so small and so remote from the [[Sun]] and the [[Earth]] that it was not discovered until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Tombaugh, Clyde W., ''The Search for the Ninth Planet, Pluto'' (Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflet No. 209, July 1946) reprinted in ''Mercury'' vol. 8, no. 1 (January/February 1979) pp 4-6&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] reclassified it as a [[dwarf planet]], as it belongs to a belt of many similar small objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=International Astronomical Union |title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes |url=http://www.iau.org/iau0603.414.0.html |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103145836/http://www.iau.org/iau0603.414.0.html |archivedate= 3 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of April 1976==
On 1 April 1976, Moore stated to radio listeners that an astronomical event would take place at 9:47&amp;nbsp;a.m. that day, a [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of Jupiter and Pluto, which was expected to have an effect observable everywhere. As Pluto passed behind Jupiter, it would briefly cause a powerful combination of the two planets' [[gravitation]]al forces which would noticeably decrease gravity on Earth. If listeners were to jump into the air at that exact moment, they would find they felt a floating sensation.&lt;ref name=moh&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/af_database/permalink/planetary_alignment_decreases_gravity/ "Planetary Alignment Decreases Gravity -- April Fool's Day, 1976"]. Museum of Hoaxes. Retrieved 21 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Asami (24 March 2008). [https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/magazine/16-04/st_best "10 Best: April Fools' Gags (the Web Is Closing for Spring Cleaning!)"]. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after 9:47 on that morning, the [[BBC]] began to receive hundreds of telephone calls from people reporting they had observed the decrease in gravity.&lt;ref name=moh/&gt; One woman who called in even stated that she and eleven friends had been sitting and had been "wafted from their chairs and orbited gently around the room".&lt;ref name=TheGuardian&gt;Wainright, Martin (30 March 2007). [http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,,2046440,00.html "Fooling around"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoax revealed==
The story was quickly revealed as an April Fools' Day hoax. Martin Wainwright later wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Moore was "an ideal presenter" to carry off the hoax, with his weighty delivery having "an added air of batty enthusiasm that only added to his credibility".&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt;

In 1980, Moore collaborated with [[Clyde Tombaugh]], the man who had discovered Pluto in 1930, to publish a new book about the dwarf planet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Moore|Moore, Patrick]], &amp; [[Clyde W. Tombaugh|Tombaugh, Clyde W.]], ''Out of the Darkness, the Planet Pluto'' (Harrisburg, Pa., Stackpole Books; and London, Lutterworth Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoax explained==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

The hoax claims that the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Pluto combined will cause one to spend a significantly longer amount of time in the air due to an increase in gravitational pull from the distant planets; however, this is incorrect. Although other planets do exert a gravitational pull on humans on Earth, the amount is very small.

Although Jupiter is very massive, it is also very far away. When at its closest distance to Earth of about 600 million kilometers, Jupiter has a gravitational pull of 0.00013 [[newton (unit)|newtons]] on a person with a mass of 100&amp;nbsp;kg, according to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravity.]] About 7.5&amp;nbsp;million times weaker than the Earth's gravity, this is roughly equivalent to the gravitational attraction of a compact car from half a meter away. Similarly, the gravitational pull of the dwarf planet Pluto on a person on Earth is roughly equal to that of a marble 100 meters away. Thus, the gravitational impact of the planets is far too small to be able to cause a person to weigh noticeably less, or stay in the air noticeably longer when jumping.

'''Lawrence Schoonover''' (1906–1980) was an American novelist.

Born in [[Anamosa, Iowa]], Schoonover attended the University of Wisconsin, then worked in advertising before becoming a novelist.

Writing mostly historical fiction, his attention to detail and historical accuracy won him great praise by his contemporaries. Among his novels are ''Queen's Cross'', ''The Burnished Blade'', ''Gentle Infidel'', ''The Spider King'', and ''The Prisoner of Tordesillas''.

==Bibliography==
* ''The Burnished Blade'' (1948). The flaming martyrdom of Joan of Arc opens this historical romance in France at the dawn of the Renaissance. Among the onlookers at that terrible spectacle was Pierre, a frightened boy whom Hugh, the armourer, had rescued that morning on the road outside Rouen. Under Hugh's tutelage, Pierre learns the closely guarded secrets of the armourer's trade. But he is destined not to use them...
* ''Gentle Infidel'' (1950, 2009). Two lovely women, different as night and day, two conflicting faiths - one of the East, the other of the West - claimed the heart of young Michael da Montelupo.  The son of Christian parents, handsome, stalwart Michael was impressed as a boy into the Turkish Emperor's elite [[Janissary]] corps, rigorously trained to become a brave, fanatical Moslem soldier. As a Turk, Michael fell under the sultry spell of Aeshia, a sensuous, scheming young Turkish wife, who tricked him into a relationship that nearly cost him his career - and his life.  But Angelica, the slim, fair, Venetian girl, awakened in him echoes of his early Christian faith.  It was for her that he put the East and its barbaric turbulence behind.  Michael's romantic adventures are enacted against the background of an era of gaudy decadence, crafty intrigue, and exotic, colorful pageantry.  The climax is reached in the spectacular siege and [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople in 1453]], which marked Christendom's last stand against the Infidel.
* ''The Golden Exile'' (1951). Adventures of English knight in Indochina.
* ''The Quick Brown Fox'' (1952) Business melodrama in an ad agency, in the vein of ''The Durable Fire'' by Howard Swiggett.
* ''The Spider King'' (1954). A dynamic [[biographical novel]] of Louis XI and his struggle to create a mighty nation from a weak medieval France.
* ''Queen's Cross'' (1955, 2008). A biographical romance novel of [[Isabella I]] of Castile and Ferdinand during the Reconquista.
* ''The Revolutionary'' (1958). A biographical novel of sea captain John Paul Jones during his period as a slaver, a fighter for the young USA, and for the Russian Imperial court.
* ''The Prisoner of Tordesillas'' (1959). Biographical novel of Mad Juana, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, and mother of Emperor Charles V
* ''The Chancellor'' (1961). A novel of palace intrigue about [[Antoine Duprat]], creator of the French lottery during the reign of [[Francis I of France]].
* ''Central Passage'' (1962). Science fiction novel of the catastrophic climatic effects of an accidental war and the challenge of humanity's next evolutionary phase.  This book is one of the first novels related to [[transhumanism]].
* ''Key of Gold'' (1968). Jewish doctor and family in Holland at the time of Spanish inquisition.
* ''To Love a Queen: Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth'' (1973). Biographical novel of the famous adventurer in his capacity as courtier, entrepreneur, sea captain, and leader.

Blues festivals are [[music festivals]] which focus on [[blues]] music. Blues is a [[music genre|genre]]&lt;ref&gt;Kunzler's dictionary of Jazz provides two separate entries: blues, an originally African-American genre (p.128), and the blues form, a widespread musical form (p.131).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[musical form]] that originated in [[African-American]] communities in the [[Southern United States]] around the end of the 19th century. It has elements of traditional [[African music]], [[American folk music]], [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[work song]]s, [[field holler]]s, [[Ring shout|shouts]] and [[chant]]s, and rhymed simple narrative [[ballad (music)|ballads]].&lt;ref name="The Evolution of Differing Blues Styles"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Evolution of Differing Blues Styles |publisher=How To Play Blues Guitar |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |url=http://how-to-play-blues-guitar.com/the-blues/the-evolution-of-different-blues-styles/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msLYV7tu?url=http://how-to-play-blues-guitar.com/the-blues/the-evolution-of-different-blues-styles/ |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blues has since evolved from  unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and [[List of blues genres|subgenres]], such as [[country blues]], [[Delta blues|Delta]] and [[Piedmont blues|Piedmont]], [[Chicago blues|Chicago]], [[West Coast blues]].

==''moves'' - International Festival of Movement on Screen==

'''[http://www.movementonscreen.org.uk ''moves'' - International Festival of Movement on Screen]''' is an annual [[experimental film]] and [[media art]] festival based in the [[North West of England]].

==History of the Festival==

Originating from the Commonwealth Film Festival, which was founded in 2001 by Northern England media producers [[Michael Burke (producer)|Michael Burke]] and [[Michael Fox (producer)|Michael Fox]], '''''[http://moves moves]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' - International Festival of Movement on Screen''' was launched in June 2007 following the termination of the former due to funding cuts.

The Commonwealth Film Festival started in June 2002 as a project of the Spirit of Friendship Festival in conjunction with the [[Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester. Its opening night featured Arjun Sajnani’s ‘Agni Vasha’, and overall the festival screened over 100 features and 275 [[short films]]. The second edition focussed on a tighter programme and thus helped the festival develop an international reputation for its intelligent programming and good hospitality. Delegate networking and public access were further developed whilst maintaining the informal and friendly atmosphere of the festival. It rapidly established itself as an annual landmark event dedicated to the worldwide promotion of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]-produced film culture. The Commonwealth Film Festival held its last edition in 2006.

In 2007, festival executive director Pascale Moyse took a strand of the festival, screendance, and expanded it to the wider concept "movement on screen" and thus ''moves'' - International Festival of Movement on Screen was born. As an independent film festival, ''moves'' hosted its first edition in [[Manchester]] in June 2007. Since then, it grew to become typohe UK's largest platform for experimental screen-based art works exploring “movement" through films, videos, media installations, [[online]] works, live events, [[videogames]], workshops and papers.

In 2010 newly appointed [[artistic director]] Gala Pujol implemented some changes in the organisation's and festival's strategy which included the relocation to [[Liverpool]] following the city's cultural expansion after its [[European Capital of Culture]] year in 2008.
''moves'' Festival takes place across the region each year with a new theme to approach screen-based works from different perspectives.

''moves'' is one of the few [[film festival]]s in the UK that does not charge entry fees.

'''moves07''': (Manchester, 12–17 June 2007)

'''moves08: Interaction of Sound and Movement''' (Manchester, 22–26 April 2008)

'''moves09: Beyond movement… what’s your story?''' (Manchester, 23–28 April 2009)

'''moves10: Framing Motion''' (Liverpool, 21–25 April 2010)

[http://www.movementonscreen.org.uk moves11: INTERSECTIONS: Filming Across Culture &amp; Technology'] (Liverpool, 25 April - 1 May 2011)

==moves11: The Theme==

All new art forms come into light by processes of [[experimentation]]: either by crossing, altering and pushing traditional boundaries or by merging classic conceptions/practices with new technologies/techniques. '''moves11''' investigated the importance of these fusions in screen-based art, and tried to highlight connections that look at [[multicultural]] and [[interdisciplinary]] creation, as well as new forms of representation that question conventions and move towards the creation of new genres and disciplines.

''moves'' is committed to showcase the best experimental works exploring "movement on screen" from around the world and so far has showcased works from artists such as [http://www.ginaczarnecki.com/ Gina Czarnecki], [[Goran Vejvoda]], Simon Fildes, Alex Reuben, Sergio Cruz, or [http://www.telenoika.net Telenoika], guests included Donald Glowinski, Judy Gladstone, Jamie Watton. The '''moves11 award''' - the main prize of the 2011 edition of the festival - was awarded to "Spin" by [[Max Hattler]].

==Alternative Routes==
Since 2010 ''moves'' is partner and coordinator of Alternative Routes, a new European network of festivals based in non-capital cities.
AR partners include 700IS Reindeerland - Festival of Experimental film and video (Egilstaðir, [[Iceland]]), FRAME Research ([[Porto]], [[Portugal]]) and MODEM ([[Debrecen]], [[Hungary]]).

==History==
[[Image:Nobel banquet 1958.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of large banquet|1958 Nobel Banquet in Stockholm City Hall's Golden Hall]]
The first banquet, for 113 male guests, was held in 1901&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/award_ceremonies/menus/soderlind/ Award ceremonies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428151100/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/award_ceremonies/menus/soderlind/ |date=April 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 1923 it was known as the Nobel Dinner ({{lang-sv|Nobelmiddagen}}).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockholm.se/OmStockholm/Stadshuset/Festlokaler/Nobelfesten/|title=Nobelfesten|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1930 the banquet was held in Vinterträdgården at Stockholm's [[Grand Hôtel (Stockholm)|Grand Hôtel Royal]],&lt;ref&gt;Levinovitz, Agneta Wallin, 2011, pagr 127&lt;/ref&gt; and it has also been held in the Golden Hall of the [[Swedish Academy]] (Svenska Akademien).&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/ceremonies/the-nobel-prize-award-ceremonies-and-banquets/|title=The Nobel Prize Award Ceremonies and Banquets|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banquet hosts 1,300 guests (including the [[Swedish Royal Family]]) and 200 students. Its host, the chair of the [[Nobel Foundation]], is always seated at the [[Monarchy of Sweden|royal]] table.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

During the dinner (usually four hours long) each Nobel Prize recipient makes a speech, often lighthearted in character.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; There are two ceremonial cheers: one for the Swedish monarch and the other, made by the monarch, in memory of [[Alfred Nobel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826112854/http://www.losnummer.se/wp-content/uppladdat/2009/07/7-07.pdf|title=The Nobel Banquet |date=26 August 2010|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speeches and cheers are presented by the banquet's toastmaster, traditionally a Swedish student who holds the job for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssco.se/nobeltoastmaster/|title=SSCO och Nobelstiftelsen söker ny toastmaster till Nobel|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324141142/http://www.ssco.se/nobeltoastmaster/|archivedate=24 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216154102/http://www.ingenjorskarriar.se/din_utveckling/article3952991.ece|title=Ingenjörens uppdrag: Vara Nobelfestens toastmaster - Ingenjörskarriär|date=16 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service during the banquet is provided by [[waiting staff]], [[chefs]], and others who are trained for several weeks.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"/&gt; Since the 1970s, flowers for the banquet have been provided by the Italian city of [[Sanremo]] (where Nobel lived during his final years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/forsta-nobelmiddagen-for-sveriges-nye-prins_5801727.svd|title=Första nobelmiddagen för Sveriges nye prins|work=SvD.se|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are grown in the [[province of Imperia]] in the [[Liguria]] region of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/resor/besok-nobels-blommor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004211014/http://www.dn.se/resor/besok-nobels-blommor|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 October 2011|title=Besök Nobels blommor|work=DN.SE|accessdate=11 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Paganini''''' is an [[operetta]] in three acts by [[Franz Lehár]]. The German [[libretto]] was by {{ill|Paul Knepler|de}} and {{ill|Bela Jenbach|de}}.

Lehár composed the work as a vehicle for [[Richard Tauber]], the acclaimed Austrian [[tenor]], though he assumed the role (with [[Vera Schwarz]] as the princess) in Berlin on 30 January 1926, rather than the Vienna premiere which was at the Johann Strauss Theater on 30 October 1925 with {{ill|Carl Clewing|de}} in the title role. Tauber's contract with the [[Berlin State Opera]] required him to be in Stockholm at the time of the Vienna premiere. The operetta was so coolly received in Vienna that the Berlin impresario, Heinz Saltenberg, was reluctant to mount it at the {{ill|Deutsches Künstlertheater|de}} without guarantees against losses. In the event, Tauber and Schwarz made it a huge success in Berlin, where it ran for three months. It was the first Lehár operetta specially written for Tauber, who had previously appeared in the composer's ''[[Zigeunerliebe]]'' in 1920 and ''{{ill|Frasquita (operetta)|de|Frasquita|lt=Frasquita}}'' in 1922 with great success. A new production was mounted in Berlin at the [[Theater des Westens]] in April 1930, again with Tauber and Schwarz, and the composer conducting at the opening night on Easter Sunday.

An English version with lyrics by [[A. P. Herbert]] was presented by [[C. B. Cochran]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in London in May 1937, with Tauber as Paganini and [[Evelyn Laye]] as Anna Elisa. They recorded seven numbers from the show for [[Parlophone Records]], including the new number 'Fear Nothing' that Lehár had written for the London production.

In 1934 the operetta was adapted into the German film ''[[Paganini (1934 film)|Paganini]]''.

'''Photokina''' (rendered in the promoters' branding as "photokina") is a [[trade fair]] held in Europe for the [[Photography|photographic]] and [[Reprography|imaging]] industries. It is the world's largest such trade fair.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The first Photokina was held in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]], in 1950, and since 1966 it has been held biennially in September at the [[koelnmesse]] Trade Fair and Exhibition Centre in [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]]. The fair became an annual event starting in 2018, and will move to May starting in 2019.&lt;ref name=Baskin&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/news/7503898674/photokina-repositions-itself-will-become-an-annual-event |title=Photokina 'repositions' itself, will become an annual event |first=Dale |last=Baskin |publisher=''[[Digital Photography Review]]'' |date=May 23, 2017 |accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many photographic and imaging companies introduce and showcase [[state of the art]] imaging products at Photokina.

==Similar trade shows==
The show has two main competitors, both of which are annual shows held in different parts of the world. The CP+ show in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]], originally the Japan Camera Show, has been held since the early 1960s. In the [[United States|U.S.]], the main photography show is [[Photo Marketing Association|PMA@CES]], which since 2012 has coincided with the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].

The first Photokina was held in 1950 at the initiative of {{Interlanguage link multi|Bruno Uhl|de}}. U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent a greeting [[telegram]] marking the opening of Photokina in 1956.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
* The 2008 show featured 1,579 exhibitors from 46 countries and had over 169,000 visitors from 161 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photokina-cologne.com/press/_press_information.php?aktion=pfach&amp;p1id=kmpresse_photokinae&amp;format=html&amp;base=&amp;tp=k2&amp;search=&amp;pmid=kmeigen.kmpresse_1222681963&amp;start=0&amp;anzahl=10&amp;channel=kmeigen&amp;language=e&amp;archiv= photokina report 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226195218/http://www.photokina-cologne.com/press/_press_information.php?aktion=pfach&amp;p1id=kmpresse_photokinae&amp;format=html&amp;base=&amp;tp=k2&amp;search=&amp;pmid=kmeigen.kmpresse_1222681963&amp;start=0&amp;anzahl=10&amp;channel=kmeigen&amp;language=e&amp;archiv= |date=February 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2010 Photokina took place from 21 to 26 September. It featured 1,251 suppliers from 45 countries and had over 180,000 visitors from 160 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-photokina.koelnmesse.info/2010/09/schlussbericht-photokina-2010-setzt-neue-massstaebe |title=photokina report 2010 |publisher=News-photokina.koelnmesse.info |access-date=2013-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724060337/http://news-photokina.koelnmesse.info/2010/09/schlussbericht-photokina-2010-setzt-neue-massstaebe/ |archivedate=2012-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Princess Doe''' is the name given to an unidentified American homicide victim found in Cedar Ridge Cemetery in [[Blairstown Township, New Jersey|Blairstown]], New Jersey on July 15, 1982.&lt;ref name=warren&gt;{{cite web|title=Unidentified Deceased (Female)|url=http://njsp.org/miss/ui_warren_u630870962.html|publisher=Warren County Sheriff Department|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hbo/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 36UFNJ|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/36ufnj.html|publisher=The Doe Network|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallucci|first=Jaclyn|title=Identifying Princess Doe: 30 Years After She Was Slain, New Technology May ID Her and The Killer|url=http://www.archive.longislandpress.com/2012/08/02/identifying-princess-doe/|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=Long Island Press|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim was a young white female between the ages of 15 and 20, although she has also been stated to be as young as 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1982|url=http://www.missingkids.com/poster/NCMU/1102461/1#poster|website=missingkids.com|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her face had been bludgeoned beyond recognition. The approximate height of the victim was 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm) and her weight was 110&amp;nbsp;lbs (50 kg).&lt;ref name=warren/&gt; She was the first [[unidentified decedent]] to be entered in the [[National Crime Information Center]].&lt;ref name=may/&gt;

Currently, Princess Doe still remains unidentified. No arrests were ever made in the case, although a married couple have claimed responsibility for the victim's death. The Warren County Prosecutor's Office is the law enforcement agency investigating the case and still considers the case active.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; The body was buried in the Cedar Ridge Cemetery, not far from where she was discovered, in January 1983.&lt;ref name=hbo/&gt; The remains of Princess Doe were exhumed in 1999 so that samples could be collected for DNA testing, which was extracted from her femur in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tommasino|first1=John|title=Mystery body dug up to conduct DNA tests|url=http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990923/NEWS/309239986/0/SEARCH|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=Pocono Record|date=23 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was reburied in the same grave.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;

==Discovery and examination==
[[File:Princess Doe.jpg|thumb|left|Two of many previous reconstructions of Princess Doe. &lt;br&gt; However, investigators believe that the most recent rendering is the most accurate.&lt;ref name=press/&gt;]]

On the morning of July 15, 1982, gravedigger George Kise discovered the body of Princess Doe in the rear of Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown, New Jersey. The body was found lying on its back just over a steep bank that leads to a creek below. The victim's face had been beaten beyond recognition with a yet-to-be-determined object. Due to the condition of her body, her eye color could not be discerned.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;

The body was clad in a red short-sleeved shirt. A peasant-style skirt was found lying on top of the victim's legs. No undergarments were found.  Despite this, no conclusive evidence of sexual assault was found, but this was difficult to determine because of the exposure of the body. A golden cross necklace was found tangled in the victim's hair. Two earrings were found in her left ear.&lt;ref name=wnj&gt;{{cite web|title=Princess Doe: New Evidence Arises After 30 Years|url=http://www.weirdnj.com/stories/princess-doe/|website=weirdnj.com|publisher=Weird NJ|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red nail polish was found on the right hand only and she had no known surgical scars, distinct birth marks or tattoos. Scars or marks on the head/face area would not be known due to the condition of the body. The front two teeth were slightly darker than the other teeth. The victim's appendix and tonsils were intact. Forensic anthropologists determined that the victim was not pregnant and had never given birth, and was most likely between the ages of 14 and 18 years old at the time of death. Toxicology did not reveal any traces of drugs but was not entirely conclusive because of the time lapse between the death and discovery of the body. It is believed that the body was discovered after two to three days or possibly weeks of exposure. This was difficult to determine because of the hot and humid weather in the area at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Princess Doe Case Details|url=http://www.princessdoe.org/details.html|website=princessdoe.org|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination indicated that the girl had attempted to fight back or defend from her attacker, as trauma to her hands and arms was observed.&lt;ref name=wnj/&gt;

==Investigation==

===Diane Genice Dye===
For many years, Princess Doe was thought to be Diane Genice Dye, a missing teenager from [[San Jose, California]], who vanished on July 30, 1979.&lt;ref name=runaway&gt;{{cite news|title='Princess Doe' Identified as California Runaway ''[note: article's title was not accurate]''|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19850201&amp;id=kzpUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fo0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4200,40675|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=Boca Raton News|date=1 February 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diane Genice Dye|publisher=The Charley Project|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/d/dye_diane.html|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was propagated by several law enforcement officials in the state of New Jersey, who went as far as to hold a press conference identifying Diane Dye as Princess Doe. However, Lt. Eric Kranz, the Princess Doe case's original lead investigator, maintained that Diane Dye was not a viable candidate for Princess Doe's identity.&lt;ref name=is&gt;{{cite news|last=Moylan|first=Tom|title=Is 'Princess Doe' Really Diane Dye? Body Discovered In N.j. May Be Calif. Runaway|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1985-01-31/news/2460319_1_dental-records-mcginn-san-jose/2|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=The Morning Call|date=31 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kranz's feelings were shared by Diane's family and investigators in California, who were particularly incensed by the conduct of New Jersey law enforcement. In 2003, Princess Doe's DNA was compared with a DNA sample from Diane's mother Patricia, and it was conclusively determined that the Princess Doe was not Diane Dye.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequent Questions About  the Princess Doe Case|url=http://www.princessdoe.org/faq.html|publisher=Princessdoe.org|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arthur and Donna Kinlaw===
[[File:Princess Doe sketch.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Police sketch of Princess Doe after interviewing Donna Kinlaw]]
In 1999, evidence came to light that Arthur and Donna Kinlaw were responsible for Princess Doe's murder. Donna was arrested in California for attempting to commit welfare fraud by using the name "Elaina", which was traced to a Long Island native. When the police questioned her, she gave them details about the murder of "Linda" and her testimony put the Kinlaws behind bars; Donna gave details about two murders Arthur had committed, of two other females who remain unidentified today.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;&lt;ref name=wnj/&gt; After Arthur was faced with a death sentence, Donna told authorities that Kinlaw had killed another woman, a prostitute, earlier in 1982.&lt;ref name=may/&gt; She told police that she was with Arthur in the cemetery and witnessed him commit the murder.&lt;ref name=press/&gt; Another report states that Donna Kinlaw said that in July 1982, her husband brought home a teenage girl, left home and returned without her. He later apparently disposed of his clothing and cleaned his vehicle. Afterward, he threatened his wife, claiming if she did not attend her job, he would "take her life" as he did to the girl he brought home.&lt;ref name=may/&gt; However, a lack of corroboration meant that Arthur Kinlaw was not charged. Speirs stated that Kinlaw "claimed responsibility for her death. But I have no physical evidence to confirm that, and without the identity of Princess Doe, I have no way of connecting the dots so to speak, putting her in a place where he could have been or would have been at the same time."&lt;ref name=press/&gt; Spears also reported that he doubted the confession because the Kinlaws could not provide a name for Princess Doe, even though they had claimed to have been with her for a period of time. Despite that he questions the credibility of their statements, Spears does believe the victim was native to Long Island, New York.&lt;ref name=may/&gt; However, Donna Kinlaw was interviewed by a forensic artist who created a sketch of the girl she claimed to have met, which does resemble the most recent composite.&lt;ref name=jg/&gt; Arthur Kinlaw remains incarcerated for two counts of [[second-degree murder]].&lt;ref name=may/&gt;

Apart from the Kinlaws, several other suspects have been reconsidered to be involved in the case.&lt;ref name=wnj/&gt;

===Recent developments===
One theory was submitted that Princess Doe may have been a runaway and could have been an individual using false names while employed at a hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Six people have recently come forward with suspected identities of Princess Doe.&lt;ref name=wnj/&gt; In 2012, a sample of her hair and a tooth were examined through isotope analysis and indicated that the victim was most likely born in the United States. The sample of her hair indicated that she had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States. The tooth sample indicated she could possibly be from Arizona.&lt;ref name=cnn12&gt;{{cite news|last1=Randi|first1=Kaye|title=Identifying 'Princess Doe'|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/crime/2012/09/23/speirs-princess-doe.cnn|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=CNN|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that the girl had spent a long period of time in Long Island, New York.&lt;ref name=jg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallucci|first1=Jacklyn|title=Arizona, Spent Time in Long Island Area|url=http://www.archive.longislandpress.com/2012/09/24/tests-confirm-princess-doe-from-arizona-lived-on-long-island-2/|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=Long Island Press|date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rev&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillis|first1=Timothy|title=Princess Doe murder case revived with fresh leads|url=http://www.portlanddailysun.me/index.php/newsx/local-news/7790-princess-doe-murder-case-revived-with-fresh-leads|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=The Portland Sun|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing images of the girl's clothing on a newspaper, a woman reported to officials that she remembered seeing a girl wearing the same clothing as Princess Doe on July 13, 1982, just two days before her body was found. The woman claimed that she was shopping with her daughter at a store across from the cemetery and observed the victim's unique clothing. The shirt and skirt themselves were traced to a manufacturer in the Midwestern United States, although the brand labels were missing.&lt;ref name=may/&gt; Three people reported that they bought similar clothes, after viewing photos, at a Long Island store, which is now closed. It is unknown if the store was specifically located in Long Island or possibly in other locations.&lt;ref name=cnn12/&gt;&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brenzel|first1=Kathryn|title=Tests reveal new details about Princess Doe before she was murdered|url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/warren-county/express-times/index.ssf/2012/09/new_tests_reveal_new_details_a.html|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=The Express Times|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 composite of the victim also generated new tips, as it resembled several missing girls from the country.&lt;ref name=wnj/&gt;&lt;ref name=details/&gt;

==Media appearances==

[[File:Princess Doe NCMEC CT Scan Recon 001d.jpg|left|thumb|Additional composite of the victim by Carl Koppelman that also illustrates her clothing]]

===''MISSING'' (HBO Documentary)===
After extensive print media coverage in 1982, Lt. Eric Kranz, the original lead investigator from the [[Blairstown Township, New Jersey|Blairstown]] Police Department, was contacted by HBO regarding the Princess Doe case, and asked if the channel could chronicle the case in an upcoming documentary, entitled ''MISSING''. Kranz agreed, and the segment was filmed over the course of several weeks. Kranz was shown following leads as they came in, and the documentary was notable for containing actual footage of the recovery of Princess Doe's body, along with footage shot by HBO of Princess Doe's 1983 funeral. The documentary also contained a segment following the [[Johnny Gosch]] disappearance.&lt;ref name=wnj/&gt;

Lt. Kranz, now retired, coined the name, "Princess Doe" early in the investigation and also managed to get the case covered extensively in the media.&lt;ref name=hbo&gt;''Princess Doe''. HBO. Blairstown, New Jersey, 1983. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was used as the impetus for recording unidentified crime victims in the [[NCIC]] database at the national level. Princess Doe became the first such case entered by the FBI director.

===''MTV's Fear''===
A season one episode of ''[[MTV's Fear]]'', a paranormal reality television show, featured a completely fictionalized account of the Princess Doe murder. In the episode, airing in 2000, Princess Doe was portrayed as the victim of a cult sacrifice.&lt;ref name=fear&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp Spirit Lake|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrLq0Jf2lBc|publisher=MTV|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers were told that Princess Doe was found decapitated and missing her hands on the grounds of "Camp Spirit Lake", a fictionalized version of Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco, which is located in Hardwick Township, New Jersey. Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco is notable for having been the filming location of the first ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' film, which Lt. Eric Kranz appeared in two years before the discovery of Princess Doe's body.

The "Princess Doe" portrayed in this episode bears no resemblance to the actual murder victim. The episode's version of the Princess Doe case resembles the unsolved murder of Rosa Delgado, who was found missing her head and hands in Warren County, New Jersey in November 1997.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosa Marie Camacho|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/c/camacho_rosa.htm|publisher=The Charley Project|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=20 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The occult aspects presented in this episode appear to be based on notable supposed cult killings in New Jersey, such as the 1972 death of [[Jeannette DePalma]], a teenaged resident of suburban [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield]] whose body was found allegedly surrounded by "occult symbols".&lt;ref name=fear/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unsolved Case of Jeannette DePalma|url=http://weirdnj.com/stories/mystery-history/jeannette-depalma/|publisher=Weird NJ magazine|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous===
The case was featured on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' in 2012 in hopes to generate new information in the case.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

The same year, the most recent reconstruction was broadcast on CNN.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|title=New image could help solve 30-year-old cold case|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlIr5rWXx_w|newspaper=CNN News|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial and memorials==
Princess Doe was buried on January 22, 1983 after she had remained unidentified for over five months. Funds were donated for a coffin and headstone for the victim.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;
 
On July 15, 2012, a  memorial service was held for the 30th anniversary of Princess Doe being discovered, at the top of the ravine where her remains were found. Over 100 citizens attended as well as several reporters and cameras. The victim's clothing as well as her reconstructions were displayed for public viewing.&lt;ref name=may&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallucci|first1=Jacklyn|title=Identifying Princess Doe: 30 Years After She Was Slain, New Technology May ID Her and The Killer|url=http://www.archive.longislandpress.com/2012/08/02/identifying-princess-doe/|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=Long Island Press|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act''''' (S.C. 2014, c. 31) was introduced by the Conservative government of Stephen Harper on November 20, 2013, during the 41st Parliament, and received royal assent on December 9, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = LEGISinfo - House Government Bill C-13 (41-2)|url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=6301394&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1|website = www.parl.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly known as "lawful access" legislation, the Act is the fifth iteration of a framework that empowers Canadian law enforcement and security intelligence agencies and the product of four previous attempts made by both Liberal and Conservative governments.

==Objective==
The Act was intended to address the problem of [[cyberbullying]], which had received a high profile from the cases involving the deaths of [[Suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons|Rehtaeh Parsons]] and [[Suicide of Amanda Todd|Amanda Todd]].{{sfn|Nicol|Valiquet|2014|p=2}} It incorporated recommendations concerning cyberbullying and the distribution of intimate images that were made in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CCSO Cybercrime Working Group: Cyberbullying and the Non-consensual Distribution of Intimate Images |url = http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/cndii-cdncii/pdf/cndii-cdncii-eng.pdf|isbn= 978-1-100-23118-1|date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for public safety.{{sfn|Nicol|Valiquet|2014|p=3}} It also serves to implement obligations arising from Canada's accession to the ''[[Convention on Cybercrime]]'' in 2001.{{sfn|Nicol|Valiquet|2014|p=3}}

== Controversy ==
Critics have argued Bill C-13 capitalized on the recent tragedies and deaths of Rehtaeh Parsons and Amanda Todd. MP Claude Gravelle, noted in House of Commons debates: "the Conservatives decided to include things that have nothing to do with cyberbullying. For example, there is a subclause on terrorists and something else on people who steal cable television signals, which has absolutely nothing to do with cyberbullying".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 026 (Official Version)|url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=6346916|website = www.parl.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Senator Mobina Jaffer argued in debates of the Senate, "Amanda Todd's and Rehtaeh Parsons’ lives would have been no different if this bill had been enacted earlier".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/sen/Y3-412-93-eng.pdf|title = |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation will make it illegal to distribute images of a person, in any way without their consent. It is said this could also violate people's privacy by giving authorities more power to watch what they are doing online. Police now only need "reasonable grounds for suspicion" to get a warrant.&lt;ref&gt;Puzic, Sonja."Anti-Cyberbullying Law, Bill C-13, Now in Effect." ''CTV News''. Web. 31 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These warrants can now include allowing police to access online data, phone records and digital tracking. "The bill also grants immunity to telecoms that voluntarily hand over data, a sticking point raising privacy concerns."&lt;ref&gt;Southey, Tabatha. "Bill C-13 Is About a Lot More Than Cyberbullying." ''The Globe and Mail''. 6 Dec. 2013. Web. 31 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "Critics have warned the bill's thresholds for warrants are too low and that the cyber bullying law is too broad and vague."&lt;ref&gt;"Critics have warned the bill's thresholds for warrants are too low and that the cyberbullying law is too broad and vague."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative history ==
This bill was proposed four times previously, making Bill C-13 the fifth iteration of "Lawful Access" proposals introduced into Canadian Parliament. Liberal and Conservative governments have each attempted to introduce lawful access.{{citation needed|date= September 2015}}

=== First attempt: Bill C-74 (2005)===
Lawful access was first proposed under Bill C-74 (short titled the [[Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act]]) by Former Liberal Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] on November 15, 2005 but did not advance passed its first reading in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] as his Parliament was dissolved on November 28, 2005.&lt;ref name="ParlInfo"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bill C-74: Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act (LS-519E)|url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?lang=F&amp;ls=c74&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1&amp;source=library_prb|website = www.parl.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second attempt: Bill C-46 and Bill C-47 (2009)===
On June 18, 2009, Stephen Harper's Conservative government proposed two lawful access frameworks, Bill C-46 (short titled ''Investigative Powers for the 21st Century Act'') and Bill C-47 (short titled ''Technical Assistance for Law Enforcement in the 21st Century Act'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/LegislativeSummaries/41/1/c30-e.pdf|title = Library of Parliament|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These two policy proposals failed to advance beyond the House of Commons, as Stephen Harper prorogued Parliament on December 30, 2009, which was the second time within less 400 days (the first being on December 4, 2008).

=== Third attempt: Bill C-50, Bill C-51 and Bill C-52 (2010)===
Following the Conservative's first failed attempt to introduce lawful access, Stephen Harper's government introduced three bills concurrently at the end of 2010: Bill C-50 (short titled ''Improving Access to Investigative Tools for Serious Crimes Act''), Bill C-51 (short titled ''Investigative Powers for the 21st Century Act'') and Bill C-52 (short titled ''Investigating and Preventing Criminal Electronic Communications Act'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lawful Access Take 2 (Bills C-50, C-51 &amp; C-52  (Winter 2010) {{!}} Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic (CIPPIC)|url = https://cippic.ca/en/node/129173|website = cippic.ca|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three policy proposals failed to advance as the Conservatives were defeated by a motion of non-confidence vote on March 25, 2011. This resulted in a federal election held later that year on May 2, 2011, which resulted in a Conservative majority government.

=== Fourth attempt: Bill C-30 (2012)===
After the Conservative's second failed attempt, Harper's Conservatives introduced Bill C-30 (short titled the [[Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act]]) on February 14, 2012. Bill C-30 was originally titled "Lawful Access Act" and tabled by Former Public Safety Minister, [[Vic Toews]], but was withdrawn from the House of Commons and resubmitted one hour later under the new title, "Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vic Toews will 'entertain amendments' to online surveillance bill|url = http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/protecting-children-from-internet-predators-act-vic-toews|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill C-30 was renamed at the very last minute "even though the bill actually made no reference to child predators except in its title".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transparent Lives: Surveillance in Canada|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bWD7AwAAQBAJ|publisher = Athabasca University Press|date = 2014-04-01|isbn = 9781927356777|first = Colin J.|last = Bennett|first2 = Kevin D.|last2 = Haggerty|first3 = David|last3 = Lyon|first4 = Valerie|last4 = Steeves}}&lt;/ref&gt; If passed, Bill C-30 would have granted law enforcement and security intelligence agencies with expanded surveillance powers, mandated internet service providers (ISPs) to disclose Canadian subscriber information (such as metadata) without a warrant and compelled ISPs to reveal information transmitted over their networks without a warrant or judicial oversight. When criticized by Members of Parliament about privacy concerns and civil liberty issues, Vic Toews responded that Canadians "can either stand with us or with the child pornographers" on February 13, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 079 (Official Version)|url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=41&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=5380035#Para2686364|website = www.parl.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, on February 14, 2012, Vic Toews lied to Canadians on national television on CTV News and denied that he ever made these comments, calling it "a far crime from that".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3YdzXGnv1g|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In protest against Vic Toews, the hacktivist collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] targeted him to expose his hypocrisy and revealed that he was having an affair to highlight the dangers of anyone having warrantless access to Canadians' digital lives.&lt;ref name="news.nationalpost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anonymous revives Vikileaks, targets Vic Toews over online surveillance bill|url = http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/vic-toews-anonymous-hackers|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hacktivist collective declared, "Anonymous will not allow a politician who allows his citizens no secrets to have any secrets of his own" on a video uploaded to YouTube.&lt;ref name="news.nationalpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyOQFYeBIho|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill C-30 was ultimately abandoned and Former Conservative Justice Minister, [[Rob Nicholson]], promised Canadians that future attempts to introduce lawful access "will not contain the measures contained in C-30" on February 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lawful Access is Dead (For Now): Government Kills Bill C-30 - Michael Geist|url = http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2013/02/bill-c-30-dead/|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this declaration, the Conservatives introduced Bill C-13 on November 20, 2013, which was the fifth iteration for the bill.&lt;ref name="ParlInfo"/&gt;

The '''Rey de Reyes 2002''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "King of Kings") was the sixth annual [[Rey de Reyes]] [[professional wrestling]] tournament and show, produced by the Mexican [[wrestling promotion]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The event took place on March 17, 2002, in [[Zapopan]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]. The tournament consisted of a semi-final round of four four-man elimination matches and a final match with the winners of each of the semi-finals facing off in an elimination match until only one man remained. The final of the 2002 tournament pitted [[Canek (wrestler)|Canek]], [[Pirata Morgan]], [[Cibernético]] and [[Octagón]] against each other. The show featured two additional matches beyond the five tournament matches.

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious 'ey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt;  The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 show was the sixth Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured five [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

[[Toronto]], Canada's '''Festival of Fear''' is an annual multigenre fan convention that runs as part of [[Fan Expo Canada]]. It was founded as the '''Canadian National Horror Expo''' in 2004 by ''[[Rue Morgue Magazine]]'' and Hobby Star Marketing Inc. It is traditionally a three-day event (Friday through Sunday) typically held the weekend before [[Labour Day]] during the summer in [[Toronto]], Canada, at the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]]. Since 2011 it has become a four-day-long event.

Originally showcasing novels, fantasy, film, television and related popular arts, the convention has expanded over the years to include a larger range of [[popular culture|pop culture]] elements, such as [[Horror and terror|horror]], [[anime]], [[manga]], [[animation]], [[toy]]s, [[collectible card game]]s, [[video game]]s and web entertainment. The convention is the largest of its kind in Canada and among the largest in world, filling the entire south building of the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] with over 91,000 attendees in 2012.

Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with industry professionals, there are previews of upcoming feature films, [[video game]] companies, and evening events such as The Masquerade; a costume contest, and other social receptions.

Typically there are over 175 hours of programming on all aspects of pop culture over the weekend.

The festival of '''San Fermín''' is a week-long, historically rooted celebration held annually in the city of [[Pamplona]], [[Navarra ]], [[Spain]]. 
The celebrations start at noon on the sixth of July, when the party starts with the setting off the pyrotechnic ''chupinazo'',{{efn|The ceremony, which dates to the beginning of the twentieth century, has been accompanied by ever-greater ceremony and is now televised all over the world. ([[:es:Chupinazo|Spanish Wikipedia:"Chupinazo"]]).}} and continue until midnight, on the fourteenth of July, with the singing of the ''Pobre de Mí''. While its most famous event is the encierro, or [[Running of the Bulls|the running of the bulls]], at 8:00 AM from July 7 to 14, the festival involves many other traditional and [[folklore|folkloric]] events. It is known locally as ''Sanfermines'' and is held in honor of [[Saint Fermin]], the co-patron of Navarre. Its events were central to the plot of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', by [[Ernest Hemingway]], which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. It has become probably the most internationally renowned [[festival|fiesta]] in Spain. Over 1,000,000 people come to participate in this festival.

==History==
===Saint Fermín===
[[Fermin|Fermín]] is said to have been the son of a [[Ancient rome|Roman]] of [[Senate of the Roman Republic|senatorial]] rank in Pamplona in the 3rd century, who was converted to [[Christianity]] by [[Saint Honestus]], a disciple of [[Saturnin|Saint Saturninus]]. According to tradition, he was baptised by Saturninus (in Navarre also known as Saint Cernin) at the spot now known as the "Small Well of Saint Cernin"{{efn|In Spanish: ''Pocico de San Cernin''}}&lt;ref name="Hist_Saint"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es/eng/propuestas/san-fermines/desarrollo/santo.htm |title=History of... The saint-Saint San Fermin festival- Sanfermines-tourist information of Navarre |date= |publisher=Government of Navarre|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermín was ordained a priest in Toulouse, and returned to Pamplona as its first bishop. On a later preaching voyage, Fermín was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] in [[Amiens]], France; and is now considered a [[martyr]] in the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="Hist_Saint"/&gt; It is believed he died on September 25, AD 303. There is no written record of veneration of the Saint in Pamplona until the 12th century. Saint Fermín, as well as Saint [[Francis Xavier]], are now the two [[Patron saint|patrons]] of Navarre.&lt;ref name="Hist_Saint"/&gt; In Pamplona, Saint Fermín is now sometimes said to have met his end by being dragged through the streets with angry bulls running after him, hence the tradition.

[[File:Escultura sanfermines.jpg|thumb|Statues dedicated to Sanfermines festival, in Pamplona]]
The celebration of the festival has its origin in the combination of two different medieval events.&lt;ref name="Hist_fiesta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es/eng/propuestas/san-fermines/desarrollo/fiesta.htm |title=History of... The fiesta of San Fermín Saint San Fermin festival- Sanfermines-tourist information on Navarre |date= |publisher=Government of Navarre|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial secular fairs were held at the beginning of the summer. As cattle merchants came into town with their animals, eventually [[bullfighting]] came to be organized as a part of the tradition.&lt;ref name="Hist_fiesta"/&gt; Specifically, they were first documented in the 14th century. On the other hand, religious ceremonies honoring the saint were held on October 10.&lt;ref name="Hist_fiesta"/&gt; However, in 1591 they were transferred to July 7 to take place at the same time as the fair, when Pamplona's weather is better.&lt;ref name="Hist_fiesta"/&gt; This is considered to be the beginning of the Sanfermines. During medieval times acts included an opening speech, musicians, tournaments, theatre, bullfights, dances or even fireworks.&lt;ref name="Hist_fiesta"/&gt; [[Running of the Bulls|Bullrunning]] appears in 17th and 18th century chronicles together with the presence of foreigners and the first concerns about the excessive drinking and dissolute behavior during the event.&lt;ref name="Hist_fiesta"/&gt; Finally, the Parade of Giants{{efn|In Spanish: ''Comparsa de Gigantes y Cabezudos''.}} was created in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Hist_fiesta"/&gt; The first official [[bullring]] was constructed in 1844.
===Modern times===
[[File:Hemingway monument.jpg|thumb|Monument to Hemingway outside the bullring in Pamplona.]]

The worldwide fame of the modern festival, and the great number of foreign visitors it receives every year, are closely related to the description in [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s book [[The Sun Also Rises]]{{efn|Also known as ''Fiesta'', which in Spanish means ''party'' or ''carnival''}} and the reports he made as a journalist.&lt;ref name="Hist_hemingway"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es/eng/propuestas/san-fermines/desarrollo/hemingway.htm|title=History of... Ernest Hemingway-Saint San Fermin festival- Sanfermines-tourist information on Navarre |date= |publisher=Navarre tourist office|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fascinated when he first visited in 1923, and returned many times until 1959.&lt;ref name="Hist_hemingway"/&gt; Hemingway was also deeply fond of bullrunnings and bullfights, but he did not participate in the running. Different city locations  such as ''La Perla Hotel''&lt;ref name="Hist_hemingway"/&gt; or the ''Iruña Café'' are famous in part due to the fact that the writer used to visit them. Another famous American author, [[James A. Michener|James Michener]], wrote extensively about the festival and bullfighting in his non-fiction book ''[[Iberia (book)|Iberia]]''. His writing explained the art and business of bullfighting with tremendous 'gracia' by explaining the importance of 'pundonor'.

===Old times===

The San Fermín Festival of the past was not like it is today: it has changed gradually both for better and for worse. Originally most of the youth looked forward to the festivities all year, saving money until they had at least fifty pesetas, the minimum necessary to watch the running of the bulls, have a snack and wine, eat lunch and dinner out, and eat churros with brandy a couple of times each San Fermín day.{{what|date=July 2016}}

After the religious function, the group formed by the Authorities and village, they came back to the Home of “the town”, at about 90 minutes after leaving it. Then was effectuated the move, to contemplate the bulls that while they were waiting to move, they grazed in the grove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanfermin.com/history/old-times/|title=Old Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=mysanfermin.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{what|date=July 2016}}

==Single day events==

===Chupinazo===
[[File:Chupinazo1.jpg|thumb|right|Chupinazo]]
The opening of the festival is marked by setting off the pyrotechnic ''chupinazo'' (or ''txupinazo'' in [[Basque language]]). The rocket is launched at 12:00 noon on July 6 from a city hall balcony with thousands of people celebrating the act in the city hall square and other locations in Pamplona.&lt;ref name="chupinazo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navarra.com/english/sanfermin/chupinazo.htm |title=The Sanfermines: the "chupinazo" |date= |publisher=navarra.com |accessdate=September 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518054720/http://www.navarra.com/english/sanfermin/chupinazo.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chupinazo has officially marked the beginning of the fiesta since 1941. The person who sets it off is decided by the city mayor.&lt;ref name="chupinazo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/historia/txupinazo/historia-del-txupinazo-hasta-1979|title=History of the txupinazo to 1980|date=|publisher=Kukuxumuxu S.L.|accessdate=July 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712042851/http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/historia/txupinazo/historia-del-txupinazo-hasta-1979|archivedate=July 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, since 1979 tradition has been that each year after city elections the chupinazo is set off by a person from the different city council political groups beginning with the mayor and then political groups ordered by number of representatives.&lt;ref name="chupinazo3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/historia/txupinazo/historia-del-txupinazo-desde-1979|title=History of the txupinazo from 1979|date=|publisher=Kukuxumuxu S.L.|accessdate=July 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712040913/http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/historia/txupinazo/historia-del-txupinazo-desde-1979|archivedate=July 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been exceptions to this tradition with some non-politicians being in charge of the act when they had performed significant achievements during the year. Examples of these exceptions were a player of the [[Osasuna|local soccer team]], or the president of the "giants and big-heads" group in its 150 years anniversary.&lt;ref name="chupinazo4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/historia/txupinazo/lanzadores-deportistas|title=A "Sporty" exception to the politicians|date=|publisher=Kukuxumuxu S.L.|accessdate=July 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712040434/http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/historia/txupinazo/lanzadores-deportistas|archivedate=July 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chupinazo5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodenavarra.es/20100706/sanfermin/chupinazo-gigante.html?not=2010070601565999&amp;idnot=2010070601565999&amp;dia=20100706&amp;seccion=sanfermin&amp;seccion2=calle&amp;chnl=50 |title=Entrevista a Jose Mari Ganuza |date=July 6, 2010 |author=A.

===Riau-Riau===
The ''Riau-Riau'' was a mass activity held on July 6. The members of the city council parade from the City Hall to a nearby chapel dedicated to Saint Fermín with participants dancing to the ''Astrain [[Waltz]]'' along the way.&lt;ref name="ABC_history"/&gt; The ritual was introduced in 1911 by [[Ignacio Baleztena Ascárate]].&lt;ref name="ABC_history"/&gt;  The procession was  removed from the festival calendar in 1992 for the sake of public order, as political activists used the "Riau-Riau" to promote clashes with authorities. Protesting youths would often block the way and it often took up to five hours for the city councilors to walk the 500 meters to the Saint Fermin chapel. Nevertheless, in recent years it has been held unofficially without the participation of the members of the city council. In 1996 and 2012 there were two failed attempts to restore the original act with the participation of the city council, both of them being cancelled due to the violent clashes with some participants.&lt;ref name="riau-riau-2012"&gt;{{cite news |title= El Riau-Riau tendrá que esperar|author=Miren Imaz |url=http://www.diariovasco.com/v/20120707/al-dia-sociedad/riau-riau-tendra-esperar-20120707.html |newspaper=[[Diario Vasco]] |date=July 7, 2012 |accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Fermin procession===
The key day of the festival is July 7, when thousands of people accompany the 15th-century statue of [[Saint Fermin]] through the old part of Pamplona. The statue is accompanied by dancers and street entertainers, and different political and religious authorities including the city mayor.&lt;ref name="statue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es/eng/organice-viaje/recurso.aspx?o=3003 |title=Chapel of Saint Fermin-tourist information of Navarre |date= |publisher=Government of Navarre|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During procession a [[Jota (music)|Jota]] (an ancient traditional dance) is performed for the saint, a rose is offered in the Saint Fernin well, and the "gigantes" (enormous wood-framed and papier-mâché puppet figures managed from inside) dance and twirl while the cathedral bell named María (Mary) peals.&lt;ref name="procession"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pamplona.es/verPagina.asp?idPag=28041PR&amp;idioma=1|title=San Fermín 2012 – La Procesión|date=|publisher=Council of Pamplona|accessdate=July 9, 2012|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630051511/http://www.pamplona.es/VerPagina.asp?idPag=28041PR&amp;idioma=1|archivedate=June 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Struendo===
"El Struendo" ("The Roar"{{efn|In Spanish the correct spelling would be "Estruendo", however the name of the act is intentionally misspelled.}}) is a single day event with more than 50 years of tradition. It has  been purposely left outside the official program and each year is celebrated on a different day, usually on a weekday so as to keep the crowds manageable. People gather at 11:59 pm at the Town Hall and make as much noise as possible for several hours mainly with drums but also bowls, whistles or any other objects.&lt;ref name="ABC_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riau riau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/la-fiesta/otros-ritos/struendo-de-iruna/|title=The "Struendo"|date=|publisher=Kukuxumuxu S.L.|accessdate=July 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710121037/http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/la-fiesta/otros-ritos/struendo-de-iruna|archivedate=July 10, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pobre de mí===
After nine days of partying, the people of Pamplona meet in the City Hall Plaza at midnight on July 14, singing the traditional mournful notes of the ''Pobre de Mí'' ('Poor Me'), in a candlelit ending. The city mayor closes the festival with participants lighting a candle and removing their red handkerchief as the song is played by the local band, followed by a fireworks display at the city hall. This closing ceremony tradition started out in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="ABC_history"/&gt;

[[File:Encierro 7 de julio de 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Running of the bulls]]
The [[running of the bulls]] (In Spanish ''encierro or los toros de san Fermin''{{efn|from the verb encerrar, to lock/shut up}}) involves hundreds of people running in front of six bulls and another six steers down an 825-meter (0.51 mile) stretch of narrow streets of a section of the old town of Pamplona. The run ends in the [[Plaza de Toros de Pamplona|Pamplona's bullring]] taking a mean time of around 3 minutes where the bulls would be held until the afternoon's bullfight when they would be killed. Bullruns are held between July 7 and 14 and a different "encaste" (sub-breed) of bull appears each day.

The event begins at 8 a.m. when a first [[firecracker]] is lit to announce the release of the bulls from their corral. Before the year 1924 it started at 6 and at 7 between 1924 and 1974.&lt;ref name="ABC_history"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.es/20120709/local-navarra/abci-nacieron-sanfermines-201207091210.html| title=Así nacieron los sanfermines| author= M. Arrizabalaga | date=July 10, 2012 | newspaper=ABC| language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Runners gather earlier at the beginning of the itinerary to ask for the protection of the Saint by singing a chant three times before a small statue of San Fermín which has been placed in a raised niche in a wall: “''To San Fermin we ask to be our patron saint and  to guide us in '''the running of the bulls''', giving to us his blessing''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanfermin.com/bulls/running-of-the-bulls/|title=Running of the Bulls - MySanFermin.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second cracker signals that the last bull has left the corral. There are six fighting bulls accompanied by six [[ox]]en (often white and brown colored) that guide them to the "plaza" and followed by three more not fighting oxen. There are also some shepherds guiding the bulls, wearing green T-shirts and holding long poles.  Once all of the bulls have entered the arena, a third rocket is released while a fourth firecracker indicates that the bulls are in their bullpens and the run has concluded. After the end of the run young cows with wrapped horns{{efn|In Spanish: ''Vaquillas enboladas''.}} are released in the bullring and toss the participants, to the amusement of the crowd.

The circuit has only changed slightly since 1852 as the former bullring was located close to the present one. Before that date the bullrunning ended in the "castle plaza", still not far from the present bullring.&lt;ref name="ABC_history"/&gt; While the origin of this tradition was the necessity to move the bulls from outside the city to the bullring for the bullfight it is not clear when citizens began to run in front of them. There are written records in 1787 that the tradition was already well established with no memory of its beginning.&lt;ref name="ABC_history"/&gt; The tradition of singing for protection to the saint dates back to 1962.&lt;ref name="ABC_history"/&gt;

The event is dangerous. Since 1925, 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/07/i_was_gored_by_a_bull.html |title=I Was Gored by a Bull.

===Giants and big-heads parade===
[[File:Comparsa pamplona jorge urdanoz.jpg|thumb|right|Pamplona's Giants and Big-heads parade family photo. From back to front and left to right we can see the American, Asian, African and European pairs of giants (last row), the six ''kilikis'' and the 5 big-heads (second row), the ''zaldikos'', and members of the parade who carry the figures (front row).]]
Every day, during the morning, there is a parade of ''[[gigantes y cabezudos]]'' (English: "giants and big-heads", respectively), with the giant figures being more than 150 years old. The eight giant figures were built by Tadeo Amorena, a painter from Pamplona, in 1860, and represent four pairs of kings and queens of four different races and places (Europe, Asia, America and Africa). Their height is around {{convert|4|meters|feet}} each, and they are carried by a dancer inside a wooden structure. During the parade, giants dance following the rhythm of traditional music. The remaining 17 figures include 6 ''kilikis'', 5 big-heads, and 6 ''zaldikos'', built at different times between 1860 and 1941. ''Kilikis'' and big-heads are caricaturesque, but human-like figures that are carried as helmets. Big-heads masks are up to {{convert|1|meters|feet}} tall, and ''kilikis'' slightly smaller. While big-heads simply precede the giants and wave their hands at spectators, ''kilikis'' run after children, hitting them with a [[foam]] truncheon. ''Zaldikos'', figures representing horses with their riders, also run after children with a truncheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historias del viejo Pamplona |author=Juan José Martirena Ruíz|year=2001 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Pamplona |location=Pamplona |isbn=84-89590-90-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gigantes de Navarra |author=Unai Lako, Aitor Calleja |year= 2010|publisher=EGN |location=Pamplona |isbn=978-84-937633-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional sports===
There are exhibitions and competitions of [[Basque rural sports]] every morning in the "Plaza de los Fueros", a square close to the city citadel, although they were formerly held in the bullring.&lt;ref name="rural"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanfermines.net/ingles/que_hacer_y_ver.php|title=Rural Sports|date= |work=Sanfermines.net|publisher=Asociación de empresarios de hostelería de Navarra (Businessmen association of hotel and bar's industry of Navarre)|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports include [[Harrijasotzaileak|stone lifting]], [[Aizkolaritza|wood cutting]], or [[hay bale]] lifting.&lt;ref name="rural"/&gt; On the other hand, the [[Jai alai]] tournament of Sanfermin is a prestigious competition of this variety of [[basque pelota]]. It is held in one of the [[Fronton (court)|courts]] of the city.&lt;ref name="rural"/&gt; Betting is common during these events.&lt;ref name="rural"/&gt;

===Bullfight===
Every afternoon from July 7 to 14 there is a [[bullfight]] in which the 6 bulls that have been driven to the bullring during the bullrunning of that day are killed. It begins at 6pm.&lt;ref name="The corrida"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es/eng/propuestas/san-fermines/desarrollo/corrida.htm|title=The bulls... The corrida-San Fermin|date= |publisher=Oficina de turismo de Navarra (Navarre tourist office)|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the 5th bullfight with younger bulls and not fully trained bullfighters is performed while the 6th features bullfighters on horses (in Spanish "rejoneo"). While the bullring of the city is the fourth largest in size{{Clarification|is this attendance capacity or area|date=June 2018}} in the world, it is full every afternoon and tickets are hard to find.&lt;ref name="The corrida"/&gt;

===Fireworks===
Every night at 23:00, a [[firework]] spectacle is held at the [[citadel]] park. Fireworks spectacles have been known to occur in Sanfermin as far back as 1595. Since the year 2000 an international fireworks contest is held.&lt;ref name="fireworks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanfermines.net/ingles/fuegos.php|title=Fireworks|date= |work=Sanfermines.net|publisher=Asociación de empresarios de hostelería de Navarra (Businessmen association of hotel and bar's industry of Navarre)|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people watch them seated on the grass around the citadel.&lt;ref name="fireworks"/&gt;

'''Solar Orbiter''' ('''SolO''') is a planned [[Sun]]-observing [[satellite]], under development by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). The mission will be launched with an [[Atlas V]] from the [[Cape Canaveral AFS]] in [[Florida]] in 2020.&lt;ref name=esa-solar-orbiter /&gt; SolO is intended to perform detailed measurements of the inner [[heliosphere]] and nascent [[solar wind]], and perform close observations of the polar regions of the Sun, which is difficult to do from [[Earth]], both serving to answer the question 'How does the Sun create and control the heliosphere?'

The Solar Orbiter will make observations of the Sun from an eccentric orbit moving as close as ~60 [[solar radius|solar radii (R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)]], or 0.284 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), placing it inside [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s perihelion of 0.3075 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kis.uni-freiburg.de/index.php?id=58&amp;L=1|title=Kiepenheuer-Institut fuer Sonnenphysik: SolarOrbiter PHI-ISS|website=Kis.uni-freiburg.de|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the planned 7 year mission the orbital inclination will be raised to about 25°.&lt;ref name=ESA181/&gt;

==Scientific objectives==
The spacecraft will make a close approach to the [[Sun]] every five months. The closest approach will be positioned to allow a repeated study of the same region of the solar atmosphere.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Solar Orbiter will be able to watch magnetic activity building up in the atmosphere that can lead to powerful [[solar flare]]s or eruptions.

Researchers will also have the chance to co-ordinate observations with NASA's ''[[Parker Solar Probe]]'' mission (2018 - 2025) which will make in situ measurements in the Sun's extended [[corona]].

The objective of the mission is to perform close-up, high-resolution studies of the Sun and its inner [[heliosphere]]. The new understanding will help answer these questions:

* How and where do the [[solar wind]] plasma and [[Sun#Magnetic field|magnetic field]] originate in the [[corona]]?
* How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability?
* How do solar eruptions produce [[Solar energetic particles|energetic particle]] radiation that fills the heliosphere?
* How does the [[solar dynamo]] work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere?

=== Trajectory ===
After launch, the Orbiter will take approximately 3.5 years, using repeated gravity assists from Earth and Venus, to reach its operational orbit, an elliptical orbit with perihelion 0.28 AU and aphelion 0.9 AU. Over the expected mission duration of 7 years, it will use additional gravity assists from Venus to raise its inclination from 0° to 25°, allowing it a better view of the Sun's poles. If an extended mission is approved, the inclination could rise further to 34°.&lt;ref name=ESA181&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/solar-orbiter/44181-mission-operations/ |title=ESA Science &amp; Technology: Mission Operations |website=Sci.esa.int |date=13 April 2015 | access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESA168&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/solar-orbiter/51168-summary/ |title=ESA Science &amp; Technology: Summar|website=Sci.esa.inty |date=28 February 2018 | access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South African Formula Atlantic Championship''', was a [[Formula Atlantic]] [[auto racing|motor racing]] championship held in [[South Africa]] between 1976 and 1979, including a race in [[Rhodesia]] during the 1976 (Non-Championship race) and 1977 seasons.

The final season ran between 1978 and 1979, starting just 5 months after the end of the 1978 season, and it was the longest season of the entire series, running from October 1978 to December 1979. 

The championship was dominated by [[Ian Scheckter]] and March as Scheckter drove a March chassis to each of the four drivers' championships.

The '''Soviet evacuation of Tallinn''', also called '''Tallinn disaster''' or '''Russian [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]''', was a Soviet operation to evacuate the 190 ships of the [[Baltic Fleet]], units of the [[Red Army]], and pro-Soviet civilians from the fleet's encircled main base of [[Tallinn]] in [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Soviet-occupied]] [[Estonia]] during August 1941.&lt;ref name=siege&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MglnqQn7_8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Harrison E. Salisbury|year=2003|title=The 900 Days: The siege of Leningrad|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|chapter=Tallinn disaster; Russian Dunkirk|pages=221–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet forces had occupied Estonia in June 1940. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] began on 22 June 1941, German forces advanced rapidly through the [[Soviet occupation of Baltic states|Soviet-occupied Baltic states]], and by the end of August the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian]] capital of Tallinn was surrounded by German forces, while a large part of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet was bottled up in Tallinn harbour.

In expectation of a Soviet breakout, the [[Kriegsmarine]] and the [[Finnish Navy]] had started on 8 August 1941 to lay [[naval mines|minefields]] off Cape [[Juminda]] on the  [[Lahemaa]] coast. While Soviet minesweepers tried to clear a path for convoys through the minefields, German coastal artillery installed a battery of {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} guns near Cape Juminda and the Finnish navy gathered their 2nd [[Motor Torpedo Boat]] Flotilla with [[VMV class patrol boat|patrol boats]] VMV9, VMV10, VMV11 and VMV17. At the same time the German 3. Schnellbootflottille with [[E-boat]]s S-26, S-27, S-39, S-40 and S-101 was concentrated at [[Suomenlinna]] outside [[Helsinki]]. German [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers from Kampfgruppe 806 based on airfields in Estonia were put on alert. On 19 August the final German assault on Tallinn began.
 
During the night of 27/28 August 1941 the Soviet [[10th Rifle Corps (Soviet)|10th Rifle Corps]] disengaged from the enemy and boarded transports in Tallinn.

The embarkation was protected by smoke screens, however, the mine-sweeping in the days before the evacuation began was ineffective due to bad weather, and there were no Soviet aircraft available for protecting the embarkation. This, together with heavy German shelling and aerial bombardment killed at least 1,000 of the evacuees in the harbor.

==Gauntlet in the Gulf of Finland==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-0154, Reval, Hafen.jpg|right|thumb|225px|The Port of Tallinn on 1 September 1941 after having been seized by Germans]]

Twenty large transports, eight auxiliary ships, nine small transports, a tanker, a tug, and a tender were organized into four convoys, protected by the [[Soviet cruiser Kirov|Soviet cruiser ''Kirov'']], with Admiral [[Vladimir Tributs]] on board, two flotilla leaders, nine destroyers, three torpedo boats, twelve submarines, ten modern and fifteen obsolete minehunters, 22 minesweepers, 21 submarine chasers, three gun boats, a minelayer, thirteen patrol vessels and eleven torpedo boats.&lt;ref name="Sea Power"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Rohwer|editor-first=J.|title=Seemacht.

On 28 August [[KG 77]] and KGr 806 sank the 2,026 grt steamer ''Vironia'', the 2,317 grt ''Lucerne'', the 1,423 grt ''Atis Kronvalds'' and the 2,250 grt ice breaker ''Krisjanis Valdemars''. The rest of the Soviet fleet were forced to change course. This took them through a heavily mined area. As a result, 21 Soviet warships, including five destroyers, struck mines and sank. On 29 August, the Luftwaffe, now reinforced with [[KG 76]], [[KG 4]] and [[KG 1]], accounted for the transport ships ''Vtoraya Pyatiletka'' (3,974 grt), ''Kalpaks'' (2,190 grt) and ''Leningradsovet'' (1,270 grt) sunk. In addition, the ships ''Ivan Papanin'', ''Saule'', ''Kazakhstan'' and the ''Serp i Molot'' were damaged by I./[[KG 4]], which also sank three more. Some 5,000 Soviet soldiers died.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström 2007a, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that evening the armada was attacked by Finnish and German torpedo boats, and the chaotic situation made organized mine sweeping impossible. Darkness fell at 22:00 and the Soviet armada stopped and anchored at midnight in the heavily mined water.

Early on 29 August Ju 88 bombers attacked the remains of the convoys off [[Suursaari]], sinking two transports. Meanwhile, the undamaged ships made best speed to reach the safety of the [[Kronstadt]] batteries. The heavily damaged merchant ship ''Kazakhstan'' disembarked 2300 men of the 5000 on board before steaming on to Kronstadt. In the following days ships operating from Suursaari rescued 12,160 survivors.&lt;ref name="Sea Power" /&gt;

The Soviet evacuation of Tallinn succeeded in evacuating 165 ships, 28,000 passengers and 66,000 tons of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.tkk.fi/~jaromaa/Navygallery/Background/Wartime/Tallinn-evac.htm Finnish navy in Continuation War, year 1941&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920155139/http://users.tkk.fi/~jaromaa/Navygallery/Background/Wartime/Tallinn-evac.htm |date=2008-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feldgrau.com/baltsea.html Naval War in the Baltic Sea 1941-1945&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At least 12,400 are thought to have drowned&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Juminda+2881941+To+the+memory+of+the+drowned+-+all+12000+of+them/1135259946924 "Juminda, 28.8.1941: To the memory of the drowned - all 12,000 of them" Helsingen Sanomat 5 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; in circumstances little known outside the former Soviet Union. The event was long downplayed by the Communist regime after the war. The evacuation may have been the bloodiest naval disaster since the [[battle of Lepanto]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

{{for|''The Best of Friends'', 1902 play with Lionel Barrymore, viewed as pro-Boer by London critics|Cecil Raleigh}} 
'''''The Best of Friends''''' is an epistolary play by [[Hugh Whitemore]] about the friendship of [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Sydney Cockerell]], and Dame [[Laurentia McLachlan]], based in the lengthy correspondence that passed between them for over 25 years.  It was inspired by ''[[The Nun, the Infidel, and the Superman]]'' by Dame [[Felicitas Corrigan]], a [[Benedictine]] nun at [[Stanbrook Abbey]] in the U.K.

George Bernard Shaw is considered one of the most important English-language playwrights of the 20th century. Sydney Cockerell was the curator of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] and was well-connected to many intellectuals of his time. Dame Laurentia was a [[Benedictine]] nun and [[Abbess]] of Stanbrook from 1931-1953 and an authority on church music.  

Originally produced as a stage play it first ran at the [[Apollo Theatre]] in 1988, with 
[[Ray McAnally]] as Shaw, Sir [[John Gielgud]] as Cockerell, and [[Rosemary Harris]] as McLachlan.

In 1991 it was filmed for television, under the direction by Alvin Rakoff, with [[Patrick McGoohan]] as Shaw, Sir [[John Gielgud]], and Dame [[Wendy Hiller]].

The play was performed in New York in 1993 with [[Roy Dotrice]] as Shaw, [[Michael Allinson]] and [[Diana Douglas]], and was revived in 2006 at the Hampstead Theatre, London, with [[Roy Dotrice]], [[Michael Pennington]] and [[Patricia Routledge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4015">The '''Dam Short Film Festival''' is a film festival held annually in [[Boulder City, Nevada]], typically in early February. [[Lee Lanier]] and Anita Lanier are the original co-founders of the festival. The festival is organized by the Dam Short Film Society, a non-profit 501(c)3 Nevada corporation. Past festival sponsors have included [[The Art Institutes]], the [[Nevada Film Office]], the [[Hacienda Hotel and Casino]], and [[Cirque du Soleil]]. The Society receives annual grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] via the Nevada Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://nac.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=1892:nevada-arts-council-awards-more-than-a-half-million-dollars-to-state-arts-communities-&lt;/ref&gt;

Started in 2005, the Dam Short Film Festival only screens films that run between 1 and 40 minutes. Generally, there are between 100 and 140 short films programmed each year. Although most of the festival shorts are submitted by student, independent, and other "up-and-coming" filmmakers, the stiff competition means many of the shorts have been produced involving film professionals. These have included [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] in "Window," [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner, [[Tom Hanks]], [[William Shatner]], and [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] in "Why Shakespeare?", the late [[Bela Lugosi]] narrating an animation based on the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] classic "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]", [[Francesco Quinn]] in "[[The Gnostic]]", and [[Robert Wagner]] and [[Lori Singer]] in "[[Little Victim]] "{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The short films are arranged into thematic programs, such as international drama, crime drama, dramedy, science-fiction, horror, comedy, avant-garde, underground, and animation. In addition to the regular screenings, the festival presents special showcases and retrospectives; for example, the 2009 event featured a showcase dedicated to documentary filmmaker Jay Rosenblatt while 2008 included a program dedicated to animator [[Jim Blashfield]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/feb/05/have-dam-good-time/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/culture/2008/jan/21/dam-short-filmfest-announces-lineup/&lt;/ref&gt; The festival also presents parties, mixers, filmmaker panels, and Q&amp;A sessions with attending filmmakers.

In 2008, the Festival moved to the historic 400-seat Boulder Theatre.  The Theatre was built in 1931 and is currently owned by [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] and his wife Amy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bouldertheatre.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 2014 marked the 10th anniversary of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/ae/film/2014/feb/06/decade-dam-short-film-festival/&lt;/ref&gt; At present, [[Lee Lanier]] serves as the Dam Short Film Society's executive director while John LaBonney serves as festival director. The Society has a working board of directors that varies from 4 to 6 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.damshortfilm.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Photographer''''' is a three-part mixed media performance accompanied by music (also sometimes referred to as a [[chamber opera]]) by [[composer]] [[Philip Glass]]. The libretto is based on the life and [[homicide]] trial of 19th-century English [[photographer]] [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Commissioned by the [[Holland Festival]], the opera was first performed in 1982 at the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Royal Palace]] in [[Amsterdam]].

==Subject==
Eadweard Muybridge was an English-born photographer who relocated to the American West and was an early pioneer in photographic technology. He photographed well-known landscapes of [[Yosemite]] that pushed the aesthetic and technological boundaries of the medium. His early photographic motion studies conducted in association with [[Leland Stanford]] led to the earliest moving photographic images. 

In 1874, Muybridge murdered Major Harry Larkyns (referred to as 'Colonel Harry Larkyns' in this work), whom he suspected of being his wife's lover, and was acquitted by a jury against the instructions of the judge on the ground of justifiable homicide. His trial is well-known because his defense argued that a head injury incurred in a stagecoach accident altered his personality, which modern neuroscientists believe could have been caused by certain types of brain damage. 

The text included in Glass' work is based on words drawn from the transcripts of the trial and Muybridge's actual letters to his wife. The second act features a slideshow of Muybridge's photographs. While based on historical events in Muybridge's life, the work also comments on aspects of Muybridge's work, melding both themes.

==Synopsis==
The form of this work consists of three acts: a play with incidental music, a concert accompanying a slideshow of Muybridge's work, and a dance with musical accompaniment. In total, the piece lasts about 90 minutes.

===Act I===
Act I is a play that includes three incidental pieces of music that fit into the play. The play recounts Muybridge's murder of Major Harry Larkyns and the trial, with an irreverent tone. 

The incidental piece "A Gentleman's Honor", includes words drawn from the actual trial transcript, commentary, and Muybridge's letters. It draws on the incident in which Flora sent Larkyns a portrait of Muybridge's son Florado, seeming to imply that Larkyns could be the father ('Whose baby is this'), and draws on the commentary of spectators ('All that white hair and a long white beard'), as well as referencing Muybridge's carriage accident and his later motion studies ('Horses in the air '). The phrases 'Artificial moonlight' and 'Artificial sky' may refer to techniques used by Muybridge in his landscape technology (overlaying clouds onto his images). Glass notes that he originally conceived the text of A Gentleman's Honor as based on a poem by Muybridge called "Circles", but Glass reconsidered and asked [[David Byrne]] to use material from the trial itself, as well as Muybridge's letters. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Glass |first=Philip |subject-link=Philip Glass|interviewer=Jennings |title=Philip Glass Interviewed by Russ Jennings (April 18, 1983) |url=https://archive.org/details/PhillipGlassWithJennings |location=San Francisco |date=April 18, 1983 |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act II===
Act II is a violin solo, or "concert", that either features a figure representing Muybridge in the darkroom in the background or a slideshow of images by Muybridge. Critics have compared the see-saw sounds of the solo violin to a hoe-down or "early American" sound, although Glass claims this analogy was not necessarily intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Glass |first=Philip |subject-link=Philip Glass|interviewer=Jennings |title=Philip Glass Interviewed by Russ Jennings (April 18, 1983) |url=https://archive.org/details/PhillipGlassWithJennings |location=San Francisco |date=April 18, 1983 |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act III===
In Act III, the characters from Act I return for a dance (including Muybridge, Flora, Larkyns, and Victorian bystanders). In some productions, the dance features photographs "developed" in the second half.

==Composition and premieres==
The preview of this work premiered in May 1982 at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam for Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands and commissioned by the Holland Festival, and its first public performance was in June 1982 as part of the Holland Festival, for which the work was commissioned. The work was suggested and developed by the Dutch director/designer Rob Malasch. Later, Glass rewrote the piece and renamed it "The Photographer: Far from the Truth". Though based on Malasch's original premise, this new version of the play was rewritten by Rob Coe. Glass also performed this work as a selection of incidental songs from Act I and the instrumental work in Act III. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Rockwell |coauthors= |title=PHILIP GLASS'S 'PHOTOGRAPHER' |work=New York Times |page= |date=October 7, 1983 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |quote= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/07/arts/philip-glass-s-photographer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass's distinctive minimalist musical style complements the theme of the opera, since the ideas of repetitive sounds and small changes seem to mirror Muybridge's techniques in his famous motion studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Muybridge: the man who made pictures move |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/04/13/125899013/muybridge-the-man-who-made-pictures-move |publisher= National Public Radio |accessdate=December 28, 2014| date=April 13, 2010 |last=Ulaby |first=Neda |authorlink=Neda Ulaby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Muybridge's achievements and this relationship to the composer's work, the work does not necessarily treat the subject of Muybridge's trial reverently, and the dance appears to use the subject as an opportunity to comment on the contradictory mores of Muybridge's own time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tobias |first=Tobi |date=October 24, 1883 |title=Home Truths |quote="David Gordon's expert movement is the best part of The Photographer." |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-ICAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=rob+coe+the+photographer+muybridge+play&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9_QEpyoUjZ&amp;sig=kneZCWJJoVIfyIEkZJOnOzEPrBQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f3SgVMXVBNfWoAT0iYHwBg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=rob%20coe%20the%20photographer%20muybridge%20play&amp;f=false |journal=The New York Times Magazine |location= |publisher= |accessdate=December 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass has stated that he intended to reflect the idea of a "Victorian melodrama" in his music. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Glass |first=Philip |subject-link=Philip Glass|interviewer=Jennings |title=Philip Glass Interviewed by Russ Jennings (April 18, 1983) |url=https://archive.org/details/PhillipGlassWithJennings |location=San Francisco |date=April 18, 1983 |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This piece seems to show Glass's transitioning from ensemble works like Einstein on the Beach to more traditional instrumentation in his later works. Glass has stated that using the word "minimalist" to apply to this work is "misleading" and would not reflect what the listener would expect to hear. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Glass |first=Philip |subject-link=Philip Glass|interviewer=Jennings |title=Philip Glass Interviewed by Russ Jennings (April 18, 1983) |url=https://archive.org/details/PhillipGlassWithJennings |location=San Francisco |date=April 18, 1983 |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
The recording was conceived with the idea that most listeners would not have experienced the stage work. Several pieces were shortened or left off the album entirely, and the order of the music is changed. Only two of the original three incidental pieces contained in Act I are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Glass |first=Philip |subject-link=Philip Glass|interviewer=Jennings |title=Philip Glass Interviewed by Russ Jennings (April 18, 1983) |url=https://archive.org/details/PhillipGlassWithJennings |location=San Francisco |date=April 18, 1983 |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was released on June 26, 1984 by CBS Records / Epic and is just 42 minutes long (compared to the 90-minute-long original work).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=December 28, 2014 |url=http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/photographer.php |title=The photographer |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Triumph of St. Joan''''' was originally an [[opera]] in three acts by [[Norman Dello Joio]] to an English language [[libretto]] on the subject of the [[martyr]]dom of [[Joan of Arc]] by Dello Joio and [[Joseph Machilis]]. It was premiered at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] on May 9, 1950.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/05/07/archives/composer-of-new-opera-discusses-his-work-recital-for-two.html|title=Composer of New Opera Discusses his Work; Recital for Two |author=[[Carter Harman]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 7, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the opera was received positively, the composer was unhappy with the work and declined to have it performed again.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/nyregion/27dellojoio.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22+Norman+Dello+Joio%22+%22opera%22&amp;st=nyt|title=Norman Dello Joio, Prolific and Popular Composer, Is Dead at 95|author=[[Daniel J. Wakin]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did adapt part of the opera into a [[symphony]] of the same title in 1951.&lt;ref name="Naxos"&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=FECD-0019&amp;catNum=FECD-0019&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English The Triumph of St. Joan Symphony naxos.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony was later renamed ''Seraphic Ode''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usopera.com/composers/dellojoio.html|title=Norman Dello Joio|work=www.usopera.com|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dello Joio returned to the subject of Joan of Arc in 1955 when he was commissioned by the [[NBC Television Opera Theatre]] to produce an original 75-minute opera for television. The resulting work in two acts was retitled '''''The Trial at Rouen''''', and, in using new music and a new libretto by Dello Joio, was in effect a completely different musical drama from its predecessor. It premiered on April 8, 1956 on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name="Dello"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/04/01/archives/challenge-of-joan-composer-relates-effort-in-trying-to-meet-it.html?sq=%2522+Norman+Dello+Joio%2522+%2522opera%2522&amp;scp=103&amp;st=p|title=Challenge of Joan; Composer Relates Effort In Trying to Meet It|author=[[Norman Dello Joio]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dello Joio adapted the work a third time, extending the music at the beginning and end of the 1956 version (including some music from the 1950 opera) to create a one-act opera for the stage. This third version, once again called ''The Triumph of St. Joan'', was premiered by the [[New York City Opera]] on April 16, 1959.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/04/17/archives/the-opera-city-center-double-bill-works-by-dello-joio-and-menotti.html?sq=%2522Lee+Venora%2522&amp;scp=15&amp;st=p|title=The Opera: City Center Double Bill; Works by Dello Joio and Menotti Sung|author=[[Howard Taubman]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 17, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ingres coronation charles vii.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Joan of Arc at the coronation of [[Charles VII of France]] as depicted by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] in this 1851 painting]]
Dello Joio was on the faculty of Sarah Lawrence College (SLC) and the college was looking to produce a theatrical work that could be a collaborative project across different departments. The composer had been contemplating writing an opera for a number of years already but had not found a subject matter that inspired him until attending the 1948 film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' with his friend Joseph Machilis, a writer, musician, and [[Queens College, City University of New York]], faculty member. The two men both agreed that an opera focusing on the "inner motivations and spiritual life of Joan" could be derived effectively and movingly and that it would make a good project for SLC. Over the next 11 months the two men laboured together to create the opera's libretto and Dello Joio composed the music in this time as well.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;

The original 1950 opera encompassed three soloists, an opera chorus, and dancers. The SLC's music and dance departments made up the cast and the production was accompanied by two pianos. The school's theatre majors specializing in the technical aspects of the stage designed and built the sets, lights, and costumes. Conductor [[Hugh Ross (musician)|Hugh Ross]] directed the chorus and all told a total of 85 SLC students were involved in putting the opera together. A grant from the Whitney Foundation provided much of the financial backing needed to mount the opera.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;
 
The opera premiered at Bates Hall on the campus of SLC on May 9, 1950. Gisela Weber created the title role with Jerome Swinford as [[Pierre Cauchon]] and John Druary as the [[Dauphin of France]]/[[Charles VII of France]]. The opera opens with Joan in her prison cell after her [[Trial of Joan of Arc|trial and sentence of execution]]. Awaiting her death alone, her memories of past events come to life on stage with intermittent periods returning her to her present moment of solitude. Flashbacks include her meeting with the Dauphin the day before the [[Siege of Orléans]], his coronation at Rheims, the breach in the relationship between Charles and Joan, and Cauchon's condemning of her at her trial.&lt;ref name="Downes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/05/11/archives/dello-joio-opera-has-its-premiere-sarah-lawrence-college-offers.html?sq=%2522+Norman+Dello+Joio%2522+%2522opera%2522&amp;scp=65&amp;st=p|title=Dello Joio Opera has its Premiere; Sarah Lawrence College Offers 'Triumph of Joan' on Campus With Students for Cast Joan a Difficult Role Score Fits the Period|author=[[Olin Downes]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music critics [[Olin Downes]] noted the following about the integral part of chorus: &lt;blockquote&gt;The chorus plays a many-sided role. Now, in the solitude of Joan's cell, it is the whispering voice of her sorely tired spirit; now it is active and potent participant in the drama, as in the coronation scene, or in the scene between Joan and the Bishop of Beauvaris, denouncing her; now it is the Greek commentator on the tragedy.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Overall the reception for Dello Joio's first rendition of ''The Triumph of St. Joan'' was positive.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt; However, the composer was himself unhappy with the work and, although there was some interest in a professional staging of the opera, Dello Joio withdrew the work from such considerations.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; He did take some of the music and adapt it into a symphony which was first performed by the [[Louisville Orchestra]] on December 5 and 6, 1951. At the premiere, renowned dancer [[Martha Graham]] performed the role of Joan of Arc using her own choreography. The symphony is organized into three movements. The first movement, entitled "The Maid", is a theme and variation in 6/8 with flute and oboe soloists on the melody. The second movement, "The Warrior", is written in 12/8 with a great deal of intensity until it moves into a stately 4/4. Of the final movement, ''The Saint'', Dello Joio said, "I cannot urge you strongly enough to have the orchestra sing the last movement. I do not feel the end of this piece should be tragic but rather one of triumphant serenity. Joan must have welcomed the fire for it was the final test which led to her salvation."&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt;

==The Trial at Rouen==
[[File:Pierre Cauchon-Jeanne Darc manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Manuscript portrait of Bishop [[Pierre Cauchon]] at the trial of [[Joan of Arc]]]]
[[Peter Herman Adler]] of the [[NBC Opera Theatre]] was interested in Dello Joio's work and in 1955 he commissioned the composer to provide the company with a new opera for television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/03/obituaries/peter-herman-adler-tv-opera-pioneer-and-conductor-91.html?scp=11&amp;sq=%22+Norman+Dello+Joio%22+%22opera%22&amp;st=nyt|title=Peter Herman Adler; TV Opera Pioneer And Conductor, 91|author=[[John Rockwell]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 3, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling he had not said what he wanted to say about Joan of Arc, Dello Joio returned to her as the source of this new work. He wrote an entirely new libretto in two acts, going back to the historical documents of her trial as a source for the new text. He also wrote completely new music for the opera.&lt;ref name="Dello" /&gt; Dello Joio commented on this process: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The Trial at Rouen'' is not a version of my first opera, but is a completely new statement, both musically and dramatically; though the temptation to use the old material was great... The premise of my opera is simple. My conclusion is that the Joan story recounts the ageless conflict between the individual of excessive imagination and those who hold to the status quo. I was aware of how dangerous this concept was, because singing philosophy can be a bore. But, in reading the intense human drama between Joan and her accusers leaped forth from the pages in highly emotional terms.&lt;ref name="Dello" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Trial of Rouen'', Dello Joio completely removed the character of the Dauphin of France/Charles VII of France, choosing instead to focus on Joan's trial and execution. The production starred soprano [[Elaine Malbin]] in the title role, baritone [[Hugh Thompson (baritone)|Hugh Thompson]] as Cauchon, bass [[Chester Watson (bass)|Chester Watson]] as Father Julien, and baritone [[Paul Ukena]] as the Jailer. There were also six inquisitors and three heavenly voices in the cast. [[Peter Herman Adler]] conducted the [[Symphony of the Air]] for the production. The opera was broadcast nationally on [[NBC]] television on April 8, 1956, to an audience in the millions.&lt;ref name="Taubman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/04/09/archives/music-new-dello-joio-opera-on-tv-the-trial-at-rouen-presented-by.html?sq=%2522+Norman+Dello+Joio%2522+%2522opera%2522&amp;scp=106&amp;st=p|title=Music: New Dello Joio Opera on TV; 'The Trial at Rouen' Presented by N.B.C. Noel Coward as Guest Contemporary Works Brilliant Musician|author=[[Howard Taubman]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 9, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music critic [[Howard Taubman]] was overall positive about the work, stating that "The NBC Television opera gave ''The Trial at Rouen'' a brilliant production, one of the best in a growing line of video presentations."&lt;ref name="Taubman" /&gt; However, his comments on the effectiveness of the work were mixed. He said the following in his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;''The Trial at Rouen'' is a high-minded attempt to come to grips with the subject of the martyrdom of Saint Joan. Its mood is reverent without turning ponderous. It is always lyrical and occasionally tense with drama. It combines words and music with an ease that makes the enfolding of the song seem natural and with a poetry that heightens its emotion... Does his opera give us Joan in all her innocence and radiance? One would have to say it comes close but is defeated in the end. One of Mr. Dello Joio's troubles is that his libretto lacks contrast and his characters are almost of one shade. In the case of Joan, this fault is rectified by variety and subtlety in the music. However, the music, though it is not afraid to sing, lets us down in the climaxes by failing to sing with sufficient intensity.&lt;ref name="Taubman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1959 opera==
[[Image:Joan of arc interrogation.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Joan of Arc]] is interrogated by [[The Cardinal of Winchester]] in her prison 1431. Painting by [[Hippolyte Delaroche|Paul Delaroche]] (1797–1856).]]
After the somewhat mixed success of ''The Trial at Rouen'', Dello Joio felt that he could still improve upon his opera further. He continued to work on the opera adding additional music to the beginning and end. He took some music from the original 1950 opera, a short aria for an English sentry (a character in the original opera but not the television version), and tagged it onto the beginning of the first act. He also added an impassioned extended farewell aria for Joan at the end of the opera. Although the work was now longer than the 1956 version, it was structured into one act instead of two.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

In 1958 [[Julius Rudel]] offered to include Dello Joio's revised one-act opera, now retitled ''The Triumph of St. Joan'', in the 1958–1959 [[New York City Opera]] (NYCO) season. He readily accepted and the work was premiered by the NYCO on April 16, 1959, in a double bill with [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s ''[[The Medium]]''. The cast included [[Lee Venora]] in the title role, [[Mack Harrell]] as Cauchon, [[Chester Watson (bass)|Chester Watson]] as Father Julien, [[Chester Ludgin]] as the Jailer, and tenor [[Frank Porretta]] as the Sentry. [[Herbert Grossman]] conducted the opera which was staged by [[José Quintero]] and included sets by [[David Hays (designer)|David Hays]] and costumes by [[Ruth Morely]]. Taubman also reviewed this production, commenting that this version was "a distinct improvement over its predecessors." He also remarked that the opera now had a much more effective climax with the scene where Joan is lashed to the stake "taking on a fearful and piteous realism".&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

{{nihongo|"'''Toilet no Kamisama'''"|トイレの神様|Toire no Kamisama|"God in the Toilet"}} is a song by Japanese singer-songwriter [[Kana Uemura]], recounting her thoughts about her late grandmother.&lt;ref name="TsutayaBook"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ja:トイレの神様／植村花菜 |trans-title=Toilet no Kamisama/Kana Uemura | url=http://www.tsutaya.co.jp/works/40917878.html |language=Japanese | work=Tsutaya | accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the leading track from her [[extended play]] ''[[Watashi no Kakera-tachi]]'', released on March 10, 2010. The song was re-recorded with [[Kotaro Oshio]], and used as a promotional track from Uemura's self-cover album, ''[[Kana: My Favorite Things]]'', later in September 2010.

The song was popular enough to boost Uemura's popularity, being downloaded more than 250,000 times to cellphones and 250,000 times to PCs&lt;ref name="RIAJcert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RIAJPC"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ja:レコード協会調べ　6月度有料音楽配信認定＜略称：6月度認定＞ |trans-title=Record Association report: June digital music download certifications (Abbreviation: June Certifications)  | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/chart/w110720.html | work=[[RIAJ]] |language=Japanese | date=July 20, 2011 | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and boosting the sales of ''Watashi no Kakera-tachi'', giving Uemura her first gold-certified album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ja:ゴールド等認定作品一覧　2010年08月 |trans-title=Catalog of works certified gold and other certifications, August 2010 | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/gold/201008.html | work=[[RIAJ]] |language=Japanese | date=2010-08-10 | accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song inspired several other media, such as an autobiographical book by Uemura, as well as a special drama to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the opening of [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]].

The song was awarded two [[Japan Record Award]]s in 2010, one in the general song category along with 9 other songs, as well as Uemura being awarded the lyricist award for the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://natalie.mu/music/news/40908 |title=「レコ大」大賞候補にいきもの、AKB48、植村花菜ら |trans-title='Gold Records' Grand Prize Candidates: Ikimono-gakari, AKB48, Kana Uemura, etc |publisher=Natalie |date=November 20, 2010 |accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
The song is a ballad, beginning with a simple guitar-based arrangement, however later expanding to a band and orchestra arrangement. The song's lyrics are an extended narrative that tell the story of Uemura and her grandmother. When she was a 3rd grader (8 years old), she lived at her grandmother's house next door to her parents, playing [[gomoku]], eating nanban-style duck noodle soup when they went out shopping, watching videotapes of the comedy program ''[[Yoshimoto Shinkigeki]]'' and helping her every day. Uemura was not very fond of cleaning toilets, so her grandmother told her that a beautiful goddess lives in the toilet, if she cleaned it every day, this goddess would make her into a beautiful woman. As Uemura grew older, the communication gap between her and her grandmother worsened and the two grew apart. Uemura, feeling resentful, moved away from home with her then boyfriend and rarely came home to visit.  Her grandmother later became more ill and was hospitalized two years after Uemura left for Tokyo. Uemura visited her, saying "Grandma, I'm home!" as she used to when she was little, before the two began to fight. Her grandmother could not say much and the next morning died quietly in her sleep. Uemura believes her grandmother was waiting for her, besides being left alone from her all this time. She feels regret for hurting her grandmother and says thank you to her at the end of the song.&lt;ref name="Lyrics"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ja:トイレの神様 - 植村花菜 |trans-title=Toilet no Kamisama - Kana Uemura | url=http://music.goo.ne.jp/lyric/LYRUTND88524/index.html |language=Japanese | work=Goo Music | accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song mentions several words in [[Kansai dialect]], especially in the way the grandmother speaks. She adds {{nihongo|''yade''|やで}} to the ends of her sentences, and uses specifically Kansai terms, such as {{nihongo|''beppin''|べっぴん||"Beautiful Woman"}} and {{nihongo|''kamo nanba''|鴨なんば||"Nanban-style duck noodle soup"}}, instead of standard Japanese {{nihongo|''bijin''|美人}} and {{nihongo|''kamo nanban''|鴨南蛮}}.  Uemura thanks her grandmother by saying {{nihongo|''honma ni arigatō''|ホンマにありがとう}}, as opposed to {{nihongo|''hontō ni arigatō''|本当に
ありがとう}}.&lt;ref name="Lyrics"/&gt; While the song is called "Toilet no Kamisama," the word {{nihongo|[[wiktionary:kami|kamisama]]|神様||"god"}} is not used in the song, instead the song talks about a {{nihongo|[[wiktionary:megami|megami]]|女神||"goddess"}} in the toilet.

When Uemura met music producer Yohito Teraoka, her self-introduction featured the story of her grandmother. Teraoka suggested they turn this story into a song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=SPECIAL INTERVIEW 植村花菜～アコースティック・ギタリスト大集結の新作『花菜 ～My Favorite Things～ 』を徹底解析! |trans-title=Special Interview Kana Uemura: A Thorough Analysis of the Acoustic Guitarist Great Gathering Album, ''Kana: My Favorite Things'' |journal=アコースティック・ギター・マガジン |volume=46 |issue=2010年12月号 |page=22 |publisher=リットーミュージック |language=Japanese |id=[[ASIN]] [https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0045OWE1A B0045OWE1A] (JP)&lt;!--This ASIN is not valid on amazon.com, but is on amazon.co.jp--&gt; JAN 4910114691208|date=27 October 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uemura performed at the 61st ''[[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]]'' New Years' singing battle. She performed the full-length version of "Toilet no Kamisama." The performance was one of the longest in Kōhaku's history, after [[Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi]]'s 15 minute performance in 1990.&lt;ref name="KohakuPerf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/5158363/ |title=植村花菜「トイレの神様」で紅白初出場へ |trans-title=Kana Uemura, her first performance at Kōhaku with "Toilet no Kamisama" | author=Sponichi Annex |publisher=Livedoor |date=November 23, 2010 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uTUH0v0Z |archivedate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also performed the song on [[Yoshimoto Shinkigeki]]'s new years' special during the curtain call, the television show mentioned in Uemura's song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000066520&amp;p=0 |title=植村花菜、よしもと新喜劇初出演で「トイレの神様」を熱唱 |trans-title=Kana Uemura, singing "Toilet no Kamisama" passionately in her first appearance on Yoshimoto Shinkigeki. |publisher=Barks |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The live action version features Uemura performing the song on guitar on a sunlit river bank, interspersed with scenes of a grandmother and several different actresses portraying the scenes described in the song. The final scenes show the grandmother walking with the adolescent actress along the river bank where Uemura sung the song. The Hashimoto animated version similarly enacts the storyline from the song, featuring drawings of a grandmother and a small girl. The video's artwork is based on the ''Toilet no Kamisama'' picture book, illustrated by Mari Torigoe, and released in September 2010.

==Adaptations==

The song inspired two books by Uemura, both with the same title. The first is an autobiography released in July 2010 through [[Takarajimasha]], telling anecdotes about her grandmother and the process of making the song.&lt;ref name="TsutayaBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jbook.co.jp/p/p.aspx/3997023/s/ | title=JBOOK：トイレの神様：植村　花菜　著：書籍 |trans-title=JBook: "Toilet no Kamisama" - Kana Uemura - Books | work=JBook |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604092743/http://www.jbook.co.jp/p/p.aspx/3997023/s/ |archivedate=June 4, 2014 | language=Japanese |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is a picture book version, published through [[Kodansha]] in September 2010.

'''Urs''' (from {{Lang-ar|عرس}}), is an Arabic word which not only mean Wedding Ceremony whether of a man or a woman. عُرس also has derived words like عروسہ which means a Bride but also sometimes on special occasion is referred to passing away of ''auliya Allah'' (intimate friends of God). One of the famous Novel's title is مراة العروس, written by Deputy Nazir Ahmed. مراة العروس means Mirror of Brides. for more clarifications kindly see following pages of Urdu and Arabic Dictionaries.

1- Al-Munjad (المنجد﴿ most Authentic Arabic to Urdu Dictionary page 550.
2- Farhang e Amira Page 420
3- Fahang e Asfiyah Volume 3 Page 268
4- Lughaat e Kishori page 317&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rekhta.org/urdudictionary?keyword=urs&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deobandi|Deobandis]] view is that no etymology towards "Urs" meaning Death Anniversary. This misconception is because, generally people do not know that actually عرس or Urs of a saint has no authenticity in Islam{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}, being an innovation (Bid'ah)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darulifta-deoband.com/home/en/Innovations--Customs/2009&lt;/ref&gt;. This view is according to [[Deobandi|deobandi movement]] which was established recently in 1867 in the [[Muslim Ummah|muslim umma]] after the wake of the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Rebellion]] in northern India, but not all ''[http://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/BID%27AH%20-%20Innovation%20in%20Islam.htm bida]'' (innovation) are prohibited according to sharia law and the prophetic traditions and the major scholars view&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/BID%27AH%20-%20Innovation%20in%20Islam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Some examples are:

{{Quote|text=Kullu bida'tin daiala: "Every innovation is a misguidance"? Doesn't the term "every" include all innovations?" Such an objection stems from the misinterpretation of the term kull ("every") in the Hadith to be all encompassing without exception, whereas in Arabic it may mean "Nearly all" or "the vast majority." This is how al-Shafi'i understood it or else he would have never allowed for any innovation whatsoever to be considered good, and he is considered a hujja or "Proof," that is, reference without peer for questions regarding the Arabic language. The stylistic figure of meaning the part by the whole, or nechdoche in English is in Arabic: 'abbara 'an al-kathratf bi at-kulliyya. This is illustrated by the use of kull in the following verse 46:25 of the Quran in a selective or partial sense not a universal sense:
"Destroying all things by commandment of its Lord. And morning found them so that naught could be seen save their dwellings". Thus, the dwellings were not destroyed although "all" things had been destroyed. "All" here means specifically the lives of the unbelievers of 'Ad and their properties except their houses.|sign=IMAM SHAFI|source=http://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/BID%27AH%20-%20Innovation%20in%20Islam.htm}}{{Quote|text="He who inaugurates a good practice (sanna fil-islam sunnatun hasana) in Islam earns the reward of it, and of all who perform it after him, without diminishing their own rewards in the least. "|sign=Prophet Muhammad|source=Tirmizi, Page 92}}


On the day of the passing away of a Saint or on a specific date, their admirers, disciples, followers and relatives assemble together at the grave of the Saint to make esal-e-sawab, obtain spiritual benefit and celebrate the anniversary with rejoice. 

The object of fixing the day and time of Urs is that the people become aware of this auspicious occasion. There is no harm in fixing the date and visiting the graves in gathering in fact this proven practice of prophet as cited in the forth coming sections.

[[Abdul-Haqq Dehlavi|Shah Abdul Aziz Muhaddith Dehlwi]] has written that if the day of Urs is meant for invocation or reminding for the deceased one, there is no harm. That gives benefit to the living as well as the deceased ones.&lt;ref&gt;Fatawa Aziziyah&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.lovemeditation-naqshbandi.com/urs-sayyindina-sheikh-abdul-qadir-jilani-11th-rabi-al-thani-2/ Urs of Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani]&lt;ref&gt;[[Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sunniworld.wordpress.com/2010/05/23/celebrating-urs-visiting-graves-complete-proofs-from-quraan-o-sunnah/&lt;/ref&gt; are such special occasion when muslims around the globe celebrate the auliya of all auliya Allah. He is the master of all the friends of Allah.

'''Vegoose''' was&lt;ref name="knoxnews.com"&gt;[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/may/06/superfly-c-pull-plug-vegoose Superfly, A.C. pull plug on Vegoose : Business : Knoxville News Sentinel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; an annual [[Halloween]] music and arts festival that took place in 2005, 2006, and 2007 in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  Unlike the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] — put on by the same organizers, [[Superfly Productions]] and [[AC Entertainment]] — Vegoose does not offer on-site [[camping]]. In addition to music, the festival features a score of activities, including [[celebrity impersonator]]s, a [[wedding chapel]], [[costume]] contests, a massive [[pumpkin]] display, and more.

The festival's current state is in question and did not make a return in 2008.&lt;ref name="knoxnews.com"/&gt; However, the festival may make its return in the near future. A.C. Entertainment and Superfly instead focused their energy on a new festival in San Francisco, the Outside Lands Festival.

==Vegoose 2007==
The third annual installment of this dynamic entertainment experience took place in Las Vegas over Halloween weekend at Sam Boyd Stadium on Saturday, October 27 and Sunday, October 28.  'Vegoose at Night,' a series of nighttime concerts, presented a variety of artists at marquee venues throughout the city starting on Friday, October 26 and running through Sunday, October 28. The popularity of the event directly affected Vegoose's future. After a decline in attendance in 2006, AC stated in the Las Vegas Review Journal that there had to be an improvement. The official attendance was 40,000 for both days (32,000 in 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegoose.com Vegoose Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Executive Producer:  Stephen Warner, Directed by:  Keith Hobelman.
