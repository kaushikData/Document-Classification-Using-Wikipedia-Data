The '''action game''' is a [[Video game genres|video game genre]] that emphasizes physical challenges, including hand–eye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres, such as [[fighting game]]s, [[beat 'em up]]s, [[shooter game]]s and [[platform game]]s which are widely considered the most important action games, though [[multiplayer online battle arena]] and some [[real-time strategy]] games are also considered to be action games.

In an action game, the player typically controls a [[Character (arts)|character]] often in the form of a [[protagonist]] or [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. This [[player character]] must navigate a [[Level (video gaming)|level]], collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major [[antagonist]] in the game's story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character's [[Health (gaming)|health]] and [[1-up|lives]], and the player receives a [[Game over]] when they run out of lives. Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels and seeing the [[Closing credits|credits]]. But some action games, such as early [[arcade games]], are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels; with the player's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their score.

== Defining elements ==
The action genre includes any game where the player overcomes challenges by physical means such as precise aim and quick response times.&lt;ref name="NGen15"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|pages=28-42|quote=Action game - A game characterized by simple action and response gameplay. ... the defining characteristic is that enemies and obstacles are overcome by 'physical' means, rather than involved intellectual problem solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action games can sometimes incorporate other challenges such as races, puzzles, or collecting objects, but they are not central to the genre. Players may also encounter tactical and exploration challenges, but these games first-and-foremost require high reaction speed and good hand–eye coordination. The player is often under time pressure, and there is not enough time for complex strategic planning. In general, faster action games are more challenging. Action games may sometimes involve puzzle solving, but they are usually quite simple because the player is under immense time pressure.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew| authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams|title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game design ==

=== Levels ===

Players advance through an action game by completing a series of [[level design|levels]]. Levels are often grouped by theme, with similar graphics and enemies called a world. Each level involves a variety of challenges, whether dancing in a dance game or shooting things in a shooter, which the player must overcome to win the game. Older games force players to restart a level after dying, although action games evolved to offer saved games and checkpoints to allow the player to restart partway through a level. Increasingly, though, some games allow for 'resurrection' or 'cloning' and the opportunity to regain lost items upon death for a certain sum of ingame currency, typically increasing exponentially the more times the player dies. The obstacles and enemies in a level do not usually vary between play sessions, allowing players to learn by trial and error. However, levels sometimes add an element of randomness, such as an enemy that randomly appears or that takes an unpredictable path.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Levels in an action game may be linear or [[nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]], and sometimes include shortcuts. For levels that require exploration, the player may need to search for a level exit that is hidden or guarded by enemies. Such levels can also contain secrets—hidden or hard-to-reach objects or places that contain something valuable. The prize can be a bonus (see below) or a non-standard exit that allows a player to access a hidden level, or jump ahead several levels. Action games sometimes offer a teleporter that will cause the player's avatar to re-appear elsewhere in the same level. Levels often make use of locked doors that can only be opened with a specific key found elsewhere in the level.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Action games sometimes make use of time restrictions to increase the challenge. However, game levels typically do not react to time passing, and day/night cycles are rare.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; When the timer expires, the player typically loses a life, although some games generate a difficult enemy or challenge. If the level is completed with time remaining, this usually adds to the player's score.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Character abilities ===
In most action games, the player controls a single [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] as the [[protagonist]].&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; The avatar has the ability to navigate and maneuver, and often collects or manipulates objects. They have a range of defenses and attacks, such as shooting or punching. Many action games make use of a powerful attack that destroys all enemies within a limited range, but this attack is rare.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Players may find a [[power-up]] within the game world that grants temporary or permanent improvements to their abilities. For example, the avatar may gain an increase in speed, more powerful attacks, or a temporary shield from attacks. Some action games even allow players to spend upgrade points on the power ups of their choice.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Obstacles and enemies ===
In action games that involve navigating a space, players will encounter obstacles, traps, and enemies. Enemies typically follow fixed patterns and attack the player, although newer action games may make use of more complex [[artificial intelligence]] to pursue the player. Enemies sometimes appears in groups or waves, with enemies increasing in strength and number until the end of the level. Enemies may also appear out of thin air. This can involve an invisible spawn point, or a visible generator which can be destroyed by the player. These points may generate enemies indefinitely, or only up to a certain number.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; At the end of a level or group of themed levels, players often encounter a [[boss (video games)|boss]]. This boss enemy will often resemble a larger or more difficult version of a regular enemy. A boss may require a special weapon or attack method, such as striking when the boss opens their mouth or attacking particular part of the Boss.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Health and lives ===
In many action games, the avatar has a certain number of hit-markers or health, which are depleted by enemy attacks and other hazards. Sometimes health can be replenished by collecting an in-game object. When the player runs out of health, the player dies. The player's avatar is often given a small number of chances to retry after death, typically referred to as [[1-up|lives]]. Upon beginning a new life, the player resumes the game either from the same location they died, a checkpoint, or the start of the level. Upon starting a new life, the avatar is typically invincible for a few seconds to allow the player to re-orient themselves. Players may earn extra lives by reaching a certain score or by finding an in-game object. Arcade games still limit the number of player lives, while home video games have shifted increasingly to unlimited lives.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Graphics and interface ===
Action games take place in either 2D or 3D from a variety of perspectives. 2D action games typically use a side view or top-down view. The screen frequently scrolls as the player explores the level, although many games scroll through the level automatically to push the player forward. In 3D action games, the perspective is usually tied to the avatar from a first-person or third-person perspective. However, some 3D games offer a context-sensitive perspective that is controlled by an [[artificial intelligence]] camera. Most of what the player needs to know is contained within a single screen, although action games frequently make use of a [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] that display important information such as health or ammunition. Action games sometimes make use of maps which can be accessed during lulls in action, or a mini-map that is always visible.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Scoring and victory ===
Action games tend to set simple goals, and reaching them is obvious.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; A common goal is to defeat the end-of-game boss. This is often presented in the form of a structured story, with a happy ending upon winning the game. In some games, the goal changes as the player reveals more of the story.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Many action games keep track of the player's score. Points are awarded for completing certain challenges, or defeating certain enemies. Skillful play is often rewarded with point multipliers, such as in ''Pac-Man'' where each ghost that the avatar eats will generate twice as many points as the last. Sometimes action games will offer bonus objects that increase the player's score. There is no penalty for failing to collect them, although these bonus objects may unlock hidden levels or special events. In many action games, achieving a high score is the only goal, and levels increase in difficulty until the player loses. Arcade games are more likely to be unbeatable, as they make their money by forcing the player to lose the game. On the other hand, games sold at home are more likely to have discrete victory conditions, since a publisher wants the player to purchase another game when they are done.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

== Subgenres ==
Action games have several major subgenres. However, there are many action games without any clear subgenre, such as ''[[Frogger]]'', as well as other types of genres like Adventure or Strategy that have action elements.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Action-adventure game]]s''' mix elements of both action and adventure genres, examples include The Legend of Zelda, Assassin's Creed and Grand Theft Auto series.

'''[[Beat 'em up]]s''' are games that involve fighting through a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stage of multiple adversaries, using martial arts or other close-range fighting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-tao-of-beat-em-ups-article?page=2 | author = Spanner Spencer | publisher = EuroGamer | title = The Tao of Beat-'em-ups | date = 2008-02-06 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/fightingforce2/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080604002041/http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/fightingforce2/ | archivedate = 2008-06-04 | author = Subskin | publisher = GameSpy | title = Reviews - Fighting Force 2 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Fighting game]]s''' feature combat between pairs of fighters, usually using martial arts moves. Actions are limited to various attacks and defenses, and matches end when a fighter's health is reduced to zero. They often make use of special moves and combos. There are both 2D and 3D fighting games, but most 3D fighting games largely take place in a 2D plane and occasionally include side-stepping. They are distinct from [[sports game]]s such as boxing and wrestling games  which attempt to model movements and techniques more realistically.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[List of maze video games|Maze game]]s''' such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'' involve navigating a maze to avoid or chase adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Intelligence and Technology | author = Robert J. Sternberg,  David Preiss | publisher = Routledge | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Platform game]]s''' involve jumping between platforms of different heights, while battling enemies and avoiding obstacles. Physics are often unrealistic, and game levels are often vertically exaggerated. They exist in both 2D and 3D forms.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Rhythm game|Rhythm action games]]''' challenge the player's sense of rhythm, and award points for accurately pressing certain buttons in sync with a musical beat. This is a relatively new subgenre of action game.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; Rhythm games are sometimes classified as a type of [[music video game|music game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/10/27/one-on-one-with-shigeru-miyamoto/ | title = One-On-One With Shigeru Miyamoto: From ‘Wii Music’ To Bowser To…  MotionPlus? | author = Stephen Totilo | date = 2008-10-27 | accessdate = 2009-02-20 | publisher = MTV | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090115074435/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/10/27/one-on-one-with-shigeru-miyamoto/| archivedate= 15 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Shooter game]]s''' allow the player to take action at a distance using a ranged weapon, challenging them to aim with accuracy. Although shooting is usually a form of violence, non-violent shooters exist as well, such as [[Splatoon]]. This subgenre includes [[first-person shooter]]s and [[third-person shooters]], as well as a plethora of other [[shoot 'em up]] games taking place from a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] or side-view perspective.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Survival game]]s''' start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the [[survival horror]] genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse. A specific subgenre of survival game is [[Battle royale game|battle royale]].

== Physical impact ==
Studies have shown that people can improve their eyesight by playing action video games. Tests by scientists at the [[University of Rochester]] on college students showed that over a period of a month, performance in eye examinations improved by about 20% in those playing ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' compared to those playing ''[[Tetris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11123-action-computer-games-can-sharpen-eyesight.html  "Action computer games can sharpen eyesight"] retrieved from NewScientestTech&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[arcade game]]s are action games, because they can be difficult for unskilled players, and thus make more money quickly.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Researchers from ''[[Helsinki School of Economics]]'' have shown that people playing a ''[[first-person shooter]]'' might secretly enjoy that their character gets killed in the game, although their expressions might show the contrary. The game used in the study was ''[[James Bond 007: Nightfire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2008/02/gamers-secretly-enjoy-getting-killed.html  "Gamers secretly enjoy getting killed "] retrieved from NewScientestTech&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==


A major turning point for action games came with the 1978 release of the [[shoot 'em up]] game ''[[Space Invaders]]'',&lt;ref name="1UP-50"/&gt; which marked the beginning of the [[golden age of arcade video games]].&lt;ref name="Whittaker-122"&gt;{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of ''Space Invaders''' mainstream success, the industry came to be dominated by action games,&lt;ref name="1UP-50"/&gt; which have remained the most dominant [[Video game genres|genre]] in [[Amusement arcade|video arcades]] and on [[Video game console|game consoles]] through to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with ''Space Invaders'',&lt;ref name="GS-SI-Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/spaceinvaders.shtm |title=The Gamespy Hall of Fame: Space Invaders |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |author=Kevin Bowen |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408152913/http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/spaceinvaders.shtm |archivedate=2008-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' from 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/838/838642p1.html | title = Asteroids Deluxe Review | author = Nate Ahearn | publisher = IGN | date = 2007-11-29 | accessdate = 2009-02-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/65tmzzT9T?url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/838/838642p1.html | archivedate = 2012-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pac-Man]]'' from 1980&lt;ref name="bandainamco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandainamcogames.co.jp/bnours/hotnews/index.php?id=21 |title=Bandai Namco press release for 25th Anniversary Edition |language=Japanese |quote={{lang|ja|2005年5月22日で生誕25周年を迎えた『パックマン』。}} ("Pac-Man celebrates his 25th anniversary on May 22, 2005", seen in image caption) |author=Namco Bandai Games Inc. |publisher=bandainamcogames.co.jp/ |date=2005-06-02 |accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230012914/http://www.bandainamcogames.co.jp/bnours/hotnews/index.php?id=21 |archivedate=2007-12-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also become iconic examples from the action genre.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', released in arcades in 1982, also became a classic in the shooter subgenre.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

In much the same way ''Space Invaders'' set the template for the [[shooter game]] subgenre,&lt;ref name="1UP-50"&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential 50: Space Invaders |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-space-invaders |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018124241/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-space-invaders |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2011-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP-10things"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3168373 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226064943/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3168373 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-26 |title=Ten Things Everyone Should Know About Space Invaders |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |author=Edwards, Benj |accessdate=2008-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' did the same for the [[platform game]] subgenre when it released in 1981.&lt;ref name="GRadar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming's most important evolutions|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=October 8, 2010|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1984 saw the emergence of martial arts themed games, with ''[[Karate Champ]]'' establishing the one-on-one [[fighting game]] subgenre,&lt;ref name="games.ign.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://games.ign.com/articles/840/840621p1.html | title = IGN's Top 10 Most Influential Games | publisher = IGN | author = Ryan Geddes &amp; Daemon Hatfield | date = 2007-12-10 | accessdate = 2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' laying the foundations for the [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] subgenre.&lt;ref name="tao1"&gt;Spencer, Spanner, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-tao-of-beat-em-ups-article?page=2 The Tao of Beat-'em-ups], ''Eurogamer'', Feb 6, 2008, Accessed Mar 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CGW"&gt;Kunkel, Bill; Worley, Joyce; Katz, Arnie, "The Furious Fists of Sega!", ''Computer Gaming World'', Oct 1988, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4833">The '''American Friends of the Middle East''' (AFME) was a pro-Arabist organization often critical of U.S. support for Israel that was formed in 1951 by columnist [[Dorothy Thompson]], [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]], and 24 further American educators, theologians, and writers (including [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]]).&lt;ref name=ZalanWilfordusnews14&gt;Kira Zalan, 2014, "How the CIA Shaped the Modern Middle East [Hugh Wilford interview]," ''U.S. News and World Report'' (online), January 16, 2014, see [https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/01/16/the-great-game-and-the-cia-shaped-the-modern-middle-east], accessed 17 June 2015.

The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], a Jewish news agency, noted that the organization "does not include a single Jew among its charter members, but has among them numerous outspoken Anti-Zionists,"&lt;ref name=JTA51&gt;JTA, 1951, "Dorothy Thompson’s 'American Friends of the Middle East' Outlines Program; Seeks Funds," ''Jewish Telegraphic Agency'' (archive, online), June 28, 1951, see [https://www.jta.org/1951/06/28/archive/dorothy-thompsons-american-friends-of-the-middle-east-outlines-program-seeks-funds], accessed 17 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; AND reported on a full page ad taken by the new organization in "the New York press" on June 27, 1951, reiterating its advertised purposes as follows:&lt;ref name=JTA51/&gt;
:1. “To break through the curtain of obscurity and distortion by writing and publicizing material designed to broaden understanding in the United States of Middle Eastern peoples, their problems, and progress.
:2. “To send representatives to the different countries; to pay particular attention to the various religious; to enable them to state their problems, and to assist them in having their voice heard in America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23470">The '''Anglophone Problem''', as it is commonly referred to in [[Cameroon]], is a socio-political issue rooted in Cameroon's colonial legacies from the [[Scramble for Africa|Germans]], [[British colonization of Africa|British]], and the [[Scramble for Africa|French]].

The issue classically and principally opposes many Cameroonians from the Northwest and Southwest regions, many of whom consider themselves anglophones, to the Cameroon government. This is based on the fact that these two regions (formally [[Southern Cameroons|British Southern Cameroons]]) were controlled by Britain as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] and [[United Nations trust territories|trust territory]] of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] respectively." 

== Background ==
While many Northwesterners and Southwesterners believe there is an anglophone problem, some do not. In fact, the term "anglophone" today creates a lot of controversy, as many former [[French language|French-speaking]] Cameroonians who are either bilingual or speak only English (most of whom have gone through the English sub-system of education) consider themselves as anglophones. The root of the Anglophone problem in Cameroon can be traced back to the Foumban Conference of 1961 that united the two territories, with different colonial legacies, into one state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Anglophone Problem is increasingly dominating the political agenda of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konings|first=Piet|year=1997|title=The Anglophone Problem in Cameroon|url=|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem has led to arguments and actions (protests, strikes, etc.) that argue for [[federalism]] or separation from the union by the Anglophones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Failure to address the Anglophone Problem threatens Cameroon's ability to create national unity between the two groups of people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Origins ==

=== The European colonizers ===
The roots of the Anglophone problem can be traced back to [[World War I]], when Cameroon was known as [[Kamerun|German Kamerun]]. The [[German Empire]] first gained influence in Cameroon in 1845 when Alfred Saker of the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] introduced a mission station.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|last=Olson|first=James|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1996|isbn=0-313-27917-9|location=|pages=169|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, German merchants established a factory: the Woermann Company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On July 5, 1884, local tribes provided the Woermann Company with rights to control the Kamerun River, consequently setting the foundation for the later [[German colonization of Africa|German colonization]] of Kamerun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1916, during World War I, [[French colonial empire|France]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] joined forces to [[Kamerun Campaign|attack and seize]] German Kamerun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] would award France and Britain mandates over Cameroon as punishment of the Germans who lost the war. Most of German Kamerun was given to the French, over 167,000 square miles of territory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The British were given [[British Cameroons|Northern Cameroons]], about 17,500 square miles of territory and [[Southern Cameroons]], 16,580 square miles. Each colonizer would later influence the colonies with their [[European languages]] and cultures, thus rendering them as Anglophones and Francophones. The large difference in awarded territory has resulted in present-day Cameroon having a huge majority Francophone population and a very small minority Anglophone population.

=== Gaining independence ===
Following [[World War II]], a wave of independence flowed rapidly throughout Africa. The [[United Nations]] obliged that Britain and France relinquish their colonies and guide them towards independence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cameroon-info.net/article/cameroon-bamenda-provincial-episcopal-conference-memorandum-to-president-paul-biya-on-the-current-situation-in-278001.html|title=Bamenda Provincial Episcopal Conference [BAPEC]|last=Anglophone Archbishops|first=|date=December 22, 2016|work=newspaper|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were three political options for British Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They could become independent by uniting with [[Nigeria]] or with [[French Cameroons|French Cameroun]]. No option of self-determination by becoming independent was given.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most desired option was independence with the least popular being unification with French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, during the [[British Cameroons referendum, 1961|British Plebiscite of 1961]], the British argued that Southern Cameroons was not economically viable enough to sustain itself as an independent nation and could only survive by joining with Nigeria or La République du Cameroun (the Republic of Cameroon).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though documents on the United Nations' "Non-Self-Governing Territories" state, "integration should be the result of the freely expressed wishes of the territory's peoples",&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International organisation and integration: a collection of the texts of documents relating to the United Nations, its related agencies and regional international organisations|last=Van Panhuys|first=H.F|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media Dordrecht|year=1968|isbn=978-1-4899-6229-4|location=|pages=288|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations would later reject Southern Cameroons' appeal to have independence as a sovereign nation placed on the ballot.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The plebiscite questions were:   
# ''Do you wish to achieve independence by joining the independent Federation of Nigeria?'' 
#  ''Do you wish to achieve independence by joining the independent Republic of Cameroun?''
The United Nations documents defined the basis of integration as: "Integration with an independent State should be on the basis of complete equality between the peoples of the erstwhile Non-Self-Governing Territory and those of the independent country with which it is integrated. The peoples of both territories should have equal status and rights of citizenship... at all levels in the executive, legislative and judicial organs of government."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With this promise in mind, on [[February 1961]], British Northern Cameroons voted to join Nigeria, while British Southern Cameroons voted to join La République du Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southern West Cameroon Revisited (1950-1972): Unveiling Inescapable Traps|last=Ndi|first=Anthony|publisher=Langaa RPCIG|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Foumban Conference of July 17–21, 1961 ===
The purpose of the [[Foumban Constitutional Conference]] was to create a [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] for the new Federal state of British Southern Cameroon and La République du Cameroun. The conference brought together representatives from La République du Cameroun, including [[Ahmadou Ahidjo|Amadou Ahidjo]], their president, with representatives from Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating an Anglophone Identity: A study of the politics of recognition and representation in Cameroon|last=Konings|first=Piet|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|year=2003|isbn=9004132953|location=Netherlands|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks before the Foumban Conference, there were reports that more than one hundred people were killed by terrorists in Loum, [[Bafang]], Ndom, and [[Douala]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africafederation.net/SouthernCameroon.htm|title=The Legal Argument for Southern Cameroon Independence|last=Dounge|first=Germanus|date=January 18, 2017|website=www.africafederation.net|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports worried unification advocates who wanted British Cameroon to unify with French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For the conference, the location of Foumban had been carefully chosen to make Ahidjo, appear as if he had everything under control. Mr. Mbile, a Southern Cameroonian representative at the conference noted, "Free from all the unrest that had scared Southern Cameroonians, the Francophone authorities had picked the place deliberately for the occasion. The entire town had been exquisitely cleaned up and houses splashed with whitewash. Food was good and receptions lavish. The climate in Foumban real or artificial went far to convince us that despite the stories of 'murder and fire,' there could be at least this island of peace, east of the Mungo."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Before the Foumban Conference, all the parties in Southern Cameroons, the Native Authority Councils and the traditional leaders attended the [[Bamenda Conference]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This conference decided on a common proposal to present when negotiations with La République du Cameroun arrived. Among many things, the Bamenda Conference agreed on a non-centralized federation to ensure there was a distinction between the powers of the states and the powers of the federation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Most of the proposals from the Bamenda Conference were ignored by Ahidjo.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anglophone Cameroon Predicament|last=Atanga|first=Mufor|publisher=Langaa Research &amp; Publishing CIG|year=2011|isbn=9956717118|location=Bamenda|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these proposals included having a [[bicameral]] legislature and decentralizing power, but instead a [[unicameral]] system was established with a centralized system of power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

At the Foumban conference, Ahidjo presented delegates with a draft constitution. By the end of the conference, instead of creating an entirely new constitution, the contributions of the Southern Cameroons delegates were reflected in suggestions made to the draft initially presented to them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[John Ngu Foncha]] and Ahidjo intended for the Foumban Constitutional Conference to be brief, however delegates left the three day conference with the impression that there would be sequential conferences to continue the drafting of the constitution.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Mbile later noted, "We may have done more if we had spent five months instead of five days in writing our constitution at Foumban."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Constitution for the new Federal Republic was agreed in Yaoundé in August 1961, between Ahidjo and Foncha, pending approval by the House of Assembly of the two states.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the end, the West Cameroon House of Assembly never ratified the Constitution.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, on October 1, 1961, the Federal Republic of Cameroon nevertheless came to fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On May 6, 1972, Ahidjo announces his decision to convert the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] into a [[unitary state]], on the provision that the idea was supported via referendum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This suggestion violated the articles in the Foumban document that read: 'any proposal for the revision of the present constitution, which impairs the unity and integrity of the Federation shall be inadmissible,' and 'proposals for revision shall be adopted by simple majority vote of the members of the Federal Assembly, provided that such majority includes a majority of the representatives ... of each of the Federated States,'... not through referendum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such violations easily allowed for the passing of the referendum that turned the Federal Republic into the United Republic of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking into account these actions, the evidence shows that the Francophone's intentions may have not been to form a federal state, but rather to annex Southern Cameroons and not treat them as equals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1984, Ahidjo's successor, [[Paul Biya]], replaced the name "United Republic of Cameroon" with "La République du Cameroun," the same name the francophone Cameroon had before federation talks.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Achankeng|first=Fonkem|year=2014|title=The Foumban "Constitutional" Talks and Prior Intentions of Negotiating: A Historico-Theoretical Analysis of a False Negotiation and the Ramications for Political Developments in Cameroon|url=|journal=Journal of Global Initiatives: Policy, Pedagogy, Perspective|volume=9|pages=149|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With changes in the Constitution of 1996, reference to the existence of a territory called the British Southern Cameroons that had a "functioning self-government and recognized international boundaries" was essentially erased.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== The Anglophone problem ==
Despite the non-acknowledgement/denial of the Anglophone problem from Francophone government leaders,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; there exists a discontent by Anglophones, both young and old, as to how Anglophones are treated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This discontent presents itself in calls for federation or separation with movements that are garnering strength.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the core of Anglophone grievances is the loss of the former West Cameroons as a "distinct community defined by differences in official language and inherited colonial traditions of education, law, and public administration."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eyoh|first=Dickson|year=1998|title=Conflicting Narratives of Anglophone Protest and the Politics of Identity in Cameroon|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2016, in a letter to [[Paul Biya]], the Anglophone Archbishops of Southern Cameroons define the Anglophone problem as follows:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The failure of successive governments of Cameroon, since 1961, to respect and implement the articles of the Constitution that uphold and safeguard what British Southern Cameroons brought along to the Union in 1961.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The flagrant disregard for the Constitution, demonstrated by the dissolution of political parties and the formation of one political party in 1966, the sacking of Jua and the appointment of [[Salomon Tandeng Muna|Muna]] in 1968 as the Prime Minister of West Cameroon, and other such acts judged by West Cameroonians to be unconstitutional and undemocratic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
# The cavalier management of the 1972 Referendum which took out the foundational element (Federalism) of the 1961 Constitution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The 1984 Law amending the Constitution, which gave the country the original East Cameroon name (The Republic of Cameroon) and thereby erased the identity of the West Cameroonians from the original union. West Cameroon, which had entered the union as an equal partner, effectively ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The deliberate and systematic erosion of the West Cameroon cultural identity which the 1961 Constitution sought to preserve and protect by providing for a bi-cultural federation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Separation ===
Movements which advocate the separation of English-speaking Cameroon from French-speaking Cameroun exist, led by the [[Cameroon Action Group]], the [[Southern Cameroons Youth League]], the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]], the [[Southern Cameroon Peoples Organization]] and the [[Ambazonia Movement]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Federation ===
Advocates of Federation want a return to the constitution agreed upon in the 1961 Foumban Conference that acknowledges the history and culture of the two regions while giving equal power to the two.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This federation had been dismantled on 20 May 1972 by the larger French-speaking Cameroon and extended the latter's executive power throughout West Cameroon.  Federation advocates include the instrumental Consortium of the leaders of three Cameroon-based trade unions: Lawyers, Teachers, and Transporters. It also includes some Cameroonians in the diaspora led by a well organized US-based Anglophone Action Group, Inc. (AAG).  AAG was one of the first groups in the diaspora to endorse the Cameroon-based Consortium as a peaceful alternative to achieving a return to the pre-1972 federated system. Opponents of federation include the ruling [[Cameroon Peoples Democratic Movement]].

=== Unitary ===
Unitarianism do not want Federation or Separation, but rather a decentralized unitary government; whereas, now the government is highly centralized in power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This violates the tenets of the 1996 Constitution as decentralization has yet to be implemented.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Struggle for political representation ==
In March 1990, the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF) led by [[John Fru Ndi]], was founded on the perception of widespread Anglophone alienation. The SDF was the first major opposition party to the People's Democratic Movement, led by Paul Biya.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Symptoms of Anglophone discontent ==
Below are various reasons that Anglophones feel marginalized, systemically, by the government. 
* The National Entrance Examinations into Schools that develop the human resources of Cameroon are set by the French Subsystem of Education. This makes it difficult for Anglophones and Francophones to compete on an equal playing field. The Examination Board members are all Francophone, which places some bias against Anglophone candidates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* There are five Ministries that concern education and none of them are Anglophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Of the 36 Ministers who defended the budgets for the Ministries last month, only one was Anglophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* In the 1961 Constitution, the Vice President was the second most important person in state protocol. Today, the Prime Minister (appointed Anglophone) is the fourth most important person in State Protocol, after the President of the Senate and the President of the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Prioritization of French over English ===

* State institutions put documents and public notices in French, with no English translations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* National Entrance Examinations into some professional schools are set in French only, sometimes even in English-speaking regions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Most of the heads of government offices only speak French, even in the English-speaking regions. Visitors and clients to government offices are then expected to speak in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Most Senior Administrators and members of the Forces of Law and Order in the Northwest and Southwest Regions are French-speaking and there is a lack of effort for them to demonstrate an understanding of anglophone culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* Members of Inspection Teams, Missions and Facilitators for Seminars sent from the Ministries in Yaoundé to Southern Cameroon are mostly French speaking, and English speaking audience are expecting to understand them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* Most of the Military Tribunals in the Northwest and Southwest Regions conduct their courts in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Finance documents such as the COBAC Code, the CIMA Code and the [[OHADA]] Code are all in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* The Magistrates in the Southern Cameroon regions are disproportionately Francophone. In addition, other government-appointed officials such as the Senior Divisional Officers, the Divisional Officers, Commissioners, and Commandants are disproportionately Francophone. There are Francophone principals in Anglophone schools, and Hospitals, Banks and Mobile Telephone Companies are predominantly Francophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Spiraling ==
{{As of|2017}}, the Anglophone problem is still on-going. It has spiraled into violence with police officers and gendarmes shooting dead several civilians. Official sources have put the number at 17 dead, but local individuals and groups have talked of 50 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/10/02/cameroon-s-anglophone-crisis-resulted-in-17-deaths-amnesty//|title=Cameroon's Anglophone crisis resulted in 17 deaths - Amnesty {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical members of some secessionist groups have killed several police officers and gendarmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/11/29/four-soldiers-killed-in-cameroon-s-anglophone-region//|title=Four soldiers killed in Cameroon's Anglophone region {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15,000 refugees have fled Southern Cameroons into neighboring Nigeria, with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] expecting that number to grow to 40,000 if the situation continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1179202/cameroons-anglophone-crisis-is-threatening-to-spin-out-of-control/|title=Cameroon’s Anglophone crisis is threatening to spin out of control|last=Dahir|first=Abdi Latif|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==
Without clearly acknowledging the existence of the Anglophone problem, the President of Cameroon has attempted to appease tensions by making a number of announcements:
* President Biya ordered the creation of a Common Law department at the Supreme Court and the School of Administration and Magistracy, ENAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameroonpostline.com/biya-orders-creation-of-common-law-depts-at-supreme-court-enam/|title=Biya Orders Creation Of Common Law Depts At Supreme Court, ENAM {{!}} CameroonPostline|website=www.cameroonpostline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his 2017 traditional end-of-year address, he announced there will be an effective decentralization scheme implemented by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/16-president-paul-biya-to-the-nationzzz|title=President Paul BIYA to the Nation|website=www.prc.cm|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of decentralization is one of the major tenets of [[Constitution of Cameroon#Constitution of the Republic of Cameroon of 1996|Cameroon's 1996 constitution]] which was spearheaded by the Anglophone opposition groups in parliament.
[[List of active separatist movements in Africa|Several separatist or secessionist groups]] have emerged or become more prominent as a result of the harsh response by the government to the Anglophone problem. These groups desire to see Southern Cameroons completely separate from ''[[Cameroon|La République du Cameroun]]'' and form its own state, sometimes referred to as ''[[Ambazonia]]''. Some groups such as the ''Southern Cameroon Ambazonia United Front'' (SCACUF) are using diplomatic means in an attempt to gain independence for the Anglophone regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ambagov.org/|title=Click To Learn More About The Interim Government of Ambazonia - AmbaGov|website=ambagov.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other groups have begun to employ armed confrontation with artisan weapons against the deployed gendarmes and soldiers in those regions.

'''Aššur''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|ʊər}}; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]; {{lang-syr|ܐܫܘܪ}} ''Āšūr''; [[Old Persian]] {{Script/Cuneiform|peo|𐎠𐎰𐎢𐎼}} ''Aθur'', {{lang-fa|آشور}}: ''Āšūr''; {{lang-he-n|אַשּׁוּר}}: ''{{transl|he|Aššûr}}'', {{lang-ar|اشور}}), also known as '''Ashur''' and '''Qal'at Sherqat''', was an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] city, capital of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (2025–1750 BC), of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1050 BC), and for a time, of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] of 911–608 BC. The remains of the city lie on the western bank of the [[Tigris River]], north of the confluence with the tributary [[Little Zab]] River, in modern-day [[Iraq]], more precisely in the [[Al-Shirqat District]] of the [[Saladin Governorate]].

Occupation of the city itself continued for approximately 4,000 years, from the mid-3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R44VRnNCzAYC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=assur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xpdZ0XG04T&amp;sig=2tZ3paHPfNYT7O9rnBIjPZzVtRE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5o6ScjJLQAhUG4iYKHRrFBys4ChDoAQg2MAk International Dictionary of Historic Places: Middle East and Africa, Volume 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Ashur-ancient-city-Iraq ''Encyclopædia Britannica'': "Ashur (ancient city, Iraq)"]&lt;/ref&gt; to the mid-14th century AD, when the forces of [[Timur]] massacred its still [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] (and by then [[Christian]]) population. The site is a [[World Heritage Site]], having been added to that organisation's list of sites in danger in 2003 following the conflict that erupted following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and as a result of a proposed dam which would flood some of the site. Assur lies 65&amp;nbsp;km (40&amp;nbsp;mi) south of the site of [[Nimrud]] and 100&amp;nbsp;km (60&amp;nbsp;mi) south of [[Nineveh]].

==History of research==
Exploration of the site of Assur began in 1898 by German archaeologists. Excavations began in 1900 by [[Friedrich Delitzsch]], and were continued in 1903–1913 by a team from the [[Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] led initially by [[Robert Koldewey]] and later by [[Walter Andrae]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Andrae, Der Anu-Adad-Tempel in Assur, JC Hinrichs, 1909, (1984 reprint {{ISBN|3-7648-1805-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Andrae, Die Stelenreihen in Assur, JC Hinrichs, 1913, (1972 reprint {{ISBN|3-535-00587-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Andrae, Die archaischen Ischtar-Tempel in Assur, JC Hinrichs, 1922, (1970 reprint {{ISBN|3-7648-1806-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Andrae, Hethitische Inschriften auf Bleistreifen aus Assur, JC Hinrichs, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Andrae, Das wiedererstandene Assur, 1938, JC Hinrichs, (1977 reprint {{ISBN|3-406-02947-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; More than 16,000 [[clay tablet|tablets]] with [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts were discovered. Many of the objects found made their way to the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin.

More recently, Ashur was excavated by B. Hrouda for the [[University of Munich]] and the Bavarian Ministry of Culture in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Excavations in Iraq 1989–1990, Iraq, vol. 53, pp. 169-182, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, in 1988 and 1989, the site was being worked by R. Dittmann on behalf of the [[German Research Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Dittmann, Ausgrabungen der Freien Universitat Berlin in Ashur und Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta in den Jahren 1986-1989, [[:de:MDPG|MDOG]], vol. 122, pp. 157–171, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
{{main|Name of Syria}}
''{{lang|akk-Latn|Aššur}}'' is the name of the city, of the land ruled by the city, and of its [[Ashur (deity)|tutelary deity]] from which the natives take their name, as did the entire nation of [[Assyria]] which encompassed what is today northern Iraq, north east Syria and south east Turkey. Today the Assyrians are still found throughout the Middle East, particularly in [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], and the Diaspora in the western world. Assur ([[Assurayu]]) is also the origin of the names [[Syria]] and [[Terms for Syriac Christians|Syriac]], these being originally [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] derivations of [[Assyria]], and for many centuries applying only to Assyria and the Assyrians (see [[Etymology of Syria]]) before also being applied to the [[Levant]] and its inhabitants by the [[Seleucid Empire]] in the 3rd century BC.

==Early Bronze Age==
Archaeology reveals the site of the city was occupied by the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. This was still the [[History of Sumer|Sumerian period]], before [[Assyria]] emerged in the 25th to 21st century BC.  The oldest remains of the city were discovered in the foundations of the [[Ishtar]] temple, as well as at the Old Palace. In the subsequent period, the city was ruled by kings from the [[Akkadian Empire]].  During the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], the city was ruled by Assyrian  governors subject to the [[Sumerian people|Sumerians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/ashur/|title=Ashur|author=Joshua J. Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old and Middle Assyrian Empire==
[[File:Meso2mil-English.JPG|left|thumb|[[Mesopotamia]] in 2nd millennium BC]]
[[File:AthurMdinta.jpg|thumb|right|Layout and expansion of the city over the centuries]]

By the time the Neo-Sumerian Ur-III dynasty collapsed at the hands of the [[Elam]]ites around the end of the 21st century BC according to the Middle Chronology and mid-20th century according to the Short Chronology following increasing raids by [[Gutians]] and [[Amorites]]. The native Akkadian-speaking Assyrian kings were now free while Sumer fell under the yoke of the [[Amorites]]. The Assyrian king [[Ushpia]] who reigned around the 21st century BC is credited with dedicating the first temple of the god Ashur in his home city, although this comes from a later inscription from [[Shalmaneser I]] in the 13th century. The temple likely dates to the original settlement of the site when the people of Ashur established their nation under the patronage of the city's god. Soon after in around 2000 BC, [[Puzur-Ashur I]] founded a new dynasty, with his successors such as [[Ilushuma]], [[Erishum I]] and [[Sargon I]] leaving inscriptions regarding the building of temples to [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], [[Adad]] and [[Ishtar]] in the city. Prosperity and independence produced the first significant fortifications in this period. As the region enjoyed relative peace and stability, trade between [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Anatolia]] increased, and the city of Ashur greatly benefited from its strategic location. Merchants would dispatch their merchandise via caravan into Anatolia and trade primarily at Assyrian colonies in Anatolia, the primary one being at Karum Kanesh ([[Kültepe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/ashur/|title=Ashur|author=Joshua J. Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Shamshi-Adad I]]'s (1813–1781 BC) capital at Assur, he magnified the city's power and influence beyond the Tigris river valley, establishing what some regard as the first Assyrian Empire. In this era, the Great Royal Palace was built, and the temple of Assur was expanded and enlarged with a [[ziggurat]]. However, this empire met its end when [[Hammurabi]], the [[Amorite]] king of [[Babylon]] conquered and incorporated the city into his short lived empire following the death of [[Ishme-Dagan I]] around 1756 BC, while the next three Assyrian kings were viewed as vassals. Not long after, the native king [[Adasi]] expelled the [[Babylonia]]ns and Amorites from Assur and Assyria as a whole around 1720 BC, although little is known of his successors. Evidence of further building activity is known from a few centuries later, during the reign of a native king [[Puzur-Ashur III]], when the city was refortified and the southern districts incorporated into the main city defenses. Temples to the moon god [[Sin]] ([[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]) and the sun god [[Shamash]] were built and dedicated through the 15th century BC. The city was subsequently subjugated by the king of [[Mitanni]], [[Shaushtatar]] in the late 15th century, taking the gold and silver doors of the temple to his capital, Washukani, as spoils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/ashur/|title=Ashur|author=Joshua J. Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashur-uballit I]] emulated his ancestor Adasi and overthrew the Mitanni empire in 1365 BC. The Assyrians reaped the benefits of this triumph by taking control of the eastern portion of the Mitanni Empire, and later also annexing [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Babylonia]]n, [[Amorite]] and [[Hurrian]] territory. The following centuries witnessed the restoration of the old temples and palaces of Assur, and the city once more became the throne of a magnanimous empire from 1365 BC to 1076 BC. [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244–1208 BC) also constructed a new temple to the goddess [[Ishtar]]. The [[Anu]]-[[Adad]] temple was established later during the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115–1075 BC). The walled area of the city in the Middle Assyrian period made up some {{convert|1.2|km2|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/ashur/|title=Ashur|author=Joshua J. Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Assyrian Empire==

In the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (912–605 BC), the royal residence was transferred to other Assyrian cities. [[Ashur-nasir-pal II]] (884–859 BC) moved the capital from Assur to Kalhu ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) following a series of successful campaigns and produced some of the greatest artworks in the form of colossal [[lamassu]] statues and low-relief depictions of the royal court as well as battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/ashur/|title=Kalhu|author=Joshua J. Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the reign of [[Sargon II]] (722–705 BC), a new capital began to rise. [[Dur-Sharrukin]] (Fortress of [[Sargon II|Sargon]]) on a scale set to surpass that of Ashurnasirpal's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/ashur/|title=Dur-Sharrukin|author=Joshua J. Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he died in battle and his son and successor [[Sennacherib]] (705–682 BC) abandoned the city, choosing to magnify Niniveh as his royal capital. However, the city of Ashur remained the religious center of the empire and continued to be revered as the holy crown of the empire, due to its temple of the national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]. In the reign of [[Sennacherib]] (705–682 BC), the House of the New Year, ''Akitu'', was built, and the festivities celebrated in the city. Many of the kings were also buried beneath the Old Palace while some queens were buried in the other capitals such as the wife of Sargon, Ataliya. The city was sacked and largely destroyed during the decisive [[Fall of Assur|battle of Assur]], a major confrontation between the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] and [[Medes|Median]] armies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=P5q7DDqMbF0C&amp;pg=PA854&amp;lpg=PA854&amp;dq=fall+of+assur+614+BC&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jkZfUmr0o8&amp;sig=Rhx269A-xlDAcIErwjh94Scv0w0&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj0l8SB_cHaAhVPalAKHROHBZ84ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=fall%20of%20assur%20614%20BC&amp;f=true/ A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East] "In 614 BC Assur was conquered by the Medes under king Cyaxares (625-585 BC)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=78nRWgb-rp8C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=fall+of+nimrud+medes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GXv9WjYvo5&amp;sig=TrdBe6iJy6DgKZ-D3XfEfi2oues&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifm5eU1dbaAhUQYVAKHSobBbcQ6AEIdDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=fall%20of%20nimrud%20medes&amp;f=false/ The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah Under Babylonian Rule] "the Medes left Arrapha, attacked Kalhu (Nimrud) and Ninuwa (Nineveh), and continued rapidly northward to capture the nearby city of Tarbisu. Afterward, they went back down the Tigris and laid siege to the city of Assur. The Babylonian army came to the aid of the Medes only after the Medes had begun the decisive offensive against the city, capturing it, killing many of its residents, and taking many others captive."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achaemenid Empire==
After the Medes were overthrown by the [[Persian people|Persians]] as the dominant force in ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). The Assyrians of Mada ([[Media (region)|Media]]) and [[Athura]] (Assyria) had been responsible for gold and glazing works of the palace and for providing Lebanese cedar timber, respectively. The city and region of Ashur had once more gained a degree of militaristic and economic strength. Along with the Assyrians in Mada, a revolt took place in 520 BC but ultimately failed. Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria|publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html| archivedate= 14 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parthian Empire==
[[File:Assur temple.jpg|thumb|120px|Parthian temple in Assur.]]
The city revived during the [[Parthian Empire]] period, particularly between 150 BC and 270 AD, being resettled and becoming an administrative centre of Parthian-ruled [Assuristan]]. Assyriologists [[Simo Parpola]] and [[Patricia Crone]] suggest Assur may have had outright independence in this period. Other polities such as [[Beth Garmai]], [[Beth Nuhadra]] and [[Adiabene]] also flourished due to the fact that the Parthians exercised only loose or intermittent control of Assyria. New administrative buildings were erected to the north of the old city, and a palace to the south. The old temple dedicated to the national god of the Assyrians Assur ([[Ashur]]) was rebuilt, as were temples to other Assyrian gods.

Assyrian [[Eastern Aramaic]] inscriptions from the remains of Ashur have yielded insight into the Parthian-era city with Assyria having its own Aramaic [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] script, which was the same in terms of grammar and syntax as that found at [[Edessa]] and elsewhere in the state of [[Osroene]].

German archaeologist Klaus Beyer published over 600 inscriptions from Mesopotamian towns and cities including Ashur, [[Dura-Europos]], [[Hatra]], [[Gaddala]], [[Tikrit]] and [[Tur Abdin]]. Given that Christianity had begun to spread amongst the Assyrians throughout the Parthian era, the original Assyrian culture and religion persisted for some time, as proven by the inscriptions that include invocations to the gods [[Ashur]], [[Nergal]], [[Sin]], [[Ishtar]] and [[Shamash]], as well as mentions of citizens having compound names that refer to Assyrian gods, such as ʾAssur-ḥēl (Ashur [is] my strength), ʾAssur-emar (Ashur decreed/commanded), ʾAssur-ntan (Ashur gave [a son]), and ʾAssur-šma' (Ashur has heard; cf. [[Esarhaddon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beyer|1998|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman historian [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] wrote in about 370 that in AD 116 [[Trajan]] formed from his conquests east of the [[Euphrates]] the new Roman provinces of Mesopotamia and [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]]. The existence of the latter Roman province is questioned by C.S. Lightfoot and F. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-studies/article/trajans-parthian-war-and-the-fourthcentury-perspective/D5CCE57D517EE6E9AF24CAD504E72371 C. S. Lightfoot, "Trajan's Parthian War and the Fourth-Century Perspective" in ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 80 (1990), pp. 115-126]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kettenhofen&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/trajan Erich Kettenhofen, "Trajan" in ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/classical-quarterly/article/another-look-at-the-breviarium-of-festus/6E9C796F42187BFBC7671CC48B1A9DD8 Simon Grote, "Another look at the ''Breviarium'' of Festus" in ''The Classical Quarterly'', Volume 61, Issue 2 (December 2011), pp. 704-721]&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, just two years after the province's supposed creation, Trajan's successor [[Hadrian]] restored Trajan's eastern conquests to the Parthians, preferring to live with him in peace and friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_gWcNAAAAQAAJ/page/n411 Theodore Mommsen, ''Römische Geschichte'' (Berlin 1885), vol. V (''Die Provinzen von Caesar bis Diocletian''), p. 403]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There were later Roman incursions into Mesopotamia under [[Lucius Verus]] and under [[Septimius Severus]], who set up the Roman provinces of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] and [[Osroene]].

The Persian [[Shapur I]] (241–272) captured and sacked the city in 257 AD after doing the same to [[Osroene]], [[Adiabene]], [[Beth Nuhadra]], [[Beth Garmai]] and  [[Hatra]], incorporating them into the [[Sassanid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-9RNCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Iraq:+The+ancient+sites+and+Iraqi+Kurdistan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjvPTbrovNAhWj2qYKHTWgA4cQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Iraq%3A%20The%20ancient%20sites%20and%20Iraqi%20Kurdistan&amp;f=false|title= Iraq: The ancient sites and Iraqi Kurdistan|author=Geoff Hann|page=246|year=2015|isbn=9781841624884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Hatra|title=Hatra|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though destroyed by Shapur I, the city remained inhabited until the 12th and 13th century, when it belonged successively to the [[Zengid dynasty]] and the [[Ilkhanate]]. It was then abandoned and in part used as a cemetery.&lt;ref name="History of the city"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html|title=History of the city|work=Assur.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats to Assur==
The site was put on [[UNESCO]]'s List of [[World Heritage]] in danger in 2003, at which time the site was threatened by a looming large-scale dam project that would have submerged the ancient archaeological site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1130/threats/ UNESCO World Heritage in Danger 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;  The dam project was put on hold shortly after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

The territory around the ancient site was occupied by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) in 2015. Since ISIL had [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|destroyed]] a number of ancient Assyrian sites, including the cities of [[Hatra]], [[Khorsabad]], and [[Nimrud]], fears rose that Assur would be destroyed too. According to some sources, the citadel of Assur was destroyed or badly damaged in May 2015 by members of IS using [[improvised explosive device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mezzofiore |first1=Gianluca |last2=Limam |first2=Arij|title=Iraq: Isis 'blows up Unesco world heritage Assyrian site of Ashur' near Tikrit|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-blows-unesco-world-heritage-assyrian-site-ashur-near-tikrit-1503367|accessdate=24 August 2015|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2017, the group no longer controls the site, however it is not secure enough for archaeological experts to evaluate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iraqis-seek-funds-to-rebuild-cultural-artifacts-controlled-by-isis/|title=Iraqis seek funds to restore cultural artifacts recovered from ISIS|work=Associated Press|publisher=CBS News|date=February 24, 2017|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Budilnik''''' ({{lang-ru|Будильник}}, Alarm clock) was a weekly&lt;ref&gt;in 1865-1866 it was coming twice a week&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Empire|Russian]] illustrated satirical journal published originally, in 1865—1871, in [[Saint Petersburg]], then, in 1873—1917, in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="periodicals"&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/periodic/pp0-abc/pp1/pp1-4601.htm ''Budilnik'']. Russian Periodicals, 1702-1894 // Русская периодическая печать (1702—1894): Справочник. Госполитиздат, 1959, 460—461&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The magazine was founded by the artist and caricaturist [[Nikolai Stepanov]] (formerly a co-editor of ''[[Iskra (magazine)|Iskra]]'', with [[Vasily Kurochkin]]) who for six years was its editor-in-chief. During this time ''Bidilnik'' was (alongside ''Iskra'') the leading force of political satire in Russia, warring with the right wing and conservative press, mostly [[Mikhail Katkov|Katkov]]'s ''[[Moskovskiye Vedomosti]]'' and [[Andrey Krayevsky|Krayevsky]]'s ''[[Golos (newspaper)|Golos]]''.&lt;ref name="br_ef"&gt;[https://slovar.cc/enc/brokhauz-efron/1587342.html Budilnik] at the [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's circulation reached its peak in 1866 (around 4200) and since then was slowly declining. In mid-1870s ''Budilnik'' became an apolitical, purely entertaining journal. Among his later editors were A.P. Sukhov, A.D. Kurepin, L.N. Utkin, E.G. Arnold, Nikolai Kicheyev, Vladimir Levinsky. 

Among the authors who contributed to it regularly were [[Pyotr Weinberg]] (in 1866-1867 the head of its literary section, pen names: [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] form [[Tambov]], The Melancholic), [[Liodor Palmin]], Ivan Dmitriyev (originally the head of its literary section), [[Gavriil Zhulev]] (also: The Grieving Poet), [[Nikolai Zlatovratsky]] (N. Cherevanin), [[Dmitry Minayev]] (Literature Domino, 40 Year Old Dandy, Dark Man), [[Alexander Levitov]], [[Nikolai Leykin]], [[Fyodor Mikhaylovich Reshetnikov|Fyodor Reshetnikov]], [[Vladimir Shchiglev]], [[Mikhail Stopanovsky]], [[Konstantin Stanyukovich]], [[Gleb Uspensky]] (as D. Petrov, V. Pechkin), [[Anton Chekhov]] (Antosha Chekhonte, G. Baldastov, My Brother's Brother, Patientless Doctor).&lt;ref name="periodicals"/&gt;

'''Cara Sucia''' is a [[Mesoamerica]]n archaeological site in western [[El Salvador]]. The site was first settled in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]] and was finally abandoned around 900 AD, in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]], when the [[Pipil people]] moved into the region, although there is no evidence of Pipil occupation at the site.&lt;ref name=Kelly307&gt;Kelly (1996), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cobos81&gt;Cobos (1994, 1998), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that during the Early Preclassic (1200&amp;ndash;500 BC), the site was occupied by people who spoke a forerunner of the [[Mayan languages]], and during the Late Preclassic period the site has evidence of contact with [[Chalchuapa]] and with [[Kaminaljuyu]] in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]].&lt;ref name=GuthrieHingston135&gt;Guthrie Hingston (1989, 2003), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is one of the most important archaeological sites in western El Salvador, but has not been restored. It consists of a number of grass-covered mounds, some of which are very large.&lt;ref name=Kelly307 /&gt; Archaeologist Paul Amaroli has carried out investigations at the site.&lt;ref name=Kelly307 /&gt; Stylistic similarities of the [[Mesoamerican architecture|architecture]], ceramics and sculpture of the site indicate a link with the [[Cotzumalhuapa]] culture in Pacific [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name=Kelly307 /&gt; Cara Sucia is the southeasternmost regional centre associated with this culture.&lt;ref name=GuthrieHingston135 /&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web | title=Cara Sucia / El Imposible | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/207/ | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cara Sucia appears to have experienced two principal phases of occupation, the first of which lasted from the Middle Preclassic through to the Late Preclassic and the second from approximately AD 650 to AD 950, in the Late to Terminal Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos (1994, 1998), pp. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal structures at the site date to the second phase of occupation, during the Late Classic.&lt;ref name=cobos68&gt;Cobos (1994, 1998), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Late Classic architecture at Cara Sucia includes temples, rectangular houses, two enclosed [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]]s and a large platform supporting various smaller structures.&lt;ref name=GuthrieHingston135 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cobos68 /&gt; Cara Sucia appears to have been an important site for the manufacture of ceramic figurines and whistles.&lt;ref name=GuthrieHingston135 /&gt;

Nineteenth-century historian Santiago Ignacio Barbarena first reported the archaeological site with the discovery of various artefacts there, including a stone sculpture of a jaguar head.&lt;ref name=GuthrieHingston135 /&gt; Cara Sucia has been severely damaged by looters since the [[Economy of El Salvador#Agriculture and land reform|Land Reform Programme of 1980]], with over 5000 looters' trenches having been recorded.&lt;ref name=GuthrieHingston135 /&gt; After controls were placed on the import of artefacts to the United States in 1987, the scale of looting was dramatically reduced by the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie Hingston (1989, 2003), pp. 135-145.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 Cara Sucia was entered on the [[World Heritage Site#Nominating process|UNESCO World Heritage Tentative Lists]], together with the [[El Imposible National Park]].&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt;

[[File:Sahih_Al-Bukhari_in_English.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sahih_Al-Bukhari_in_English.png|thumb|Book of [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Sahih Bukhari]], featuring 3882 chapters.]]

A '''chapter''' is one of the main divisions of a piece of writing of relative length, such as a [[book]] of [[prose]], [[poetry]], or [[law]]. A chapter book may have multiple chapters and these can be referred to by the things that may be the main topic of that specific chapter. In each case, chapters can be numbered or titled or both.  An example of a chapter that has become well known is "Down the [[White Rabbit|Rabbit]]-Hole", which is the first chapter from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

==Chapter structure==

Many [[novel]]s of great length have chapters. [[Non-fiction]] books, especially those used for reference, almost always have chapters for ease of navigation. In these works, chapters are often subdivided into [[Section (writing)|sections]]. Larger works with a lot of chapters often group them in several 'parts' as the main subdivision of the book.

The chapters of reference works are almost always listed in a [[table of contents]]. Novels sometimes use a table of contents, but not always. If chapters are used they are normally numbered sequentially; they may also have titles, and in a few cases an epigraph or prefatory quotation. In older novels it was a common practice to summarise the content of each chapter in the table of contents and/or in the beginning of the chapter.

==Unusual numbering schemes==

In works of fiction, authors sometimes number their chapters eccentrically, often as a [[metafictional]] statement.  For example:
*''[[Seiobo There Below]]'' by [[László Krasznahorkai]] has chapters numbered according to the [[Fibonacci sequence]].
*''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]] only has chapters which are [[prime numbers]].
*''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'' by [[Flann O'Brien]] has the first page titled ''Chapter 1'', but has no further chapter divisions.
*''God, A Users' Guide'' by [[Seán Moncrieff]] is chaptered backwards (i.e., the first chapter is chapter 20 and the last is chapter 1). The novel ''[[The_Running_Man_(novel)|The Running Man]]'' by [[Stephen King]] also uses a similar chapter numbering scheme.
*Every novel in the series ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' by [[Lemony Snicket]] has [[triskaidekaphobia|thirteen]] chapters, except the final instalment (''[[The End (A Series of Unfortunate Events)|The End]]''), which has a fourteenth chapter formatted as its own novel.
*''[[Mammoth (John Varley)|Mammoth]]'' by [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]] has the chapters ordered chronologically from the point of view of a non-time-traveler, but, as most of the characters travel through time, this leads to the chapters defying the conventional order.
*''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] has its 18 chapters labelled as episodes, with 3 books split between them.

==Book-like==
In [[ancient civilization]]s, books were often in the form of [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] [[scroll]]s, which contained about the same amount of text as a typical chapter in a modern book. This is the reason chapters in recent reproductions and translations of works of these periods are often presented as "Book 1", "Book 2" etc.

In the early printed era, long works were often published in multiple volumes, such as the Victorian [[Three-volume novel|triple decker novel]], each divided into numerous chapters. Modern omnibus reprints will often retain the volume divisions. In some cases the chapters will be numbered consecutively all the way through, such that "Book 2" might begin with "Chapter 9", but in other cases the numbering might reset after each part (i.e., "Book 2, Chapter 1"). Even though the practice of dividing novels into separate volumes is rare in modern publishing, many authors still structure their works into "Books" or "Parts" and then subdivide them into chapters. A notable example of this is [[The Lord of the Rings]] which consists of six 'Books', each with a recognizable part of the story, although it is usually published in three volumes.

The '''Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007''' (full name: '''Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007''' ({{USBill|110|S.|1348}})) was a bill discussed in the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] [[United States Congress]] that would have provided legal status and a path to citizenship for the approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants residing in the [[United States]]. The bill was portrayed as a compromise between providing a path to citizenship for illegal aliens and increased border enforcement: it included funding for {{convert|300|mi|km}} of vehicle barriers, 105 camera and radar towers, and 20,000 more Border Patrol agents, while simultaneously restructuring visa criteria around high-skilled workers. The bill also received heated criticism from both sides of the immigration debate. The bill was introduced in the [[United States Senate]] on May 9, 2007, but was never voted on, though a series of votes on amendments and [[cloture]] took place. The last vote on cloture, on June 7, 2007, 11:59&amp;nbsp;AM, failed 34–61 effectively ending the bill's chances. A related bill S. 1639, on June 28, 2007, 11:04&amp;nbsp;AM, also failed 46–53.

==Legislative history==
The bill was a compromise based largely on three previous failed immigration reform bills:

* [[Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act (S. 1033)|The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act (S. 1033)]], a bill proposed in May 2005 by Senators [[Ted Kennedy]] and [[John McCain]], sometimes referred to as the "McCain–Kennedy or McKennedy Bill."
* '''The Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act of 2005 (S. 1438)''', a bill proposed in July 2005 by Senators [[John Cornyn]] and [[Jon Kyl]], sometimes referred to as the "Cornyn–Kyl Bill."
* [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006|The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611)]], sponsored by Senator [[Arlen Specter]], which was passed in the Senate in May 2006 but never passed in the House.

The bill's sole sponsor in the Senate was Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]], though it was crafted in large part as a result of efforts by Senators Kennedy, McCain and Kyl, along with Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], and input from President [[George W. Bush]], who strongly supported the bill. For that reason it was referred to in the press by various combinations of these five men's names, most commonly "Kennedy–Kyl". A larger group of senators was involved in creating the bill, sometimes referred to as the 'Gang of 12'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18842287/ 'Gang of 12' mulls over immigration bill], ''[[Associated Press]]'', May 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[David Vitter]] of Louisiana led the opposition to the bill, clashing with McCain and Senator [[Chuck Hagel]] of Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Walsh |first=Bill|author2=Colley Charpentier |title=Vitter leads opposition to immigration bill |newspaper=New Orleans Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans, Louisiana |date=22 June 2007 |url=http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/06/vitter_leads_opposition_to_imm.html |accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the [[Security Through Regularized Immigration and a Vibrant Economy Act of 2007]] was being considered in the [[United States House of Representatives]], although to considerably less public attention.

On June 7, three Senate votes on cloture (a move to end discussion) for the bill failed with the first losing 33–63, the second losing 34–61 and the third losing 45–50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.cq.com/docs/cqt/news110-000002527366.html Senate Gives Up on Immigration Bill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705193655/http://public.cq.com/docs/cqt/news110-000002527366.html |date=2007-07-05}}, Michael Sandler and Jonathan Allen, ''CQ Today'', June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This had been thought by some observers to signal the end of the bill's chances, since on that day, after the first failing vote, Harry Reid had told reporters that, if another vote on cloture failed, "the bill's over with. The bill's gone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/06/07/217464.aspx "Immigration: Another Vote Likely], Ken Strickland, MSNBC First Read, June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the urging of President Bush, the bill was brought back for discussion in the Senate as bill S. 1639 on June 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-06-23-voa21.cfm "US Senate to Reconsider Immigration Reform Next Week"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626075024/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-06-23-voa21.cfm |date=2007-06-26 }}, Deborah Tate, VOA News, June 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, a motion to proceed passed the Senate, by a margin of 64–35 (under Senate rules it needed 60 votes).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/washington/26cnd-immig.html "Immigration Bill Clears Test Vote in Senate"], [[David Stout]] and Robert Pear, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A number of amendments to the bill were considered and rejected. On June 28, the bill failed to get the 60 votes necessary to end debate.

==Changes to immigration policy==
S.1639 would have created a new class of [[visa (document)|visa]], the "Z&amp;nbsp;visa", that would be given to everyone who was living without a valid visa in the United States on Jan. 1, 2010; this visa would give its holder the legal right to remain in the United States for the rest of their lives, and access to a [[Social Security number]]. After eight years, the holder of a Z visa would be eligible for a [[United States Permanent Resident Card]] (a "green card") if they wanted to have one; they would first have to pay a $2,000 fine, and back taxes for some of the period in which they worked. By the normal rules of green cards, five years after that the undocumented immigrant could begin the process of becoming a [[U.S. citizen]].

S.1639 would have required such an undocumented immigrant to be in his or her home country when he or she applies for a green card.

S.1639 would have also ended [[family reunification]], in which an immigrant who becomes a U.S. citizen can ease the process by which their relatives from outside the country can get green cards. Under the bill, only the spouse and children of a new citizen would be made eligible for green cards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_5925670 Major provisions of compromise plan], ''The Mercury News'', May 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

S.1639 would eliminate the employer-sponsored component of the immigration system  and replace it with a point-based "merit" system. Points would be awarded by the USCIS adjudicating officers for a combination of education, job skills, family connections and English proficiency. Sponsorship of a U.S. employer would not be required although additional points would be awarded if a U.S. job offer was available. The [[labor certification]] process would also be eliminated. Several family-based immigration categories would also be folded into the point system. Points-based systems are already used for admitting skilled immigrants in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and other developed countries.

===Guest worker program===
Another new category of visa, the "Y visa", would have been created, that would let temporary guest workers stay in the country for two years, after which they would have to return home. The original bill set this program at 400,000 people a year. However, its scope was greatly reduced by two amendments passed by the Senate: the first, sponsored by Senator [[Jeff Bingaman]], reduced the number of entrants to 200,000 a year;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a8GKWJaeEmo8&amp;refer=us "Senate Cuts Guest-Worker Plan in Immigration Measure"], Jay Newton-Small, [[Bloomberg News]], May 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the second, sponsored by Senator [[Byron Dorgan]], set the program to only run for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/07/congress.immigration.ap/index.html |title=Immigration bill fails key test, is withdrawn |agency=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621192615/https://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/07/congress.immigration.ap/index.html |archivedate=2007-06-21 |date=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased enforcement===
The bill would have increased enforcement of the [[United States-Mexico border]], including increasing the number of border patrol agents by 20,000 and adding another {{convert|370|mi|km}} of fencing, among others.

The bill would have also created a new program, the "Employment Eligibility Verification System", that would be a central database meant to hold immigrant-status information on all workers living in the United States. Eventually all employers, regardless of size of the company, would have been required to assemble this information and keep the system updated on all their employees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717022828/http://news.com.com/Work+bill+would+create+new+ID+database/2100-1028_3-6185466.html Work bill would create new ID database], Anne Broache and Declan McCullagh, CNET News, May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the bill, no further part of the bill would have gone forward until these measures had been implemented.

A group of conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] senators, led by Jim DeMint, claimed that a majority of the enforcement provisions in the bill were already required under previous law, including the 2005 [[REAL ID Act]] and the 2006 [[Secure Fence Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.examiner.com/blogs/tapscotts_copy_desk/2007/6/12/DeMint-Eight-Senate-Colleagues-Challenge-Bush-to-do-Immigration-Bills-Border-Protection-Now DeMint, Eight Senate Colleagues Challenge Bush to do Immigration Bill's Border Protection Now], [[Mark Tapscott]], ''Tapscott's Copy Desk'', June 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===DREAM Act provisions===
The bill contained within it the entirety of the [[DREAM Act]], a bill that has been introduced unsuccessfully several times in the House and Senate, that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought into the country as minors who either go to college or serve in the U.S. military; it would also restore states rights in determining eligibility for in-state tuition.

The DREAM Act has four basic requirements, which are:
* Must have entered the country before the age of 16;
* Must graduate high school or obtain a GED;
* Must have good moral character (no criminal record); and
* Must have at least five years of continuous presence in the US.

==Criticism==
The bills received heated criticism from both the [[right-wing politics|right wing]] and the [[left-wing politics|left wing]]. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] rejected providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, as it would reward them for disregarding United States immigration laws. [[liberalism|Liberals]] criticized the points-based system and provisions limiting family reunification visas available to only [[nuclear family]] members of US citizens as unfair.  Labor unions, human rights, and some Hispanic organizations attacked the guest workers program, claiming that it would create a group of underclass workers with no benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release| title = LULAC Opposes Senate Immigration Compromise| publisher = League of United Latin American Citizens| date = May 21, 2007| url = https://www.lulac.org/advocacy/press/2007/immigrationreform4.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418075628/https://lulac.org/advocacy/press/2007/immigrationreform4.html |archivedate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism of the guest workers program was that because each guest worker is required to return home for a year before renewing his or her visa, these workers would instead overstay their visa, becoming [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]].

High-tech industry criticized the point-based [[permanent resident|green card]] system  for scrapping employer sponsorship of green card applications and eliminating priority processing for the highly skilled workers specifically selected by the U.S. employers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/07/MNG15QAM241.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news  "Visa Plan angers Silicon Valley", SFGate.com, June 7, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Many immigration practitioners, while supporting aspects of the proposal, criticized the bill as "unworkable" and called for fundamentally revising it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?docid=22692 Statement of AILA, American Immigration Lawers Association] June 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics of the bill in the U.S. Senate also complained that the Senate consideration of the bill did not follow the usual procedure, as the bill did not go through the committee debate and approval process and the opportunities to offer floor amendments were limited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,274435,00.html "Senate Takes Time Before Vote on Compromise Immigration Reform Bill" Foxnews.com] May 21, 2007

==Film==
[http://www.howdemocracyworksnow.com/story/last-best-chance "Last Best Chance"], story 12 in ''[[How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories]]'', a documentary series from filmmaking team [[Shari Robertson]] and [[Michael Camerini]], centers around Ted Kennedy's efforts to pass the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13778">'''Creativity techniques''' are methods that encourage [[Creativity|creative]] actions, whether in the arts or sciences. They focus on a variety of aspects of creativity, including techniques for idea generation and [[divergent thinking]], methods of re-framing problems, changes in the affective environment and so on. They can be used as part of [[problem solving]], artistic expression, or therapy.

Some techniques require groups of two or more people while other techniques can be accomplished alone.  These methods include word games, written exercises and different types of improvisation, or algorithms for approaching problems. [[Aleatoricism|Aleatory]] techniques exploiting [[randomness]] are also common.

==Aleatory techniques==
{{main|Aleatoricism}}
Aleatoricism is the incorporation of [[randomness|chance]] (random elements) into the process of creation, especially the creation of art or media. Aleatoricism is commonly found in music, art, and literature, particularly in poetry.  In film, Andy Voda made a movie in 1979 called ''[[Chance Chants]]'', which he produced by a flip of a coin or roll of a die. In music, [[John Cage]], an avant-garde musician, composed music by using the ''[[I Ching]]'' to determine the position of musical notes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms|last=Mikics|first=David|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300106367|location=New Haven|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; superimposing star maps on blank sheet music, by rolling dice and preparing open-ended scores that depended on the spontaneous decisions of the performers. (1) Other ways of practicing randomness include coin tossing, picking something out of a hat, or selecting random words from a dictionary. 

The aleatory approach is also demonstrated in the case of the process called provocation, which was initially introduced by [[Edward de Bono]] as an aid to research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creative Research: The Theory and Practice of Research for the Creative Industries|last=Collins|first=Hilary|publisher=AVA Publishing SA|year=2017|isbn=9782940411085|location=Laussane|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method, which [[Richard Restak]] said was also employed by [[Anthony Burgess]], aims to achieve novel ideas in writing by directing a plot with creative connections through random words picked from a reference book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation, Creativity, and Discovery in Modern Organizations|last=Bundy|first=Wayne|publisher=Quorum Books|year=2002|isbn=1567205690|location=Westport, CT|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restak explained that the two hundred billion interconnected neural cells in the brain are capable of an abundance of possibilities for long-range connections and creative interactions using random and unrelated words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In short, aleatoricism is a way to introduce new thoughts or ideas into a creative process.

==Improvisation==
{{main|Improvisation}}
[[Improvisation]] is a creative process which can be spoken, written, or composed without prior preparation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/improvisation Improvisation | Define Improvisation at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Improvisation, also called extemporization, can lead to the discovery of new ways to act, new patterns of thought and practices, or new structures. Improvisation is used in the creation of music, theater, and other various forms.  Many artists also use improvisational techniques to help their creative flow.

The following are two significant domains that use improvisation:

* [[Improvisational theater]] is a form of theater in which actors use improvisational acting techniques to perform spontaneously. Many improvisational ("improv") techniques are taught in standard drama classes. The basic skills of listening, clarity, confidence, and performing instinctively and spontaneously are considered important skills for actors to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Yorton |first=Tom |title=The art of improv: How to make decisions without a script |url=http://www.cognos.com/newsletter/decisions/st_070307_01.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706010359/http://www.cognos.com/newsletter/decisions/st_070307_01.html |archivedate=July 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Free improvisation]] is real-time composition. Musicians of all kinds improvise ("improv") music; such improvised music is not limited to a particular genre. Two contemporary musicians that use free improvisation are [[Anthony Braxton]] and [[Cecil Taylor]].

==In problem solving==
{{Main|Creative problem solving}}
In [[problem-solving]] contexts, the random-word creativity technique is perhaps the simplest method. A person confronted with a problem is presented with a randomly generated word, in the hopes of a solution arising from any associations between the word and the problem. This technique is based on associative thinking, the process of retrieving information from our knowledge and automatically find patterns across elements. While standard associative thinking generates associations between concepts that are strongly related and not very original, the unpredictability of a random word will lead to explore new associations that would not emerge automatically, and hopefully trigger novel solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mindiply.com/blog/post/random-stimulation-and-associative-thinking|title=Random stimulation and associative thinking|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A random image, sound, or article can be used instead of a random word as a kind of creativity goad or [[wikt:provocation|provocation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideaflow.corante.com/archives/2003/05/09/more_on_idea_generation_tools_and_techniques.php More On Idea Generation Tools and Techniques. IdeaFlow: Discussion about innovation and creativity - new products, strategy, open innovation, commercialization of technologies...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf |title=Idea Generation, Creativity and Incentives |publisher=Mitsloan.mit.edu |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many problem-solving tools and methodologies to support creativity:

* [[TRIZ]] (theory which are derived from tools such as ARIZ or TRIZ contradiction matrix)
* [[Creative Problem Solving#Creative Problem Solving|Creative Problem Solving Process (CPS)]] (complex strategy, also known as Osborn-Parnes-process)
* [[Lateral thinking|Lateral thinking process]], of Edward de Bono
* [[Six Thinking Hats]], of Edward de Bono
* [[Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument]] – right brain / left brain
* [[Brainstorming]] and [[6-3-5 Brainwriting|Brainwriting]]
* [[Think outside the box]]
* [[Business war games]], for the resolution of competitive problems 
* [[SWOT analysis]]
* [[USIT - Unified Structured Inventive Thinking|The method USIT of convergent creativity]]
* [[Thought experiment]]
* [[Five Ws]]

==In project management==
For [[project management]] purposes, '''group creativity techniques''' are creativity techniques used by a [[team]] in the course of executing a project. Some relevant techniques are [[brainstorming]], the [[nominal group technique]], the [[Delphi technique]], idea/[[mind map]]ping, the [[affinity diagram]], and [[multicriteria decision analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boral |first=Sumanta |date=2016 |title=Ace the PMI-ACP exam: a quick reference guide for the busy professional |location=New York |publisher=[[Apress]] |isbn=9781484225257 |oclc=967511997 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4842-2526-4 |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are referenced in the ''Guide to the [[Project Management Body of Knowledge]]''.&lt;ref name="Projects"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/8359/Group-Creativity-Techniques-to-Collect-Requirements- |title=Group creativity techniques to collect requirements |website=projectmanagement.com |date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group creativity techniques can be used in a sequence; for example:&lt;ref name="Projects"/&gt;
# Gather [[requirement]]s using idea/[[mind map]]ping
# Continue generating ideas by [[brainstorming]]
# Construct an [[affinity diagram]] based on the generated ideas
# Identify the most important ideas by applying the [[nominal group technique]]
# Obtain several rounds of independent feedback using the [[Delphi technique]]

==Affecting factors==

===Distraction===
Multiple studies have confirmed that distraction actually increases creative cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nautil.us/issue/7/waste/how-to-waste-time-properly|title=How To Waste Time Properly - Issue 7: Waste - Nautilus|website=Nautilus|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such study done by Jonathan Schooler found that non-demanding distractions improve performance on a classic creativity task called the UUT (Unusual Uses Task) in which the subject must come up with as many possible uses for a common object. The results confirmed that decision-related neural processes occur during moments of unconscious thought while a person engages in a non-demanding task. The research showed that while distracted a subject isn’t maintaining one thought for a particularly long time, which in turn allows different ideas to float in and out of one’s consciousness—this sort of associative process leads to creative incubation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baird|first1=Benjamin|last2=Smallwood|first2=Jonathan|last3=Mrazek|first3=Michael D.|last4=Kam|first4=Julia W. Y.|last5=Franklin|first5=Michael S.|last6=Schooler|first6=Jonathan W.|title=Inspired by Distraction: Mind Wandering Facilitates Creative Incubation|journal=Psychological Science|date=1 October 2012|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1117–1122|doi=10.1177/0956797612446024|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612446024|language=en|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambient noise is another variable that is conducive to distraction, yet it has been proven that a moderate level of noise actually heighten creativity. Professor Ravi Mehta conducted a study to research the degree of distraction induced by various noise levels and their effect on creativity. The series of experiments show that a moderate level of ambient noise (70&amp;nbsp;dB) produces just enough distraction to induce processing disfluency, which leads to abstract cognition. These higher construal levels caused by moderate levels of noise consequently enhance creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehta|first1=Ravi|last2=Zhu|first2=Rui (Juliet)|last3=Cheema|first3=Amar|title=Is Noise Always Bad? Exploring the Effects of Ambient Noise on Creative Cognition|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=2012|volume=39|issue=4|pages=784–799|doi=10.1086/665048|jstor=10.1086/665048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walking===
In 2014, a study found that walking increased creativity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oppezzo|first=Marily|last2=Schwartz|first2=Daniel L.|title=Give your ideas some legs: The positive effect of walking on creative thinking.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0036577|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|volume=40|issue=4|pages=1142–1152|doi=10.1037/a0036577}}&lt;/ref&gt; an activity favored by [[Albert Einstein]].

===Sleep and relaxation===

Some advocate enhancing creativity by taking advantage of [[hypnagogia]], the transition from wakefulness to sleep, using techniques such as [[lucid dreaming]].  One technique used by [[Salvador Dalí]] was to drift off to sleep in an armchair with a set of keys in his hand; when he fell completely asleep, the keys would fall and wake him up, allowing him to recall his mind's subconscious imaginings.&lt;ref&gt;http://almostbohemian.com/sleep/&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Edison]] used the same technique, with [[ball bearing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2008/05/st-napping/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation===

A study&lt;ref&gt;h{{cite journal |last1=Ding |first1= Xiaoqian|last2=Tang |first2=Yi-Yuan |date=2014|title=Improving creativity performance by short-term meditation|url=https://behavioralandbrainfunctions.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1744-9081-10-9 |journal=Behavioral and Brain Functions |volume=10 |issue=9 |doi=10.1186/1744-9081-10-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2014 conducted by researchers in China and the US, including the psychologist [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Michael Posner]] found that performing a short 30 minute [[meditation]] session each day, for seven days, was sufficient to improve verbal and visual creativity, as measured by the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]], due to the positive effects of meditation on emotional regulation. The same researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ding |first1=Xiaoqian |last2=Tang |first2=Yi-Yuan |date=2015 |title=Short-term meditation modulates brain activity of insight evoked with solution cue |url=https://academic.oup.com/scan/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/scan/nsu032 |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=43–49 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsu032 |pmc=4994853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also showed in 2015 that short term meditation training could also improve insight-based problem solving (the type commonly associated with an "Ah-ha", or "eureka" type moment of realization) as measured by the [[Remote Associates Test]].

[[File:Dublin Streets a Vendor of Books 1889.jpeg|460px|thumb|''Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Book'', [[Walter Osborne]], Oil on canvas, 80 x 90 cm, 1889. [[National Gallery of Ireland]]]]
'''''Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Books'''''  is a 80 x 90 cm oil on canvas painting by the Irish artist [[Walter Osborne]], completed in 1889 and housed in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]]. It is one of a series of paintings Osborne made at the time emphasising the plight and hardships of Dublin's poor.

==Description==
[[File:Dublin Streets a Vendor of Books 1889 (detail).jpg|thumb|480px|left|Detail]]
The painting shows a bookseller's [[Hawker (trade)|stall]], set up on [[Eden Quay]], looking eastwards towards [[O'Connell Bridge]] with a hazy [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] view of [[James Gandon]]’s [[Custom house]].&lt;ref name="bl80"&gt;Bhreathnach-Lynch (2016), 80&lt;/ref&gt; A mother leaning against the wall holds a child in her arms. She looks tired and anxious, and appears to be connected with the young barefoot girl who approaches the bookseller's customers, offering [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]] for sale.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://onlinecollection.nationalgallery.ie/view/objects/asitem/search@/0?t:state:flow=bf169169-b3fb-4d0f-90ad-73a1fa1ab4c3 Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Books, 1889]". [[National Gallery of Ireland]]. Retrieved 20 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; That they have been unsuccessful attracting buyers is indicated by the basket full of flowers on the ground by the woman.&lt;ref name="bl80" /&gt; 

[[File:Dublin Streets a Vendor of Books 1889 (detail 2).jpg|thumb|480px|Detail]]

Other details in the bustling scene include traffic (horses, carts and pedestrians) passing over O'Connell Bridge, and a [[barge]] and [[skiff]] just coming into view as they travel up the [[River Liffey]]. To the right of the main figures are a number of horse-drawn carts awaiting fares. A number of men wearing [[kilt]]s gather at a corner.

==Series==
The painting is one of a series of paintings of Dublin street scenes the artist completed around the time,&lt;ref name="bl80" /&gt; during visits home from his residence in England. They were later exhibited as a group at the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://repository.dri.ie/catalog/9593x1014 The Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Books]". [[Royal Irish Academy]]. Retrieved 20 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Complete Dictionary of Contributors and their Work from its Foundation in 1769 to 1904, Volume 6". [[The Royal Academy of Arts]]. H. Graves, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; The series was completed in oils in his studio, using detailed pencil sketches, and also on photographs, a modern approach for a painter at the time. Like the other works in the series, ''Dublin Streets'' is documentary in subject matter, influenced in part by the French [[Naturalism (visual art)|Naturalist]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] painters.&lt;ref name="bl80" /&gt; 

==Reception==
Although highly regarded today, these documentary, street paintings depicting everyday life were not commercially successful, and Osborne supplemented his income through portrait paintings, which were not as artistically satisfying. However, it remains an invaluable faithful record the quay in 1889; O'Connell bridge had just been rebuilt, while the view of Custom's house was overshadowed in 1891 by the [[Loopline Bridge|Loopline Viaduct]].

[[File:The cover of Ecclesia orans.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''Ecclesia orans'']]
'''''Ecclesia orans''''' is [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] [[scientific journal]] published by the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]] of [[Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino|Sant’Anselmo]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=G /&gt;&lt;ref name=D /&gt;&lt;ref name=E /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
''Periodica de Scientiis Liturgicis'' is the subtitle of the [[Review journal|review]].&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

== Origins and frequency ==
''Ecclesia orans'' was initiated in 1984.&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=D /&gt;&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt; Next year was the time of the first issue that used to appear three times a year; &lt;br /&gt;
a reader was given 120 pages of ''Ecclesia orans'' the format of which was not changed from the beginning.&lt;ref name=A /&gt; Since 2013 it has been occurring twice a year.&lt;ref name=B /&gt;

== Contents ==
Each time a reader can find [[Article (publishing)|articles]] on [[History|historical]] and [[Literature|literary]] study, [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] [[theology]] and pastoral questions, publications concerning crucial [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] affairs of the following kind: congresses, and noticeable publications on [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], and [[review]]s of [[book]]s. [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]] life and activities are being described in a regular [[Newsletter]].&lt;ref name=A /&gt; At the end of ''Ecclesia orans'' one can find a section of useful [[index (publishing)|index]]es:&lt;ref name=F /&gt; names, [[manuscript]]s, documents of the [[Catholic Church|Church's]] [[magisterium]], as well as [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]], [[Patristics|patristic]] and [[Christian]] authors sources, passages of euchology and songs, and the main index.&lt;ref name=C /&gt;

== Characteristic ==
Both ''Ecclesia orans'' and the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]] of [[Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino|Sant’Anselmo]] in [[Rome]] are worldwide.&lt;ref name=D /&gt; There is a varied group of people that can contribute: the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] [[professor]]s as well as other Faculties of the [[Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino|Athenaeum of Sant’Anselmo]] that come from different countries, the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] graduates, prominent [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] scholars, and from writers who specialize in topics that are connected with the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]].&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=H /&gt; One can read articles in the language of the writers: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. The language that is used for editorial purposes is always English and Italian. ''Ecclesia orans, Periodica de Scientiis Liturgicis'' has now its own [[Review journal|review]] that has been waiting for. Its twenty-two year experience and resources will help is an excellent tool to sanctify both men and women in [[Christ]] and worship [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

== Relations with the Pontifical Liturgical Institute in Rome ==
Future [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] [[professor]]s, [[research]]ers, directors of [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] commissions, and [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] animators have been engaged with the formation by the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]].&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=H /&gt; In order to achieve its aim, the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]], raised to an Ecclesiastical Faculty in 1978 and organises courses so that students can be taught properly.&lt;ref name=D /&gt; [[Professor]]s of the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]], for whom [[History|historical]] and [[Theology|theological]] approach to the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] is of vital importance. Not only formation of [[student]] is crucial for the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] but also [[book]]s that are published to promote the [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] [[science]]s.&lt;ref name=E /&gt; The following volumes are in three volumes: ''Rerum Ecclesiasticarum Documenta'', ''Analecta Liturgica'', and ''Anàmnesis''.&lt;ref name=D /&gt;&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

== Principal objective ==
Another expression of the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] is ''Ecclesia orans, Periodica de Scientiis Liturgicis'' – its engagement is to extend the growth of the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] on a larger, [[international]] scale.&lt;ref name=H /&gt; The direction of the new [[Review journal|review]] is to take is multi-faceted; a varied aspect of [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] as follows: [[Literature|literary]] (editing and study of texts), [[History|historical]], [[Theology|theological]], pastoral, and [[art]]istic.&lt;ref name=D /&gt; What one will find special and original in the [[Review journal|review]] is the [[scientific method]] and topic discussion. This is the way in which [[Liturgical Movement|conciliar and postconciliar liturgical renewal]] can be led to [[Science|scientific]] discussions. The [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Liturgical Institute]] will respond authoritatively to current issues of pastoral [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] and to adapt to different [[culture]]s only provided that it builds on a solid [[Science|scientific]] basis.&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=A /&gt;

== Other tasks ==
The [[Review journal|review]] aimed to contribute to this process over the last 30 years; accepting various contributions to its pages strictly [[Academia|academic]] in nature, based on the [[research]] of their various authors, which is offered as a means to promote the [[science]] and [[technology]] needed to support a [[ritual]] celebration that is more committed and more aware of what he is doing. Among the objectives of the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and, before that, of the [[Liturgical Movement|liturgical movement]], was the intention to provide the necessary means for [[Science|scientific]] [[research]] of the celebration of the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], which could lead to a greater awareness of the reality that is celebrated.&lt;ref name=F /&gt;&lt;ref name=H /&gt; That is why, during the 19th and 20th centuries, different series and editions of sources have come into existence, especially [[Patristics|patristic]] and [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] sources, which over the years have become indispensable tools for the construction of a [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] study and development of [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] [[theology]].&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt;

== Strategy of the review ==
The strategy of this [[Review journal|review]] with a strictly [[Academia|academic]] nature is determined by this principle: to provide a place for fellowship, discussion and reflection necessary to provide a serious [[Theology|theological]] ground on which to base the [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] celebration.&lt;ref name=F /&gt; Therefore, ''Ecclesia orans'' has become an reliable voice, the echo of the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]], which for more than 50 years of its life has promoted [[research]] on what the [[Tradition]] of the [[Catholic Church|Church]], in its more authoritarian forms, has given us. And it is in this line that the most important contribution of this first edition of 2013 has been included, the [[Letter (message)|letter]] received by the [[Editing|editor]] of the [[magazine]], from the [[emeritus]] [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt;

'''Eleanor Harz Jorden''' (1920 – February 18, 2009) was an American linguistics scholar and an influential [[Japanese language]] educator and expert. Born Eleanor Harz, she married [[William Jorden]], reporter and diplomat; the marriage ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Maralit.

Dr. Jorden earned her Ph.D. at [[Yale University]] under the direction of [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marshall Unger, ''Literacy and Script Reform in Occupation Japan'' (Oxford University Press US, 1996: {{ISBN|0-19-510166-9}}), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; She was best known for her seminal textbooks on the Japanese language, including ''Beginning Japanese'' and ''[[Japanese: The Spoken Language]]''.  The latter text included Jorden's [[JSL romanization|JSL]] system of [[rōmaji]] for transcribing Japanese into [[Roman script]]. Her explanations of the subtleties of [[Japanese grammar]] and usage are still widely referenced today.

Jorden taught Japanese at many educational institutions, including [[Cornell University]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Williams College]], the [[University of Hawaii]], [[International Christian University]] in Tokyo and [[Ohio State University]].  For many years, Jorden also served as Chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages at the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department's]] [[Foreign Service Institute]] (FSI).

Jorden also founded several programs, including the intensive FALCON Program at [[Cornell University]] and the Foreign Service Institute Japanese Language School in Tokyo, Japan.

'''Faxian''' ({{zh|t=法顯|s=法显|p=Fǎxiǎn|first=t}}; 337 – c. 422) was a Chinese [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] and translator who traveled by foot from China to India, visiting many sacred Buddhist sites in what are now [[Xinjiang]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]] between 399-412 to acquire [[Buddhist texts]]. His journey is described in his important travelogue, ''A Record of Buddhist Kingdoms, Being an Account by the Chinese Monk Fa-Xian of his Travels in India and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] in Search of the Buddhist Books of Discipline''. Other transliterations of his name include '''Fa-Hien''', '''Fa-hian''', and '''Fa-hsien'''.

==Biography==
In 399 Faxian set out with nine others to locate sacred Buddhist texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Průšek]] and Zbigniew Słupski, eds., Dictionary of Oriental Literatures: East Asia (Charles Tuttle, 1978): 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He visited India in the early fifth century. He is said to have walked all the way from China across the icy desert and rugged mountain passes. He entered India from the northwest and reached [[Pataliputra]]. He took back with him Buddhist texts and images sacred to Buddhism. He saw the ruins of the city when he reached [[Pataliputra]].

Faxian's visit to India occurred during the reign of [[Chandragupta II]]. He is also renowned for his pilgrimage to [[Lumbini]], the birthplace of [[Gautama Buddha]] (modern [[Nepal]]). However, he mentioned nothing about Guptas. Faxian claimed that demons and dragons were the original inhabitants of [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLFXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA506&amp;dq=fa+hian|title=The Medical times and gazette, Volume 1|author=|year=1867|publisher=John Churchill|edition=|location=LONDON|page=506|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}(Original from the University of Michigan)&lt;/ref&gt;

On Faxian's way back to China, after a two-year stay in Ceylon, a violent storm drove his ship onto an island, probably [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert E., Lopez, Donald S. Jr. (2014). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=Dushun&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KPy8U_zHJJTR4QSV54C4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=amala&amp;f=false The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism], Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; After five months there, Faxian took another ship for southern China; but, again, it was blown off course and he ended up landing at [[Mount Lao]] in what is now [[Shandong]] in northern China, {{convert|30|km}} east of the city of [[Qingdao]]. He spent the rest of his life translating and editing the scriptures he had collected.

Faxian wrote a book on his travels, filled with accounts of early Buddhism, and the geography and history of numerous countries along the [[Silk Road]]s as they were, at the turn of the 5th century CE. He wrote about cities like Magadha, Patliputra, Mathura, city of Kanauj and Middle India. He also wrote that inhabitants of Middle India also eat and dress like China people. He declared Patliputra as a very prosperous city.

He returned in 412 and settled in what is now [[Nanjing]]. In 414 he wrote (or dictated) ''Foguoji'' (''A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms''; also known as ''Faxian's Account'').  He spent the next decade, until his death, translating the Buddhist [[sutra]] he had brought with him from [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Průšek]] and Zbigniew Słupski, eds., Dictionary of Oriental Literatures: East Asia (Charles Tuttle, 1978): 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is the introduction to a translation of Faxian's work by [[James Legge]]:

{{quote|
Nothing of great importance is known about Fa-Hien in addition to what may be gathered from his own record of his travels. I have read the accounts of him in the ''[[Memoirs of Eminent Monks]]'', compiled in A.D. 519, and a later work, the ''Memoirs of Marvellous Monks'', by the third emperor of the [[Ming dynasty]] (A.D. 1403-1424), which, however, is nearly all borrowed from the other; and all in them that has an appearance of verisimilitude can be brought within brief compass
[[File:BEAL(1869) FAH-HIAN'S ROUTE THROUGH INDIA AND TARTARY.jpg|thumbnail|Faxian´s route through India]]
His [[Chinese surname|surname]], they tell us, was Kung, and he was a native of Wu-yang in P’ing-Yang, which is still the name of a large department in [[Shanxi|Shan-hsi]]. He had three brothers older than himself; but when they all died before shedding their first teeth, his father devoted him to the service of the Buddhist society, and had him entered as a [[śrāmaṇera|Sramanera]], still keeping him at home in the family. The little fellow fell dangerously ill, and the father sent him to the [[vihara|monastery]], where he soon got well and refused to return to his parents.

When he was ten years old, his father died; and an uncle, considering the widowed solitariness and helplessness of the mother, urged him to renounce the monastic life, and return to her, but the boy replied, "I did not quit the family in compliance with my father’s wishes, but because I wished to be far from the dust and vulgar ways of life. This is why I chose monkhood." The uncle approved of his words and gave over urging him. When his mother also died, it appeared how great had been the affection for her of his fine nature; but after her burial, he returned to the monastery.

On one occasion he was cutting rice with a score or two of his fellow-disciples when some hungry thieves came upon them to take away their grain by force. The other Sramaneras all fled, but our young hero stood his ground, and said to the thieves, "If you must have the grain, take what you please. But, Sirs, it was your former neglect of charity which brought you to your present state of destitution; and now, again, you wish to rob others. I am afraid that in the coming ages you will have still greater poverty and distress;—I am sorry for you beforehand." With these words he followed his companions into the monastery, while the thieves left the grain and went away, all the monks, of whom there were several hundred, doing homage to his conduct and courage.

When he had finished his novitiate and taken on him the obligations of the full Buddhist orders, his earnest courage, clear intelligence, and strict regulation of his demeanor were conspicuous; and soon after, he undertook his journey to India in search of complete copies of the [[Vinaya-pitaka]]. What follows this is merely an account of his travels in India and return to China by sea, condensed from his own narrative, with the addition of some marvelous incidents that happened to him, on his visit to the [[Vulture Peak]] near [[Rajgir|Rajagriha]].

It is said in the end that after his return to China, he went to the capital (evidently [[Nanjing|Nanking]]), and there, along with the Indian Sramana [[Buddhabhadra (translator)|Buddha-bhadra]], executed translations of some of the works which he had obtained in India; and that before he had done all that he wished to do in this way, he removed to [[Jingzhou|King-chow]] (in the present [[Hubei|Hoo-pih]]), and died in the monastery of Sin, at the age of eighty-eight, to the great sorrow of all who knew him. It is added that there is another larger work giving an account of his travels in various countries.

Such is all the information given about our author, beyond what he himself has told us. Fa-Hien was his clerical name, and means "Illustrious in the Law," or "Illustrious master of the Law." The Shih which often precedes it is an abbreviation of the name of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as Sakyamuni, "the [[Shakya|Sakya]], mighty in Love, dwelling in Seclusion and Silence," and may be taken as equivalent to Buddhist. It is sometimes said to have belonged to "the eastern [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Tsin dynasty]]" (A.D. 317-419), and sometimes to "the Sung," that is, the [[Liu Song dynasty|Sung dynasty of the House of Liu]] (A.D. 420-478). If he became a full monk at the age.... of twenty, and went to India when he was twenty-five, his long life may have been divided pretty equally between the two dynasties.}}

A '''flashing arrow''' is a metaphorical audiovisual cue used in [[film]]s to bring some object or situation that will be referred later, or otherwise used in the advancement of plot, to the attention of the viewers.

The device is not introduced into the plot or the dialogue, but is something peripheral; however made ''obvious'' (hence the name) by a particular camera shot or background music.
An example of this device is a camera close-up in a horror movie that suggests information like danger from an unlocked door. A ''literal'' flashing  arrow was used in the 1981 film ''[[Student Bodies]]'' to mock this [[cliché]]d use.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- Is this the origin of the term? --&gt; http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/public/tv-smarter-johnson.html&lt;/ref&gt; The use of flashing arrows and that particular joke were both mentioned in ''[[Everything Bad Is Good for You]]'', where the authors says works that have little use of this and require figuring things out yourself have a more deductive viewer base.

Another example of a literal flashing arrow can be seen in the ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]''. This device is used several times throughout the anime—for instance in the first episode, a flashing arrow and high-pitched beeping noise indicate a vase that a character breaks later on in that scene.

Yet another instance is a cut, situation blank in an action film when the hero is in a [[deathtrap (plot device)|difficult-to-escape situation]], to a brief shot of the item he will use to save himself.

A form of flashing arrows is used in some video games as well; in these cases, the important object or clue is itself glowing or flashing.  However, this use can be forgiven to an extent,{{Says who|date=February 2011}} as a realistically sized key (for example) would be nearly impossible to see on a standard-sized television set ''without'' some sort of illumination.

A case in point of this can be seen in the film ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' during a scene where the protagonist stabs to death a young woman with a pencil. The pencil shows up in nearly every cut scene before the girl's death.

Another example of a flashing arrow is used in the film ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'', when the child with the bike and the bus driver appear in numerous scenes, before both of them become a factor in Harold Crick's "death".

The '''Justice Party USA''' is a [[Political parties in the United States|political party]] in the [[United States]]. It was organized in November 2011 by a group of political activists including former [[Mayor of Salt Lake City]] [[Rocky Anderson]] as an alternative to what he saw as a [[duopoly]] of the [[Political parties in the United States|two major political parties]]. One of the major goals of the Justice Party is removing corporate influence and other concentrated wealth from politics.&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;Romboy, Dennis [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705395124/Rocky-Anderson-forms-Justice-Party-plans-to-run-for-president.html "Rocky Anderson forms Justice Party, plans to run for president"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', November 30, 2011.

== History ==
[[File:Rocky Anderson at MLK.jpg|thumb|250px|Former [[Mayor of Salt Lake City]] [[Rocky Anderson]] is the founder of the Justice Party and the party's 2012 presidential candidate]]
In December 2011, it became a qualified party in [[Mississippi]], the first state to recognize the party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Winger|Winger, Richard]] (December 29, 2011) [http://www.ballot-access.org/2011/12/29/justice-party-qualifies-for-mississippi-ballot/ "Justice Party qualifies for Mississippi ballot"], ''[[Ballot Access News]]''. Retrieved December 30, 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529020413/http://www.ballot-access.org/2011/12/29/justice-party-qualifies-for-mississippi-ballot/ |date=May 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a small beginning, 30 persons at the launching event with no TV crew covering it, the party was able to put its founder [[Rocky Anderson]] on the ballot in 15 states and secure official write-in status in 15 additional states. It was the fifth largest third party in terms of presidential ballot access in the 2012 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Winger, Richard (October 1, 2012) [http://www.ballot-access.org/2012/10/27/ballot-access-news-october-2012-print-edition/ "2012 Ballot Status for President"] ''Ballot Access News''.

The party released a draft statement endorsing [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Democratic nomination]] rather than nominating its own candidate, but no official announcement was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oppositionnews.org/articles/2016/q1/opposition-left-divided-over-bernie-sanders/|title=Opposition Left divided over Bernie Sanders|last=Wachtler|first=Mark|date=2016-01-22|website=Opposition News|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology and positions ==
The Justice Party was created with the motto "economic, environmental, and social justice for all".&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt; The party was designed with the intention of shifting government back to a focus on the Constitution by removing corporate influence in politics.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;

It is pro-immigration reform, pro-breaking up large banks, pro-reinstating [[Glass–Steagall]], pro-government funded higher education and against subsidies to oil and gas companies.&lt;ref name="JPUSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justicepartyusa.net |title=Policy of the Justice Party |publisher=The Justice Party's website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217053650/http://www.justicepartyusa.net// |archivedate=December 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MASC''' is a balanced subset of 500K words of written texts and transcribed speech drawn primarily from the Open [[American National Corpus]] (OANC). The OANC is a 15 million word (and growing) corpus of American English produced since 1990, all of which is in the public domain or otherwise free of usage and redistribution restrictions.

All of MASC includes manually validated annotations for logical structure (headings, sections, paragraphs, etc.), sentence boundaries, three different tokenizations with associated part of speech tags, shallow parse (noun and verb chunks), named entities (person, location, organization, date and time), and [https://web.archive.org/web/20131109202842/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/ Penn Treebank] syntax. Additional manually produced or validated annotations have been produced by the MASC project for portions of the sub-corpus, including full-text annotation for [[FrameNet]] frame elements and a 100K+ sentence corpus with [[WordNet]] 3.1 sense tags, of which one-tenth are also annotated for [[FrameNet]] frame elements. Annotations of all or portions of the sub-corpus for a wide variety of other linguistic phenomena have been contributed by other projects, including [[PropBank]], [[TimeBank]], [http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/corpora/mpqa_corpus/ MPQA opinion], and several others. Co-reference annotations and clause boundaries of the entire MASC corpus are scheduled to be released by the end of 2016.

WordNet sense annotations for all occurrences of 114 words are also included in the MASC distribution, as well as [[FrameNet]] annotations for 50-100 occurrences of each of the 114 words. The sentences with [[WordNet]] and [[FrameNet]] annotations are also distributed as a part of the [http://www.anc.org/data/masc/wordnet-framenet-annotations/ MASC Sentence Corpus].

== Genres ==

Unlike most freely available corpora including a wide variety of linguistic annotations, MASC contains a balanced selection of texts from a broad range of genres:

All MASC annotations, whether contributed or produced in-house, are transduced to the Graph Annotation Format (GrAF) defined by ISO TC37 SC4’s Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF).
The online tool [http://www.anc.org/software/anc2go/ ANC2Go] can transduce annotations over all or parts of MASC to any of several other formats, including CONLL IOB format and formats for use in [[UIMA]] and [[General Architecture for Text Engineering]].

== Distribution ==

MASC is an open data resource that can be used by anyone for any purpose. At the same time, it is a collaborative community resource that is sustained by community contributions of annotations and derived data. It is freely downloadable from the [http://www.anc.org/data/masc/downloads/data-download/ MASC download page] or through the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]].

MASC is also distributed in part-of-speech-tagged form with the [[Natural Language Toolkit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9834">&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:True-marion-cp-137284.jpg|thumb|Marion True, While still at the Getty]] --&gt;
'''Marion True''' (born November 5, 1948) was the former curator of [[antiquities]] for the [[Getty Center|J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. True was indicted on April 1, 2005, by the Italian court, on criminal charges accusing her of participating in a conspiracy that laundered stolen artifacts through private collections and creating a fake paper trail; the Greeks later followed suit.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"&gt;Combs, Jacob, and Morag Kersel. [http://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/undergrad/prizes/Combs2010.pdf "A True Controversy: The Trial of Marion True and Its Lessons for Curators, Museums Boards, and National Governments.]" : 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial brought to light many questions about museum administration, repatriation, and ethics.

==Early years==
True was born in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]] in 1948, and grew up in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] where she developed an interest in Greek [[Antiquities]].&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; True later received a [[scholarship]] to study the classics and fine arts at New York University, [[NYU]]. True also has a [[masters degree]] in classical [[archaeology]] from NYU's Institute of Fine Arts, and a [[PhD]] from [[Harvard]], where she studied under Emily Dickinson Vermeule.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reynolds, [http://www.arts.arizona.edu/are476/files/true2.htm "The puzzle of Marion True"], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic, [http://www.italystl.com/ra/2159.htm "Getty curator Marion True, indicted over acquisitions, has often spoken on ethical issues"] ''Los Angeles Times'', May 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; True was trained by Cornelius Clarkson Vermeule III, contemporary scholar of Ancient Art and Curator of Classical Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, from 1957 to 1996.

In 1982, True joined The Getty as a curatorial assistant and later became a [[curator]] in 1986. True created a new policy for The Getty in 1987,&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; which required the museum to notify governments when objects were being considered for [[acquisitions]]. Under this new policy, if a government could prove an object had been illegally exported, the museum would return it.

In 1992, True organized a symposium to debate the authenticity of a Greek kouros, which is  referred to today as the [[Getty kouros]].&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; The label in the museum reads, "Greek, 530 BCE or Modern Forgery". This Kouros was worth $10 million in 1985 when it was acquired, and it is believed to have been looted from southern Italy.

In 1995, True put in place another acquisition policy that prohibited the museum from acquiring antiquities that lacked thorough documentation, or that had not previously been part of an established collection.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; Later in 1995, The Getty incorporated the collection of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman into the museum's collection.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; During that same year, True obtained a private loan to purchase a vacation home on the Greek Island of [[Paros]]; Larry Fleischman offered to loan True the money to repay this loan in 1996.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; Later, lawyers would question if True and the Fleischmans had a conflict of interest.

==Trial==

In 2005, True was indicted by the Italian government, along with renowned American antiquities dealer, [[Robert E. Hecht]], for conspiracy to traffic in illicit antiquities. She was accused of participating in a conspiracy that laundered stolen objects through private collection in order to create a fake paper trail that would serve as the items' provenance.&lt;ref name=Mead&gt;Mead, Rebecca. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/09/070409fa_fact_mead "Onward and Upward with the Arts: Den of Antiquity."] ''The New Yorker'' 9 April  1007:1-8&lt;/ref&gt; The Getty issued statements supporting True, "We Trust that this trial will result in her exoneration and end further damage to the personal and professional reputation of Dr. True."&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] warehouse, which contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer, [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]], was eventually arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be "one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market".&lt;ref name=vogue&gt;''[[Men's Vogue]]'', November/December 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Medici was sentenced in 2004, by a  court in Rome, to ten years in prison and a fine of 10 million euros, "the largest penalty ever meted out for antiquities crime in Italy".&lt;ref name=vogue/&gt;

On October 1, 2005, True resigned from The Getty.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; In November 2006, The Greek prosecution followed the Italian's lead, charging True with trafficking in looted antiquities due to her involvement in The Getty's purchase of an illicitly excavated golden funerary wreath.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; On November 20, 2006, the Director of the museum, [[Michael Brand]], announced that 26 disputed pieces were to be returned to Italy.

In a letter to the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] on December 18, 2006, True stated that she was being made to "carry the burden" for practices which were known, approved, and condoned by The Getty's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-true29dec29,0,3427365.story?coll=la-home-headlines LATimes.com ~ "Getty lets her take fall, ex-curator says"]&lt;/ref&gt; True testified for the first time in March 2007.

In September 2007, Italy dropped the civil charges against True.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt; The Getty also announced its plan to return 40 out of 46 objects. On September 26, 2007, Getty Center signed a contract with the Italian Culture [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] in [[Rome]] to return stolen arts from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7013471.stm BBC NEWS, Getty to hand back 'looted art']&lt;/ref&gt; Forty ancient art works would be returned including: the 5th century BC [[Aphrodite]] [[limestone]] and [[marble]] statue, in 2010; [[fresco]] [[paintings]] stolen from [[Pompeii]]; marble and [[bronze]] sculptures; and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] vases.

In November 2007, the Greek criminal charges against True were dropped as the statute of limitations had expired. The wreath and three other items from the Getty's collection were returned to Greece.&lt;ref name="Combs-Kersel"/&gt;

==Criminal charges==
All charges against True were eventually dismissed. Because the statute of limitations had expired, she was acquitted in 2007 of charges relating to the acquisition of a 2,500-year-old funerary wreath, which was shown to have been looted from northern Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/27/europe/getty.php Intl. ''Herald Tribune'' "Ex-curator acquitted in case of Greek relic"]&lt;/ref&gt; The wreath in question had already been returned to Greece. In 2010, an Italian court dismissed the remainder of the charges against her, holding that the statute of limitations has expired.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Felch, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/10/charges-dismissed-against-getty-curator-marion-true-by-italian-judge.html "Charges dismissed against ex-Getty curator Marion True by Italian judge (updated)"] ''Los Angeles Times'', October 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contested artifacts==

Aphrodite of Morgantina was an [[acrolithic]] sculpture acquired by The Getty in 1988, it is a 7-foot-tall, 1,300-pound statue of limestone and marble.&lt;ref&gt;Flech, Jason, [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/23/entertainment/la-et-return-of-aphrodite-20110323 "The Getty Ship Aphrodite Statue to Sicily: The Iconic Statue, bought in 1988, is among 40 object of disputed origin repatriated."] The LA Times 23 March  2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum and True ignored the obvious signs that it was looted.  It was returned to Morgantina in early March, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Morreale, Giovanni, [http://www.timesofsicily.com/chasing-aphrodite-venus-of-morgantina/ "Chasing Aphrodite: Venus of Morgantina"], ''Times of Sicily'' February 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the sculpture actually portrays [[Persephone]] or [[Demeter]], rather than [[Aphrodite]].

[[File:Kouros.jpg|thumb|The Getty kouros]] The [[Getty kouros]] is an over-life-size statue in the form of a late archaic Greek kouros.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;[J. Paul Getty Museum. Statue of a kouros. Retrieved September 2, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; The dolomitic marble sculpture was also bought by Frel in 1985 for $7 million and first exhibited there in October 1986. If genuine, it is one of only twelve complete kouroi still extant. If fake, it exhibits a high degree of technical and artistic sophistication by an as-yet unidentified forger. Its status remains undetermined: today the museum's label reads "Greek, about 530 B.C., or modern forgery".&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;

The Golden Wreath was bought by The Getty in 1994 for $1.15 million.&lt;ref name=Mead/&gt; True was shown the wreath in a Swiss bank vault before purchasing and determined that it was "too dangerous" to purchase, because of its signs of looting. Under the advisement of The Getty's board, True purchased it through Christoph Leon, a Swiss art dealer.&lt;ref name=Mead/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12915">'''Mark Zuckerberg book club''' aka '''A Year of Books''' was an online book club hosted by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] through his personal [[Facebook]] account started in January 2015.&lt;ref name=chowdhry&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2015/01/05/mark-zuckerberg-book-club/ |title=Mark Zuckerberg Starts A Book Club As His New Year's Resolution |work=Forbes |author=Amit Chowdhry |date=January 5, 2015 |accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg made a book recommendation every two weeks for a year to his millions of Facebook followers.&lt;ref name=apthirdpick/&gt;

Zuckerberg came up with the idea as part of his New Year's Resolution for 2015 after Cynthia Greco, the Audience Development Manager for MediaOnePA/York Newspaper Company, suggested that Zuckerberg read a new book every month. Zuckerberg modified the idea to one book every two weeks and books which "emphasize learning about new cultures, beliefs, histories and technologies."&lt;ref name=chowdhry/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15169">[[File:HEARST2.JPG|thumb|Innis pointed to the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst newspaper chain]] and its handful of powerful rivals as constituting a modern monopoly of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Monopolies of knowledge''' arise when the [[ruling class]] maintains political power through control of key communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander John. (2006). ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.357.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that monopolies of knowledge gradually suppress new ways of thinking. Entrenched hierarchies become increasingly rigid and out of touch with social realities. Challenges to elite power are often likely to arise on the margins of society. The arts, for example, are often seen as a means of escape from the sterility of conformist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1980) ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis'', introduced and edited by William Christian. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.xii-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian economic historian [[Harold Innis]] developed the concept of monopolies of knowledge in his later writings on [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Monopolies of knowledge|communications theories]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Toronto: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurs in [[ancient Egypt]] where a complex writing system conferred a monopoly of knowledge on literate priests and scribes. Mastering the art of writing and reading required long periods of apprenticeship and instruction, confining knowledge to this powerful class.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's warnings about monopolies of knowledge take on particular urgency in the years immediately preceding his death in 1952. In his later writings, he argued that industrialization and mass media had led to the mechanization of a culture in which more personal forms of oral communication were radically devalued.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, pp.80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; "Reading is quicker than listening," Innis wrote in 1948. "The printing press and the radio address the world instead of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the concept ==

When discussing the monopolies of knowledge, Innis focuses much of his concern on the United States, where he feared that mass-circulation newspapers and magazines along with privately owned broadcasting networks had undermined independent thought and local cultures and rendered audiences passive in the face of what he calls the "vast monopolies of communication".&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''The Strategy of Culture''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James W. Carey]] notes that Innis worried about the centralized control of information and entertainment by advertising-driven media. "The very existence of a commodity such as 'information' and an institution called 'media' make each other necessary," Carey writes. "More people spend more time dependent on the journalist, the publisher, and the program director. Every week they wait for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [magazine]."&lt;ref&gt;Carey, James W. (1992) ''Communication As Culture: Essays on Media and Society'', p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fashion his concept of monopolies of knowledge, Innis drew on several fields of study, including economics, history, communications and technology.

===Economics and the price system===

In his 1938 essay, ''The Penetrative Powers of the Price System'', Innis anticipates his later concept of monopolies of knowledge.  Although he does not precisely define what he means by the "price system", he does show how trade and technology shaped modern industrial economies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.217-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis suggests, for example, that the shift from coal and iron to oil and electricity had profound implications that no one in industrial societies could escape. He mentions the growth of cities with people living in large apartment buildings made possible by developments in electrical equipment on the one hand, and the dispersal of populations over wide metropolitan areas as a result of the automobile and paved roads, on the other.

The inhabitants of modern industrial societies even eat differently than their more rural forebears. "The demands of population in congested areas, under the direction of scientific work in nutrition," Innis writes, "have shifted from carbohydrates to vitamins or from wheat to dairy products, live-stock, fruits and vegetables."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1956) ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'', edited by Mary Q. Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he adds, city dwellers are influenced by cheap, mass-circulation newspapers which peddle political stereotypes along with department store ads.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Essays), pp.266-267.&lt;/ref&gt; For Innis, the industrial economy monopolizes how people live, work, communicate and think.&lt;ref&gt;See, Kroker, Arthur. (1984) ''Technology and the Canadian Mind''. Montreal: New World Perspectives, pp.120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and classical studies===

Innis's concept of monopolies of knowledge was also influenced by the scholar [[Solomon Gandz]] who published a lengthy paper in 1939 on the significance of the [[oral tradition]] in the development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.353.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandz advanced the idea that the control of language in the oral tradition was grounded in religious institutions which ensured a civilization's continuity by preserving its traditions. At the same time, however, religious elites often shared their power with political elites who controlled the use of military force, thereby ensuring a civilization's success in conquering and holding territory.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.358-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis incorporated these ideas in his concept of [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Time and space|time-biased and space-biased media]]. He argued that civilizations and empires flourished when there was a [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Balance.2C bias and empire|balance]] between time- and space-biased media.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The triumph of one type of medium over the other, however, undermined stability demonstrating that unbalanced monopolies of knowledge could gradually lead to the decline and fall of civilizations and empires.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Innis's discussion of the priestly monopoly over writing that undermined the Egyptian empire. Innis (Empire), pp.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued this was, in fact, happening to Western civilization which had become [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Western civilization in peril|dangerously unbalanced]] partly because of the monopoly of knowledge exercised by space-biased communications technologies such as the daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; For Innis, the newspaper reflected an obsession with what he termed "present-mindedness".&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers and the news agencies that served them could transmit large amounts of information over long distances, but this speed of transmission and the emphasis on immediacy obliterated continuity and memory. "Time," Innis wrote, "has been cut into pieces the length of a day's newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (1954) "Concept of Monopoly and Civilization." ''Explorations'', No. 3 quoted in Carey, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of electronic media—radio and later, television—added more speed and immediacy contributing cumulatively to the erasure of cultural memory. Moreover, these space-biased media could be used by political elites to mobilize large populations—as in [[Nazi Germany]]—to support disastrous wars of conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of writing==

Innis placed special emphasis on monopolies of knowledge that are based on the control of written media. "We can conveniently divide the history of the West into the writing and printing periods," he writes in [[Empire and Communications#Writing.2C printing and speech|''Empire and Communications'']].&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===

"The sword and the pen worked together," Innis writes. "The written record signed, sealed, and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government. Small communities were written into large states and states were consolidated into empire." Innis adds that the monarchies of Egypt and Persia as well as the Roman empire "were essentially products of writing."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome's adoption of papyrus facilitated the [[Empire and Communications#Writing.2C empire and religion|spread of writing]] and the growth of bureaucratic administration needed to govern vast territories.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), pp.120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of the alphabet strengthened monopolies of knowledge in a variety of ancient empires.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis warns about the power of writing to create mental "grooves" which determine "the channels of thought of readers and later writers."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printing and paper===

Innis believed that the [[printing press]] was a decisive invention in the history of the West. [[Lewis Mumford]] pointed out that printing was "a completely mechanical achievement...the type for all future instruments of reproduction: for the printed sheet...was the first completely standardized product."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis (1946) ''Technics and Civilization''. London: George Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., p.135.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Innis, the printing press and the accompanying medium of paper ushered in not just the mechanization that would become characteristic of an industrial society based on mass production, but also the mechanization of knowledge itself. By that, Innis meant that printing led to the production of beliefs and practices that reinforced monopolies of knowledge characteristic of industrial culture.&lt;ref&gt;See, Innis, Harold (1980) ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis'' introduced and edited by William Christian, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this can be seen in the large-scale production of [[newsprint]] in the 19th century that had far-reaching effects. Newsprint fostered the development of big newspaper plants that needed larger numbers of readers to deliver to big advertisers such as [[department store]]s. Department stores themselves reflected new ways of marketing to rising numbers of city dwellers. To attract more readers, newspaper proprietors began to run [[comics]] and to rely on the "excitement and sensationalism" of foreign wars. Such coverage influenced British and American foreign policies, sometimes disastrously.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), pp.77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis also warned that printed books could produce conformity of thought akin to the regimentation of workers in industrial factories.&lt;ref&gt;See Housser, Signe, ''Harold A. Innis and Michel Foucault: A Communications Perspective on Knowledge Construction''[http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/bitstream/1892/7718/1/b16625535.pdf], MA Thesis, Simon Fraser University, 1984, pp.66-67. Housser draws on ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis''. 2/42, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeats the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|Biblical commandment against worshiping graven images]], but suggests that in our unconscious society, this prohibition is not interpreted to apply to the printed word.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Idea File), 1/1, p.3. Innis writes: "Thou shalt not worship any graven image—not interpreted to mean the printed word or those words themselves.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Kuhns, societies dominated by print media regard only printed knowledge as "essentially valid." Textbook publishers exert a huge influence on education at all levels while schools and universities refuse to accept knowledge in other than printed forms. "The monopoly of knowledge protects its own with wary vigilance," Kuhns writes.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhns, William. (1971) ''The Post-Industrial Prophets: Interpretations of Technology''. New York: Weybright and Talley, pp.154-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in Mumford's words, with the advent of the printed book, learning "became book-learning."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, p.136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Levinson]] writes that "[l]iteracy probably constitutes the most significant monopoly of knowledge in human history."&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Paul. (1997) ''The Soft Edge: A Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution''. New York: Routledge, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, however, that in open, democratic societies, public education systems are dedicated to breaking this monopoly by teaching students how to read and write, thereby giving them full access to printed knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, pp.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New media==

We can look at the [[Internet]] as being a factor in creating knowledge monopolies. Those who have the skills to use the technology have the power to choose what information is communicated. The significance of the Internet in the creation of these monopolies, in more recent years, has been somewhat diminished due to increased knowledge and awareness of how to use the technology. At the same time, the ever-increasing complexity of digital technologies strengthens monopolies of knowledge as the ''New York Times'' points out in a series which began on April 27, 2009, called ''The Digital Arms Race'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he Pentagon has commissioned military contractors to develop a highly classified replica of the Internet of the future. The goal is to simulate what it would take for adversaries to shut down the country’s power stations, telecommunications and aviation systems, or freeze the financial markets — in an effort to build better defenses against such attacks, as well as a new generation of online weapons. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/us/28cyber.html?pagewanted=all]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wherever new media arise, so too do monopolies of knowledge concerning how to use the technologies to reinforce the power and control of elite groups.

'''Muyil''' (also known as '''Chunyaxché''') was one of the earliest and longest inhabited ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites on the eastern coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. It is located approximately {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of the coastal site of [[Tulum]], in the [[Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo|Municipality of Felipe Carrillo Puerto]] in the state of [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]]. Artifacts found here date back from as early as 350 [[BCE]]. to as late as 1200-1500 CE.  The ruins of Muyil are an example of Peten architecture, like those found in southern Mayan sites with their steep walled pyramids such as [[Tikal]] in Guatemala.  It is situated on the [[Sian Ka'an]] lagoon, a name meaning "Where the Sky is Born". Muyil was located along a [[trade route]] on the Caribbean once accessible via a series of canals. Among the most commonly traded goods were Jade, obsidian, chocolate, honey, feathers, chewing gum, and salt.  It is believed that throughout much of its history, Muyil had strong ties to the center of [[Coba]] located some {{convert|44|km|mi}} the north / northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Witschey 1993, [http://muyil.smv.org/interest.htm "Background"]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 federal census reported a population of 191 inhabitants in the locality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&amp;c=1223 2010 census tables: INEGI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502000000/http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&amp;c=1223 |date=2013-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Natura naturata''''' is a [[Latin]] term coined in the Middle Ages, mainly used later by [[Baruch Spinoza]] meaning "Nature natured", or "Nature already created".  The term adds the suffix for the Latin feminine [[past participle]] (''-ata'') to the verb ''naturo'', to create "natur'''ed'''".  The term describes a passive God, or more specifically, the passivity of God (substance) when it is predicated into modes, and is contrasted with the second part of Spinoza's dichotomy, ''[[natura naturans]]'', meaning "nature naturing", or "nature in the active sense". 

The distinction is expressed in Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[B]y ''Natura naturans'' we must understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''or'' such attributes of substance as express an eternal and infinite essence, that is … God, insofar as he is considered as a free cause. &lt;br&gt; But by ''Natura naturata'' I understand whatever follows from the necessity of God's nature, ''or'' from God's attributes, that is, all the modes of God's attributes insofar as they are considered as things which are in God, and can neither be nor be conceived without God.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Prop. 29, Scholium. Trans: Edwin Curley.  London: Penguin, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ancient history]]''' &amp;ndash; study of ''recorded'' human history from the beginning of [[writing]] at about 3000 BC until the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The times ''before [[writing]]'' belong either to [[protohistory]] or to [[prehistory]]. The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 – 5,500 years, beginning with [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], the oldest form of writing discovered so far.  Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed, currently most [[Western culture|Western]] scholars use the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in  476 [[Anno Domini|AD]] or the coming of Islam in 632 AD as the end of ancient history.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] reflects the attitudes of French Philhellenism.]]

'''Philhellenism''' ("the love of Greek culture") and '''philhellene''' ("the admirer of Greeks and everything Greek"), from the Greek {{lang|grc|φίλος}} ''philos'' "friend, lover" and {{lang|grc|ἑλληνισμός}} ''hellenism'' "Greek", was an intellectual fashion prominent mostly at the turn of the 19th century. It contributed to the sentiments that led Europeans such as [[Lord Byron]] or [[Charles Nicolas Fabvier]] to advocate for [[Greek War of Independence|Greek independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The later 19th-century European philhellenism was largely to be found among the [[Classicists]].

==Philhellenes in antiquity==
[[File:Coin of Mithridates II of Parthia.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Mithridates II of Parthia]] from the mint at [[Seleucia on the Tigris]]. [[Inscription of Parthian imperial power|The Greek inscription]] reads ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΜΕΓΑΛΟΥ ΑΡΣΑΚΟΥ ΦΙΛΕΛΛΗΝΟΣ ("[coin] of the great king Arsaces, friend of the Greeks")]]
In antiquity, the term 'philhellene' ({{lang-el|φιλέλλην}}, from ''φίλος'' - ''philos'', "dear one, friend" + ''Έλλην'' - ''Hellen'', "Greek"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111464 Philos, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;) was used to describe both non-Greeks who were fond of Greek culture and Greeks who patriotically upheld their culture. The [[A Greek-English Lexicon|Liddell-Scott Greek-English Lexicon]] defines 'philhellen' as "fond of the Hellenes, mostly of foreign princes, as [[Amasis II|Amasis]]; of [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] kings[...]; also of Hellenic tyrants, as [[Jason of Pherae]] and generally of [[Greeks|Hellenic]] (Greek) patriots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23110917 Philellen, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The early rulers of the [[Parthian Empire]], merging [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and Greek culture described themselves as philhellenes

===Roman philhellenes===

The literate upper classes of Rome were increasingly [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] in their culture during the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Romans and Aliens|last=Balsdon|first=J.P.V.D.|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co Ltd|year=1979|isbn=0715610430|location=London|pages=30-58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Momigliano, 1975. Alien Wisdom: The Limits of Hellenization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Wardman, 1976. ''Rome's debt to Greece''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JulianusII-antioch(360-363)-CNG.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Julian (emperor)]]]]
Among Romans the career of [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]] (died 174 BC), who appeared at the [[Isthmian Games]] in [[Corinth]] in 196 BC and proclaimed the freedom of the Greek states, was fluent in Greek, stood out, according to [[Livy]], as a great admirer of Greek culture;  the Greeks hailed him as their liberator.&lt;ref&gt;A modern assessment is E. Badian, 1970. ''Titus Quinctius Flamininus: Philhellenism and Realpolitik''0&lt;/ref&gt; There were however, some Romans during the late Republic, who were distinctly anti-Greek, resenting the increasing influence of Greek culture on Roman life, an example being the Roman Censor, Cato the Elder and also Cato the Younger who lived during the "Greek invasion" of Rome but towards the later years of his life he eventually became a philhellene after his stay in Rhodes.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The lyric poet [[Quintus Horatius Flaccus]] was another philhellene. He is notable for his words, "Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit et artis intulit agresti Latio" (Conquered Greece took captive her savage conqueror and brought her arts into rustic Latium), meaning that after the conquest of Greece the defeated Greeks created a cultural hegemony over the Romans.

Roman emperors known for their philhellenism include [[Nero]], [[Hadrian]], [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Julian the Apostate]].

==Modern times==
{{quote|"The world is the expanding Greece and Greece is the shrinking world."|[[Victor Hugo]]}}
{{See also|Classical tradition|Classics}}

In the period of political reaction and repression after the fall of [[Napoleon]], when the liberal-minded, educated and prosperous middle and upper classes of European societies found the [[Romanticism|romantic]] revolutionary ideals of 1789&amp;ndash;92 repressed by the restoration of old regimes at home, the idea of the re-creation of a Greek state on the very territories that were sanctified by their view of Antiquity—which was reflected even in the [[neoclassicism|furnishings of their own parlors]] and the contents of their bookcases—offered an ideal, set at a romantic distance. Under these conditions, the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek uprising]] constituted a source of inspiration and expectations that could never actually be fulfilled, disappointing what [[Paul Cartledge]] called "the Victorian self-identification with the Glory that was Greece".&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge&lt;/ref&gt; American higher education was fundamentally transformed by the rising admiration of and identification with ancient Greece in the 1830s and afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Culture of Classicism: Ancient Greece and Rome in American Intellectual Life, 1780-1910|last=Winterer|first=Caroline|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victor Hugo by Étienne Carjat 1876 - full.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Victor Hugo]], a well known philhellene]]

Another popular subject of interest in Greek culture at the turn of the 19th century was the shadowy [[Scythian]] philosopher [[Anacharsis]], who lived in the 6th century BCE. The new prominence of Anacharsis was sparked by [[Jean-Jacques Barthélemy]]'s fanciful ''Travels of Anacharsis the Younger in Greece'' (1788), a learned imaginary [[travel journal]], one of the first [[historical novels]], which a modern scholar has called "the encyclopedia of the new cult of the antique" in the late 18th century. It had a high impact on the growth of philhellenism in France: the book went through many editions, was reprinted in the United States and was translated into German and other languages. It later inspired European sympathy for the Greek War of Independence and spawned sequels and imitations throughout the 19th century.

In German culture the first phase of philhellenism can be traced in the careers and writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], one of the inventors of art history, [[Friedrich August Wolf]], who inaugurated modern [[Homeric scholarship]] with his ''Prolegomena ad Homerum'' (1795) and the enlightened bureaucrat [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. It was also in this context that [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] were to compose poetry and prose in the field of literature, elevating Hellenic themes in their works. In the [[German states]], the private obsession with ancient Greece took public forms, institutionalizing an elite philhellene [[ethos]] through the ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'', to revitalize [[German education]] at home, and providing on two occasions high-minded philhellene German princes ignorant of modern-day Greek realities, to be Greek sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;The history of pedagogically conservative philhellenism in German high academic culture has been examined in [[Suzanne L. Marchand]], ''Down from Olympus: Archaeology and Philhellenism in Germany, 1750-1970'' ([[Princeton University Press]], 1996); she begins with Winckelmann, Wolf and von Humboldt.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later 19th century the new studies of archaeology and anthropology began to offer a quite separate view of ancient Greece, which had previously been experienced at second-hand only through [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]],  [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Greek sculpture]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Marchand, 1992. ''Archaeology and Cultural Politics in Germany, 1800-1965: The Decline of Philhellenism'' (University of Chicago).&lt;/ref&gt; 20th century heirs of the 19th-century view of an unchanging, immortal quality of "Greekness" are typified in J.C. Lawson's ''Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion'' (1910) or R. and E. Blum's ''The Dangerous Hour: The lore of crisis and mystery in rural Greece'' (1970); according to the Classicist [[Paul Cartledge]], they "represent this ideological construction of Greekness as an essence, a Classicizing essence to be sure, impervious to such historic changes as that from [[Greek paganism|paganism]] to [[Orthodox Christianity]], or from [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence peasant agriculture]] to more or less internationally [[Industrial agriculture|market-driven capitalist farming]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philhellenic movement led to the introduction of [[Classics]] or ''Classical studies'' as a key element in education, introduced in the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasien]] in [[Prussia]]. In [[England]] the main proponent of Classics in schools was [[Thomas Arnold]], headmaster at [[Rugby School]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The theme of [[Nikos Dimou]]'s ''The Misfortune to be Greek''&lt;ref&gt;''Η δυστυχία του να είσαι Έλληνας'', 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; is the perception that the Philhellenic West's projected desire for the modern Greeks to live up to their ancestors' glorious past has always been a burden upon the Greeks themselves. In particular, Western Philhellenism focused exclusively on the heritage of Classical Greek history, in effect negating or rejecting the heritage of [[Byzantine]] history which for the Greeks themselves is at least as important.

===Philhellenism and art===
Philhellenism also created a renewed interest in the artistic movement of [[Neoclassicism]], which idealized 5th-century Classical Greek art and architecture.,&lt;ref&gt;It often selected for its favoured models third and second century sculptures that were actually [[Hellenistic]] in origin, and appreciated through the lens of Roman copies: see Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Antique Sculpture 1500-1900'' 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; very much at second hand, through the writings of the first generation of art historians, like [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]].

The groundswell of the Philhellenic movement was result of two generations of intrepid artists and amateur treasure-seekers, from Stuart and Revett, who published their measured drawings as ''The Antiquities of Athens'' and culminating with the removal of sculptures from [[Aegina]] and the [[Parthenon]] (the [[Elgin marbles]]), works that ravished the British Philhellenes, many of whom, however, deplored their removal.

===Philhellenism in the Greek War of Independence and later===
{{main article|Greek War of Independence#Philhellenism}}

Many well known philhellenes supported the Greek Independence Movement such as [[Shelley]], [[Thomas Moore]], [[Leigh Hunt]], [[Cam Hobhouse]], [[Walter Savage Landor]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=M3L_icA5UEEC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=London+Philhellenic+Committee+shelley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_fWoAMFScu&amp;sig=P1weOBP1EYMuQTCVFw32axZaOHE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitiJTBlOHOAhXB1xQKHXSTCFsQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=London%20Philhellenic%20Committee%20shelley&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, notably [[Lord Byron]], even took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries. Many more financed the revolution or contributed through their artistic work.

Throughout the 19th century, philhellenes continued to support Greece politically and militarily. For example, [[Ricciotti Garibaldi]] led a volunteer expedition (''Garibaldini'') in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Pécout, "Philhellenism in Italy: political friendship and the Italian volunteers in the Mediterranean in the nineteenth century", ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' '''9''':4:405-427 (2004) {{doi|10.1080/1354571042000296380}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Garibaldini, headed by the Greek poet [[Lorentzos Mavilis]], fought also with the Greek side during the [[Balkan Wars]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Plain Folk of the Old South''''' is a 1949 book by [[Vanderbilt University]] historian [[Frank Lawrence Owsley]], one of the [[Southern Agrarians]].  In it he used statistical data to analyze the makeup of [[Southern United States|Southern]] society, contending that yeoman farmers made up a larger middle class than was generally thought.&lt;ref&gt;Carey (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical perspectives ==
Historians have long debated the social, economic, and political roles of Southern [[Social class|class]]es.  Terms used by scholars for the non-elite class include "common people" and  "yeomen."  At a lower status level are the [[poor white]]s known disparagingly, in some areas of the South, as  "[[Georgia cracker|Crackers]]."&lt;ref name="Hyde"&gt;Hyde (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colonial and antebellum years, subsistence farmers tended to settle in the back country and uplands.  They generally did not raise [[commodity crops]] and owned few or no [[Slavery in the United States|slave]]s.  [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] favored the term "yeoman" for a land-owning farmer.  It emphasized an independent political spirit and economic self-reliance.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views of Olmsted, Dodd, and Phillips ===

Northerners such as [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who traveled in and wrote about the 1850s South, through the early 20th-century historians such as [[William E. Dodd]] and [[Ulrich B. Phillips]], assessed common southerners as minor players in [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] social, economic, and political life of the South.

Twentieth-century romantic portrayals of the antebellum South, such as [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1936) and the 1939 film adaptation, mostly ignored the yeomen. The nostalgic view of the South emphasized the [[elite]] [[Planter (American South)|planter class]] of wealth and refinement, controlling large plantations and numerous slaves.

Novelist [[Erskine Caldwell]]'s ''[[Tobacco Road (novel)|Tobacco Road]]'' portrayed the degraded condition of whites dwelling beyond the great plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Darden Asbury | first1 = Pyron | year = 1981 | title = The Inner War of Southern History | url = | journal = Southern Studies: an Interdisciplinary Journal of the South | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 5–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frank Lawrence Owsley ===
The major challenge to the view of planter dominance came from historian [[Frank Lawrence Owsley]] in ''Plain Folk of the Old South'' (1949).  His work ignited a long historiographical debate.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Owsley started with the work of Daniel R. Hundley, who in 1860 had defined the southern middle class as "farmers, planters, traders, storekeepers, artisans, mechanics, a few manufacturers, a goodly number of country school teachers, and a host of half-fledged [[country lawyers]], doctors, parsons, and the like".&lt;ref&gt;Hundley (1860); Tommy W. Rogers, "D. R. Hundley: A Multi-Class Thesis of Social Stratification in the Antebellum South," ''Mississippi Quarterly'' 1970 23(2): 135–154&lt;/ref&gt;  To find these people, Owsley turned to the name-by-name files on the manuscript federal census.  Using their own newly invented codes, the Owsleys created databases from the manuscript federal census returns, tax and trial records, and local government documents and wills.  They gathered data on all southerners.  Historian Vernon Burton described Owsley's ''Plain Folk of the Old South'', as "one of the most influential works on southern history ever written".&lt;ref&gt;Vernon O. Burton, "Frank Lawrence Owsley," in ''American National Biography'', Volume 16 ed by John Arthur Garraty (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Plain Folk'' argued that southern society was not dominated by planter aristocrats, but that yeoman farmers played a significant role in it. The religion, language, and culture of these common people created a democratic "plain folk" society. Critics say Owsley overemphasized the size of the southern landholding middle class, while excluding the large class of [[Poor White|poor white]]s who owned neither land nor slaves.  Owsley believed that shared economic interests united southern farmers; critics suggest the vast difference in economic classes between the elite and subsistence farmers meant they did not have the same values or outlook.&lt;ref name="Hyde" /&gt;

=== Recent scholarship ===
In his study of [[Edgefield County]], [[South Carolina]], Orville Vernon Burton classified white society into the poor, the yeoman middle class, and the elite.  A clear line demarcated the elite, but according to Burton, the line between poor and yeoman was less distinct. Stephanie McCurry argues that yeomen were clearly distinguished from poor whites by their ownership of land (real property).  Yeomen were "self-working farmers", distinct from the elite because they physically labored on their land alongside any slaves they owned.  Planters with numerous slaves had work that was essentially managerial, and often they supervised an overseer rather than the slaves themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Burton (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wetherington (2005) argues the plain folk (of Georgia) supported secession to defend their families, homes, and notions of white liberty.  During the war, the established patriarchy continued to control the home front and kept it functioning, even though growing numbers of plain folk joined the new wartime poor.  Wetherington suggests that their localism and racism dovetailed with a republican ideology founded on Jeffersonian notions of an "economically independent yeomanry sharing common interests".&lt;ref&gt;Wetherington (2005) p, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Plain folk during the war raised subsistence crops and vegetables and relied on a free and open range to hunt hogs. Examples of these conditions can be seen in the award-winning novel [[Cold Mountain (novel)|''Cold Mountain'']].

Before the war, they became more active in the cotton and slave markets, but plain folk remained unwilling to jeopardize their self-sufficiency and the stability of their neighborhoods for the economic interests of planters. The soldiers had their own reasons for fighting. First and foremost, they sought to protect hearth and home from Yankee threats. [[White supremacy]] and masculinity depended on slavery, which Lincoln's Republicans threatened. Plain-folk concepts of masculinity explain why so many men enlisted: they wanted to be worthy of the privileges of men, including the affections of female patriots. By March 1862, the piney woods region of Georgia had a 60% enlistment rate, comparable to that found in planter areas.&lt;ref&gt;Wetherington (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war dragged on, hardship became a way of life. Wetherington reports that enough men remained home to preserve the paternalistic social order, but there were too few to prevent mounting deprivation. Wartime shortages increased the economic divide between planters and yeoman farmers; nevertheless, some planters took seriously their paternalistic obligations by selling their corn to plain folk at the official Confederate rate "out of a spirit of patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;Wetherington (2005) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Wetherington's argument weakens other scholars' suggestions that class conflict led to Confederate defeat. More damaging to Confederate nationalism was the growing localism that grew, as areas had to fend for themselves as [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s forces came nearer.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction Era after the war]], plain folk split. Most supported the conservative (or Democratic Party) position, but some were "[[Scalawags]]" who supported the Republicans for a while.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''politics of [[New England]]''' has long been defined by the region's political and cultural history, demographics, economy, and its loyalty to particular U.S. political parties. Within the [[politics of the United States]], New England is sometimes viewed in terms of a single voting bloc. Of the twenty-one congressional districts in New England, twenty are currently represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. In the [[United States Senate|Senate]], nine Democrats, two Independents (both of whom caucus with Democrats), and one [[Susan Collins|Republican]] represent New England. The Democratic candidate has won a plurality of votes in every State in New England in every presidential election since [[2004 Presidential Election (United States)|2004]], making the region considerably more Democratic than the rest of the nation.

[[Same-sex marriage]] is permitted in [[Same-sex marriage in New England|all six New England states]], with [[Same-sex marriage in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] being the final state to legalise the practice in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/08/01/same-sex-marriages-begin-rhode-island/jmLqnKf1lyRuYr70l9vaMO/story.html | work=Boston Globe | title=Same-sex marriages begin in R.I., Minnesota | date=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Maine, it was legalized by the legislature in 2009, but [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|defeated in a referendum]] (53% voted to ban it versus 47% who voted to legalize it) later the same year. On January 26, 2012, supporters of a ballot initiative to repeal that decision obtained sufficient petition signatures to ensure the initiative appeared on the November 2012 ballot, where the initiative won 53–47.

The national U.S. [[Anti-nuclear movement in the United States|movement against nuclear power]] had its roots in New England in the 1970s. In 1974, activist Sam Lovejoy toppled a weather tower at the site of the proposed [[Montague Nuclear Power Plant]] in Western Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=ken/&gt; The movement "reached critical mass" with the arrests at [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]] on May 1, 1977, when 1,414 [[anti-nuclear]] activists from the [[Clamshell Alliance]] were arrested at the Seabrook site. [[Harvey Wasserman]], a Clamshell spokesman at Seabrook, and [[Frances Crowe]] of Northampton, an [[American Friends Service Committee]] member, played key roles in the movement.&lt;ref name=ken&gt;Michael Kenney.

===Same-sex marriage===
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in New England}}

[[Same-sex marriage]] is legal or has been legalized in all of the New England states: [[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|Maine]], [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Same-sex marriage in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]], as well as in the neighboring state of [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]].

The legalization of same-sex marriage was part of a campaign which began in November 2008, called Six by Twelve, and was organized by the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders|Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD)]] to legalize same-sex marriage in all six New England states by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/BPnews.asp?ID=30392 'Gay marriage' bill passes N.H.

===Anti-nuclear movement===
{{See also|Paul Gunter|Harvey Wasserman|Frances Crowe|Macy Morse}}

There were four targets of the anti-nuclear movement since 1974. As a result, Montague Nuclear was cancelled. Yankee Rowe closed prematurely for engineering inadequacies. Vermont Yankee was closed because it became uncompetitive. Seabrook remains operational.

====Montague Nuclear Power Plant====
On February 22, 1934, Sam Lovejoy took a crowbar to the weather-monitoring tower which had been erected at the [[Montague Nuclear Power Plant]] site. Lovejoy fell {{convert|349|ft}} from the {{convert|550|ft}} tower. He turned himself in to the local police. He presented a statement in which he took responsibility for the action. Lovejoy's action galvanized local public opinion against the plant.&lt;ref name=goo&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19810104&amp;id=rbcVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yg4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3870,625153 Utilities Drop Nuclear Power Plant Plans] ''Ocala Star-Banner'', January 4, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YKP_KZGD7dwC&amp;pg=PA382&amp;lpg=PA382&amp;dq=%22Judith+Johnsrud%22+nuclear&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-JeNY0lHLd&amp;sig=VJNzMbeuJL-gPsF1vdjSWZUkYOQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zH40SomcB5aG6wPPlYnHDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#PPA394,M1  No nukes by Anna Gyorgy] pp. 393–394.&lt;/ref&gt; The Montague nuclear power plant proposal was canceled in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nu.com/aboutnu/timeline.asp  Some of the Major Events in NU's History Since the 1966 Affiliation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224104529/http://www.nu.com/aboutnu/timeline.asp |date=2013-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after $29 million was spent on the project.&lt;ref name=goo/&gt;

====Yankee Rowe====
The [[New England Coalition]] (NEC) is an educational non-profit organization based in Brattleboro, Vermont. Historically, it has been part of the [[anti-nuclear movement]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=NEC&gt;[http://necnp.org/ New England Coalition].&lt;/ref&gt; The NEC is primarily concerned with legal action more than protests. It was involved in both legal action and protests about the [[Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Plant]] prior to its shut down in 1992, and has been involved in legal action and protests over extending the license to operate at the [[Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]].

====Vermont Yankee====
In February 2010, the [[Vermont Senate]] voted 26 to 4 against allowing the PSB to consider re-certifying the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant after 2012, citing radioactive [[tritium]] leaks, misstatements in testimony by plant officials, a cooling tower collapse in 2007, and other problems.&lt;ref name=NYT01&gt;Wald, Matthew L., [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/us/25nuke.html Vermont Senate Votes to Close Nuclear Plant] ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, [[Entergy]] won a court case to invalidate the state's veto power on continued operation.&lt;ref name="PR Newswire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/entergy-to-close-decommission-vermont-yankee-221304391.html |title=Entergy to Close, Decommission Vermont Yankee |publisher=PR Newswire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a number of [[anti-nuclear protests]] about Vermont Yankee since the 1970s. These included protests following the Japanese [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in March 2011 and on the date of the original operating license expiry in March 2012. On August 28, 2013 the company said economic factors, notably the low cost of electricity caused by cheap natural gas, would result in the company's decommissioning the plant in the fourth quarter of 2014.&lt;ref name="PR Newswire"/&gt;

NSA did the operational interception, and, if information that would be of interest to other intelligence agencies was found, the material was passed to them.&lt;ref name=NSA-SSC1976-04-23&gt;{{cite web |author=Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities |title=Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans: National Security Agency Surveillance Affecting Americans |date=April 23, 1976 |url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIj.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Intercepted messages were disseminated to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] (BNDD), and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]." No court authorized the operation and there were no warrants.

The precursor to the project according to Budiansky occurred in 1940, "In January 1940 the Army's adjutant general sent a letter to the president of [[RCA]], [[David Sarnoff]], asking if a Lieutenant Earle F. Cook might be assigned to the company..." Cook photographed all international commercial cablegrams. "The clandestine arrangement—almost certainly illegal—set a precedent..." Official wartime censorship began in Dec. 1940, when all cables were "turned over to the government for inspection." According to [[Louis W. Tordella|Tordella]], "the collection program 'just ran on' ever since its beginning in World War II 'without a great deal of attention from anyone'..." Three major cable companies provided copies of all international telegrams passing through New York, Washington, and San Francisco. In the 1950s, "New Shamrock" tapped the links of 60–70 foreign embassies.&lt;ref name=Stephen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Budiansky |first1=Stephen|title=Code Warriors|date=2016|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=9780385352666|pages=23,286–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of Project SHAMROCK, 150,000 messages a month were printed and analyzed by NSA personnel.

In May 1975 however, Congressional critics began to investigate and expose the program. As a result, NSA director [[Lew Allen]] terminated it, on his own authority rather than that of other intelligence agencies. According to Budiansky, a 1977 US Deparment of Justice review concluded wiretap laws were violated, but "If the intelligence agencies possessed too much discretionary authority with too little accountability, that would seem to be a 35-year failing of Presidents and the Congress rather than the agencies or their personnel."&lt;ref name=Stephen/&gt;

The testimony of both the representatives from the cable companies and of director Allen at the hearings prompted [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] chairman Senator [[Frank Church]] to conclude that Project SHAMROCK was "probably the largest government interception program affecting Americans ever undertaken."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

One result of these investigations was the 1978 creation of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) which limited the powers of the NSA and put in place a process of warrants and judicial review. Another internal safeguard, was United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18 (USSID 18), an internal NSA and intelligence community set of procedures, originally issued in 1980.&lt;ref name=USSID18&gt;{{cite web |author=National Security Agency |title=U.S. Signal Intelligence Directive 18: Legal Compliance and Minimization Procedures
|url=http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/1118/CLEANEDFinal%20USSID%20SP0018.pdf |date=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USSID 18 was the general guideline for handling signal intelligence [[SIGINT]] inadvertently collected on US citizens, without a warrant, prior to the [[George W. Bush]] Administration. The post-Clinton era interpretations of FISA and USSID 18's principles assume that the executive branch has [[unitary authority]] for warrantless surveillance. This assertion came under congressional investigation as an apparent violation of FISA's intent.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21819">'''The psychology of film''' is a sub-field of the [[psychology of art]] that studies the characteristics of [[film]] and its production in relation to [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[narrative]] understanding, and [[emotion]]. A growing number of psychological scientists and brain scientists have begun conducting empirical studies that describe the cognitive and biological underpinnings of motion pictures or what has been called "psychocinematics".&lt;ref name=Shimamura&gt;{{cite book|last=Shimamura|first=Arthur P. (Editor)|title=Psychocinematics: Exploring Cognition at the Movies|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early theoretical approaches included works by psychologists [[Hugo Münsterberg]]&lt;ref name="Münsterberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Münsterberg|first=Hugo|title=The Photoplay. A psychological study|year=1916|publisher= Appleton.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudolf Arnheim]].&lt;ref name=Arnheim&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|title=Film as Art: 50th Anniversary Printing|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive film theorists [[David Bordwell]] and [[Noël Carroll]] fostered its philosophical underpinnings.

==Sensory Features==
Film is rather unusual as it involves an integration of visual and auditory stimuli. In [[Fictional film|narrative films]], plots are guided by camera placement and movement, dialogue, sound effects, and editing. Some aspects of film are driven by bottom-up or sensory guided factors (such as light, motion or sound), whereas other aspects depend more on top-down or conceptually driven factors, like past experiences and internal motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Whan|author2=Daniel C. Smith |title=Product Level Choice: A Top-Down or Bottom-Up Process?|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=December 1989|volume=16|issue=3|pages=289–299|doi=10.1086/209215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editing===

Cuts and flashbacks represent types of editing that alter the normal temporal sequencing of events, creating non-linear narrative structures. Editing creates the transition between events. Research focusing on recall ability for linear versus non-linear narratives suggests that temporal changes impact memory of events, but not comprehension.&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowe|first=Phillip J.|author2=Durkin, Kevin |title=The effect of flashback on children's understanding of television crime content|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=1 January 1999|volume=43|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1080/08838159909364476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film cuts are instantaneous, perceptual, and sometimes temporal discontinuities that do not exist in our own realities. However, despite this, viewers accept cuts as a natural storytelling technique in film. Even though we see reality in a continuous flow of linked images, in movies, cuts seem to work, regardless of how experienced a viewer is. [[Walter Murch]] suggests that this is because viewers are in fact used to cuts in their everyday lives through the act of [[blinking]]. When you turn to look at an object, for example, you normally blink, thus creating a visual break in continuity between what you ''were'' looking at and what you are now looking at. Another possibility that Murch explores to explain humans’ innate acceptance of film cuts is the way in which we [[dream]]. Our dreams tend to jump around from place to place and situation to situation without any real sense of continuity. Thus the [[Oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]] nature of [[film]]s is familiar to viewers and allows them to innately understand the [[editing]] despite discontinuities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33334569|title=In the blink of an eye : a perspective on film editing|last=1943-|first=Murch, Walter,|date=1995|publisher=Silman-James Press|isbn=9781879505230|edition= 1st |location=Los Angeles|oclc=33334569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwan &amp; Ildirar (2010), who focused solely on inexperienced viewers’ ability to comprehend film, found that the comprehensibility of films was determined by whether or not they followed a familiar line of action. Overall, our brains accept the perceptual discontinuities found in films, but it is ultimately easier for viewers, regardless of their experience, to understand cuts that follow a continuous and familiar line of action as opposed to ones that are more discontinuous. When a familiar line is not present, more experienced viewers are significantly better at comprehending a complex narrative by “filtering” out editing discontinuities.&lt;ref name="schwan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwan|first=S.|author2=Ildirar, S.|date=7 June 2010|title=Watching Film for the First Time: How Adult Viewers Interpret Perceptual Discontinuities in Film|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=7|pages=970–976|doi=10.1177/0956797610372632|pmid=20530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, however, [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] linearity that creates temporal continuity is more important than [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] for recall and understanding of a [[Narrative structure|narrative’s]] events.[[Psychology of film#cite note-cowen-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Sequence of events===

[[Cognitive neuroscience]] research demonstrates that some movies can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. Studying the neuroscience of film is based on the hypothesis that some films, or film segments, lead viewers through a similar sequence of perceptual, emotional and cognitive states. Using [[fMRI]] brain imaging, researchers asked participants to watch 30 minutes of [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] (1966) as they lay on their backs in the MRI scanner. Despite the seemingly uncontrolled task and complex nature of the stimulus, brain activity was similar across viewers’ brains, particularly in spatiotemporal areas. When compared to a random sequence of scenes, the specific order of events seemed to be strongly associated with this similarity in brain activity. It was also determined that the level of control a movie has on someone’s mental state is highly dependent upon the cinematic devices (pans, cuts and close-ups) it contains. Tightly edited films exert more control on brain activity and eye-movement than open-ended films. However, similar eye-movement and similarity in visual processing does not guarantee similar brain responses.&lt;ref name=hasson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hasson|first=Uri|author2=Landesman, Ohad |author3=Knappmeyer, Barbara |author4=Vallines, Ignacio |author5=Rubin, Nava |author6= Heeger, David J. |title=Neurocinematics: The Neuroscience of Film|journal=Projections|date=30 August 2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.3167/proj.2008.020102|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.2650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the average correlation in taste between individual viewers is rather low and not well predicted by film critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.3167/proj.2017.110107|title = Strikingly Low Agreement in the Appraisal of Motion Pictures|journal = Projections|volume = 11|year = 2017|last1 = Wallisch|first1 = Pascal|last2 = Alden Whritner|first2 = Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spatial Information===

Viewing spaces on screen from a stable point of view is important for short-term spatial coding and long term spatial memory. Long-time viewers of the television show ''[[Friends]]'' were significantly better at accurately recalling spatial information about the show's set, because the camera never moves away from the "[[fourth wall]]". Equally experienced viewers of the show "[[ER (TV series)|E.R.]]" were less likely to recall information about the set and be able to mentally orient themselves inside it, because the show is filmed from many different angles.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Daniel T.|author2=Wang, Caryn |title=Spatial Representation in Cognitive Science and Film|journal=Projections|date=1 June 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24–52|doi=10.3167/proj.2009.030103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study,&lt;ref name=hirose&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirose|first=Yoriko|title=Perception and memory across viewpoint changes in moving images|journal=Journal of Vision|date=1 January 2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=1–19|doi=10.1167/10.4.2|pmid=20465322}}&lt;/ref&gt; observers were instructed to look at short movies involving changes in point of view. They used 15 movie clips featuring a handbag, whose properties (color, position, identity, and shape) were manipulated across cuts. Observers' reactions were recorded by examining eye-movement, changes in behavior and memory performance. The researchers later asked the observers if they had noticed anything unusual occur during the clips, without directly referring to the handbag. Changing the position of objects, i.e. the handbag, between scenes was the only variable that did not appear to affect eye-movement or memory. Overall, observers were more likely to draw their attention and look sooner at the handbag-stimulus at the moment right after its properties changed. When specifically asked about it, they were more likely to describe the handbag in terms of its post-cut properties, after a change had occurred. Even though their visual system appeared to pick up on the changes, observers were not consciously aware of them or able to report noticeable differences across cuts. The results illustrate that observers construct and maintain internal visual representations of complex visual environments while viewing dynamic scenes. This also helps explain why movie viewers usually are not aware of continuity errors in editing.&lt;ref name="hirose"/&gt;

===Cinematic techniques===

Cinematic techniques are often regarded as grammatical structures or components of the cinematic art as a language made up of images.&lt;ref name=Messaris94&gt;{{cite book|last=Messaris|first=Paul|title=Visual "Literacy": Image, Mind, Reality|year=1994|publisher=Westview|location=Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A period of visual adaptation is necessary before being able to understand images in movies or on [[television]].  Viewers need sufficient exposure to cinematic techniques and the meanings attributed to them to adequately interpret the images on the screen. At a very young age, we learn how to watch videos and understand different editing techniques. One study looked at adult participants who had very little exposure to film to see if they were able to understand simple editing techniques, such as [[point of view shot]]s, [[establishing shot]]s, [[Panning (camera)|pan shots]], [[Shot reverse shot|shot/reverse shot]], ellipsis of time, and [[cross-cutting]]. These viewers were able to understand some of the techniques, such as ellipses of time; however, more complex techniques, like shot/reverse shot were more difficult for them to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwan|first=Stephan|author2=Sermin Ildirar |title=Watching Film for the First Time: How Adult Viewers Interpret Perceptual Discontinuities in Film|journal=Association for Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=21|issue=7|pages=969–976|doi=10.1177/0956797610372632|pmid=20530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[filmmaking]] techniques derive meaning through past experiences or [[Ideology|ideologies]] that influence the way viewers see certain images or sequence of images. An example of this would be how [[camera angle]]s can affect our perception of what is occurring on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baranowski|first=Andreas|last2=Hecht|first2=Heiko|date=2017-05-30|title=Effect of Camera Angle on Perception of Trust and Attractiveness|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317237444|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|volume=36|pages=90–100|doi=10.1177/0276237417710762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low angle shots in which the camera is pointed up at a subject tend to make the subject appear more powerful or stronger. While high angle shots can make a subject appear weaker. These interpretations of [[camera angle]]s, however, ultimately derive from the notion that bigger is better. The lateral movement of a subject across the screen can also influence an audience's interpretation of the subject.  For example, characters that move from left-to-right are perceived more positively than characters who move right-to-left. This partiality toward rightward movement likely has its roots in the predominance of right-handedness in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L Egizii|first=Matthew|last2=Denny|first2=James|last3=Neuendorf|first3=Kimberly|last4=D Skalski|first4=Paul|last5=Campbell|first5=Rachel|date=2012-05-01|title=Which Way Did He Go? Directionality of Film Character and Camera Movement and Subsequent Spectator Interpretation|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the practice of reading left-to-right in [[Western Romance languages|Western languages]].

====Changes in film techniques====

One study compiled data on the changing trends in techniques by examining 160 English-language films released from 1935-2010.&lt;ref name=cutting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutting|first=James E|author2=Brunick, Kaitlin L |author3=DeLong, Jordan E |author4=Iricinschi, Catalina |author5= Candan, Ayse |title=Quicker, faster, darker: Changes in Hollywood film over 75 years|journal=I-Perception|date=1 January 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=569–576|doi=10.1068/i0441aap|pmid=23145246|pmc=3485803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cutting" /&gt;  The findings demonstrate that over time shot lengths have become shorter, while the shorter the shot the more motion it is likely to contain. In addition, contemporary films have significantly more motion and movement than older ones. Motion is the optical change created by moving objects, people, and shadows; movement is that change created by camera motion or gradual lens change.
Presumably, the film industry has capitalized on the results of previous psychological research that shows motion and the onset of motion capture our attention.&lt;ref name=hillstrom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillstrom|first=Anne P.|author2=Yantis, Steven |title=Visual motion and attentional capture|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=1 July 1994|volume=55|issue=4|pages=399–411|doi=10.3758/BF03205298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, films have become darker over time, as the overall brightness of the images on the movie screen has decreased.&lt;ref name="cutting" /&gt;

These changes in film-making choices increase attention manipulation and are thought to facilitate comprehension.

==Top-down factors==
Top-down factors refer to expectations and background knowledge that influence viewers' perception, understanding and appreciation of film. Expertise, attention and eye-movements are top-down factors that guide how viewers experience film.

===Expertise and awareness of audience manipulation===

Explicit awareness about the processes by which meaning is created by the visual media could be regarded as one measure of film expertise and sophistication. Increased awareness of the subtle techniques employed by filmmakers to “manipulate” audiences leads to increased admiration and aesthetic responses to film,&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=L.|title=Art as the communication of competence|journal=Social Science Information|date=1 December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=115–141|doi=10.1177/053901847301200604}}&lt;/ref&gt;   as in other forms of visual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=D.W.|title=When the Movies Were Young|year=1975|publisher=Benjamin Blom|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Researchers have identified a strong relationship between prior film experience and conscious awareness of visual manipulations, especially for people with practical experience in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Sol|title=Through Navajo Eyes: An Exploration in Film Communication and Anthropology|year=1972|publisher=Indiana University Press.|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study compared the participants’ ability to understand narrative in Hollywood versus experimental film, by measuring interpretational awareness. Subjects with significant, moderate and no formal background or experience in film viewed a film that contained both scenes with Hollywood-style and experimental-style editing. Regardless of expertise level, participants described the Hollywood-like scenes in “naturalistic terms,” as if their events had occurred in reality and tended not to make explicit references to stylistic techniques. This interpretational tendency reflects Hollywood’s “invisible style.” When describing the experimental scenes, inexperienced viewers struggled to construct a cohesive “naturalistic” narrative. More experienced viewers were more likely to make explicit reference to the “breaking of conventions” and the intentions behind them.&lt;ref name=messaris81&gt;{{cite journal|last=Messaris|first=Paul|title=The Film Audience's Awareness of the Production Process|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|year=1981|volume=33|issue=4|pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film editing seems to be a barrier of awareness for conventional Hollywood-type movies, as they create an illusion of “real life”.

===Segmentation===

Segmentation or event segmentation is a fundamental component of attention that facilitates understanding, object recognition and planning. Event segmentation constitutes breaking down dynamic scenes into spatial and temporal parts or units of events.

Event segmentation is viewed as “the brain’s cutting-room floor.”&lt;ref name=zacksj /&gt; 
It is considered to be an automatic and ongoing process that depends on meaningful changes in a perceived situation. To test this, researchers measured brain activity while participants viewed an extended narrative film. They used MRI scanning to show transient evoked brain responses (changes in brain activity) at those points they identified as event boundaries (changes in situation). Situational changes were coded frame by frame into spatial, temporal, object, character, causal and goal changes. Participants were then instructed to perform an event segmentation task by watching a movie and pressing a button to identify units of activity that were natural and meaningful to them. Paying attention to situational changes gives rise to a neural cascade that is consciously perceived at the end of one event and the beginning of another.&lt;ref name=zacksj&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=J|title=Human Brain Activity Time-locked to Perceptual Event Boundaries|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=4|pages=651–655|doi=10.1038/88486|pmid=11369948|year=2001|last2=Braver|first2=TS|last3=Sheridan|first3=MA|last4=Donaldson|first4=DI|last5=Snyder|first5=AZ|last6=Ollinger|first6=JM|last7=Buckner|first7=RL|last8=Raichle|first8=ME|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Event Segmentation Theory (EST),&lt;ref name=zacks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Speer, Nicole K. |author3=Swallow, Khena M. |author4=Braver, Todd S. |author5= Reynolds, Jeremy R. |title=Event perception: A mind-brain perspective|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 2007|volume=133|issue=2|pages=273–293|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.273|pmid=17338600|pmc=2852534}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the perception of event boundaries is a side effect of prediction during ongoing perception. Prediction is an adaptive mechanism made up of cognitive event models that represent “what is going on now” to create expectations and attentive biases for ongoing processing. Prediction errors occur at situational changes and cause information processing segmentation.

Broader narrative comprehension theories have also been applied to the perception and memory of movies.&lt;ref name=zacks2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Speer, Nicole K. |author3=Reynolds, Jeremy R. |title=Segmentation in reading and film comprehension|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=1 January 2009|volume=138|issue=2|pages=307–327|doi=10.1037/a0015305|pmid=19397386|citeseerx=10.1.1.496.1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects the hypothesis that the same mechanisms are used to understanding stories and real life. In one study, researchers illustrated the common episodic structure between text and film, by asking participants to match a constructed text story to the dialogueless movie [[The Red Balloon]]. This task required participants to locate episodes and their components within the cinematic story: exposition, complication and resolution.&lt;ref name=baggett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baggett|first=Patricia|title=Structurally equivalent stories in movie and text and the effect of the medium on recall|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=1 June 1979|volume=18|issue=3|pages=333–356|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(79)90191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-movement===

Using an [[Eye tracking|eyetracker]], researchers have discovered a strong center-of-screen bias with a distribution of gaze points approximately peaking at the screen center. However, eye gazes rarely focus on the same location. Visual dispersion across the screen increases over time and particularly, after repeated exposure to the same video stimulus. Because of this, there is greater gaze dispersion when viewers are watching advertisements compared to a television show.&lt;ref name=brasel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brasel|first=S Adam|author2=Gips, James |title=Points of view: Where do we look when we watch TV?|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2008|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1890–1894|doi=10.1068/p6253|pmid=19227380|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230036|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driver|first=J.|title=Parietal neglect and visual awareness|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–22|year=1998|doi=10.1038/217|pmid=10195103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Religious Studies Center''' (RSC) is the research and publishing arm of [[BYU Religious Education|Religious Education]] at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), sponsoring scholarship on [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]] (LDS) [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]], [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|history]], [[Standard Works|scripture]], and [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|doctrine]].&lt;ref name=RE2003&gt;{{cite journal | title=Religious Studies Center | journal=Religious Educator | year=2003 | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=110–111 | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/RelEducator,437 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dean of Religious Education serves as the RSC's director, and an associate dean oversees the two branches of the RSC: research and publications.

==History==
The RSC (sometimes called the '''Center for Religious Studies''' in its early years)&lt;ref name=ofcountries&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holland, Jeffrey R. | authorlink=Jeffrey R. Holland | title=…Of Countries and of Kingdoms | journal=[[BYU Studies]] | year=1977 | volume=18 | issue=1 | pages=4–5 | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/byustudies,570 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilkinson&gt;{{cite book | author=Wilkinson, Ernest L. | authorlink=Ernest L.

Holland]], dean of Religious Education at BYU.&lt;ref name=treasury&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Preface | title=A Book of Mormon Treasury: Gospel Insights From General Authorities and Religious Educators | year=2003 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | location=Provo, Utah | page=ix–x | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,22453 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the recommendation of [[List of presidents of Brigham Young University}BYU president]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]], the establishment of the RSC was approved by BYU's Board of Trustees in early 1976.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; Holland became the RSC's first director, with Keith H. Meservy, assistant professor of ancient scripture, as administrator.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; In 1976, Holland was appointed  [[Church Educational System#Chronology of the Commissioner of Church Education|Commissioner of Church Education]], and [[Ellis T. Rasmussen]] replaced him as dean of Religious Instruction and general director of the RSC.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen served as dean from 1976-81.  See: {{cite journal | author=McCarlie, V. Wallace | title=Sidney B. Sperry: Father of Religious Education at BYU | journal=Religious Education Review | date=Winter 2009 | url=http://byureligiouseducationreview.com/2009WinterSidneySperry.php | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126183328/http://byureligiouseducationreview.com/2009WinterSidneySperry.php | archivedate=2010-01-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Religious Education dean is also the RSC general director.  For Rasmussen, see: {{cite journal | author=Anderson, Lavina Fielding | authorlink=Lavina Fielding Anderson | title=A Respectful Meeting of the Minds | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=June 1978 | page=70| url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/06/a-respectful-meeting-of-the-minds | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSC brought together several earlier BYU institutions. It became the home of the '''Richard L. Evans Chair of Christian Understanding''',&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; which had been founded in 1973 with [[Truman G. Madsen]] as its first occupant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Chair of Christian Understanding Founded | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=January 1973 | page=138 | url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1973/01/news-of-the-church/chair-of-christian-understanding-founded | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madsen became a professor emeritus in 1994, and the position was renamed the '''Richard L. Evans Chair of Religious Understanding''', reflecting the hope that holders would extend the hand of friendship to all people, not just Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grover |first=Steven David |date=2008 |title=Building Bridges: The Richard L. Evans Chair of Religious Understanding |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/volume-9-number-2-2008/building-bridges-richard-l-evans-chair-religious-understanding |journal=Religious Educator |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=45–56 |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RSC also assumed and expanded upon the activities of the '''Institute of Mormon Studies''', which was founded to study Mormon history and doctrine under [[Daniel H. Ludlow]] in 1961 and Madsen in 1966. Likewise, the RSC absorbed the '''Book of Mormon Institute''', a center for research on the [[Book of Mormon]], with Ludlow as its first director in 1965, followed by [[Paul R. Cheesman]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt;

In September 1985, at the request of Holland, then BYU's president, the RSC began holding annual symposia on the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cheesman, Paul R. | authorlink=Paul R. Cheesman | chapter=Preface | title=The Book of Mormon: The Keystone Scripture: Papers from the First Annual Book of Mormon Symposium | page=ix | year=1988 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,19326 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was organized by  [[Paul R. Cheesman]], who also edited the published compilation of papers from that event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.lib.byu.edu/ead/XML/MSS2049.xml#bio |title=Biographical History |work=Register of the Paul R. Cheesman (1921-1991) Papers, 1945-1991 |publisher=[[Harold B. Lee Library]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each symposium successively covered following sections of the book&lt;ref name=matthews87&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Conversation about the BYU Religious Studies Center | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=January 1987 | pages=79–80 | url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/01/news-of-the-church/a-conversation-about-the-byu-religious-studies-center | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1994, when papers on the entire book had been published in nine anthology volumes in the ''Book of Mormon Symposium Series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Religious Studies Center Publications | editor=[[Monte S. Nyman]] |editor2=Charles D. Tate, Jr. | title=The Book of Mormon: Fourth Nephi Through Moroni, From Zion to Destruction: Papers From the Ninth Annual Book of Mormon Symposium, 1994 | page=ii | year=1995 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,21541 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty publications directors have consisted of [[S. Kent Brown]] (1985{{snd}}1987), Charles D. Tate Jr. (1987{{snd}}1994), [[Kent P. Jackson]] (1994{{snd}}2001), Richard D. Draper (2001{{snd}}2004), [[Richard N. Holzapfel]] (2004{{snd}}2010), [[Robert L. Millet]] (2010{{snd}}2012), Dana M. Pike (2012{{snd}}2013), Thomas A. Wayment (2013{{snd}}2018), and [https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles Scott C. Esplin] (2018{{snd}}present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles |title=Faculty and Staff Profiles |website=Religious Studies Center |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All have significantly influenced the nature and quality of the academic books and journal articles published.

In 2001, the dean of Religious Education, Andrew C. Skinner, asked Richard D. Draper to reorganize the center with Holzapfel as editor of the new ''Religious Educator'' journal and [https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles Devan Jensen] as executive editor to professionalize the publications. The RSC created a new advisory board with male and female members from diverse backgrounds with interest in ancient scripture and modern history and doctrine of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Draper negotiated a partnership with Covenant Communications to publish RSC materials; that partnership lasted about five years. The ''Religious Educator'' relied on copyediting by Ted D. Stoddard with design work by Stephen Hales Creative, based in Provo, Utah. Holzapfel started a project to digitize past RSC content; initiated translation of selected articles into Spanish, Portuguese, and German; and launched the ''BYU Religious Education Review'' magazine. Under the leadership of directors Millet, Pike, and Wayment, publications continued to win awards (see list below) and reach a wider audience.

==Purpose==
The RSC seeks to improve religion teaching at BYU, to encourage LDS religious studies, and to promote the study of other religions.  Believing that [[General Authority|church leaders]], not scholars, are the ultimate doctrinal authority, the RSC seeks to only add historical, cultural, and linguistic context and to explore new views of the LDS religious tradition.&lt;ref name=RE2003/&gt; The RSC coordinates and publishes this research&lt;ref name=waterman&gt;{{cite journal | author=Waterman, Bryan | title=A Guide to the Mormon Universe: Mormon Organizations &amp; Periodicals | journal=[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]] | date=December 1994 | issue=97 | page=52 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/097-44-65.pdf | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hopes of growing the body of LDS literature and thought.&lt;ref name=RE2003/&gt;

In 1977, as Church Commissioner of Education, Holland told the center that he hoped it would bring dialogue with other cultures and religions, leading to greater understanding, brotherhood, and peace.&lt;ref name=ofcountries/&gt;  Later, as president of BYU in 1986, Holland recalled that the RSC was established to inform those within the university and the general LDS membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Holzapfel, Richard N. | authorlink=Richard N. Holzapfel | title=It's a classic! | date=October 21, 2008 | work=RSC Blog | url=http://rsc.byu.edu/blog/?p=4 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the RSC began posting its complete library in English and selections in Spanish and Portuguese in order to increase its worldwide presence.&lt;ref&gt;http://rsc.byu.edu/{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
===Areas of study===
The RSC has funded research in several areas, including ancient scripture,&lt;ref name="nibleyRSC"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University | page=v | title=Nibley on the Timely and the Timeless: Classic Essays of Hugh Nibley | year=1978 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,16986 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ancient studies,&lt;ref name="nibleyRSC" /&gt; the [[Bible]],&lt;ref name="seila"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University | page=v | title=Excavations at Seila, Egypt | editor=[[C.

===Research and funding===
The RSC awards [[Grant (money)|financial grants]] to BYU faculty and other scholars for research into LDS history, doctrine, scripture, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Grants |work=Religious Studies Center |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |url=http://rsc.byu.edu/rsc_grants.php |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427210825/http://rsc.byu.edu/rsc_grants.php |archivedate=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research has been published by the RSC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Skousen, Royal | authorlink=Royal Skousen | chapter=The Book of Mormon Critical Text Project | page=65 | editor=[[Susan Easton Black]] |editor2=Charles D.

===Books===
The following titles show the breadth of books published by the RSC ([https://rsc.byu.edu/books complete list]): Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, eds., ''The Words of Joseph Smith''; Hugh W. Nibley, ''Nibley on the Timely and the Timeless''; Kenneth L. Alford, ed., ''Civil War Saints''; [[Roger P. Minert]], ''In Harm's Way: East German Latter-day Saints in World War II; ''Mark L.

Frederick, ''Joseph Smith's Seer Stones''. Several have won awards (see list below).

===Symposia and Conferences===
A primary function of the RSC is the organization of symposia and conferences on religious subjects, from which selected papers are later published.&lt;ref name=waterman/&gt; Anthologies from symposia on broad topics make up several volumes in the RSC Monograph Series.&lt;ref name=supporting&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Larry C. |year=1985 |title=Supporting Saints: Life Stories of Nineteenth-Century Mormons |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/out-print/supporting-saints-life-stories-nineteenth-century-mormons |pages=xi–xii |publisher=Religious Studies Center |location=Provo, Utah |chapter=Foreword |chapterurl=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/supporting-saints-life-stories-nineteenth-century-mormons/foreword-and-introduction |isbn=0-8849-4565-0 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moorty |first=S.

The RSC is also involved with the annual [[Sidney B. Sperry Symposium]],&lt;ref name=treasury/&gt; which have been held at BYU since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Sperry, Sidney B. | author=Rasmussen, Ellis T. | title=Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History | editor=[[Richard O. Cowan]] |editor2=[[Donald Q. Cannon]] |editor3=[[Arnold K. Garr]] | publisher=[[Deseret Book]] | location=Salt Lake City, Utah | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[general authorities]] deliver the keynote addresses at these symposia.&lt;ref name=treasury/&gt;

In 2003 the Religious Education Administrative Council approved a proposal by Richard Neitzel Holzapfel and Thomas A. Wayment to host a conference on the Saturday before Easter which would focus on Jesus's last twenty-four hours and Resurrection. The conference was held and rebroadcast on KBYU Television, helping Religious Education expand its audience. The response to this conference, now called the [http://rsc.byu.edu/easterconference BYU Easter Conference], was so positive that the university decided it should be an annual event, cosponsored by Religious Education and the RSC. Early on, nearly one thousand attendees heard Elder D. Todd Christofferson give the keynote address at the second annual conference, "The Atonement and the Resurrection," later published in the ''Religious Educator''. In subsequent years, the event was shifted to Fridays, often targeted to coincide with Good Friday. Over the years keynote addresses were delivered by President [[Cecil O.

===Periodicals===
In addition to books and articles, the RSC publishes its own periodicals.&lt;ref name="RE2003" /&gt; In 1986 the RSC began publishing the quarterly&lt;ref name="matthews87" /&gt; (later triannual) ''Religious Studies Center Newsletter'', which carried updates on RSC symposia, books, and research,&lt;ref name="waterman" /&gt; and was distributed to Church Educational System faculty and LDS military chaplains.&lt;ref name="matthews87" /&gt;  In 2008 the newsletter was replaced by ''BYU Religious Education Review'', a semiannual magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://catalog.lib.byu.edu/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=VG1FAxkplw/LEE/152540253/8/2016759/BYU+religious+education+review |title=BYU Religious Education Review |website=[[Harold B. Lee Library]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Dean Robert L. Millet and others created the ''Religious Educator'' journal to focus on "teaching the gospel, publishing studies on scripture, doctrine, and LDS Church history, and sharing the messages of outstanding devotional essays."&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Educator'' 1 (2000): i.&lt;/ref&gt; Millet replaced the temporary editorial board in 2001 with Richard Neitzel Holzapfel, who became the full-time editor in chief. Holzapfel asked Ted D. Stoddard, a professor in the Marriott School of Business, to explore design and content issues and prepare guidelines that would enhance the scholarly basis of this new publication. Holzapfel clarified the purpose of this new venture: "Our hope is to provide readers with carefully prepared, inspirational, and information-packed writings on a wide range of subjects explicitly associated with the Restoration. Teachers, authors, researchers, and students of Latter-day Saint studies at every level will appreciate discussions of relevant ideas and issues from a perspective of faith."&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Educator'' 3, no. 2 (2002): vi&lt;/ref&gt; The main audience consists of Church Educational System teachers, such as volunteers and paid professionals in [[LDS Seminaries]] and [[Institutes of Religion]] and religion professors at church colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Religious Educator: Perspectives on the Restored Gospel |journal=Religious Educator |date=Spring 2000 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=i |url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/RelEducator/id/376 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the RSC agreed to oversee and help fund the student journal ''Studia Antiqua''.

'''''Ronin Warriors''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Legendary Armor Samurai Troopers'''''|鎧伝サムライトルーパー|Yoroiden Samurai Torūpā}}, is a Japanese [[anime]] series and [[manga]] adaptation created by [[Hajime Yatate]]. The anime was produced and animated by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] and [[Nagoya Broadcasting Network|Nagoya TV]], and aired across Japan on the [[TV Asahi]] network from 30 April 1988 to 4 March 1989 and has a total of 39 episodes. The manga ran from November 17, 1988 to April 5, 1990 and consists of 2 volumes which were published by Kodansha.

''Ronin Warriors'' was produced by [[Graz Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Cinar]], and it was recorded by the [[Vancouver]]-based [[Ocean Productions]] cast. ''Ronin Warriors'' first aired on American television during the summer of 1995 and subsequently appeared through syndication, as well as the [[USA Network]] and later on [[Cartoon Network]]. The series was released on DVD in 2002, including the original Japanese version with English subtitles on the reverse side of the disc. On September 4, 2014, North American anime licensor [[Discotek Media]] announced their license of the original Japanese anime (''Yoroiden Samurai Troopers''), and plans to release the series on DVD.&lt;ref name="discotek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-09-05/discotek-adds-samurai-troopers-bokurano-comic-party-3rd-lupin-iii-tv-special/.78423|title=Discotek Adds Samurai Troopers, Bokurano, Comic Party, 3rd Lupin III TV Special|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2014-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discotek has said that they have no plans to release ''Ronin Warriors'' until they clear issues with the dub. Discotek has also licensed the OVAs and will include both Japanese and English audio as well as English subtitles.&lt;ref name="discotek"/&gt;

The opening and ending sequences and the [[eyecatch]]es were replaced with new ones, and the Japanese title cards were removed; there were no substantial cuts to the bodies of the episodes and the episodes retained most of the original music.

Three direct-to-video sequels were produced: ''Gaiden'' (''Side Story''), ''Kikoutei Densetsu'' (''The Legend of the Solar Armor'') and ''Message''. There is also a ''Ronin Warriors'' [[manga]] as well as numerous novels and audio dramas based on the anime. While all the sequels have been released on DVD, the manga and audio dramas have not been made available in English.

Shape was informed by the political activism of the 60s. [[Disability arts]] grew out of the [[disability rights movement]], and the wider struggle by disabled people for equality and the right to participate in all aspects of society.&lt;ref name="shapearts1"/&gt;

==Activities==
Their mission is to provide skills, opportunities and support for disabled artists, individuals and cultural organisations; and help build a more inclusive cultural sector. It does this through four delivery aims:

*More disabled people employed in the creative industries
*More disabled people as audiences
*Disabled artists creating high quality creative work
*Disabled people participating in the arts

==Notable artists==
*[[Yinka Shonibare]] is a disabled artist who worked as an arts development officer at Shape in the 90s. Shonibare acknowledges the role that Shape Arts played in his early career: "I worked for Shape three days a week, running workshops on singing, dancing or visual arts for disabled and older people in day centres and hospitals. The job meant I could afford to rent a studio and it gave me organisational and fundraising skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilitynow.org.uk/entertainment/arts/an-artist-with-a-lot-of-bottle |title=An artist with a lot of bottle — Disability Now |publisher=Disabilitynow.org.uk |date=2012-01-14 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Shonibare was announced as patron of the annual Shape 'Open' exhibition where disabled and non-disabled artists are invited to submit work in response to a disability focused theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shape Open exhibition Patron Announced|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/news/shape-open-exhibition-patron-announced.aspx|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yinka Shonibare MBE Announces Winner of Shape Open 2013 |url=https://www.shapearts.org.uk/Blog/yinka-shonibare-mbe-announces-winner-of-shape-open-2013 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sicko''''' (stylized as '''''SiCKO''''')  is a 2007 American [[documentary film]] made by filmmaker [[Michael Moore]]. The film investigates [[health care in the United States]], focusing on its [[health insurance]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]].  The movie compares the profiteering, non-universal U.S. system with the non-profit [[universal health care]] systems of [[Canadian and American health care systems compared|Canada]], the [[National Health Service|United Kingdom]], [[France#Public health|France]] and [[Healthcare in Cuba|Cuba]].

''Sicko'' was made on a budget of about $9 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/movies/20sick.html|title=Some Cities Will Get Early Look at ‘Sicko’|date=June 20, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grossed $25 million theatrically in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=sicko.htm Box Information for ''Sicko'' at boxofficemojo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This box office take exceeded the official expectation of [[The Weinstein Company]], which had hoped for a gross in line with ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'''s $22 million US box office gross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966667.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=TWC, Moore stand behind ‘Sicko’|author=Dade Hayes|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==


According to ''Sicko'', almost fifty million Americans are uninsured while the remainder, who are covered, are often victims of insurance company fraud and [[red tape]]. Furthermore, ''Sicko'' references the World Health Organization which lists the U.S. health in general as ranked 37 out of 191, with certain health measures, such as infant mortality and life expectancy, equal to countries with much less economic wealth.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization ranking of health systems&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews are conducted with people who thought they had adequate coverage but were denied care. Former employees of insurance companies describe cost-cutting initiatives that give bonuses to insurance company physicians and others to find reasons for the company to avoid meeting the cost of medically necessary treatments for policy holders, and thus increase company profitability.

In Canada, a citizen describes the case of [[Tommy Douglas]], who was voted the [[greatest Canadian]] in 2004 for his contributions to the [[Health care in Canada|Canadian health system]].  Moore also interviews a [[Microsurgery|microsurgeon]] and people waiting in the emergency room of a Canadian public hospital.

Against the backdrop of the history of the American health care debate, opponents of universal health care are set in the context of 1950s-style [[anti-communist]] propaganda.  A 1950s [[Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine|record]] distributed by the [[American Medical Association]], narrated by [[Ronald Reagan]], warns that universal health care could lead to lost freedoms and socialism. In response, Moore shows that socialized public services like police, fire service, the United States Postal Service, public education and community libraries have not led to communism in the United States.

The origins of the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]] are presented using a taped conversation between [[John Ehrlichman]] and President [[Richard Nixon]] on February 17, 1971; Ehrlichman is heard telling Nixon that "...the less care they give them, the more money they make," a plan that Nixon remarked "fine" and "not bad."  This led to the expansion of the modern [[health maintenance organization]]-based health care system.  Connections are highlighted between [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA), the lobbying arm of the largest drug companies in the United States, lobbying groups in Washington D.C., and the [[United States Congress|Congress]].  [[Hillary Clinton]], a champion of the [[Clinton health care plan]], is shown as a crusader for change, appointed to reform the health care system in the United States by her husband, newly elected President Bill Clinton. Her efforts are met with heavy-handed criticisms by Republicans on Capitol Hill, and right-wing media throughout the country, who characterize her plan as the harbinger of socialism. When she is defeated, her punishment is to "never speak of it again while in the White House." Seven years later, her silence is [[bribery|rewarded]], as she becomes a Senator via Healthcare Industry Contributions, the second largest recipient in the Senate.

In the United Kingdom, a country whose [[National Health Service]] is a comprehensive [[publicly funded health care]] system, Moore interviews patients and inquires about in-hospital expenses incurred by patients, only to be told that there are no out-of-pocket payments. Moore visits a typical UK pharmacy, where pharmaceuticals are free of charge for all persons in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and under 16, 16–17 in full-time education, disabled, unemployed, or over 60 in England, and subsidized in most cases for everyone else (in England); only a fixed amount of £6.65 (about $10) per item on a prescription was charged, irrespective of cost to the NHS. Further, NHS hospitals employ a cashier, part of whose job is to reimburse low-income patients for their out-of-pocket travel costs to the hospital.  Interviews include an NHS [[general practitioner]], an American woman residing in London, and British politician [[Tony Benn]], who concedes that a hypothetical dismantling of the NHS would lead to a revolution.

In France, Moore visits a hospital and interviews the head of [[obstetrics and gynaecology]] and a group of American [[expatriate]]s.  Moore rides with the "SOS Médecins", a 24-hour French medical service that provides house calls by physicians.&lt;ref name=jcohn&gt;{{cite news | last =Cohn| first =Jonathan| title =Shticko; It's no fun to agree with Michael Moore| work=[[The New Republic]]| date= July 20, 2007| url =http://www.tnr.com/print/article/shticko-its-no-fun-agree-michael-moore }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moore discovers that the French government provides many social services and rights in addition to health care, such as daycare for $1 an hour, free college education, a minimum five weeks paid vacation by law, vacation, and neonatal support that includes cooking, cleaning, and laundry services for new mothers.

Returning to the United States, interviews disclose that [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] rescue workers who volunteered [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11, 2001 attacks|after the September 11, 2001 attacks]] were denied government funds to care for [[Health effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks|physical and psychological maladies]] they subsequently developed, including respiratory disease and [[PTSD]]-induced [[bruxism]].  Unable to receive and afford medical care in the United States, the 9/11 rescue workers, as well as all of Moore's friends in the film needing medical attention, set sail from Miami to Cuba on three speedboats in order to obtain free medical care provided for the [[enemy combatant]]s detained at the U.S. [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]].  The group arrives at the entrance channel to "Gitmo" and Moore uses a megaphone to request access, pleading for the 9/11 victims to receive treatment that is on par with the medical attention the "evildoers" are receiving. The attempt ceases when a siren is blown from the base, and the group moves on to [[Havana]], where they purchase inexpensive medicine and receive free medical treatment at the elite [[Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital]].&lt;ref name="inthenews"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Providing only their names and birth dates, the volunteers are hospitalized and receive medical attention. Before they leave, the 9/11 rescue workers are honored by a local Havana fire station.

Finally, Moore addresses the audience, emphasizing that people should be "taking care of each other, no matter the differences."  To demonstrate his personal commitment to this theme, Moore decides to help one of his biggest critics, Jim Kenefick.  According to a blog posting, Kenefick feared he would have to shut down his anti-Moore website because he needed US $12,000 to cover the costs of medical treatment for his sick wife. Not wanting the U.S. health care system to trump Kenefick's ability to express his opinion, Moore sends Kenefick the money himself.

This film ends with Moore walking towards the [[United States Capitol]] with a basket full of his clothes, sarcastically saying he will get the government to do his laundry until a better day comes for the sick and hopeless who are unable to receive health care.

The European première was held in Great Britain on October 24, 2007, at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] as part of the 51st [[London Film Festival]].  Moore was to introduce the film, but remained in the United States due to a 'family issue', sending a lengthy letter to be read in his absence.  Part of the letter gave thanks to the Rt Hon. [[Tony Benn]], featured in the film, who delivered a short speech before the showing.

Roger Friedman of [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] called the film a "brilliant and uplifting new  film" and praised Moore for the way in which he lets "very articulate average Americans tell their personal horror stories at the hands of insurance companies" and "criticizes both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for their inaction and in some cases their willingness to be bribed by pharmaceutical companies and insurance carriers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Journalist [[John Stossel]]  wrote an article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that claimed Julie Pierce's husband, Tracy, featured in ''Sicko'', would not have been saved by the bone marrow transplant denied by his insurer. Stossel also questioned whether this treatment would have been given in a universal health care system, citing rationing and long waiting lists in Canada and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Sick Sob Stories  |work=Wall Street Journal| date = September 13, 2007|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118964470258225901?mod=googlenews_wsj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110082230/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118964470258225901.html|archivedate=January 10, 2009| first=John| last=Stossel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Pierce claimed Stossel never contacted her or her husband's doctors, and that the insurer denied other treatments as well and questioned Stossel's assertion that Tracy would not have received this in a socialized system, arguing that they are performed more frequently in Canada than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = An Open Letter to John Stossel|publisher= MichaelMoore.com|date= September 15, 2007|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/news/article.php?id=10226|accessdate= September 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011070420/http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/news/article.php?id=10226 |archivedate = October 11, 2007 |df= mdy-all

Moore insisted in the movie as well as in an interview with Stossel that the treatment provided in the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital was just like that given to any Cuban; but Stossel's investigations led Stossel to conclude that the hospital provided service only for the Cuban elite and that this care was not available to the average Cuban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Exclusiva/story?id=3568278&amp;page=1#.T4wPoydWpPk|title=Healthy in Cuba, Sick in America?

Loder points to a 2005 film, ''Dead Meat'', by [[Stuart Browning]] and Blaine Greenberg, which documents long waiting lists for care in Canada.  Loder points to calls for reform in Britain and France due to the same rationing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1563758/story.jhtml|title=Movie News - New Movies, Reviews, Casting - MTV - News|work=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wendell Potter====
[[Wendell Potter]] admitted that while he was working as Head of Corporate Communications at [[CIGNA]], the health insurance industry umbrella agency [[America's Health Insurance Plans]] had developed a campaign to discredit Michael Moore and the movie. When asked what he thought about the film Potter said that "I thought that he hit the nail on the head with his movie. But the industry, from the moment that the industry learned that Michael Moore was taking on the health care industry, it was really concerned&amp;nbsp;... They were afraid that people would believe Michael Moore."&lt;ref&gt;Belle, Nicole. (July 12, 2009) [http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/bill-moyers-journal-cigna-chief-admit "Bill Moyers Journal: CIGNA Chief Admits: Michael Moore's SICKO 'Hit The Nail On The Head'"]. [[Crooks and Liars]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Bill Moyers]] reported that PBS had obtained a copy of the "game plan" that was adopted by the industry's trade association, [[America's Health Insurance Plans]] which spelled out the industry strategies to "highlight horror stories of government-run systems". Potter explained, "The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are the worst thing that could possibly happen to them, that even if you consider that, you're heading down on the slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics for years and years and years, to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern."

Moyers reported and Potter confirmed that there were attempts to radicalize Moore in an effort to discredit the film’s message. Moore would be referred to as a "Hollywood entertainer" or "Hollywood moviemaker" to associate the film as being grounded in entertainment without any basis in objective reality. "They would want you to see this as just some fantasy that a Hollywood filmmaker had come up with. That's part of the strategy." Potter said that the strategy worked and the impact of the film was "blunted" by the [[public relations]] campaign. He agreed that ''Sicko'' contained "a great truth" which he said was "that we shouldn't fear government involvement in our health care system. That there is an appropriate role for government, and it's been proven in the countries that were in that movie.  You know, we have more people who are uninsured in this country than the entire population of Canada. And that if you include the people who are underinsured, more people than in the United Kingdom. We have huge numbers of people who are also just a lay-off away from joining the ranks of the uninsured, or being purged by their insurance company, and winding up there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people     = Moyers, Bill|date      = July 10, 2009|title      = ''Bill Moyers Journal'': Wendell Potter on Profits Before Patients|url        = https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/07102009/watch2.html

Kenefick accused Moore of presenting his words out of context in order to defame him, and both Kenefick and his onetime co-blogger, Lee, criticized Moore for claiming to make this donation anonymously, only to highlight it in his film.

===Treasury Department probe===
In a May 2, 2007 letter, the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] informed Moore that he was the subject of a civil investigation stemming from the filmmaker's March trip to Cuba. In the letter to Moore, a Treasury official noted that the department had no record of Moore obtaining a license that authorized him to "engage in travel-related transactions involving Cuba," alleging that Moore violated the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].&lt;ref name = "investigation"&gt;{{cite web| title =Uncle Sam Probes Michael Moore (Treasury Department investigating director's unauthorized Cuba trip)| work =thesmokinggun.com| url =http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0510071moore1.html| accessdate=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuba"&gt;{{cite web| title =Michael Moore In Trouble For Cuba Trip (Treasury Investigation; Moore Took Sept. 11 Workers To Banned Island For Treatment)| work =michaelmoore.com| url =http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikeinthenews/index.php?id=9778| accessdate =May 14, 2007| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070516183815/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikeinthenews/index.php?id=9778| archivedate =May 16, 2007| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A duplicate master copy of the film was being held in Canada should an attempt have been made by American authorities to seize the film as part of the investigation against Moore that arose from taking the American 9/11 rescue workers to Cuba for medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1119539820070611 | publisher=Reuters | title=Moore fears film seizure after Cuba trip |agency=Reuters | accessdate=July 11, 2007 | first=Michelle | last=Nichols | date=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore has said that trips made for conducting journalism are usually covered under a general license, which does not require preauthorization by the State Department. Moore states that his intentions were to travel to the [[Guantánamo Bay Naval Base|US Naval base in Guantánamo Bay]]. Upon Moore's arrival at [[Guantánamo Bay]], a siren was sounded and Moore decided to turn around for safety.

On ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Moore reported that he was notified that a [[subpoena]] regarding his trip to Cuba had already been issued. According to an anonymous source reported by Reuters, Moore has not been served; rather, the government contacted his attorney, [[David Boies]], to discuss the logistics of serving a subpoena.&lt;ref name=Reuters729&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSN2725763420070727 | publisher=Reuters | title=U.S. officials may subpoena filmmaker Moore |agency=Reuters | accessdate=July 29, 2007 | date=July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deleted scenes and extras==
The DVD release includes deleted segments that Moore filmed but did not use in the theatrical release.  Several scenes from the section about health care in the United Kingdom feature footage of a homeless shelter where people received acupuncture and foot massages. Discarded scenes in France include an interview with an employee from [[General Electric]], who tells Moore they get benefits in France that GE employees do not receive in the United States.&lt;ref name="metroactive.com"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes showing Moore's visit to [[Norway]] and depicting its healthcare system, social benefits, and rehabilitation-based prison system were removed from the film because the Norwegian healthcare system, which is supervised by the [[Norwegian Board of Health Supervision]], possesses numerous benefits similar to the French system. Like the French health care system, Norwegian patients treated for illnesses such as [[psoriasis]] or [[rheumatism]] are shown eligible for two weeks' paid vacation at a spa in the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway hires a government [[ethicist]] to determine how to invest the windfall from the country's oil wealth, because they want to do it in an ethical manner.&lt;ref name="metroactive.com"/&gt; A scene where Moore visits [[Bastøy Prison]], a Norwegian island prison, was also deleted. Here, inmates reside in small group homes and focus on rehabilitation through manual labor and farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|uGTzbj3fRSw|Michael Moore in Norway}}. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleted American health care scenes include an uninsured woman who was offered a 50% discount for treatment of spinal cancer. She still could not afford the initial consultations, so she held a [[fundraiser]] to pay for it. After the initial visit, the 50 percent discount was revoked when the hospital discovered that she had obtained the money to pay for her treatment through fundraising, which the hospital considered to be earned income.  An interview with [[Marcia Angell]] was also deleted.  The former editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' criticizes various practices of pharmaceutical companies and the [[Food and Drug Administration]].  Executive producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] asked Moore to remove a scene critical of Hillary Clinton, but Moore refused.  Weinstein, whose company provided financing for the film, is a friend of the Clinton family.&lt;ref name="WP_Akers"&gt;{{cite news

In the DVD edition of the film, Moore added a segment called "''Sicko'' Goes to Washington". This extra promotes the [[United States National Health Care Act]], legislation that would create a [[single-payer health care]] system within the United States.

The '''Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies''' ("SCJS"), founded in August 1990 by Rabbi Joshua Stampfer of [[Portland, Oregon]], and Dr. Stanley Hordes of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], is the major academic organization conducting and encouraging research on the [[Crypto-Jews]]{{ref|1}} of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] and their descendants today. This also involves significant attention being given to the [[Inquisition]] and to its ramifications for [[Sephardic Jews]] as well as for the general [[Jewish]] community. 

Membership in the SCJS is composed of scholars interested in crypto-Jews, descendants of crypto-Jews, and others interested in the topic from a historical, sociological, anthropological, religious, ethnic, literary, philosophical, or other perspective. The Society is nonreligious, and membership is open to all. Today, there is much interest, both academic and personal, in the history and contemporary status of crypto-Jews, and a number of distinguished scholars have published in the area. Especially in recent years, a number of people, especially, but not limited to, [[Hispanics]], have returned or converted to Judaism, frequently in part because of knowledge of a previously-suppressed Jewish heritage. [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], and [[California]] are major areas of interest, but significant interest also is found in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[Orlando, Florida]], [[New York City]], [[Portland, Oregon]], and other areas with large numbers of [[Hispanic]]s. This contemporary phenomenon of returning/converting also is of specific interest to some academic researchers.

The SCJS publishes ''HaLapid'': The Journal of the Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies, a combination newsletter and journal. Published four times per year, ''HaLapid'' (Hebrew for The Torch) mostly includes refereed academic research articles, personal stories by descendants of crypto-Jews, and news items, but also includes occasional poetry, links for related websites, and other items of interest. The SCJC also hosts a website, and helps answer questions and make referrals for interested persons.

The Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies meets annually for a three-day conference which includes a keynote speaker, sessions on recent research findings, personal stories of returnees, business sessions, and various forms of entertainment. At the 2003 annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, the keynote speaker was retired Rabbi Samuel Lerer who spent much of his 51-year career working with anusim in Mexico. The SCJS has taken a lead in interest in [[DNA]] studies, especially as it applies to crypto-Jews, other Sephardim, and the Jewish community in general.

* {{note|1}} The well-known Judaica author [[Cecil Roth]] popularized the term [[marranos]] in his 1932 book ''A History of the Marranos'', but, because of the negative meaning attached to the word marrano by supporters of the Inquisition, today the term preferred by descendants and scholars is Crypto-Jews (i.e., Secret Jews), or [[anusim]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for forced ones)

A '''stamp catalog''' (or '''stamp catalogue''') is a catalog of [[postage stamp]] types with descriptions and prices.

The stamp catalog is an essential tool of [[philately]] and [[stamp collecting]]. Stamp catalogs are part of [[philatelic literature]].

== History ==
The first stamp catalog was published in France by [[Oscar Berger-Levrault]] on 17 September 1861 and the first illustrated catalog by [[Alfred Potiquet]] in December 1861 (based on the earlier work).

The first catalogs in Great Britain were published in 1862 by [[Frederick Booty]],&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;Phillips, Stanley. ''Stamp Collecting: A guide to modern philately'', revised edition, Stanley Gibbons, London, 1983, p.243. {{ISBN|0-85259-047-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Brown (philatelist)|Mount Brown]],&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt; and Dr. [[John Edward Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5YDAAAAQAAJ&amp;ots=fXq6jrKBT0&amp;dq=A%20hand%20catalogue%20of%20postage%20stamps&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  John Edward Gray, ''A hand catalogue of postage stamps for the use of collectors,'' London, Robert Hardwicke, 1862]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Early Postage Stamp Catalogs" by George B. Sloane in ''Stamps'', 13 July 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the United States was ''The Stamp Collector's Manual'' by A.C. Kline (a pseudonym for John William Kline), also 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Trenchard and George T. Turner, "John William Kline America's First Philatelic Author", in ''Philatelic Literature Review'', Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 24-41, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally catalogs were just [[Stamp dealer|dealer]]s' price lists, though today that is less common.  The catalogs of some major publishers continue to serve as an official price list for the publisher.  For example, Stanley Gibbons in the United Kingdom specifically states in the catalog that the price listed is the estimated selling price by Stanley Gibbons Ltd.  On the other had, Scott in the United States does not sell stamps.  Rather, the Scott catalog serves as a reference document for expected prices used by buyers and sellers.  Over time, as [[philately]] developed, catalogs tended to accumulate additional supporting details about the stamps, such as dates of issue, color variations, and so forth. As their use by collectors became widespread, the catalogs came to define what was and was not a legitimate stamp, since many collectors would avoid stamps not described in the catalog. In recent years, the [[Internet]] has become a common resource for information about stamps. Some catalogs have an on-line version while others are available only on-line.

== Current catalogs ==
The following catalogs have a worldwide coverage:
*[[Michel catalog|Michel]] - printed, software and online
*[[Scott catalog|Scott]] - printed, pdf-format and online
*[[Stanley Gibbons#Stamp catalogues|Stanley Gibbons]] - printed and online
*[[Yvert et Tellier]] - printed only

These are large undertakings, since there are thousands of new stamps to describe each year, and the prices of all stamps may go up or down. For publishers that are not dealers, the prices are estimated by data from dealers and auctions.

In addition, the catalog publishers usually put out specialized volumes with additional details, generally by nationality: Michel has a specialized German catalog, Scott a specialized US catalog, and so forth.

Many countries have their own "national catalogs", typically put out by a leading publisher or dealer in that country. Postal administrations may themselves put out catalogs, although they tend to be aimed at less-experienced collectors, and rarely provide fully detailed stamp data. Some notable country catalogs include:

'''''The Artist's Despair Before the Grandeur of Ancient Ruins''''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Der Künstler verzweifelnd vor der Grösse der antiken Trümmer'') is a [[drawing]] in red [[chalk]] with brown [[Wash (painting)|wash]] executed between 1778-1780 by [[Johann Heinrich Füssli]]. It depicts an artist's response to [[ruins]], namely those of the [[Colossus of Constantine]] at the [[Capitoline Museums]] in [[Rome]]. The work was acquired by the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="Zurich"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kunsthaus.ch/en/the-collection/prints-and-drawings/johann-heinrich-fuseli/?redirect_url=title%3DRГ©gleme |title=Johann Heinrich Fuseli |publisher=[[Kunsthaus Zürich]] |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's despair may be caused by "the impossibility of emulating the greatness of the past", by the knowledge that all things must decay, or by a sense of unfulfilled longing and dislocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VEEot7jUvS8C&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Writing Rome: Textual Approaches to the City |author=Edwards, Catharine |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-55952-2 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distortions of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and the "plunge into the abyss" along the right edge conjure up a sense of [[nightmare]].&lt;ref name="Zurich"/&gt; [[SPQR]] may be read in the [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the base of the foot, while vegetation sprouts up near the hand; the artist, in a "fit of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]", is dwarfed by the fragments of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Built, the Unbuilt and the Unbuildable: In Pursuit of Architectural Meaning |author=Harbison, Robert |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=1991 |isbn=0-262-08204-7 |pages=108f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dean Martin Show''''', not to be confused with the ''Dean Martin Variety Show'' (1959–1960), is a TV [[Variety show|variety]]-[[Television comedy|comedy series]] that ran from 1965 to 1974 for 264 episodes. It was broadcast by [[NBC]] and hosted by entertainer [[Dean Martin]]. The theme song to the series was his 1964 hit "[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]".

The series was a staple for NBC, airing Thursdays at 10:00 for 8 years, until its move to Fridays at 10:00 for the final season and change in format.

''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'', a series of specials spun off from the final season, generated solid ratings for 10 years on NBC.

==Development==
Martin was initially reluctant to do the show, partially because he did not want to turn down movie and nightclub performances. His terms were deliberately outrageous: he demanded a high salary and that he need only show up for the actual taping of the show. To his surprise the network agreed. As daughter Deana Martin recalled after meeting the network and making his demands Martin returned home and announced to his family, "They went for it. So now I have to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-classic-hollywood-20110523,0,6902137.story Classic Hollywood: Dean Martin does TV his way] [[Los Angeles Times]] May 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; (The terms of employment, and not having to appear for rehearsals, allowed Martin to appear in a series of [[Matt Helm]] films concurrent with the show's run, as well as other projects such as a co-starring role in the first ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' film in 1970.)

Martin believed that an important key to his popularity was that he did not put on airs. His act was that of a drunken, work-shy playboy, although the ever-present [[old-fashioned glass]] in his hand often only had [[apple juice]] in it. The show was heavy on physical comedy rather than just quips (he made his weekly entrance by sliding down a fireman's pole onto the stage.) Martin read his dialogue directly from cue cards. If he flubbed a line or forgot a lyric, Martin would not do a retake, and the mistake—and his recovery from it—went straight to tape and onto the air.

''The Dean Martin Show'' was shot on color videotape beginning in 1965 at Studio 4 inside [[The Burbank Studios|NBC's massive color complex]] at 3000 West Alameda Avenue in [[Burbank, California]]. The same studio was used for [[Frank Sinatra]]'s yearly TV specials in the late 1960s, and [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis Presley's 1968 "Comeback Special"]]. Studio 4 is currently one of two used in the production of the [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''.

==Regular segments==
*Martin sang two solo numbers per show, one a serious ballad. He would join his weekly guests in song medleys, trading lyrics back and forth. Some of these duets were deliberately played for laughs—Dean and [[Liberace]], for example—with special lyrics by Lee Hale to suit the performers.
*One recurring segment was based on Martin's club act, in which he would begin to sing a popular song and suddenly insert a gag punchline. Martin often tried to make his pianist, [[Ken Lane]], laugh hard enough to break his concentration. The segment usually began with Martin leaping onto Lane's piano; in one episode the real piano was secretly replaced with a phony one. When Martin did his leap the entire faux-piano collapsed under his weight, all to the surprise and delight of the studio audience.
*A knock on the "closet" door occurred each week, with Martin opening the door to reveal an unannounced celebrity guest. Most of the time, Martin did not know who the guest would be, to keep his reactions more spontaneous, according to Hale's book ''Backstage at the Dean Martin Show''.
*A regular gag during one season was the "Mystery Voice Contest", wherein Dean invited viewers to write in to guess who was singing a particular song. Invariably, it was the famous Frank Sinatra hit "[[Strangers in the Night]]". Finally on one episode, Sinatra himself showed up to announce that he was the mystery singer. Martin dutifully handed over the prize—a trip to Los Angeles, the city where the two of them already lived.
*The finale was typically a production number featuring Dean and the guest stars. Occasionally it would be a musical sketch with Martin appearing as "Dino Vino", a disc jockey who played old records. A vintage record would then be heard, with Dean and his cronies mouthing the words and pantomiming outrageously for comic effect.
*One of the most highly rated of Martin's programs was a Christmas episode featuring only his and [[Frank Sinatra]]'s family members: Martin's wife Jeanne with children Craig, Claudia, Gail, Deana, Dean Paul, Ricci and Gina along with Sinatra's three children, Tina, Nancy and Frank Jr.
*During the show's 8th season, the finale was a selection of songs from a popular [[MGM]] film musical. Clips from the film in question would be shown, with Martin and guests singing a medley from the films. Among those saluted were ''[[Easter Parade (1948 film)|Easter Parade]]'', ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'', ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'', and the [[1951 in film|1951]] film version of ''[[Show Boat]]''.
*When the show was cancelled in 1974, a series of ''[[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]s'' were produced in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] at the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino|MGM Grand Hotel]]. This tradition was started during the final season of the variety show, and continued until 1984.

==Regulars and recurring guests==
In later seasons, many regular performers were added, such as [[Dom DeLuise]] and [[Nipsey Russell]] in sketches set in a barber shop; [[Kay Medford]] and [[Lou Jacobi]] in sketches set in a diner, and Medford also pretending to be the mother of Martin's pianist, Ken Lane. [[Leonard Barr]], [[Guy Marks]], [[Tom Bosley]], [[Marian Mercer]], [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], and [[Rodney Dangerfield]] were also featured on multiple occasions, while bandleader [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]] was a regular.

During the inaugural 1965–1966 season, [[Sid and Marty Krofft|The Krofft Puppets]] were seen regularly. Their stint, however, only lasted 8 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Erickson, "E! True Hollywood Story:" The Weird World of Sid &amp; Marty Krofft&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] recall in an interview that they were fired because of an incident involving Liberace, for whom they've previously worked, and who was a great fan of their puppets. Sid states: "And he [Liberace] asked his fan club to write Dean Martin a letter and tell Dean Martin that there isn't enough puppetry on the show."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=TVLEGENDS|title=Sid and Marty Krofft on "The Dean Martin Show" - EMMYTVLEGENDS.ORG|date=2013-02-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLrEXvLV3_Y|accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the letters were nasty and came in great amounts: "And so, can you imagine getting over 250 thousand letters like that in a matter of a couple of weeks, and well, he really didn't like that and fired us."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Summer replacement series==
For Martin's Thursday night time slot, the network and Martin's production crew created original summer programming (without Martin) to hold his usual weekly audience. [[Rowan and Martin]] hosted the first. Dean Martin's 1966 summer series proved so successful that two seasons later it spawned one of television's most memorable series, ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''.

From July to September 1967, the summer show was co-hosted by Martin's daughter Gail Martin, [[Vic Damone]] and [[Carol Lawrence]].

In 1968, Martin's staff came up with a new format: a salute to the 1930s, with a variety show performed as if television existed at that time. Producer [[Greg Garrison]] recruited a dozen chorus girls, naming the group "[[The Golddiggers]]" after the [[Warner Brothers]] musicals of the 1930s. The series, ''Dean Martin Presents the Golddiggers'', starred [[Frank Sinatra, Jr.]] and [[Joey Heatherton]] as musical hosts, with comedy routines by [[Paul Lynde]], [[Stanley Myron Handelman]], Barbara Heller, comic impressionists Bill Skiles and Pete Henderson, and neo-vaudeville musicians [[The Times Square Two]].

The summer show was a hit, returning the following year with a new cast. [[Lou Rawls]] and Gail Martin took over as hosts and six-foot-six dancer [[Tommy Tune]] was featured.

The Golddiggers also toured the nation's nightclubs as a live attraction. Some of the members grew tired of traveling and dropped out, to be replaced by other hopefuls. After the summer series ran its course, the Golddiggers were seen on Martin's own program, and four of them were used in another group, the Ding-a-Ling Sisters.

Toward the end of the Thursday-night run, the summer series was devoted to European comedians. [[Marty Feldman]] was featured in ''Dean Martin's Comedy World'', hosted by [[Jackie Cooper]].

==Home media==
From 2003 until August 2007, a 29-volume ''Best of The Dean Martin Variety Show'' collection was sold by direct marketing firm [[Guthy-Renker]] via [[infomercial]]s and a website.

In mid-2007, [[NBC Universal]] filed suit in [[U.S. District Court]] against several parties, including Guthy-Renker, claiming copyright infringement, forcing G-R to temporarily withdraw the DVDs from sale.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The lawsuit was in regard to a dispute over rights to footage used in the DVD series, material to which NBC claimed it still held the copyright.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The conflict was discovered when NBC Universal looked into plans to release its own DVD set.

Also named as one of the defendants in the lawsuit was longtime ''Dean Martin Show'' producer Greg Garrison, who, NBC claims, had rights to use only excerpts from selected episodes of ''The Dean Martin Show''{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} for the DVDs—episodes which, according to NBC, Garrison purchased years earlier from the network for a syndicated run of ''The Dean Martin Show'' that aired worldwide from 1979 to 1981. Garrison died in 2005, before the lawsuit was brought forward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dean-Martin-Subscription-DVDs-Halted-Per-NBC-Lawsuit/8087 TV Shows on DVD.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206020953/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dean-Martin-Subscription-DVDs-Halted-Per-NBC-Lawsuit/8087 |date=2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A settlement among all of the parties to the suit was reached on January 2, 2008. As a consequence, the Guthy-Renker website once again began selling the collection, and infomercials advertising it returned to the small screen.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

There remain two other lawsuits pending over rights to material used in the ''Best of Dean Martin Variety Show'' series, but neither of those suits affected sales of the home video collection.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Unaffected by legal disputes were ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' specials, which continue to be marketed on DVD by Guthy-Renker. Total revenues from Dean Martin DVD sales have been rumored to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The Martin shows have not been on television since their original telecasts.

On February 3, 2011, it was revealed that a brand new package of DVDs featuring footage from ''The Dean Martin Show'' would be released on May 24, 2011 by Time-Life Video. Unlike the earlier Guthy-Renker collection, which was marketed via mail order subscription, these new sets would be aimed largely at the retail sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dean-Martin-DVDs-Announced/14986 Dean Martin Show DVDs Announced] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207050301/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dean-Martin-DVDs-Announced/14986 |date=2011-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2011, NBC Universal TV Consumer Products Group issued a press release disclosing its participation with Time-Life on the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/distribution/nutvconsprod/pressreleases?pr=contents/press-releases/2011/03/21/thebestofthedea1300743481250.xml NBCU Press Release re New Dean Martin Show DVDs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612050020/http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/distribution/nutvconsprod/pressreleases?pr=contents%2Fpress-releases%2F2011%2F03%2F21%2Fthebestofthedea1300743481250.xml |date=2012-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an online report posted July 9, 2011, Deana Martin, one of Dean's daughters, reported to columnists Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith that the first sets of ''Dean Martin Show'' DVDs released by Time-Life in the late spring had sold so well that a second collection was already being planned, and that she (Deana) would be contributing commentary to it.&lt;ref name="Beck/Smith Hollywood"&gt;[http://becksmithhollywood.com/?tag=deana-martin Beck/Smith Hollywood]&lt;/ref&gt; This information has been independently confirmed by officials at both Time-Life and NBC Universal.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

By the end of the summer of 2011, release dates were disclosed for the second wave of ''Dean Martin Show'' DVDs produced by Time-Life and featuring footage supplied by the series' originating network, NBC. Entitled ''King of Cool: The Best of The Dean Martin Variety Show'', the new collection would be made available in 1- and 6-disc configurations.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

'''''The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors, and Architects''''' or '''''Le vite de' pittori, scultori et architetti moderni''''' is a series of artist biographies written by [[Gian Pietro Bellori]] (1613–96), whom [[Julius von Schlosser]] called "the most important historiographer of art not only of Rome, but all Italy, even of Europe, in the seventeenth century".&lt;ref name=Schlosser&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Schlosser|first1=Julius Ritter|title=Die Kunstliteratur: Ein Handbuch zur Quellenkunde der neueren Kunstgeschichte.|date=1924|publisher=Kunstverlag Anton Schroll &amp; Co.|location=Vienna|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Die_Kunstliteratur.html?id=RaQwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the foundational texts of the history and criticism of European art.&lt;ref name=Cropper/&gt;

The first edition (1672) contained biographies of nine painters ([[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Carracci]], [[Barocci]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Rubens]], [[Van Dyck]], [[Domenichino]], [[Lanfranco]], and [[Poussin]]), two sculptors ([[François Duquesnoy]] and [[Alessandro Algardi]]), and one architect ([[Domenico Fontana]]). The book was dedicated to [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and published with French financial support.&lt;ref name=Zirpolo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zirpolo|first1=Lilian|title=The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition by Giovan Pietro Bellori; Alice Sedgwick Wohl Review by: Lilian H.

==Preface==
The preface to the ''Lives'' is an essay Bellori delivered to the [[Accademia di San Luca]], [[Rome]] in 1664. The essay, entitled ''The Idea of the Painter, the Sculptor and the Architect'' (''L'idea del pittore, dello scultore, e dell'architetto'') contributed to a classicist reading of the ''Lives'', as opposed the a book about near-contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Cropper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cropper|first1=Elizabeth|title=Giovan Pietro Bellori, the Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition by Alice Sedgwick Wohl|journal=The Burlington Magazine|date=December 2006|volume=148|issue=1245|page=854|jstor=20074653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[archaeology]], a '''tool stone''' is a type of stone that is used to manufacture [[stone tool]]s,&lt;ref name=Lithics&gt;
{{cite book | first=William | last=Andrefsky Jr. | title=Lithics: Macroscopic Approaches to Analysis | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2005 |edition=Second | isbn=0-521-61500-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or stones used as the raw material for tools.&lt;ref name=Folsom&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, tools that require a sharp edge are made using [[cryptocrystal]]line materials that fracture in an easily controlled [[Conchoidal fracture|conchoidal]] manner.&lt;ref name=Lithics/&gt;
Cryptocrystalline tool stones include [[flint]] and [[chert]], which are fine-grained [[sedimentary]] materials; [[rhyolite]] and [[felsite]], which are [[igneous]] [[flowstone]]s; and [[obsidian]], a form of natural glass created by igneous processes. These materials fracture in a predictable fashion, and are easily resharpened. For more information on this subject, see [[lithic reduction]].

Large-grained materials, such as [[basalt]], [[granite]], and [[sandstone]], may also be used as tool stones, but for a very different purpose: they are ideal for [[ground stone]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Whereas cryptocrystalline materials are most useful for killing and processing animals, large-grained materials are usually used for processing plant matter. Their rough faces often make excellent surfaces for grinding plant seeds. With much effort, some large-grained stones may be ground down into [[stitching awl|awls]], [[adzes]], and [[axe]]s.

The '''Transcontinental Traverse''' (TCT) was a [[geodetic survey]] [[Traverse (surveying)|traverse]] conducted in the [[Continental United States]] by the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] between 1961 and 1976. It was the most accurate large-area survey ever done prior to [[Global Positioning System]] surveys. TCT included over 2,700 survey stations, covered over 13,600 miles, and passed through 44 states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/magazine/tct/welcome.html#trans The High-precision Transcontinental Traverse: Improving the Scale of the U.S. Survey Network], NOAA (page "the traverse") &lt;/ref&gt;  

This nationwide survey increased the accuracy of the existing U.S. survey network. It was also fundamental to the sophisticated mathematical readjustment of the nation's survey network known as the [[North American Datum of 1983]].&lt;ref name=NOAA-PD&gt;{{citation|title=The High-precision Transcontinental Traverse: Improving the Scale of the U.S. Survey Network|work=NOAA Celebrates 200 years|type=website|publisher=U.S. [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]]|url=https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/magazine/tct/welcome.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the "end of an era" as the last conventional, purely terrestrial large scale survey.{{sfn|Wilford2001|p=366}}

==Forerunner surveys==
The first major transcontinental survey was the Transcontinental Arc of Triangulation, completed in 1896 along the [[39th parallel north]] with coastal endpoints at [[Cape May, New Jersey]], and [[Point Arena, California]] lighthouses. It established the [[Meades Ranch]] survey marker, also called the Geodetic Center of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Meades Ranch|author=Jerry Penry|date=June 4, 2015|work=The American Surveyor|publisher=Cheves Media|url=http://www.amerisurv.com/content/view/13900/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/web/about_ngs/history/milestones.shtml Milestones of the Survey], National Geodetic Survey, June 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transcontinental Traverse, commonly known as the "TCT", grew out of smaller surveying projects that the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (C&amp;GS) conducted for the U.S. Air Force missile-tracking program in an area near Cape Canaveral, Florida, during the 1960s.  C&amp;GS developed unique specifications for this work that resulted in one part in 1,000,000, exceeding Air Force requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/magazine/tct/welcome.html#capec Cape Canaveral Triangulation Survey Yields High-Precision Results], NOAA&lt;/ref&gt; This led C&amp;GS officials to conclude that applying the same specifications to a nationwide traverse, a surveying method, would dramatically improve the scale of the entire U.S. survey network. Soon after completing its work for the Air Force in Florida in 1961, C&amp;GS embarked on the TCT.&lt;ref name=NOAA-PD/&gt;

==Route and history==
The Geodimeter electronic distance measurement device was rapidly tested and adopted by national agencies for long-distance mapping. The last base line to be measured with tape happened near [[Salmon, Idaho]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=Dracup/&gt;

The survey began in 1961 in Florida and ended in 1976 in Michigan. It crisscrossed North America along three east-west and five north-south corridors. A portion that had been planned to traverse the US-Canada border to Maine was canceled due to advances in [[satellite geodesy]].&lt;ref name=Dracup&gt;{{citation|title=GEODETIC SURVEYING 1940 - 1990|author=Joseph F. Dracup|via=NOAA|url=https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/geodetic_surveying_1940.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment and methods==
[[File:Bilby towers on Transcontinental Traverse.png|thumb|Two complete Bilby towers on Transcontinental Traverse]]
The traverse made use of the geodimeter, a lightwave phase [[electronic distance measurement]] instrument that had just been invented when the traverse began.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|title=EDM (Geodimeter Model 2A)|work=Database: Physical Sciences Collection - Surveying and Geodesy|id=catalog number 1998.3094.01|url=https://amhistory.si.edu/surveying/object.cfm?recordnumber=748815|accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/magazine/tct/welcome.html#improv The High-precision Transcontinental Traverse: Improving the Scale of the U.S. Survey Network], NOAA (page "improving distance measurement")&lt;/ref&gt; The instruments were located atop [[Bilby tower]]s many meters above ground level to avoid obscuring objects and to get a smoother air temperature profile for accuracy. Due to the light source then in use, the geodimeter could only be operated at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Government of Australia|work=[[Pandora Archive]]|title=NATMAP's INTRODUCTION OF ELECTRONIC DISTANCE MEASURING TO AUSTRALIA - SIXTY YEARS ON|author=Paul Wise|year=2014|url=http://www.xnatmap.org/adnm/docs/2013/aganasm/nasm.html|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/166632/20180227-0206/www.xnatmap.org/adnm/docs/2013/aganasm/nasm.html|archivedate=2018-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12078">There have been many voting systems used at '''[[Melodifestivalen]]''' over the course of its history. The Swedish broadcasters have experimented with various techniques over the years including splitting the juries by age, regional voting and an "expert" jury. [[Televoting]] was controversially first introduced in [[Melodifestivalen 1993|1993]], as an unannounced experiment. The Swedish telephone network promptly collapsed under the strain of phone calls being made.&lt;ref name=collapse&gt;ESCtoday.com [http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7428 Melodifestivalen 1990-2000]. Retrieved on 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Televoting was permanently reintroduced in 1999, but the regional jury system was retained, and given a 50% weighting in the overall results. In 2011 the regional juries were abolished and their task was given to juries from other countries that participate in the year's [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. 2015 saw the introduction of a mobile app that allowed the public to vote for their favourite entries for free, but only when the songs were being performed. Although used in all semi-finals and the Second Chance round, the app votes were not used in the final due to the system becoming overloaded and ceasing to function about half an hour into the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/om-appen/om-appen|title=Allt om vår nya app|work=svt.se|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/utredning-visar-darfor-strulade-appen|title=Utredning visar - därför strulade appen|work=svt.se|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current voting system has been controversial, as it is possible for the song which receives the most votes from the public not to win, as happened in [[Melodifestivalen 2005|2005]], [[Melodifestivalen 2008|2008]], [[Melodifestivalen 2013|2013]] and [[Melodifestivalen 2017|2017]].

The current televoting/appvoting record is 12,634,477 votes in the [[Melodifestivalen 2016]] final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/alla-rostningssiffror-sa-tog-frans-jeppsson-wall-och-if-i-were-sorry-over-melodifestivalen-2016|title=Se alla röstningssiffror: Så tog Frans över i Melodifestivalen 2016|access-date=2016-03-16|work=svt.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of voting systems used==

{| class="wikitable"

! Year(s) !! Voting system
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|'''1959–1961'''
|width="60%"|Four expert juries in [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Malmö]] and [[Luleå]].
|-valign="top"
|'''1962'''
|Postcard voting.
|-valign="top"
|'''1963'''
|As 1959–1961.
|-valign="top"
|'''1965–1969'''
|Regional juries in each of [[Sveriges Radio]]'s regions. One point per jury member.
|-valign="top"
|'''1971'''
|Postcard voting in the three semifinals. Regional juries in each of Sveriges Radio's regions decided the final.
|-valign="top"
|'''1972–1973'''
|As 1965–1969.
|-valign="top"
|'''1974–1975'''
|Eleven regional juries, each with fifteen people. Each jury member awarded 3, 2 and 1 point(s) to their three favourite songs. This led to [[ABBA]] winning with 302 points, the largest total ever (impossible under the current system.) In [[Melodifestivalen 1975|1975]] the number of jury members was reduced from fifteen to ten, and they were allowed to award five points in any manner they wished.
|-valign="top"
|'''1977–1980'''
|Regional juries. The [[positional voting system]] used in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] at the time was used. Each jury awarded one to eight points, ten and finally twelve.
|-valign="top"
|'''1981–1988'''
|Regional juries. Juries each awarded 1, 2, 4, 6 and eight points to the five songs. In [[Melodifestivalen 1982|1982]] the number of contestants was increased to ten once again and a first round vote was used to reduce that number to five for the "super final". From [[Melodifestivalen 1984|1984]] to [[Melodifestivalen 1987|1987]] the juries were sorted by age, not region, but the voting system remained the same. Regional juries returned in [[Melodifestivalen 1988|1988]].
|-valign="top"
|'''1989–1990'''
|As 1977–1980.
|-valign="top"
|'''1991–1992'''
|As 1981–1988 with regional juries.
|-valign="top"
|'''1993'''
|A regional televote in which the regions' points were given in the same manner as the previous two competitions: 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8.
|-valign="top"
|'''1994–1996'''
|As 1981–1988 with regional juries.
|-valign="top"
|'''1997'''
|Regional juries. Juries awarded 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 points to their top seven songs.
|-valign="top"
|'''1998'''
|As 1981–1988 with regional juries.
|-valign="top"
|'''1999–2008'''
|Juries voted as 1997. Televoting points are given by multiplying the juries' points allocations (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) by the total number of juries - so with eleven juries, 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 - to give a 50:50 jury-public points split
|-valign="top"
|'''2009'''
|As 1999–2008 but with the addition of a twelfth 'international' jury, and with televoting points factored up accordingly.
|-valign="top"
|'''2010'''
|As 1999–2008 with eleven juries, but only five from Swedish regions; the other six from other individual European countries.
|-valign="top"
|'''2011–2017'''
|Eleven international juries give points as above; televoting now gives respective shares of 473 points (the total of all the juries) based on percentage of total vote, e.g. a song that gets 10% of the televoting would receive 48 points (47.3). In 2018, the format was changed slightly so that more points would be on offer, with 7's, 5's and 3's also included to mirror the voting system of Eurovision proper, and ensure a total of 638 televoting points on offer.
|-valign="top"
|'''2018-present'''
|As 2011-2017, but with the addition of 7's, 5's and 3's in the juries voting, to mirror the voting system of Eurovision proper. This creates a total of 638 televoting points on offer.

==Records==

In the event of a tie, the song that received more votes from the public receives the higher position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/gavleborg/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=575492 Nordman undvek sistaplatsen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181519/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/gavleborg/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=575492 |date=2007-09-30 }} {{sv icon}}. SR.se (13 March 2005). Retrieved on 28 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The closest victories are [[Tommy Körberg]]'s in 1969 and Björn Skifs' in 1978. In 1969, Körberg tied for first place with [[Jan Malmsjö]] before winning after the jury voted for their favourite out of the two. In 1978, Björn Skifs tied for first place with Lasse Holm, Kikki Danielsson and Wizex; but won after each jury was called to vote for their favourite out of the tied songs. Unlike in 1969, each jury ''group'' (rather than individual jury members) counted for one point in the tie-break.

Since the current voting system was introduced, results have been more clear-cut. The televoters and juries agreed on the winner in seven out of nine finals between 1999 and 2007. The closest victory since 1999 is Sanna Nielsen's two-point win in 2014. The biggest victory by straight-points in the history of the event is ABBA's win in 1974 with 302 points. Under the current voting system the record is 288 points, achieved by [[Måns Zelmerlöw]] in 2015 with the song "[[Heroes (Måns Zelmerlöw song)|Heroes]]". The entry also broke the record for the biggest difference between the winning and second placed song, with 149 points between it and [[Jon Henrik Fjällgren]]'s "[[Jag är fri (Manne leam frijje)]]". "Heroes" also garnered the largest amount of both jury and viewer points received by an entry since 1999, gathering 122 points and 166 points, respectively. Two songs have scored top marks from each voting region: Carola Häggkvist in 1983 with "Främling", and Arvingarna in 1993 with "Eloise". However, in 1993, experimental televoting was used and the two are not entirely comparable. The biggest victory in terms of points as a percentage of the total possible score is also held by Carola and "Främling", which defeated Kikki Danielsson's "[[Varför är kärleken röd? (song)|Varför är kärleken röd?]]" by 43 points, 48% of the total potential mark.

==Jury regions==
[[Image:Melodifestivalen juries labelled.png|right|thumb|SVT has eleven news districts,  each of which was represented by a jury in the final of Melodifestivalen from 1974-2009.]]

Until 2010 each jury represented one of SVT news districts. In 2010 six juries were replaced by international juries from different European countries, with the remaining juries coming from Luleå, Umeå, Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholm. In 2011 the Swedish were all replaced by international juries. In 2013 and 2014, all Big 5 countries cast their votes.
