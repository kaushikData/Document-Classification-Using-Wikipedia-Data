'''A. Uberti, Srl.''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] manufacturer of high quality replicas of 19th century [[United States|American]] [[Percussion cap|percussion]] [[revolvers]], [[carbines]], and [[rifles]] as well as [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] [[revolvers]], [[single-shot rifle]]s, and [[lever-action rifles]]. These replicas are commonly used by [[historical re-enactors]], participants in [[action shooting]] sports such as [[cowboy action shooting]], working ranchers and target shooters who prefer traditional-style firearms. Thanks to their quality, Uberti replicas are also sought after by collectors and historical firearm enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Taffin2005"&gt;{{cite book |last = Taffin |first = John |authorlink = John Taffin |title = The Gun Digest Book of Cowboy Action Shooting: Guns Gear Tactics |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=64y8aMc9tt8C&amp;pg=PA221 |edition = Kevin Michalowski |date = 24 April 2005 |publisher = Gun Digest Books |location = Iola, Wisconsin |isbn = 0-89689-140-2 |pages = 226–228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uberti is located in [[Gardone V.T.]], a suburb of [[Brescia, Italy]], that has for centuries been the home to other firearm manufacturers and similar craft businesses. Independent for many years, Uberti was purchased and made into a subsidiary of [[Beretta]] Firearms and subsequently acquired by [[Benelli (firearms)|Benelli]],{{when|date=December 2016}} also a member of the Beretta Holding Company.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"&gt;{{cite book |last = Lee |first = Jerry |title = Gun Digest 2014 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OoBq0qlNwcwC&amp;pg=PA523 |date = 12 August 2013 |publisher = Krause Publications |location = Iola, Wisconsin |isbn = 978-1-4402-3542-9 |page = 523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and history ==
Aldo Uberti (d. 1998) founded his company in the foothills of the Italian Alps in 1959 to recreate long-obsolete but iconic firearms from the days of the American West and the U.S. Civil War. The factory was (and still is) in [[Gardone]] in the province of [[Brescia]], an area renowned for arms and armor manufacturing since the late Middle Ages. In particular, a manufacturing tradition of that area (dating back to the Renaissance) has been that of replicating foreign-style armor, most notably armor in the German style to be exported to and used in Germanic countries. This was done in part to help establish the area as an important arms-manufacturing center, which it remains today, and in part to showcase the ability of local artisans and metalsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Phyrr, ''Heroic Armor of the Italian Renaissance'', 321, 322&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldo Uberti had attended the Zanardelli gunsmithing school, and by age 14 he was already apprenticing with [[Beretta]], a determining factor in his early career. He founded Uberti on the eve of the U.S. Civil War's 100th anniversary, when he was approached by U.S. businessmen who wanted to cater to the budding but promising reenactment market.&lt;ref&gt;Farwest.it magazine, July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Uberti's first replica was the 1851 Colt Navy revolver, followed by other [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] civil-war-era models; later, he moved on to [[Remington Arms|Remington]] and [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] designs. It was during this era that Colt ceased production of their famous [[Colt Single Action Army|Single Action Army]] or "Peacemaker" revolvers.&lt;ref name="HoggWalter2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Hogg |first1 = Ian |last2 = Walter |first2 = John |title = Pistols of the World |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=okQH6zFgDtUC&amp;pg=PA352 |date = 29 August 2004 |publisher = David &amp; Charles |isbn = 0-87349-460-1 |pages = 352–363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, Uberti had grown into an internationally recognized producer of Civil-War and Old West firearms, with high quality standards and a marked preference for forging their receivers out of solid steel rather than using casting or alloys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sackpeterson.com/models/dakota.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2000, Uberti was acquired by [[Beretta]], thanks to whose substantial financing it upgraded the factory to a brand-new facility, thereby greatly expanding production capacity. By 2002, the factory was further modernized with CNC machinery; this enabled them to expedite certain manufacturing processes, although an amount of hand-fitting and hand-finishing remains necessary to this day for this type of firearm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubertireplicas.com/about-uberti/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uberti in American western movies ==
Uberti firearms have been featured in numerous Western movies thanks to their authentic looks. Italian filmmaker [[Sergio Leone]] visited the Uberti factory in the 1960s to procure replica Civil War and Old West revolvers for use in all his Western films including ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''.&lt;ref name="Wilson2008"&gt;{{cite book |last = Wilson |first = Robert Lawrence |title = The Peacemakers: Arms and Adventure in the American West |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ijgOAAAACAAJ |year = 2008 |publisher = Chartwell Books |isbn = 978-0-7858-1892-2 |page = 175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other movie credits include Uberti's [[Colt Walker]] featured in [[John Wayne]]'s 1969 ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'',&lt;ref&gt;True West Magazine, ''Scattergun Sidekick Unite'', 24 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the same model in [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal, ''The Story of Guns in America'', 9 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; All firearms in the 1990 Western ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' starring [[Kevin Costner]] were Ubertis,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Dances_With_Wolves&lt;/ref&gt; while a number of Uberti rifles and pistols have also been used in the 1993 film ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' featuring [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Kurt Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Tombstone&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current production ==
Today, Uberti caters to collectors, [[Cowboy Action Shooting|cowboy action shooters]], civil war skirmishers as well as working ranchers, hunters and other outdoorsmen who need or prefer to carry traditional firearms into the field. Historically, Uberti has produced parts such as frames, cylinders, and barrels for several other manufacturers like [[Beretta]], [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Taurus]], [[Charles Daly firearms|Charles Daly]], [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[U.S. Fire Arms Manufacturing Company|USFA]],&lt;ref name="HoggWalter2004" /&gt; while current firearms made by the company are offered under both the Uberti brand names and those of importers Cimarron and Taylor's.
&lt;ref name="Ayoob2011"&gt;{{cite book |last = Ayoob |first = Massad |authorlink = Massad Ayoob |title = Gun Digest Book of Beretta Pistols: Function, Accuracy, Performance |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=koebTYhoV9wC&amp;pg=PA128 |date = 2011 |publisher = Gun Digest Books |location = Iola, Wisconsin |isbn = 1-4402-2653-9 |page = 128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to modern steels and the decades-old experience of the artisans assembling the guns, Uberti's replicas are highly regarded by shooters and collectors all over the world, sometimes thought as surpassing the originals in quality.&lt;ref&gt;Magnum n° 2, year 3, p 68 – 73. Milano, Acquario Editrice, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that Uberti has been called "The King of Replicas" by U.S. shooters and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph G. Bilby, Civil War Firearms: Their Historical Background and Tactical Use, Da Capo Press, 29 March 2005, 207&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Uberti's faithfulness to the originals is such that many internal parts of their current Colt replica may be interchanged with those of an original first-generation Single Action Army.&lt;ref&gt;Colt 1873 Single Action, lupidicavatore.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current U.S. importers ==
The long and varied history of Uberti importers has sometimes created confusion in the mind of the U.S. customer, with unfounded rumors about quality differences between the lines offered through various importers.&lt;ref&gt;https://thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=321040&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that the product has been often marketed under the importer's name (e.g., Navy Arms, Cimarron, etc.) rather than the manufacturer's, with each importer naturally positioning their product as being the best.

Currently, Uberti firearms come into the United States through three main importers. The first and largest is [[Stoeger]], a member of the same parent company (Benelli, in turn a member of the Beretta Holding Company). In this case, Stoeger does not act as a brand, but only as a) the FFL under which the Uberti firearms are imported, which is why these are the only Uberti firearms to be openly marketed under the Uberti brand; and b) the company handling the 5-year warranty. The second is Taylor's, a Virginia-based company that caters in particular to cowboy-action shooters, reenactors and collectors. The third is Cimarron Arms, a Texas-based company also specializing in the Cowboy-action market.

== Business units and corporate ownership ==

The Beretta Holding Company acquired Uberti with the explicit goal of dominating the market niche of replica firearms—a niche that up to that point Beretta had not entered. Through this acquisition, Beretta's intention was to quickly become the dominant force in this interesting market segment (particularly in the U.S.), by offering a product that reflected Beretta's own manufacturing standards.

According to the then CEO of Beretta Holding, Dott. Piero Gussalli Beretta, "the objective of this acquisition [was] that of leading the Beretta group onto the stage of America's most genuine tradition of cowboy-type firearms and shooting, through a brand that is comparable to Beretta in quality and prestige."&lt;ref&gt;Beretta Acquires Uberti | Shooting Industry | Find Articles at BNET, findarticles.com.&lt;/ref&gt; A year after the acquisition (2001), Uberti netted a record of $15M. The current Uberti CEO is Dr. Giacomo Merlino.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Grant, ''International directory of company histories,'' St. James Press, 2001, {{ISBN|978-1-55862-444-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the [[United States|U.S.]] subdivision of Uberti is located in [[Accokeek, Maryland]], within the [[Benelli (firearms)|Benelli]] U.S. main offices. Uberti is in fact part of the Benelli group, in turn a member of the [[Beretta]] holding family.&lt;ref name="Carpenteri2013"&gt;{{cite book |last = Carpenteri |first = Stephen D. |title = Gun Trader's Guide to Rifles: A Comprehensive, Fully Illustrated Reference for Modern Rifles with Current Market Values |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=smYtAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT341 |date = 13 December 2013 |publisher = Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated |isbn = 978-1-62873-481-2 |page = 341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait - Aharon Zorea 2016.jpg|thumb|Dr. Aharon W. Zorea in 2016]]
'''Aharon Wilson Zorea''' (born March 5, 1969) is a [[historian]] specializing in modern social movements, especially related to [[crime control]] and contemporary [[Medical ethics|medical issues]].

== Early life ==
Aharon Zorea was born Aaron James Alexander Wilson on March 5, 1969 in [[Houston]], Texas the youngest of three children to Barton Taylor Wilson, Jr. and Patricia Anne Wilson (née Forslund). His childhood was marked by frequent travel.  Before he was a year old, his family moved from [[Houston]] to Anchorage, [[Alaska]] and at the age of five they moved to [[Tacoma, Washington]] while his father attended law school.  Five years later, they moved to Kfar Chabad, Israel and then to [[Chico, California]], before finally settling back in Anchorage, Alaska.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Religious conversion ==
Much of the family travel was motivated by religious conviction. Zorea's parents converted to [[Reform Judaism]] before he was born, but after ten years the entire family transitioned in [[Hasidic Judaism|Chasidic Judaism]].  In 1980 they legally changed the family name from Wilson to Zorea (which means, “Sower of Seeds”) and then made [[Aliyah]] to Israel. They intended to immigrate and remain in the Jewish Holy Land for life.  Barton changed his name to Moshe Calberg Zorea, and Patricia changed her name to Rivka Chana Zorea.  His two elder brothers also changed their names, from Barton Taylor Wilson III to Avraham Barton Zorea, and from Derek Leeland Wilson to Isaac Derek Zorea. Aaron’s name remained mostly the same with only a spelling change.  The family moved to the village of Kfar Chabad in Israel, which is one of the two centers of Chasidism (the other being in Crown Heights, Brooklyn), where Moshe and the two elder brothers attended Yeshiva Ohr Tmimim.  Shortly before Zorea’s thirteenth birthday, Moshe Zorea converted to Christianity, and the entire family followed his lead.  Less than a year after arriving in Israel, the Zorea family moved back to the United States and maintained the name change.  The story of the family’s religious conversion became the subject of many lectures and a forthcoming book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Historical Lesson in Faith Bring Professor's Family to the Faith|last=O'Brien|first=Joseph|date=2010-03-18|work=The Catholic Times, pp. 5-6|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7fgWHmGWbc|title=Theology on Tap Lecture on Judaism (1 of 3)|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c98waHBe-7o|title=Theology of Tap Lecture on Judaism (2 of 3)|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwjOIbXCKiY|title=Theology on Tap Lecture on Judaism (3 of 3)|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
After several years in Chico, California, the Zorea family moved back to Anchorage, Alaska where his parents and siblings remained. Zorea attended [[Bartlett High School (Alaska)|Bartlett High School]], and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (1987) in History from the [[University of Alaska Anchorage|University of Alaska, Anchorage]].  He earned his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1993) in American Diplomatic History from [[Purdue University]], where he studied under Jon Teaford. After teaching for five years, Zorea attended [[Saint Louis University]] and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (2005) under [[Donald T. Critchlow|Donald Critchlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://richland.uwc.edu/bio/aharon-zorea|title=Aharon Zorea Curriculum Vitae|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|date=2015-10-15|website=University of Wisconsin|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Between earning his M.A. and PhD., Zorea taught at several high schools including [[Holy Rosary Academy (Alaska)|Holy Rosary Academy]] (Anchorage, Alaska) and [[Interlochen Center for the Arts#Interlochen Arts Academy|Interlochen Arts Academy]] (Michigan).

'''Alcora Exercise''' ({{lang-pt|Exercício Alcora}}, {{lang-af|Alcora Oefening}}) or simply '''Alcora''' was a secret [[military alliance]] between [[South Africa]], [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] and [[Rhodesia]], formally in force between 1970 and 1974. The code name "Alcora" being an acronym for "'''Al'''iança '''Co'''ntra as '''R'''ebeliões em '''A'''frica" (Portuguese expression meaning: "Alliance against the rebellions in Africa").

The official goal of Alcora Exercise was to investigate the processes and means by which a coordinated tripartite effort between the three countries could face the mutual threat to their territories in [[Southern Africa]]. The immediate goal was to face the African revolutionary movements that fought guerrillas wars against the Portuguese authorities in Angola and Mozambique, to limit the spread of the action of these movements in [[South West Africa]] and Rhodesia and to prepare the defense of the Portuguese, South African and Rhodesian territories against an expected conventional military aggression from the hostile governments of the African neighbor countries.

Alcora was the formalization of informal agreements on military cooperation between the local Portuguese, South African and Rhodesian military commands that had been in place since the mid-1960s. Alcora was kept secret and referred to as an 'exercise' (not an alliance or treaty), mainly due to the pressure of the [[Portuguese Government]], that feared the external and internal political issues that would be raised if it appeared to be associated with the ''[[Apartheid]]'' regime of South Africa and the minority rule in Rhodesia, in contradiction to the official Portuguese doctrine of the existence of racial equality in Angola and Mozambique.

Under Alcora, South Africa, Portugal and Rhodesia cooperated in the [[Angolan War of Independence]], the [[Mozambican War of Independence]], the [[South African Border War]] and the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].

The Alcora alliance collapsed due to the Portuguese [[Carnation Revolution]] of 25 April 1974 and the subsequent independence of Angola and Mozambique that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Afonso|first=Aniceto|author2=Carlos de Matos Gomes|title=Alcora|page=|url=| isbn=978-989-8633-01-9 | year=2013 | publisher=Divina Comédia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/a-military-alliance-between-portugal-and-african-states-that-few-knew-about-1.1772940 A military alliance between Portugal and African states that few knew about], Irish Times 25 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexandre de Rhodes, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]'''  (15 March 1591&lt;ref&gt;Current scholarship suggests Rhodes may have been born in 1593. See Eduardo Torralba, S.I., "La Date de naissance du Père de Rhodes: 15 mars 1591, est-elle exacte?", in ''Bulletin de la Societé des Etudes Indochinoises'', n.s. 35 (1960), 683–689, about the disagreement regarding the date of de Rhodes' birth.  While some sources, including the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], indicate that the date was 1591, specialists such as Torralba, [[Peter Phan]], Claude Larre, Pham Dinh Khiem, and Joseph Dehergne give the later date of 1593.&lt;/ref&gt; – 5 November 1660) was a French [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] and [[lexicographer]] who had a lasting impact on [[Christianity in Vietnam]]. He wrote the ''[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]'', the first trilingual [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]-[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-[[Latin]] [[dictionary]], published  in [[Rome]], in 1651.&lt;ref name="W2583"&gt;''Wörterbücher: Ein Internationales Handbuch Zur Lexikographie'' by Franz Josef Hausmann, p.2583 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kwqc7xso22wC&amp;pg=PA2583&amp;dq=%22Dictionarium+Annamiticum+Lusitanum+et+Latinum%22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind'' By James Cowles p.501 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4CYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=%22Dictionarium+Annamiticum+Lusitanum+et+Latinum%22#PPA501,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Old map of Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Map of "Annam" drafted by Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) showing "Cocincina" (left) and "Tunkin" (right).]]

Alexandre de Rhodes was born in [[Avignon]], now in [[France]]. He was a descendant of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/25566838/The_First_French_in_Macao._The_Jesuit_Alexandre_de_Rhodes&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[novitiate]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] in Rome on 24 April 1612 to dedicate his life to missionary work. He arrived in [[Indochina]] about 1619. A Jesuit mission had been established in [[Hanoi]] in 1615; Rhodes arrived there in 1620. He spent ten years in and around the Court at Hanoi during the rule of [[Trịnh Tùng]] and [[Trịnh Tráng]]. Rhodes spent twelve years in Vietnam studying under another Jesuit, Francisco de Pina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryliving.com/vietnam2/vietnamch3.htm |title=Customs and Culture of Vietnam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505003302/http://www.militaryliving.com/vietnam2/vietnamch3.htm |archivedate=2006-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1624, he was sent to the [[East Indies]], arriving in [[Cochinchina|Cochin-China]] on a boat with fellow Jesuit [[Girolamo Maiorica]]. In 1627, he travelled to [[Tongkin]]g, Vietnam where he worked until 1630, when he was forced to leave. He was expelled from Vietnam in 1630 as Trịnh Tráng became concerned about the spread of Catholicism in his realm. Rhodes in his reports said he converted more than 6,000 Vietnamese. Daily conversation in Vietnam "resembles the singing of birds", wrote Alexandre de Rhodes.

From Vietnam Rhodes went to [[Portuguese Macau]], where he spent ten years. He then returned to Vietnam, this time to the lands of the [[Nguyễn Lords]], mainly around [[Huế]]. He spent six years in this part until he aroused the displeasure of lord [[Nguyễn Phúc Lan]] and was condemned to death.

As his sentence was reduced to exile, Rhodes returned to Rome by 1649 and pleaded for increased funding for Catholic missions to Vietnam, telling somewhat exaggerated stories about the natural riches to be found in Vietnam. This plea by Alexandre de Rhodes is at the origin of the creation of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] in 1659. As neither the Portuguese nor the Pope showed interest in the project, Alexandre de Rhodes, with [[Pope Alexander VII]]'s agreement, found [[secular]] volunteers in Paris in the persons of [[François Pallu]] and [[Pierre Lambert de la Motte]], the first members of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, who were sent to the Far-East as [[Apostolic vicar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ex_Hy0sv4T0C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=Rhodes+Missions+Etrangeres+de+Paris&amp;sig=ACfU3U3Cmo-FMdoKxBLF3YQQZh3kbbQ95g ''Viet Nam'' By Nhung Tuyet Tran, Anthony Reid p.222]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OC3OHQ0SygYC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Rhodes+Missions+Etrangeres+de+Paris&amp;sig=ACfU3U05mtIRUx34aHurVvpWPAjAtOnZJg ''An Empire Divided'' by James Patrick Daughton, p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SqTQjve2VLsC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Rhodes+Missions+Etrangeres+de+Paris&amp;sig=ACfU3U0_wB3FrNB-sDXxTCJsyQYlHBkIrg#PPA229,M1 ''Asia in the Making of Europe'', p.229–230]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandre de Rhodes himself was sent to [[Persia]] instead of back to Vietnam. Rhodes died in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Persia]] in 1660 and was buried in the [[New Julfa Armenian Cemetery]].

In 1943, the French colony of Indochina issued a 30c postage stamp honoring him. In 2001 Vietnamese artist [[Nguyen Dinh Dang]] created a painting in homage to Alexandre de Rhodes and [[Nguyen Van Vinh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ribf.riken.go.jp/~dang/paintings/Rhodes.html |title=The Introduction of Roman Writing Into Vietnam (The transcendental Death of Mr. Nguyen Van Vinh)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Vietnam, de Rhodes developed an early Vietnamese alphabet based on work by earlier Portuguese missionaries. De Rhodes compiled a [[catechism]], ''{{lang|vi|[[Phép giảng tám ngày]]}}'', and a trilingual dictionary and grammar, ''{{lang|la|[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]}}''. Both were published in Rome in 1651. Unlike Maiorica's catechism and devotional texts, de Rhodes's works eschewed the traditional Vietnamese [[chữ Nôm]] script in favor of this new [[Latin-script alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell P., Jenny M. The Handbook of Austroasiatic Languages. BRILL. 2014. V. 2. P. 909&lt;/ref&gt; Later refined as [[Vietnamese alphabet|quốc ngữ]], it eventually displaced chữ Nôm as the Vietnamese language's written form during the 19th and 20th centuries and "effectively separated ensuing generations of Vietnamese students from their own national literature, because they could no longer read it".&lt;ref&gt;Pears P.

New York: Longman. 1991. P. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

De Rhodes also wrote several books about Vietnam and his travels there, including:

* ''{{lang|fr|Histoire du royaume de Tunquin}}'' (History of the Kingdom of Tonkin) (Rome, 1650)
* ''{{lang|fr|Tunchinensis historiæ libri duo}}'' (pub. 1652)
* ''{{lang|fr|Divers voyages et missions du P. Alexandre de Rhodes en la Chine et autres royaumes de l'Orient}}'' (Paris, 1653), translated into English as ''Rhodes of Viet Nam: The Travels and Missions of Father Alexandre de Rhodes in China and Other Kingdoms of the Orient'' (1966)
* ''{{lang|fr|La glorieuse mort d'André, Catéchiste}}'' (The Glorious Death of [[Andrew of Phú Yên|Andrew]], Catechist) (pub. 1653)

The '''American Schools of Oriental Research''' ('''ASOR'''), founded in 1900 as the '''American School of Oriental Study and Research in Palestine''', supports and encourages the study of the peoples and cultures of the [[Near East]], from the earliest times to the present. It is apolitical and has no religious affiliation. [[Susan Ackerman (biblical scholar)|Susan Ackerman]] has been President since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dartmouth Professor Leads Middle East Research Group|url=http://jewish.dartmouth.edu/news/dartmouth-professor-leads-middle-east-research-group|publisher=[[Dartmouth College]]|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASOR: History: The Early Years |url=http://www.asor.org/about/history.html |publisher=ASOR ]]|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASOR supports three independent overseas institutes:
* [[Albright Institute of Archaeological Research]], [[Jerusalem]], - former directors of which include [[Millar Burrows]] who was instrumental in the first publications of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]].
* Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute, [[Nicosia]].
* [[American Center of Oriental Research]], [[Amman]]. 
The overseas institutes support scholars working in the Middle East that focus on [[Near Eastern Archaeology]], [[Semitic languages]], [[history]], and [[Bible|Biblical]] studies. All institutes are also members of the [[Council of American Overseas Research Centers]].

==Annual conference==
ASOR convenes a scholarly conference once a year in North America, always beginning 8 days before [[Thanksgiving]] (on a Wednesday evening) and running through Saturday evening. 

2008 - [[Boston, MA]] and drew over 730 scholars and interested lay members from around the world. 

2009 - [[New Orleans, LA]].

2018 - [[Denver, CO]].

2019 - [[San Diego]], CA.

==Publications==
ASOR also publishes three  scholarly publications. Two of the journals are academic flagships in their respective areas: the ''[[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]]'' presents archaeological, historical, and epigraphic articles on topics from the ancient Near East, and the ''[[Journal of Cuneiform Studies]]'' presents articles in English, German, and French on Mesopotamian topics.  The organization also publishes ''[[Near Eastern Archaeology (journal)|Near Eastern Archaeology]]'', a quarterly that reports recent research for both popular and professional audiences.

'''Christopher Beeston''' (c. 1579 – c. 15 October 1638) was a successful actor and a powerful theatrical [[impresario]] in [[Renaissance|early 17th century]] London.  He was associated with a number of playwrights, particularly [[Thomas Heywood]].

==Early life==
Little is known of Beeston's early life. In extant records he is known alternately as Beeston and Hutchison. He has not so far been decisively connected with the William Beeston mentioned by [[Thomas Nashe]] in ''Strange News''; however, such a connection is possible. Beeston has been conjecturally associated with the "Kit" in the surviving plot of [[Richard Tarlton]]'s ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (play)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage'', 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that he began in theatre as a child actor: [[Augustine Phillips]] bequeathed "his servant" Beeston thirty shillings in his 1605 last will and testament, indicating that Beeston had been that actor's apprentice with the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]]. Beeston played in the company's 1598 production of [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964'', Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; So it appears that Beeston started as a [[boy player]] and later graduated to adult roles.

In 1602 Beeston was involved in a serious scandal involving a charge of rape. The evidence is recorded in the Minute Books of [[Bridewell Palace|Bridewell]] prison. A woman named Margaret White, the widow of a cloth worker, accused him of raping her on Midsummer night and leaving her pregnant. Beeston denied the charge, in a riotous hearing attended by his fellow actors who "much abused the place". The hearing recommended that Beeston be prosecuted, but no records of a trial survive; it appears that the case did not follow through, perhaps for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Salkeld, "Literary Traces in Bridewell and Bethlem, 1602–1624," ''Review of English Studies'', Vol. 56 No. 225, pp. 379–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maturity==
Beeston left the Lord Chamberlain's Men and moved on to [[Worcester's Men]] in August 1602, a month after the rape accusation; perhaps he was forced out. He stayed with Worcester's Men through its transformation into [[Queen Anne's Men]], eventually becoming the troupe's manager.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 226–9 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he worked closely with [[Thomas Heywood]], producing most of that prolific writer's plays at the [[Red Bull Theatre]]. Surviving court documents suggest that Beeston's business practices were not above reproach; he was sued twice, in 1619 and 1623, in business disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 236–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary records reveal that Beeston had treated company funds as his own, charging the company for properties he had purchased with its money. The company, already in difficult straits, limped along until the death of [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] in 1619. For a brief time, the remnants of the company toured the countryside, but they soon disappeared.

Beeston, meantime, had established the [[Cockpit Theatre]] in [[Drury Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Glynne Wickham, ''Early English Stages 1576–1660'', London, Routledge,  2002; pp. 117–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Beeston's interest in this theatre dates to 1616, when he bought a [[cockfight]] ring, possibly employing [[Inigo Jones]] to convert it to a theatre.  The new establishment, still called the [[Cockpit Theatre]] after its former function, opened in 1616.  On [[Shrove Tuesday]] 1617, a mob of apprentices ransacked and torched the theatre; patrons of the Red Bull, they appear to have been angry that their favourite plays had been moved to the more-exclusive (and expensive)indoor theatre. When Beeston rebuilt the theatre, he named it the Phoenix, but it was still frequently called the Cockpit.

Prospering in the theatre business meant negotiating murky waters. Beeston regularly bribed Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]], and once bought the Master's wife a pair of gloves worth "at least 20 shillings," according to Herbert's approving note. Beeston eventually granted Herbert a share in the profits of Queen Anne's Men.&lt;ref name="ThoroldHornblow1927"&gt;{{citation|author1=W. J. Thorold|author2=Arthur Hornblow|author3=Perriton Maxwell|author4=Stewart Beach|title=Theatre Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KiwoAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 August 2011|year=1927|volume=45–46|publisher=The Theatre Magazine Company|page=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
From 1619 until his death in 1638, Beeston ran both theatres with a succession of companies, ranging from [[Prince Charles' Men]]&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queen Henrietta's Men]] to the last group of child actors, commonly called [[Beeston's Boys]]. (The actors in this group were significantly older than Elizabethan boy players; a number were in their early twenties.) Beeston's enterprises during these years prospered. The Cockpit offered credible competition to the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]] for the wealthier set of playgoers; Beeston employed fashionable playwrights such as [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] and [[James Shirley]] to attract these audiences. After the temporary demise and ultimate eclipse of the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]] in 1621, the Red Bull was the main attraction in [[Middlesex]] for citizens and apprentices.

Beeston died in 1638, leaving his theatrical interests in the hands of his son [[William Beeston]].

The '''civil calendar''' is the [[calendar]], or possibly one of several calendars, used within a country for civil, official or administrative purposes. The civil calendar is almost always used for general purposes by people and private organizations.

The most widespread civil calendar and [[de facto standard|''de facto'' international standard]] is the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Although that calendar is associated with the Catholic Church and the papacy, it has been adopted, as a matter of convenience, by many secular and non-Christian countries although some countries use other calendars.

== Civil calendars worldwide ==
{{main|List of calendars|Calendar era}}
Most countries in the world use the Gregorian calendar as their sole civil calendar. Countries which do not use the Gregorian calendar are Afghanistan and Iran, which use the [[Solar Hijri calendar]], [[Ethiopia]] ([[Ethiopian calendar]]) and [[Nepal]] ([[Vikram Samvat]]). Some countries use other calendars alongside the Gregorian calendar: [[Bangladesh]] ([[Bangla calendar]]), India ([[Indian national calendar]]) and Israel ([[Hebrew calendar]]).

Other countries use modified versions of the Gregorian calendar: Taiwan ([[Minguo calendar]]), Thailand ([[Thai solar calendar]]), North Korea ([[North Korean Calendar]]) and Japan ([[Japanese calendar]]).

'''Diarmaid Ninian John MacCulloch'''{{Needs IPA|date=September 2017}} {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|Kt|FSA|FRHistS|FBA}} (born 31 October 1951) is a British historian and academic, specialising in [[ecclesiastical history]] and the [[history of Christianity]]. Since 1995, he has been a fellow of [[St Cross College, Oxford]]; he was formerly the senior tutor. Since 1997, he has been Professor of the History of the Church at the [[University of Oxford]].

Though ordained a [[Deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] in the [[Church of England]], he declined ordination to the [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priesthood]] because of the Church's attitude to homosexuality.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2009/wk45/history_feature.shtml BBC Press Office (2009): A History Of Christianity]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he encapsulated the evolution of his religious beliefs: "I was brought up in the presence of the Bible, and I remember with affection what it was like to hold a dogmatic position on the statements of Christian belief. I would now describe myself as a candid friend of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Christianity'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; MacCulloch co-edits the ''[[Journal of Ecclesiastical History]]''.

==Life==
Diarmaid MacCulloch was born in [[Kent]], England, to parents Nigel J.&amp;nbsp;H. MacCulloch (an Anglican priest) and Jennie MacCulloch (''née'' Chappell).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= MacCulloch |first=Diarmaid |year=c. 2011 |title=Curriculum Vitae: Diarmaid Ninian John MacCulloch |url=https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/stx/Website%20Documentation/Fellows%20Documents/MacCulloch%20CV.pdf |access-date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Hillcroft Preparatory School]] and [[Stowmarket High School|Stowmarket Grammar School]] in [[Suffolk]]. He subsequently studied history at [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1972; this was promoted to a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1976. During that period, he was also [[organ scholar]] at the college. After completing a Diploma in Archive Administration at [[Liverpool University]] in 1973, he then returned to Cambridge to complete a PhD degree in 1977 on [[Tudor period|Tudor]] history under the supervision of [[Geoffrey Elton]], combining this with a position as Junior Research Fellow at Churchill College.

MacCulloch joined the [[Gay Christian Movement]] in 1976, serving twice on its committee and briefly as honorary secretary. From 1978 to 1990 he tutored at [[Wesley College, Bristol]], and taught church history in the department of theology at the [[University of Bristol]]. He interrupted his teaching to study for the Oxford Diploma in Theology (awarded 1987) at [[Ripon College Cuddesdon]]. In 1987 he was [[Ordination#Roman Catholic.2C Orthodox.2C and Anglican churches|ordained]] a [[Deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] in the [[Church of England]] and from 1987 to 1988 he served as a non-stipendiary minister at [[Church of All Saints, Clifton|All Saints' Clifton with St John's]] in the Diocese of Bristol. However, in response to a motion put before the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] in 1987 by Tony Higton regarding the sexuality of clergy, he declined ordination to the [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priesthood]] and ceased to minister at Clifton.

Regarding the conflict between his [[homosexuality and the Anglican Communion|homosexuality and the Church of England]] and his own retreat from orthodoxy he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was ordained Deacon. But, being a gay man, it was just impossible to proceed further, within the conditions of the Anglican set-up, because I was determined that I would make no bones about who I was; I was brought up to be truthful, and truth has always mattered to me. The Church couldn't cope and so we parted company. It was a miserable experience.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

MacCulloch was awarded a [[Doctor of Divinity]] (DD) degree by the [[University of Oxford]] in 2001; the DD is the highest degree awarded by the university.

His book ''[[Reformation: A History|Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490–1700]]'' (2003) won the 2004 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and 2004 [[British Academy Book Prize]], adding to his earlier success in carrying off the 1996 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''Thomas Cranmer: A Life''. ''[[A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years]]'', was published in September 2009 with a related 6-part television series called ''[[A History of Christianity (TV series)|A History of Christianity]]'' which first aired on BBC4 in 2009 and then on BBC2 and BBC4 in 2010. The book won [[McGill University]]'s [[Cundill Prize]], a $75,000 prize, the largest such prize in Canada at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec/british-church-historian-wins-mcgills-cundill-prize/article1798747/ | location=Toronto | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | title=Search | date=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Edo period'''|江戸時代|Edo jidai}} or {{nihongo|'''Tokugawa period'''|徳川時代}} is the period between 1603 and 1868 in the [[history of Japan]], when Japanese society was under the rule of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the country's 300 regional ''[[daimyō]]''. The period was characterized by economic growth, strict social order, [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policies, a stable population,  "no more wars", and popular enjoyment of arts and culture. The shogunate was officially established in [[Edo]] on March 24, 1603, by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. The period came to an end with the [[Meiji Restoration]] on May 3, 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]].

== Consolidation of the shogunate ==
{{main|Tokugawa shogunate}}
[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], first ''[[shōgun]]'' of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]]]

A [[revolution]] took place from the time of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], which existed with the [[Tennō]]'s court, to the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], when the ''[[samurai]]'' became the unchallenged rulers   in what historian [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] called a "centralized [[feudal]]" form of shogunate. Instrumental in the rise of the new-existing [[bakufu]] was [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], the main beneficiary of the achievements of [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Already powerful, Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich [[Kantō region|Kantō]] area. He maintained two million ''[[koku]]'' of land, a new headquarters at [[Edo]], a strategically situated castle town (the future [[Tokyo]]), and also had an additional two million ''koku'' of land and thirty-eight [[vassal]]s under his control. After Hideyoshi's death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the [[Toyotomi clan]].

Ieyasu's victory over the western ''[[daimyō]]'' at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] (October 21, 1600, or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the [[Keichō]] era) gave him control of all [[Japan]]. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy ''daimyō'' houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western ''daimyō'', but his assumption of the title of ''[[shōgun]]'' helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Hidetada]] (1579–1632) as ''shōgun'' and himself as retired ''shōgun'' in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat, and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615, the Tokugawa army destroyed the Toyotomi stronghold at [[Osaka]].

The Tokugawa (or Edo) period brought 250 years of stability to [[Japan]]. The political system evolved into what historians call ''bakuhan'', a combination of the terms ''[[bakufu]]'' and ''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'' (domains) to describe the government and society of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=128–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''bakuhan'', the ''shōgun'' had national authority and the ''daimyō'' had regional authority. This represented a new unity in the feudal structure, which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of [[centralized]] and decentralized authorities. The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule: land redistribution gave them nearly seven million ''koku'', control of the most important cities, and a land assessment system reaping great revenues.

The  [[feudal]] hierarchy was completed by the various classes of ''daimyō''. Closest to the Tokugawa house were the ''[[Shinpan (daimyo)|shinpan]]'', or "related houses". They were twenty-three ''daimyō'' on the borders of Tokugawa lands, all directly related to Ieyasu. The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu. The second class of the hierarchy were the ''[[fudai]]'', or "house ''daimyō''", rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service. By the 18th century, 145 ''fudai'' controlled such smaller ''han'', the greatest assessed at 250,000 ''koku''. Members of the ''fudai'' class staffed most of the major bakufu offices. Ninety-seven ''han'' formed the third group, the ''[[tozama]]'' (outside vassals), former opponents or new allies. The ''tozama'' were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million ''koku'' of productive land. Because the ''tozama'' were least trusted of the ''daimyō'', they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated, although they were excluded from central [[government]] positions.

The Tokugawa shogunate not only consolidated their control over a reunified [[Japan]], they also had unprecedented power over the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], the court, all ''daimyō'' and the religious orders. The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the ''shōgun'', who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family. The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands. To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family, Ieyasu's granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619.

A code of laws was established to regulate the ''daimyō'' houses. The code encompassed private conduct, marriage, dress, types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year (the ''[[sankin-kōtai]]'' system); prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships; proscribed Christianity; restricted castles to one per domain (''[[han (administrative division)|han]]'') and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law. Although the ''daimyō'' were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions for [[military]] and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles, roads, bridges and palaces. The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the ''daimyō'', thus weakening their threat to the central administration. The ''han'', once military-centered domains, became mere local [[Administration (government)|administrative]] units. The ''daimyō'' did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, [[bureaucrat]]s and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.

==Foreign trade relations==
{{main|Sakoku}}
[[File:HasekuraWithShipDetail.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|San Juan Bautista]]'' is represented in [[Claude Deruet]]'s painting of [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] in Rome in 1617, as a galleon with Hasekura's flag (red manji on orange background) on the top mast.]]
[[File:Hasekura Travels.jpg|thumb|Itinerary and dates of the travels of Hasekura Tsunenaga]]
[[File:Nagasaki bay siebold.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Dejima]] island as a Dutch trading post in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], 1897]]

Like Hideyoshi, Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders. He wanted to make Edo a major port, but once he learned that the Europeans favored ports in [[Kyūshū]] and that China had rejected his plans for official trade, he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities.

The beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]] during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built its first ocean-going Western-style [[warships]], such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-[[ton]] [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas and then to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 720 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], used those ships throughout Asia.

The "Christian problem" was, in effect, a problem of controlling both the [[Christian]] ''daimyō'' in Kyūshū and their trade with the [[Europeans]]. By 1612, the ''shōgun''{{'}}s retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity. More restrictions came in 1616 (the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado, an island northwest of Kyūshū), 1622 (the execution of 120 missionaries and converts), 1624 (the expulsion of the Spanish), and 1629 (the execution of thousands of Christians). Finally, the [[Closed Country Edict of 1635]] prohibited any Japanese from traveling outside Japan or, if someone left, from ever returning. In 1636, the Dutch were restricted to [[Dejima]], a small [[artificial island]]—and thus, not true Japanese soil—in Nagasaki's harbor.

The shogunate perceived Catholic Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor, and so decided to target it. The [[Shimabara Rebellion]] of 1637–38, in which discontented Catholic Christian samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufu—and Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel stronghold—marked the end of the Christian movement, although some [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christians survived by going underground, the so-called [[Kakure Kirishitan]]. Soon thereafter, the Portuguese were permanently expelled, members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed, all subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple, and the Dutch and Chinese were restricted, respectively, to Dejima and to a special quarter in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Besides small trade of some outer ''daimyō'' with [[Korea]] and the [[Ryukyu Islands]], to the southwest of Japan's main islands, by 1641, foreign contacts were limited by the policy of ''[[sakoku]]'' to Nagasaki.

The last Jesuit was either killed or reconverted by 1644&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=369–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1660s, Christianity was almost completely eradicated, and its external political, economic, and religious influence on Japan became quite limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only China, the [[Dutch East India Company]], and for a short period, the English, enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period, for commercial purposes only, and they were restricted to the [[Dejima]] port in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial.

==Society==
{{main|Edo society}}
[[File:Edo Hibachi.JPG|thumb|The house of the merchant ''([http://www.kcf.or.jp/fukagawa/ Fukagawa Edo Museum])'']]
[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|Social classes during the Edo period ([[Tokugawa shogunate]]).]]

Edo society had an elaborate social structure, in which everyone knew their place and level of prestige. At the top were the Emperor and the court nobility, invincible in prestige but weak in power. Next came the [[shōgun]], ''[[daimyō]]'' and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa. They had power. The ''daimyō'' comprised about 250 local lords of local "han" with annual outputs of 50,000 or more bushels of rice. The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals, including elegant architecture, landscaped gardens, Noh drama, patronage of the arts, and the tea ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UJLtPR_gMtsC&amp;pg=PA225 p 225–230]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long period of inner conflict, the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country. It created a balance of power that remained (fairly) stable for the next 250 years, influenced by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principles of [[social order]]. Most [[samurai]] lost their direct possession of the land: the ''daimyō'' took over their land.  The samurai had a choice: give up their sword and become peasants, or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer. Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north, or as direct vassals of the ''shōgun'', the 5,000 so-called ''[[hatamoto]]''. The ''daimyō'' were put under tight control of the shogunate. Their families had to reside in Edo; the ''daimyō'' themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province (''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'') for the next. This system was called ''[[sankin-kōtai]]''.

The individual had no legal rights in Tokugawa Japan. The family was the smallest legal entity, and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society. The 1711 ''Gotōke reijō'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the emperor and court nobles (''[[kuge]]''), together with the ''shōgun'' and ''daimyō''. Below them the population was divided into [[Four divisions of society|four classes]] in a system known as ''mibunsei'' (身分制): the samurai on top (about 5% of the population) and the peasants (more than 80% of the population) on the second level. Below the peasants were the craftsmen, and even below them, on the fourth level, were the merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beasley|1972|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the peasants lived in the rural areas. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the [[jōkamachi|cities]] that were built around ''daimyō'' [[Japanese castle|castles]], each restricted to their own quarter.

Outside the four classes were the so-called ''[[Burakumin|eta]]'' and ''hinin'', those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism. ''Eta'' were butchers, tanners and undertakers. ''Hinin'' served as town guards, street cleaners, and executioners. Other outsiders included the beggars, entertainers, and prostitutes. The word ''eta'' literally translates to "filthy" and ''hinin'' to "non-humans", a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' were not even people.&lt;ref name="Frédéric 2002 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Frédéric|2002|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hinin'' were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city. Other persecution of the hinin included disallowing them from wearing robes longer than knee-length and the wearing of hats.&lt;ref name="Frédéric 2002 313"/&gt; Sometimes ''eta'' villages were not even printed on official maps. A sub-class of hinin who were born into their social class had no option of mobility to a different social class whereas the other class of hinin who had lost their previous class status could be reinstated in Japanese society.&lt;ref name="Frédéric 2002 313"/&gt; In the 19th century the umbrella term ''burakumin'' was coined to name the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Frédéric 2002 93"&gt;{{harvnb|Frédéric|2002|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''eta'', ''hinin'' and ''burakumin'' classes were officially abolished in 1871.&lt;ref name="Frédéric 2002 313"/&gt; However, their cultural and societal impact, including some forms of discrimination, continued into modern times.&lt;ref name="Frédéric 2002 93"/&gt;

==Economic development==
[[File:Terakoya for girls.jpg|thumb|left|[[Terakoya]], private educational school]]

The Edo period bequeathed a vital commercial sector to be in burgeoning urban centers, a relatively well-educated elite, a sophisticated government [[bureaucracy]], productive agriculture, a closely unified nation with highly developed financial and marketing systems, and a national infrastructure of roads.

Economic development during the Tokugawa period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, [[Han (administrative division)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts.

By the mid-18th century, Edo had a population of more than one million, and [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Japan had almost [[zero population growth]] between the 1720s and 1820s, often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine, but some historians have presented different theories, such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flath|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.

===Agriculture===
[[Rice]] was the base of the economy.  About 80% of the people were rice farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Susan B. Hanley and Kozo Yamamura (1977)  ''Economic and demographic change in preindustrial Japan, 1600–1868'', pp. 69–90&lt;/ref&gt; Rice production increased steadily, but population remained stable, so prosperity increased. Rice paddies grew from 1.6 million chō in 1600 to 3 million by 1720.&lt;ref&gt;One chō, or chobu, equals 2.5 acres.&lt;/ref&gt; Improved technology helped farmers control the all-important flow of irrigation to their paddies. The ''daimyō'' operated several hundred castle towns, which became loci of domestic trade. Large-scale rice markets developed, centered on Edo and Ōsaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conrad D. Totman|title=A history of Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJLtPR_gMtsC&amp;pg=PA225|year=2000|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell||chapter=ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cities and towns, guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services. The merchants, while low in status, prospered, especially those with official patronage. Merchants invented credit instruments to transfer money, currency came into common use, and the strengthening credit market encouraged entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tetsuji Okazaki|title=The role of the merchant coalition in pre-modern Japanese economic development: an historical institutional analysis|journal=Explorations in Economic History|year=2005|volume=42|issue=2|pages=184–201|url=http://www2.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cemano/research/DP/documents/coe-f-33.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2004.06.005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510095959/http://www2.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cemano/research/DP/documents/coe-f-33.pdf|archivedate=2012-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''daimyō'' collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in Edo. To raise money, the ''daimyō'' used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].

It was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced [[forest management]] policy. Increased demand for timber resources for construction, shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation, which resulted in forest fires, floods and soil erosion. In response the ''shōgun'', beginning around 1666, instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. The policy mandated that only the ''shōgun'' and ''daimyō'' could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about [[silviculture]] and plantation [[forestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diamond|2005|pp=297–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial services===
The merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage. The samurai, forbidden to engage in farming or business but allowed to borrow money, borrowed too much. The bakufu and daimyos raised taxes on farmers, but did not tax business, so they too fell into debt. By 1750, rising taxes incited peasant unrest and even revolt.  The nation had to deal somehow with samurai impoverishment and treasury deficits. The financial troubles of the samurai undermined their loyalties to the system, and the empty treasury threatened the whole system of government. One solution was reactionary—with prohibitions on spending for luxuries. Other solutions were modernizing, with the goal of increasing agrarian productivity.  The eighth Tokugawa shogun, Yoshimune (in office 1716-1745) had considerable success, though much of his work had to be done again between 1787 and 1793 by the shogun's chief councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759-1829). Others shoguns debased the coinage to pay debts, which caused inflation. By 1800, the commercialization of the economy grew rapidly, bringing more and more remote villages into the national economy. Rich farmers appeared who switched from rice to high-profit commercial crops and engaged in local money-lending, trade, and small-scale manufacturing. Some wealthy merchants sought higher social status by using money to marry into the samurai class.

A few domains, notably Chōsū and Satsuma, used innovative methods to restore their finances, but most sunk further into debt.  The financial crisis provoked a reactionary solution near the end of the "Tempo era" (1830-1843) promulgated by the chief counselor Mizuno Tadakuni. He raised taxes, denounced luxuries and tried to impede the growth of business; he failed and it appeared to many that the continued existence of the entire Tokugawa system was in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;McClain (2002) pp 128-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic and intellectual development==
[[File:Japanese - Figurine ("Okimono") of a Dragon Emerging from Waves - Walters 491733.jpg|thumb|"Figurine ("Okimono") of a Dragon Emerging from Waves", Japan ca. 19th century]]
[[File:Mid-EdoClockwatch.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Wadokei]], Japanese-made clockwatch, 18th century]]

During the period, Japan studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', "Dutch studies") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired by Western techniques.

The flourishing of [[Neo-Confucianism]] was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period. [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies had long been kept active in Japan by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clerics, but during the Tokugawa period, Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control. This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society. The ethical [[humanism]], [[rationalism]], and historical perspective of neo-Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class. By the mid-17th century, neo-Confucianism was Japan's dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the ''[[kokugaku]]'' (national learning) school of thought.

Advanced studies and growing applications of neo-Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class- and large-group-oriented practices. The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the [[rule of law]]. New laws were developed, and new administrative devices were instituted. A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu. Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life. The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule. Government was all-powerful but responsible and humane. Although the class system was influenced by neo-Confucianism, it was not identical to it. Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model, in Japan, some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite.

Members of the [[samurai]] class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and in cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar-administrators. Another special way of life—''chōnindō''—also emerged. ''[[Chōnindō]]'' ("the way of the townspeople") was a distinct culture that arose in cities such as [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]], and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualities—diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality—while blending [[Shinto]], neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts.

For the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture. Their search for enjoyment became known as ''[[ukiyo]]'' (the floating world), an ideal world of fashion, popular entertainment, and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life.  This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries, many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara. The region was better known for being the center of Edo's developing sense of elegance and refinement. This place of pleasure and luxury became a destination for the elite and wealthy merchants who wished to flaunt their fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longstreet|Longstreet|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their economy relied primarily on the patronage of such individuals in order to sustain itself. For many of those who inhabited and worked in this region maintaining the illusion of grandeur was the only way of supporting their business.

[[File:First Japanese treatise on Western anatomy.jpg|thumb|''[[Kaitai Shinsho]]'', Japan's first treatise on Western [[anatomy]], published in 1774]]

Yoshiwara was home to mostly women who, due to unfortunate circumstances, found themselves working in this secluded environment. Combining factors such as rent, value of their employment contract, cost of clothing, make-up, gift giving, and other expenses ensured that many would spend their entire lives working to pay off their debts. These females were expected to perform dances, sing, play an instrument, gossip or provide companionship so that their guests would come again. As a result, the region developed its own culture which, in turn, determined what would be popular in the rest of the country. This was particularly true for fashion because a woman's identity was determined by her clothing, specifically it clarified what her profession and status was within that field. The quality of her attire ensured that she stood out from the rest of her competition. It was her only means of establishing a reputation and helped to market her talents. However, Yoshiwara also possessed a seedier side. Much of the business conducted here incorporated the use of prostitution as a means to deal with the women's cost of living. As a result, since its establishment was first authorised by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seigle|1993|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; this area became the country's government sanctioned red-light district. This designation lasted for about 250 years.

Professional female entertainers (''[[geisha]]''), music, popular stories, ''[[Kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' (puppet theater), poetry, a rich literature, and art, exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints (known as ''[[ukiyo-e]]''), were all part of this flowering of culture. Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653–1724) and the poet, essayist, and travel writer [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–94).

Matsumura Keibun is one of the most significant painters of this period. His works commonly included realistic depictions of birds, flowers and animals.&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{Harvnb|Birmingham Museum of Art|2010|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', full-colour [[ukiyo-e]] woodblock print, [[Hokusai]], {{circa|1829–32}}]]

[[Ukiyo-e]] is a genre of painting and printmaking that developed in the late 17th century, at first depicting the entertainments of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]] of Edo, such as courtesans and [[kabuki]] actors.  [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] produced the first full-colour ''[[nishiki-e]]'' prints in 1765, a form that has become synonymous to most with ukiyo-e.  The genre reached a peak in technique towards the end of the century with the works of such artists as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]] and [[Utamaro]].  As the Edo period came to an end a great diversity of genres proliferated: warriors, nature, folklore, and the landscapes of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The genre declined throughout the rest of the century in the face of modernization that saw ukiyo-e as both old-fashioned and laborious to produce compared to Western technologies.  Ukiyo-e was a primary part of the wave of [[Japonism]] that swept Western art in the late 19th century.

[[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] were both still important in Tokugawa Japan. [[Buddhism]], together with [[neo-Confucianism]], provided standards of social behavior. Although Buddhism was not as politically powerful as it had been in the past, Buddhism continued to be espoused by the upper classes. Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in 1640 when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple. The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han, villages, wards, and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments. Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community. Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity.

[[File:Plan of edo.jpeg|thumb|Scaled pocket plan of Edo]]

[[Shinto]] eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo-Confucian rationalism and materialism. The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems. Kokugaku contributed to the emperor-centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The [[Kojiki]], [[Nihon Shoki]], and [[Man'yōshū]] were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit. Some purists in the kokugaku movement, such as [[Motoori Norinaga]], even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influences—in effect, foreign influences—for contaminating Japan's ancient ways. Japan was the land of the [[kami]] and, as such, had a special destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment===

The Edo period was characterized by an unprecedented series of economic developments (despite termination of contact with the outside world) and cultural maturation, especially in terms of theater, music, and other entertainment.  For example, a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta-chō was invented during this time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Song, dance, storytelling: aspects of the performing arts in Japan|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=THBuAAAAMAAJ|publisher = China-Japan Program, Cornell University|date = 1978-06-01|language = en|first = Frank|last = Hoff|page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still used today in folk songs.  Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened.  Several different types of [[kabuki]] (theater) emerged.  Some, such as [[shibaraku]], were only available at a certain time of year, while some companies only performed for nobles.  Fashion trends, satirization of local news stories, and advertisements were often part of kabuki theater, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Edo Culture: Daily Life and Diversions in Urban Japan, 1600–1868|last = Nishiyama|first = Matsunosuke|publisher = University of Hawai'i Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 198–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the shogunate==
{{main|Bakumatsu}}

===Decline of the Tokugawa===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Emperor Ninkō]] --&gt;

[[File:OdaibaView.jpg|thumb|right|''Dai-Roku Daiba'' (第六台場) or "No. 6 Battery", one of the original Edo-era battery islands]]
[[File:Shinagawa Baidai cannon.jpg|thumb|One of the cannons of Odaiba, now at the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. 80-pound bronze, bore: 250mm, length: 3830mm]]

The end of this period is specifically called the [[bakumatsu|late Tokugawa shogunate]]. The cause for the end of this period is controversial but is recounted as the forcing of Japan's opening to the world by [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], whose [[Naval fleet|armada]] (known by Japanese as "[[Black Ships|the black ships]]") fired weapons from [[Edo Bay]]. Several [[artificial island|artificial land masses]] were created to block the range of the armada, and this land remains in what is presently called the [[Odaiba]] district.

The Tokugawa did not eventually collapse simply because of intrinsic failures. Foreign intrusions helped to precipitate a complex political struggle between the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'' and a coalition of its critics. The continuity of the anti-''bakufu'' movement in the mid-19th century would finally bring down the Tokugawa. Historians consider that a major contributing factor to the decline of the Tokugawa was "poor management of the central government by the ''shōgun'', which caused the social classes in Japan to fall apart".{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jansen|2002|pp=289–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, the Tokugawa attempted to restrict families' accumulation of wealth and fostered a "back to the soil" policy, in which the farmer, the ultimate producer, was the ideal person in society.

Despite these efforts to restrict wealth and partly because of the extraordinary period of peace, the standard of living for urban and rural dwellers alike grew significantly during the Tokugawa period. Better means of crop production, transport, housing, food, and entertainment were all available, as was more leisure time, at least for urban dwellers. The literacy rate was high for a preindustrial society (by some estimates the literacy rate in the city of Edo was 80 percent), and cultural values were redefined and widely imparted throughout the [[samurai]] and ''[[chōnin]]'' classes. Despite the reappearance of [[guild]]s, economic activities went well beyond the restrictive nature of the guilds, and commerce spread and a money economy developed. Although government heavily restricted the merchants and viewed them as unproductive and usurious members of society, the samurai, who gradually became separated from their rural ties, depended greatly on the merchants and artisans for consumer goods, artistic interests, and [[loan]]s. In this way, a subtle subversion of the warrior class by the ''chōnin'' took place.

A struggle arose in the face of political limitations that the ''shōgun'' imposed on the entrepreneurial class. The government ideal of an [[agrarian society]] failed to square with the reality of commercial distribution. A huge government bureaucracy had evolved, which now stagnated because of its discrepancy with a new and evolving social order. Compounding the situation, the population increased significantly during the first half of the Tokugawa period. Although the magnitude and growth rates are uncertain, there were at least 26 million commoners and about four million members of samurai families and their attendants when the first nationwide census was taken in 1721. Drought, followed by crop shortages and starvation, resulted in twenty great famines between 1675 and 1837. During the Tokugawa period, there were 154 famines, of which 21 were widespread and serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Turkington|first=David|author-link=David Turkington|title=A Chronology of Japanese History|work=Edo Period (1603-1868)|url=http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peasant unrest grew, and by the late 18th century, mass protests over taxes and food shortages had become commonplace. Newly landless families became tenant farmers, while the displaced rural poor moved into the cities. As the fortunes of previously well-to-do families declined, others moved in to accumulate land, and a new, wealthy farming class emerged. Those people who benefited were able to diversify production and to hire laborers, while others were left discontented. Many samurai fell on hard times and were forced into handicraft production and wage jobs for merchants.

Although Japan was able to acquire and refine a wide variety of scientific knowledge, the rapid industrialization of the West during the 18th century created a material gap in terms of technologies and armament between Japan and the West, forcing it to abandon its policy of seclusion and contributing to the end of the Tokugawa regime.

Western intrusions were on the increase in the early 19th century. Russian warships and traders encroached on [[Karafuto]] (called [[Sakhalin]] under Russian and Soviet control) and on the [[Kuril Islands]], the southernmost of which are considered by the Japanese as the northern islands of [[Hokkaidō]]. A British warship entered Nagasaki harbour searching for enemy Dutch ships in 1808, and other warships and [[whaler]]s were seen in Japanese waters with increasing frequency in the 1810s and 1820s. Whalers and trading ships from the United States also arrived on Japan's shores. Although the Japanese made some minor concessions and allowed some landings, they largely attempted to keep all foreigners out, sometimes using force. ''[[Rangaku]]'' became crucial not only in understanding the foreign "[[barbarian]]s" but also in using the knowledge gained from the West to fend them off.
[[File:Edo general.jpg|thumb|General from the late Edo period]]
By the 1830s, there was a general sense of crisis. Famines and [[natural disaster]]s hit hard, and unrest led to a peasant uprising against officials and merchants in Osaka in 1837. Although it lasted only a day, the uprising made a dramatic impression. Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems. The ''shōgun''{{'}}s advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit, more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts, suppression of ''rangaku'', censorship of literature, and elimination of "luxury" in the government and samurai class. Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of ''[[sonnō jōi]]'' (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians), which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions. The ''bakufu'' persevered for the time being amidst growing concerns over Western successes in establishing colonial enclaves in China following the [[First Opium War]] of 1839–1842. More reforms were ordered, especially in the economic sector, to strengthen Japan against the Western threat.

Japan turned down a demand from the United States, which was greatly expanding its own presence in the Asia-Pacific region, to establish [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations when [[James Biddle (commodore)|Commodore James Biddle]] appeared in [[Edo Bay]] with two warships in July 1846.

===End of seclusion===
[[File:Matthew Calbraith Perry.jpg|thumb|[[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Calbraith Perry]]]]
[[File:Commodore Perry expedition LOC LC-USZ62-3319.jpg|thumb|Landing of Commodore Perry, Officers and Men of the Squadron To meet the Imperial Commissioners at ''Kurihama [[Yokosuka]]'' March 8th, 1854]]

When Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853, the bakufu was thrown into turmoil. The chairman of the senior councillors, [[Abe Masahiro]] (1819–1857), was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to [[national security]], Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the ''[[daimyō]]'' who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe decided to compromise by accepting Perry's demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the Treaty of Peace and Amity (or [[Treaty of Kanagawa]]) opened two ports to American ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]], a seaport on the [[Izu Peninsula]], southwest of Edo. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the U.S. and Japan (Harris Treaty), opening still more areas to American trade, was forced on the ''bakufu'' five years later.

The resulting damage to the ''bakufu'' was significant. The devalued price for gold in Japan was one immediate, enormous effect.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European and American traders purchased gold for its original price on the world market and then sold it to the Chinese for triple the price.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p51" /&gt; Along with this, cheap goods from these developed nations, like finished cotton, flooded the market forcing many Japanese out of business.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p51" /&gt; Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the ''bakufu''. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the ''fudai'', had consulted with the ''shinpan'' and ''tozama daimyō'', further undermining the already weakened ''bakufu''. In the [[Ansei Reform]] (1854–1856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, a naval training school with Dutch instructors was set up at Nagasaki, and a Western-style military school was established at Edo; by the next year, the government was translating Western books. Opposition to Abe increased within ''[[fudai]]'' circles, which opposed opening ''bakufu'' councils to ''tozama daimyō'', and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by [[Hotta Masayoshi]] (1810–1864).

At the head of the dissident faction was [[Tokugawa Nariaki]], who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The Mito school—based on neo-Confucian and Shinto principles—had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, the turning back of the West, and the founding of a world empire under the divine [[Yamato dynasty]].

In the final years of the Tokugawas, foreign contacts increased as more concessions were granted. The new treaty with the United States in 1859 allowed more ports to be opened to diplomatic representatives, unsupervised trade at four additional ports, and foreign residences in Osaka and Edo. It also embodied the concept of extraterritoriality (foreigners were subject to the laws of their own countries but not to Japanese law). Hotta lost the support of key ''daimyō'', and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the ''bakufu'', rejected Hotta's request and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan's internal politics for the first time in many centuries. When the ''shōgun'' died without an [[heir]], Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] (or Keiki), for ''shōgun'', a candidate favored by the ''[[shinpan]]'' and ''tozama daimyō''. The ''fudai'' won the power struggle, however, installing Tokugawa Yoshitomi, arresting Nariaki and Keiki, executing [[Yoshida Shōin]] (1830–1859), a leading ''sonnō-jōi'' intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu), and signing treaties with the United States and five other nations, thus ending more than 200 years of exclusion.

Recently{{when|date=November 2016}} some scholars{{who|date=November 2016}} have suggested that there were more events that spurred this opening of Japan. From 1716 to 1745 Yoshimune (eighth Tokugawa ''shōgun'' from 1716–1745) started the first [[Kyōhō reforms]] in an attempt to gain more revenue for the government.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, to 1786 Tanuma Okitsugu also initiated some unorthodox economic reforms to expand government income.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p42" /&gt; This led his conservative opponents to attack him and take his position as he was forced from government in disgrace.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p42" /&gt; Similarly, Matsudaira Sadanobu launched the [[Kansei Reforms]] in 1787–1793 to stabilize rice prices, cut government costs, and increase revenues.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p42" /&gt; The final economic reform of the [[Tenpō]] era of 1841–1843 had similar objectives. Most were ineffective and only worked in some areas. These economic failings would also have been a force in the opening of Japan, as Japanese businessmen desired larger markets. Some scholars also point to internal activism for political change. The Mito school had long been an active force in demanding political changes, such as restoring the powers of the Emperor. This anger can also be seen in the poetry of Matsuo Taseko (a woman who farmed silk worms in the Ina Valley) from Hirata Atsutane's School of National Learning:
&lt;poem&gt;
"It is disgusting
the agitation over thread
In today's world
Ever since the ships
from foreign countries
came for the jeweled
silkworm cocoons
to the land of the gods and the Emperor
Peoples hearts
awesome though they are,
are being pulled apart
and consumed by rage."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired many anti-Tokugawa activists as they blamed the Bakufu for impoverishing the people and dishonoring the emperor.&lt;ref name="Gordon2008p52" /&gt;

===Bakumatsu modernization and conflicts===
{{main|Bakumatsu}}

During the last years of the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'', or ''[[bakumatsu]]'', the ''bakufu'' took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of [[anti-Western sentiment]] throughout the country.

The army and the navy were modernized. A naval training school was established in [[Nagasaki]] in 1855. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as [[Yokosuka]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Japanese navy of the ''shōgun'' already possessed eight Western-style steam warships around the flagship [[Japanese battleship Kaiyo Maru|''Kaiyō Maru'']], which were used against pro-imperial forces during the [[Boshin War]] under the command of Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. A [[Jules Brunet|French military mission]] was established to help modernize the armies of the ''bakufu''.

Revering the emperor as a symbol of unity, extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners. Foreign naval retaliation in the [[Anglo-Satsuma War]] led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in 1865, but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties. A ''bakufu'' army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Chōshū Domain]]s in 1866. Finally, in 1867, [[Emperor Kōmei]] died and was succeeded by his underaged son [[Emperor Meiji]].

[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and ''shōgun''. He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the ''shōgun''{{'}}s leadership role. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Chōshū ''daimyō'', other ''daimyō'' called for returning the ''shōgun''{{'}}s political power to the emperor and a council of ''daimyō'' chaired by the former Tokugawa ''shōgun''. Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late 1867 and resigned, announcing an "imperial restoration". The Satsuma, Chōshū, and other ''han'' leaders and radical courtiers, however, [[rebellion|rebelled]], seized the [[Japanese imperial palace|imperial palace]], and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868.

Following the [[Boshin War]] (1868–1869), the ''bakufu'' was abolished, and Yoshinobu was reduced to the ranks of the common ''daimyō''. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the ''bakufu'' [[navy|naval forces]] under Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] continued to hold out for another six months in [[Hokkaidō]], where they founded the short-lived [[Republic of Ezo]].

'''Ernest Favenc''' (21 October 1845&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |last=Gibbney |first=H.J. |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040169b.htm |title=Favenc, Ernest (1845 - 1908) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 4 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press]] |year=1972 |page=160 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 14 November 1908) was an explorer of [[Australia]], a [[journalist]] and historian.

==Personal life==
Favenc was born in [[Walworth]], [[Surrey]], [[England]]. Of [[Huguenot]] descent, he was the son of Abraham George Favenc, merchant, and his wife Emma, née Jones. He was educated at the Werdersches Gymnasium, [[Berlin]] and at Temple College, [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]], [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

Favenc arrived in [[New South Wales]] in 1864,&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; and, after being in the colony for about a year, in a commercial position, he afterwards worked in the pastoral industry in the frontier squatting districts of [[Queensland]].

Favenc died at his Darlinghurst home in Sydney on 14 November 1908, and was survived by his wife and family.&lt;ref name=smh_obituary&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=16 November 1908 |title=Ernest Favenc |page=6 |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15024159 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploration ==
In July 1878 he was selected to explore the country along the western border of Queensland to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] to evaluate the possibility of connecting the Queensland Railways to Port Darwin. The journey took him six months, and he reported that such a line would be feasible.&lt;ref name=smh_obituary/&gt;

In the early 1880s he also undertook expeditions in the country to the south of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] and the north-west of [[Western Australia]].

==Writing==
Favenc's first publication was ''The Great Austral Plain'' in 1887, ''The Last of Six: Tales of the Austral Tropics'' appeared in 1893, followed by ''The Secret of the Australian Desert'' (a short novel) in 1895, ''Marooned on Australia'' and ''The Moccasins of Silence'', both in 1896.

Favenc also wrote under the pseudonym of "Dramingo", often for ''[[The Queenslander]]'', and was an accomplished pencil sketcher. He also published romances, children's stories and verse as well as several books on exploration, the most extensive being ''The History of Australian Exploration from 1788 to 1888''.

On the original launch of this book in 1888 the Sydney, Australia ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' reported...

{{cquote|The History of Australian Exploration'' is an important one and however diverse may have been the aims, ideas and successes of those by whom the work was done,...Ernest Favenc's rather formidable volume...gathers together all those scattered memorials merging it into a unity of a great labour. Favenc was himself an explorer and treats his subject not in a perfunctory way, but as one who feels the wild charm and the magical attraction of the unknown...}}

'''''Exposito in Matthaeum Evangelistam''''' ("Commentary on the [[Gospel of Matthew]]") is a work by the ninth-century [[Benedictine]] monk [[Christian of Stavelot]]. As its name implies, it is a commentary on the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. In the preface, Christian promised to produce commentaries on the other gospels, but wrote only two brief works on the [[Gospel of John]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]], neither of which is as comprehensive or complete.

The traditional date given for the composition of this work is 864; however, some scholars have questioned this and maintained that Christian actually lived decades earlier.{{ref|date}} Multiple editions have survived of Christian's commentary on Matthew, some of which were likely edited by later writers to conform with their own views. Of particular interest to, and considerable debate among, modern scholars is Christian's view of the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]]. As Philip Schaff noted:

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Curiously enough, his exact language upon this interesting point cannot be now determined beyond peradventure, because every copy of the first printed edition prepared by [[Wimphelin de Schelestadt]], Strassburg 1514, has perished, and in the MS. in possession of the Cordelier Fathers at [[Lyon]] the critical passage reads differently from that in the second edition, by the Lutheran, [[Johannes Secerius]], Hagenau 1530. In the Secerius text, now printed in the Lyon edition of the Fathers, and in [[Migne]], the words are, 26:26, “''Hoc est corpus meum. Id est, in sacramento''” (“This is my body. That is, in the sacrament,” or the sacramental sign as distinct from the res sacramenti, or the substance represented). Matt. 26:28, ''Transferens spiritaliter corpus in panem, vinum in sanguinem'' (“Transferring spiritually body into bread, wine into blood”). In the MS. the first passage reads: “''Id est, vere in sacramento subsistens''” (“That is, truly subsisting in the sacrament”); and in the second the word “''spiritaliter''“ is omitted. The [[Roman Catholic]]s now generally admit the correctness of the printed text, and that the MS. has been tampered with, but insist that Druthmar is not opposed to the Catholic doctrine on the Eucharist.{{ref|Schaff}}&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

Christian's writings have also attracted the interest of scholars of [[Jewish history]]. A tantalizing reference exists in Christian's work to the conversion of the [[Khazars]] to [[Judaism]], believed to have occurred in the late eighth or early ninth centuries:

:''At the present time we know of no nation under the heavens where Christians do not live. For [Christians are even found] in the lands of [[Gog and Magog]] -- who are a [[Hun]]nic race and are called Gazari (Khazars) [they are] circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism. The [[Bulgars]], however, who are of the same seven tribes [as the Khazars], are now becoming [[baptized]] [into Christianity].''{{ref|quote}}

==Family history representations==
Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example as a [[pedigree chart|pedigree]] or '''{{visible anchor|ancestry chart}}'''. Family trees are often presented with the oldest generations at the top and the newer generations at the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an individual, will more closely resemble a tree in shape, being wider at the top than the bottom. In some ancestry charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear to the right. A descendancy chart, which depicts all the descendants of an individual will be narrowest at the top.

Family trees can have many themes. One might encompass all direct descendants of a single figure, or all known ancestors of a living person. Another might include all members of a particular surname (e.g. male-line descendants). Yet another approach is to construct a tree including all holders of a certain office, such as [[Kings of Germany family tree|kings of Germany]]. This relies on [[Royal intermarriage|dynastic marriage]] to hold together the links between dynasties.

The image of the tree probably originated with one in medieval art of the [[Tree of Jesse]],&lt;ref&gt;Simon Julian Gilmour (2000) ''Daz Sint Noch Ungelogeniu Wort: A Literary and Linguistic Commentary on the Gurnemanz Episode in Book III of Wolfram's Parzival''. Universitätsverlag Winter, 2000. p.64&lt;/ref&gt; used to illustrate the [[Genealogy of Christ]] in terms of a prophecy of [[Isaiah]] (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-Biblical use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods in [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Genealogia deorum gentilium]]'' ("On the Genealogy of the Gods of the Gentiles"), whose first version dates to 1360.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Fan chart===
One technique is a "fan chart", which features a half circle chart with concentric rings: the person of interest is the inner circle, the second circle is divided in two (each side is one parent), the third circle is divided in four, and so forth. Fan charts depict paternal and maternal ancestors.

==Graph theory==
While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in general form a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] in the sense of [[graph theory]], since distant relatives can mate, so a person can have a common ancestor on their mother's and father's side. However, because a parent must be born before their child is born, a person cannot be their own ancestor, and thus there are no loops, so ancestry forms a [[directed acyclic graph]].

The graphs of [[matrilineal]] descent ("mother" relationships between women) and [[patrilineal]] descent ("father" relationships between men) are trees however.

Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry chart is a [[perfect binary tree]], as each person has exactly one mother and one father, for two parents; these thus have a regular structure. A descendancy chart, on the other hand, does not in general have a regular structure, as a person can have any number of children, or none at all.

==Notable examples==
The longest family tree in the world [[Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent|is that of]] the Chinese philosopher and educator [[Confucius]] (551–479 BC), and he is the descendant of [[Tang of Shang|King Tang]] (1675–1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him, and includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was printed in September 2009 by the [[Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee]], to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese thinker. This latest edition is expected to include some 1.3 million living members who are scattered around the world today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-02/16/content_6460522.htm Confucius family tree has two million members] from ''[[China Daily]]'', unknown date, updated February 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There are extensive genealogies for the ruling dynasties of China, but these do not form a single, unified family tree; and it is unclear at which point(s) the most ancient historical figures named become mythological.

In Japan, the ancestry of the [[Imperial family of Japan|Imperial Family]] is traced back to the mythological origins of Japan.  The connection to persons from the established historical record begins in the mid-first millennium AD.

Another very old and extensive tree is that of the [[Lurie]] lineage—which includes [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Martin Buber]]—and traces back to Jehiel Lurie, a 13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to [[Rashi]] and purportedly back to the legendary [[King David]], as documented by Neil Rosenstein in his book ''The Lurie Legacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lurie Legacy: The House of Davidic Royal Descent |author=Neil Rosenstein, Ranan R. Lurie |isbn=978-1-886223-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' recorded the Lurie family in the "longest lineage" category as oldest-known living family in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=JTA |author=Bill Gladstone |date=October 24, 2004 |url=http://www.jta.org/2004/10/24/life-religion/features/the-oldest-family-in-the-world |title=The oldest family in the world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent from the House of David; covering a period of approximately 1000 years. 

In the Torah and Old Testament, genealogies are provided for many biblical persons, including a record of the descendants of Adam. 

According to the Torah, the [[Kohanim]] are decended from [[Aaron]].  Genetic testing performed at the [[Technion]] has shown that modern Kohanim share common Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the Kohanim.

In the Islamic world, claimed descent from the prophet [[Mohammed]] greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders.  New dynasties often used claims of such descent to help establish their legitimacy. 

In Europe, the pedigree of [[Niall Noígíallach]] would be a contender for the longest, through [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 123 AD){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}; in the legendary history of Ireland he is further descended from [[Breogán]], and ultimately from Adam, through the sons of Noah.  Many noble and aristocratic families of European and West-Asian origin can reliably trace their ancestry back as far as the mid to late first millennium AD; some claiming undocumented descent from Classical Antiquity or mythological ancestors.

Before the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], in the [[Greco-Roman]] world, some reliable pedigrees dated back perhaps at least as far as the first half of the first millennium BC; with claimed or mythological origins reaching back further.  [[ancient rome|Roman]] clan and family lineages played an important part in the structure of their society, and were the basis of their intricate system of personal names.  However, there was a break in the continuity of records-keeping at the end of [[Classical Antiquity]].  Records of the lines of succession of the [[Pope]]s and the Eastern Roman Emperors through this transitional period have survived, but these are not continuous genealogical histories of single families.

In Africa, the ruling dynasty of Ethiopia claimed descent from [[King Solomon]] via the [[Queen of Sheba]].

The genealogy of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian ruling dynasties was recorded from the beginnings of the Pharaonic era circa 3000 BC, to the end of the [[Ptolomaic dynasty|Ptolomaic Kingdom]]; although this is not a record of one continuously-linked family lineage, and surviving records are incomplete.

In some pre-contact [[Native American civilizations]], genealogical records of ruling and priestly families were kept, some of which extended over at least several centuries. 

In many human cultures [[clan]] and [[tribal]] associations are based on claims of common ancestry; although detailed documentation of those origins is often very limited.

The '''GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast''' ('''MOAB''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|æ|b}}, commonly known as "'''Mother of All Bombs'''") is a large-yield bomb, developed for the United States military by Albert L. Weimorts, Jr. of the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/27/local/me-passings27.3 |title=Albert L. Weimorts Jr. 67; Engineer Created 'Bunker Buster' Bombs |agency=Times Wire Services |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=27 December 2005 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of development, it was said to be the most powerful non-[[nuclear weapon]] in the American arsenal.&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/moab.htm |title=GBU-43/B "Mother Of All Bombs" / Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Globalsecurity.org |access-date=26 March 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bomb is designed to be delivered by a [[C-130 Hercules]], primarily the [[MC-130|MC-130E Combat Talon I]] or [[MC-130|MC-130H Combat Talon II]] variants.

The MOAB was first dropped in combat in the [[2017 Nangarhar airstrike|13 April 2017 airstrike]] against an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province]] (ISIS) tunnel complex in [[Achin District]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="CooperMashal" /&gt;

[[File:MOABtest.jpg|thumb|right|Prototype MOAB an instant before impact on Eglin AFB's Range 70]]

The basic principle resembles that of the [[BLU-82]] ''Daisy Cutter'', which was used to clear heavily wooded areas in the [[Vietnam War]]. Decades later, the BLU-82 was used in Afghanistan in November 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/07/afghanistan.terrorism6 |title=Taliban hit by bombs used in Vietnam |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |date=6 November 2001 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the Taliban.  Its success as a weapon of intimidation led to the decision to develop the MOAB. Pentagon officials suggested MOAB might be used as an [[anti-personnel weapon]], as part of the "[[shock and awe]]" strategy integral to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/206160/enter-moab-mackubin-thomas-owens |title=Enter Moab |last=Owens |first=Mackubin Thomas |year=2003 |magazine=[[National Review Online]] |access-date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GBU-43s are delivered from [[C-130]] cargo aircraft, inside which they are carried on cradles resting on airdrop platforms. The bombs are dropped by deploying drogue parachutes, which also extract the cradle and platform from the aircraft. Shortly after launch, the drogues are released and bombs fall unretarded, without the use of a retarding parachute. [[GPS]] satellite-guidance is used to guide bombs to their targets.&lt;ref name=gs/&gt;

The MOAB is not a [[Penetration (weapons)|penetrator weapon]] and is primarily an [[air burst]] ordnance intended for soft to medium surface targets covering extended areas and targets in a contained environment such as a deep canyon or within a [[cave system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.defensenews.com/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-mother-of-all-bombs |title=What you need to know about the 'Mother of All Bombs' |last=Insinna |first=Valerie |year=2017 |magazine=[[Defense News]] |access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; High altitude [[Carpet bomb|carpet-bombing]] with much smaller {{convert|500|to|2000|lb|order=flip|adj = on}} bombs delivered via heavy bombers such as the [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]], [[B-2 Spirit|B-2]], or the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1]] is also highly effective at covering large areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/weapons/l/aabombs4.htm |title=United States Military Weapons of War |accessdate=9 December 2007 |date=2007 |website=About.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917185011/http://usmilitary.about.com/od/weapons/l/aabombs4.htm |archivedate=17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOAB is designed to be used against a specific target, and cannot by itself replicate the effects of a typical heavy bomber mission. During the [[Vietnam War]]'s [[Operation Arc Light]] program, for example, the [[United States Air Force]] sent [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]s on well over 10,000 bombing raids, each usually carried out by two groups of three aircraft. A typical mission dropped 168 tons of ordnance, pounding an area 1.5 by 0.5 miles with an explosive force equivalent to 10 to 17 MOABs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.americanwarlibrary.com/vietnam/vwb52.htm |title=B-52 Mission, Totals By Year/Month |accessdate=18 April 2017 |year=2017 |website=American War Library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stratofortress.org/history.htm |title=The Story of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress |accessdate=18 April 2017 |year=2017 |website=B-52 Stratofortress Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.103fieldbatteryraa.net/documents/74.html |title=General Statistics Vietnam War |accessdate=18 April 2017 |year=2017 |website=103 Field Battery RAA.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOAB was first tested with the explosive [[tritonal]] on 11 March 2003, on Range 70 located at [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in [[Florida]]. It was tested again on 21 November 2003.&lt;ref name=gs/&gt;

Since 2003, 15 MOABs have been manufactured at the [[McAlester Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[McAlester, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Dekker |url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/made-in-oklahoma-mother-of-all-bombs-dropped-in-afghanistan/article_751c643e-f92c-58ae-8b44-a6a6429948c7.html |title=Made in Oklahoma: 'Mother of all bombs' dropped in Afghanistan could have come from McAlester |newspaper=[[Tulsa World]] |date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcalister"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lord |first1=Debbie |title=What is the 'mother of all bombs', and what does it do? |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-military/what-the-mother-all-bombs-and-what-does/MIfXaYYaPyCaraZNF4UOcK/ |accessdate=16 April 2017 |newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Force has said the MOAB has a unit price of $170,000, but this is a historical unit cost made in the mid-2000s and various factors of the bomb's atypical development process have made exact cost estimation difficult. The [[Air Force Research Lab]] generated the value based on already existing parts such as bomb casing and metals, and since the bomb was built in-house by the service they did not pay for outside research or have standard procurement costs associated with it. MOAB was a "crash project" developed for use against an adversary with uncertain tactics on unfamiliar terrain, and so was an effort to meet an urgent need not a formal program. Should more bombs be ordered to be built, manufacturing would likely be started over with higher costs due to a lack of old parts, price inflation, and new design and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/04/22/after-us-drops-frankenbomb-on-afghanistan-questions-linger.html |title=After US Drops 'Frankenbomb' on Afghanistan, Questions Linger |first=Oriana |last=Pawlyk |website=Military.com |date=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar weapons==
During [[World War II]], [[RAF Bomber Command|Royal Air Force Bomber Command]] used the [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]], officially known as the "Bomb, Medium Capacity, 22,000 lb" 42 times. At 22,000 lbs total weight, these [[earthquake bomb]]s were technically larger than the MOAB. However, half their weight was due to the cast iron casing necessary for penetrating the ground (up to 40 m) before exploding. The MOAB, in contrast, has a light 2,900 lb aluminum casing surrounding {{convert|18,700| lb|abbr=on}} of explosive [[Composition H-6]] material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justsecurity.org/40022/the-mother-bombs-understanding-massive-ordnance-air-blast-weapon/ |title='The Mother of All Bombs': Understanding the Massive Ordnance Air Blast Weapon |last1=Schmitt |first1=Michael |last2=Barker |first2=Peter |website=Just Security.org |accessdate=April 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Air Force]]'s [[T-12 Cloudmaker]] 44,000-pound demolition bomb (similar in design to the Grand Slam), developed after [[World War II]], carried a heavier explosive charge than the MOAB, but was never used in combat.

In 2007, the Russian military announced that they had tested a [[thermobaric weapon]] nicknamed the "[[Father of All Bombs]]" ("FOAB").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.belairdaily.com/father-of-all-bombs/6372.html |title=Trump Dropped Mother of All Bombs. But He Wasn’t Expecting Russia to do This |website=Bel Air Daily |language=en-US |access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weapon is claimed to be four times as powerful as the MOAB.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2167175,00.html |title=Russia unveils the 'father of all bombs' |first=Luke |last=Harding |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 September 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; But its specifications are widely disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/russian-bomb-claims-questionable-expert-says/a-2782398-1 |title=Russian Bomb Claims Questionable, Expert Says |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2007/10/russian-father/ |title=Russian "Father of All Bombs" = Fake? |website=Wired |date=10 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOAB is the most powerful conventional bomb ever used in combat as measured by the weight of its explosive material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/news/a26055/us-air-force-drops-moab-isis/ |title=U.S. Air Force Drops the Largest Conventional Bomb Ever Used in Combat |magazine=Popular Mechanics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/13/us-drops-largest-non-nuclear-bomb-ever-in-afghanistan.html |title=US drops largest non-nuclear bomb ever in Afghanistan |website=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosive yield is comparable to that of the smallest [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, such as the [[Cold War]]-era American M-388 projectile fired by the portable [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett]] recoilless gun. The M-388, a [[W54]] nuclear warhead variant, weighed less than 60 pounds. At the projectile's lowest yield setting of 10 tons, roughly equivalent to a single MOAB, its explosive force was only 1/144,000th (0.0007%) that of the Air Force's 1.44-megaton [[W49]] warhead, a nuclear weapon commonly found on American [[ICBM]]s from the early 1960s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3496">The '''Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust''' is an [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Trust organisation established in 1975 as part of the [[Welsh Archaeological Trusts]].

The Trust is a charitable company (Registered in Wales, No: 1276976; Registered Charity No. 505609)whose principal objective is to educate the public in archaeology which it achieves by such diverse means as are allowed in its Articles and Memorandum of Association.

It owns, maintains and continually enhances the Regional Historic [[Built environment|Environment]] Record, which includes information on more than 25,000 known archaeological and historic sites and monuments and is a prime tool for education and research. 

The Trust provides an archaeological planning service jointly funded by the Unitary Authorities and [[Cadw]], Currently more than 22,000 planning applications are checked each year for implications to the Historic Environment. Actions are advised to ensure that proper assessments are carried out and appropriate measures implemented to ensure that Historic [[Built environment|Environment]] interests are protected. As a result of potential conflicts of interest this area of work is separately staffed and funded and governed by a Code of Conduct approved by Cadw.

The Trust also provides general advice through its Heritage Management Services to a variety of institutions and organisations including the Forestry Authority, CCW, Statutory Undertakers, the [[Environment Agency]], [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and the Church in Wales. The Trust is also a reporting station for the Portable Antiquities scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaeology.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=498&amp;Itemid=39 www.archaeology.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust through its Projects teams undertakes assessments, evaluations, surveys, watching-briefs, building recording and excavations in South Wales and elsewhere. It has had extensive involvement with many major developments in the area. In addition Projects staff carry out area wide monument assessment and [[historic landscape characterisation]] works with the intention of improving the information and evidence base to support enhanced protection of the historic environment.

The Trust has also contributed to developing research agendas through publication of its work. It promotes knowledge and learning about the past through publication, displays, leaflets, lectures and talks and seeks to involve the community of southeast Wales in its work.

The Trust is registered as an approved organisation with the [[Institute of Field Archaeologists]] (no 15) and requires all employees, whether corporate members of the Institute or not, to adhere to the Institute's Codes and Standards as a condition of employment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1172">'''Hieronymus Pez''' (24 February 1685 &amp;ndash; 14 October 1762) was an Austrian [[Benedictine]] librarian and historian.

Pez was born at [[Ybbs]].  In 1703 he entered the [[novitiate]] at [[Melk Abbey]], and was [[ordained]] in 1711. He became assistant to his brother [[Bernhard Pez]], after whose death he became librarian.  He remained at Melk until his own death.

Hieronymus Pez was also member of the first [[learned society]] in Habsburg Monarchy, the [[Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis]], which was publishing the first scientific journal of the monarchy, to which Pez was also contributing.

==Works==

His principal works are: 

*"Scriptores rerum Austriacarum", 1721–45, in three volumes, a collection of over one hundred sources for Austrian history; 
*"Acta S. Colomanni" (1713); 
*"History of St. Leopold" (1746).

'''Historiography''' is the study of the methods of [[historian]]s in developing history as an academic discipline, and by extension is any body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches. Scholars discuss historiography by topic&amp;nbsp;– such as the "[[historiography of the United Kingdom]]", the "[[historiography of Canada]]", "[[historiography of the British Empire]]", the "[[historiography of early Islam]]", the "[[Chinese historiography|historiography of China]]"&amp;nbsp;– and different approaches and genres, such as [[political history]] and [[social history]]. Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the ascent of [[academic history]], there developed a body of historiographic literature. The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties&amp;nbsp;– such as [[Historiography and nationalism|to their nation state]]&amp;nbsp;– is a debated question.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Ferro, ''The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The research interests of historians change over time, and there has been a shift away from traditional diplomatic, economic, and political history toward newer approaches, especially social and [[Postcolonialism|cultural studies]]. From 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history increased from 31 to 41 percent, while the proportion of political historians decreased from 40 to 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on the number of full-time professors in U.S. history departments. [[Stephen H. Haber]], David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations", ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34–43 at p. 42 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, of 5,723 faculty in the departments of history at British universities, 1,644 (29%) identified themselves with social history and 1,425 (25%) identified themselves with political history.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html "Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007&amp;nbsp;– listed by research interest"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=2006-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In the [[early modern period]], the term ''historiography'' meant "the writing of history", and ''historiographer'' meant "[[historian]]". In that sense certain [[Official history|official historians]] were given the title "[[Historiographer Royal]]" in [[Rikshistoriograf|Sweden]] (from 1618), [[Historiographer Royal (England)|England]] (from 1660), and [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Scotland]] (from 1681). The Scottish post is still in existence.

Historiography was more recently defined as "the study of the way history has been and is written&amp;nbsp;– the history of historical writing", which means that, "When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians."&lt;ref&gt;(''The Methods and Skills of History: A Practical Guide'', 1988, p. 223, {{ISBN|0-88295-982-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
{{see|Ancient history}}
Understanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the "telling of history" has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. 
What constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]).{{weasel-inline|date=January 2018}}

The earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], though no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name. 
By contrast, the term "historiography" is taken to refer to written history recorded in a narrative format for the purpose of informing future generations about events. In this limited sense, "ancient history" begins with the early historiography of [[Classical Antiquity]], in about the 5th century BCE.

{{Main article|Chinese historiography|Twenty-Four Histories}}
{{further information|Chinese literature}}
[[File:Shiji.jpg|upright|thumb|First page of the ''[[Shiji]]''.]]

One of the Confucian [[Five Classics]], the ''Shang Shu'' 尚書, has conventionally been given the English title ''[[Classic of History]]''. This terminology is misleading as the book is a collection of speeches and anecdotes about ancient worthies, which while arranged in rough chronological order lacks any attempt to integrate them into a coherent narrative or indicate exactly how much time has passed between two incidents. The purpose of the book is less about recording history and more about imparting moral lessons.
  
The first true history of China is therefore the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|BCE}}. It is among the earliest surviving historical texts to be arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles in the world, and was traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE). A "commentary" on the Spring and Autumn, the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the {{annum|5th century|BCE}}, is considered the earliest work of narrative history in the world, covering the period from {{annum|722 to 468|BCE}}. It is many times longer and much more detailed and vivid than the laconic text it is purportedly commenting on, so that it is commonly regarded as a work of history in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D.R. Woolf, ed.|title=A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHK3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA990|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=990|isbn=9781134819980}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Just as the Spring and Autumn annals has lent their name to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] they cover, the following [[Warring States period]] is named after the book ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Intrigues of the Warring States]]'', compiled between the {{annum|3rd and 1st centuries|BCE}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xing Lu|title=Rhetoric in Ancient China, Fifth to Third Century, B.C.E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72QURrAppzkC&amp;pg=PA118|year=1998|pages=117–18|isbn=9781570032165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Annals, the Intrigues lack any chronological apparatus and is more of a return to the editorial style of the Classic of History. The purpose of the work is rather to teach the reader useful diplomatic and strategic skills rather than provide a coherent narrative of the period.

The Han dynasty eunuch [[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|BCE}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work pioneered the "Annals-biography" format, which would become the standard for prestige history writing in China. In this genre a history opens with a chronological outline of court affairs, and then continues with detailed biographies of prominent people who lived during the period in question.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Martin, ''Herodotus and Sima Qian: The First Great Historians of Greece and China: A Brief History with Documents'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Sima's had been a universal history from the beginning of time down to the time of writing, his successor [[Ban Gu]] wrote an annals-biography history limiting its coverage to only the [[Western Han dynasty]], the [[Book of Han]] (96 CE). This established the notion of using dynastic boundaries as start- and end-points, and most later Chinese histories would focus on a single dynasty or group of dynasties.

The Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han were eventually joined by the [[Book of the Later Han]] (488 CE) (replacing the earlier, and now only partially extant, Han Records from the Eastern Pavilion) and the [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] (297 CE) to form the "Four Histories". These became mandatory reading for the [[Imperial Examinations]] and have therefore exerted an influence on Chinese culture comparable to the [[Thirteen_Classics|Confucian Classics]]. More annals-biography histories were written in subsequent dynasties, eventually bringing the number to between twenty-four and twenty-six, but none ever reached the popularity and impact of the first four.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson 2018, pp. 692-695&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Chinese historiography describes history in terms of [[dynastic cycle]]s. In this view, each new dynasty is founded by a morally righteous founder. Over time, the dynasty becomes morally corrupt and dissolute. Eventually, the dynasty becomes so weak as to allow its replacement by a new dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jörn Rüsen|title=Time and History: The Variety of Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvGyzu-nLaUC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-349-7|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 281 CE the tomb of [[King Xiang of Wei]] (d. 296 BC) was opened, inside of which was found a historical text called the [[Bamboo Annals]], after the writing material. It is similar in style to the Spring and Autumn Annals and covers the time from the [[Yellow Emperor]] to 299 BC. Opinions on the authenticity of the text has varied throughout the centuries, and in any event it was re-discovered too late to gain anything like the same status as the Spring and Autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Endymion. (2018). Chinese History: A New Manual. Self-published. P. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thucydides Manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Reproduction of part of a tenth-century copy of [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.]]

The earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], a development which would be an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around [[History of the Mediterranean region|the Mediterranean]] region. Greek historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484–425 BCE) who became known as the "father of history".&lt;ref&gt;John L. Myres, ''Herodotus, Father of History'' (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various Mediterranean cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events.

[[File:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Bust of Thucydides, Hellenistic copy of a 4th-century BC work]]

The generation following Herodotus witnessed a spate of local histories of the individual [[city-state]]s (''[[polis|poleis]]''), written by the first of the [[Local history|local historians]] who employed the written archives of city and sanctuary. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] characterized these historians as the forerunners of Thucydides,&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, ''On Thucydides'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and these local histories continued to be written into [[Late Antiquity]], as long as the city-states survived. Two early figures stand out: [[Hippias of Elis]], who produced the lists of winners in the Olympic Games that provided the basic chronological framework as long as the pagan classical tradition lasted, and [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], who compiled more than two dozen histories from civic records, all of them now lost.

[[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}}&amp;nbsp;– {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''.

The proverbial [[Philippic]] attacks of the Athenian orator [[Demosthenes]] ({{annum|384–322|BCE}}) on [[Philip&amp;nbsp;II of Macedon]] marked the height of ancient political agitation. The now lost history of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] campaigns by the [[diadoch]] [[Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;I]] ({{annum|367–283|BCE}}) may represent the first historical work composed by a ruler. [[Polybius]] ({{c.|lk=no|203}}&amp;nbsp;– {{annum|120|BCE}}) wrote on the rise of Rome to world prominence, and attempted to harmonize the Greek and Roman points of view.

The [[Chaldea]]n priest [[Berossus]] ({{annum|{{floruit|3rd century}}|BCE}}) composed a Greek-language ''History of [[Babylonia]]'' for the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus&amp;nbsp;I]], combining [[Hellenistic]] methods of historiography and [[Mesopotamia]]n accounts to form a unique composite. Reports exist of other near-eastern histories, such as that of the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]]; but he is considered semi-legendary and writings attributed to him are fragmentary, known only through the later historians [[Philo of Byblos]] and [[Eusebius]], who asserted that he wrote before even the [[Trojan war]].

[[Ancient Romans|The Romans]] adopted the Greek tradition, writing at first in Greek, but eventually chronicling their history in a freshly non-Greek language. While early [[Roman literature|Roman works]] were still written in Greek, the ''Origines'', composed by the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] ({{annum|234–149|BCE}}), was written in Latin, in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence. It marked the beginning of Latin historical writings. Hailed for its lucid style, [[Julius Caesar]]'s ({{annum|100–44|BCE}}) ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|de Bello Gallico]]'' exemplifies autobiographical war coverage. The politician and orator [[Cicero]] ({{annum|106–43|BCE}}) introduced rhetorical elements in his political writings.

[[Strabo]] ({{annum|63|BCE}}&amp;nbsp;– {{annum|{{c.|lk=no|24}}|[[Common Era|CE]]}}) was an important exponent of the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. [[Livy]] ({{annum|59|BCE}}&amp;nbsp;– {{annum|17|CE}}) records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from [[city-state]] to [[empire]]. His speculation about what would have happened if [[Alexander the Great]] had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of [[alternate history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |title=Livy's History of Rome: Book 9 |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biography, although popular throughout antiquity, was introduced as a branch of history by the works of [[Plutarch]] ({{c.|lk=no|46}}&amp;nbsp;– {{annum|127|CE}}) and [[Suetonius]] ({{c.|lk=no|69}}&amp;nbsp;– after {{annum|130|CE}}) who described the deeds and characters of ancient personalities, stressing their human side. [[Tacitus]] ({{annum|{{c.|lk=no|56|117}}|CE}}) denounces Roman immorality by praising [[Germanic peoples|German]] virtues, elaborating on the [[topos]] of the [[Noble savage]].

Christian historiography began early, perhaps as early as [[Luke-Acts]], which is the [[primary source]] for the [[Apostolic Age]], though its [[Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles|historical reliability is disputed]]. In the [[Early Christianity|first Christian centuries]], the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon was developed]]. The [[Early centers of Christianity|growth of Christianity]] and its enhanced status in the Roman Empire after [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine&amp;nbsp;I]] (see [[State church of the Roman Empire]]) led to the development of a distinct Christian historiography, influenced by both [[Christian theology]] and the nature of the [[Christian Bible]], encompassing new areas of study and views of history.  The central role of the Bible in Christianity is reflected in the preference of Christian historians for written sources, compared to the classical historians' preference for oral sources and is also reflected in the inclusion of politically unimportant people. Christian historians also focused on development of religion and society.  This can be seen in the extensive inclusion of written sources in the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' written by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] around 324 and in the subjects it covers.&lt;ref name="sxixkf"&gt;[http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html ''Historiography''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018032745/http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html |date=2007-10-18 }}, Concordia University Wisconsin , retrieved on 2 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian theology considered time as linear, progressing according to divine plan.  As God's plan encompassed everyone, Christian histories in this period had a universal approach. For example, Christian writers often included summaries of important historical events prior to the period covered by the work.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, John (1998). ''The past and its presenters: an introduction to issues in historiography'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, {{ISBN|0-340-67934-4}}, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the [[Middle Ages]]. They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, that of the Church and that of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers.  In the [[early medieval|Early Middle Ages]] historical writing often took the form of [[annals]] or [[chronicle]]s recording events year by year, but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, John (1998). ''The past and its presenters: an introduction to issues in historiography'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, {{ISBN|0-340-67934-4}}, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type of writing is the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which was the work of several different writers: it was started during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] in the late 9th&amp;nbsp;century, but one copy was still being updated in 1154.  Some writers in the period did construct a more [[narrative]] form of history. These included [[Gregory of Tours]] and more successfully [[Bede]], who wrote both [[secular]] and [[ecclesiastical]] history and who is known for writing the ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''.&lt;ref name = "sxixkf"/&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').

===Islamic world===
{{See also|Historiography of early Islam|Muqaddimah|Muslim historians}}

[[Muslim]] historical writings first began to develop in the 7th century, with the reconstruction of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s life in the centuries following his death. With numerous conflicting narratives regarding Muhammad and his [[Sahaba|companions]] from various sources, it was necessary to verify which sources were more reliable. In order to evaluate these sources, various methodologies were developed, such as the "[[Ilm ar-Rijal|science of biography]]", "[[science of hadith]]" and "[[Isnad]]" (chain of transmission). These methodologies were later applied to other historical figures in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. Famous historians in this tradition include [[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwah]] (d.&amp;nbsp;712), [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (d.&amp;nbsp;728), [[Ibn Ishaq]] (d.&amp;nbsp;761), [[al-Waqidi]] (745–822), [[Ibn Hisham]] (d.&amp;nbsp;834), [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] (810–870) and [[Ibn Hajar Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]] (1372–1449).&lt;ref&gt;Chase F.

S. Khan (1976). "al-Biruni and the Political History of India", ''Oriens'' '''25''', pp. 86–115.&lt;/ref&gt;
Islamic historical writing eventually culminated in the works of the Arab Muslim historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406), who published his historiographical studies in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (translated as ''Prolegomena'') and ''Kitab al-I'bar'' (''Book of Advice'').&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, Tarif.

===East Asia===
====Japan====
{{main article|Historiography of Japan}}
{{further information|Japanese literature}}
The earliest works of history produced in Japan were the ''[[Rikkokushi]]'', a corpus of six national histories covering the history of Japan from its mythological beginnings until the 9th century. The first of these works were the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', compiled by [[Prince Toneri]] in 720.

====Korea====
{{main article|Historiography of Korea}}
{{further information|Korean literature}}
The tradition of Korean historiography was established with the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', a history of Korea from its allegedly earliest times. It was compiled by [[Goryeo]] court historian [[Kim Busik]] after its commission by King [[Injong of Goryeo]] (r. 1122 – 1146). It was completed in 1145 and relied not only on earlier Chinese histories for source material, but also on the ''[[Hwarang Segi]]'' written by the [[Silla]] historian [[Kim Daemun]] in the 8th century. The latter work is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ki-Moon Lee|author2=S. Robert Ramsey|title=A History of the Korean Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AmspKX3beoC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2011|page=37|isbn=9781139494489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
In 1084 the [[Song dynasty]] official [[Sima Guang]] completed the [[Zizhi Tongjian|Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government]], which laid out the entire history of China from the beginning of the [[Warring States period]] (403 BCE) to the end of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties period]] (959 CE) in chronological annals form, rather than in the traditional annals-biography form. This work is considered much more accessible than the "Official Histories" for the [[Six dynasties]], [[Tang dynasty]], and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties]], and in practice superseded those works in the mind of the general reader.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson pp. 681-684&lt;/ref&gt;

The great Song Neo-Confucian [[Zhu Xi]] found the Mirror to be overly long for the average reader, as well as to too morally nihilist, and therefore prepared a didactic summary of it called the [[Zizhi Tongjian Gangmu|Digest of the Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government]], posthumously published in 1219. It reduced the original's 249 chapters to just 59, and for the rest of imperial Chinese history would be the first history book most people ever read.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (2018) p. 685&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment==
[[File:Buste de Voltaire.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Voltaire]]'s works of history are an excellent example of [[Enlightenment era]] advances in accuracy.]]

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the modern development of historiography through the application of scrupulous methods began. Among the many Italians who contributed to this were [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c. 1370–1444), [[Francesco Guicciardini]] (1483–1540), and [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]] (1538–1607).

===Voltaire===
French ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) had an enormous influence on the development of historiography during the Age of Enlightenment through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:
:Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume de Syon, "Voltaire," in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&amp;pg=PA1270|date=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=1270–72|isbn=9781884964336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire's best-known histories are ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'' (1751), and his ''[[Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations]]'' (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress.

Voltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on "History" in Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'': ''"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population."'' Already in 1739 he had written: ''"My chief object is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization&amp;nbsp;– in a word,&amp;nbsp;– of the human mind."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Sreedharan|title=A Textbook of Historiography: 500 BC to AD 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJVoi3PIejwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire's histories used the values of the Enlightenment to evaluate the past. He helped free historiography from antiquarianism, [[Eurocentrism]], religious intolerance and a concentration on great men, diplomacy, and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Sakmann, "The Problems of Historical Method and of Philosophy of History in Voltaire", ''History and Theory'', (1971) 11#4 pp. 24–59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Gay]] says Voltaire wrote "very good history", citing his "scrupulous concern for truths", "careful sifting of evidence", "intelligent selection of what is important", "keen sense of drama", and "grasp of the fact that a whole civilization is a unit of study."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, "Carl Becker's Heavenly City", ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1957) 72:182–99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Voltaire's Politics'' (2nd ed. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Hume===

At the same time, philosopher [[David Hume]] was having a similar effect on the study of history in [[Great Britain]]. In 1754 he published ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]]'', a 6-volume work which extended "From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688". Hume adopted a similar scope to Voltaire in his history; as well as the history of Kings, Parliaments, and armies, he examined the history of culture, including literature and science, as well. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change and he developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other&amp;nbsp;– he paid special attention to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[William Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;S. K. Wertz, "Hume and the Historiography of Science", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1993) 54#3 pp. 411–36 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2710021 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved "the most entire system of liberty, that was ever known amongst mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Hume vol 6. p 531 cited in {{cite book|author=John Philipps Kenyon|title=The history men: the historical profession in England since the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LkbAAAAIAAJ|year=1984|publisher=U. of Pittsburgh Press|page=42|isbn=9780822959007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edward Gibbon===
[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) was a masterpiece of late 18th-century history writing.]]

The apex of Enlightenment history was reached with [[Edward Gibbon]]'s monumental six-volume work, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', published on 17 February 1776. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of [[primary source]]s,  its methodology became a model for later historians. This has led to Gibbon being called the first "modern historian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yH9rdaF1CckC|title=Theorists of the Modernist Novel: James Joyce, Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf|author=Deborah Parsons|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|page=94|isbn=9780203965894}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold impressively, earning its author a total of about £9000. Biographer [[Sir Leslie Stephen|Leslie Stephen]] wrote that thereafter, "His fame was as rapid as it has been lasting."

Gibbon's work has been praised for its style, its piquant epigrams and its effective irony. [[Winston Churchill]] memorably noted, "I set out upon...Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' [and] was immediately dominated both by the story and the style.... I devoured Gibbon. I rode triumphantly through it from end to end and enjoyed it all."&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill, ''My Early Life: A Roving Commission'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1958), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon was pivotal in the secularizing and 'desanctifying' of history, remarking, for example, on the "want of truth and common sense" of biographies composed by [[Saint Jerome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/tom-holland/edward-gibbon-and-he-rose-again|title=Edward Gibbon: And He Rose Again|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually for an 18th-century historian, Gibbon was never content with secondhand accounts when the primary sources were accessible (though most of these were drawn from well-known printed editions). "I have always endeavoured," he says, "to draw from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty, has always urged me to study the originals; and that, if they have sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend."&lt;ref&gt;Womersley, ''Decline and Fall'', vol. 2, Preface to Gibbon vol. 4, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; In this insistence upon the importance of primary sources, Gibbon broke new ground in the methodical study of history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In accuracy, thoroughness, lucidity, and comprehensive grasp of a vast subject, the 'History' is unsurpassable. It is the one English history which may be regarded as definitive.... Whatever its shortcomings the book is artistically imposing as well as historically unimpeachable as a vast panorama of a great period.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen, ''DNB'', p. 1134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==19th century==
[[File:Carlyle manuscript burning Japan cph.3g10399.tif|thumb|Japanese print depicting [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s horror at the burning of his manuscript ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]''.]]

The tumultuous events surrounding the [[French Revolution]] inspired much of the historiography and analysis of the early 19th century. Interest in the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] was also rekindled by the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 in [[England]].

===Thomas Carlyle===
[[Thomas Carlyle]] published his three-volume ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'', in 1837.  The first volume was accidentally burned by [[John Stuart Mill]]'s maid. Carlyle rewrote it from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Rosenberg, ''Carlyle and the Burden of History''  (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Carlyle's style of historical writing stressed the immediacy of action, often using the present tense.  He emphasised the role of forces of the spirit in history and thought that chaotic events demanded what he called 'heroes' to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. He considered the dynamic forces of history as being the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies. Carlyle's ''The French Revolution'' was written in a highly unorthodox style, far removed from the neutral and detached tone of the tradition of Gibbon. Carlyle presented the history as dramatic events unfolding in the present as though he and the reader were participants on the streets of Paris at the famous events.  Carlyle's invented style was epic poetry combined with philosophical treatise. It is rarely read or cited in the last century.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Cobban, "Carlyle's French Revolution", ''History'' (1963) 48#164 pp. 306–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Cumming, ''A Disimprisoned Epic: Form and Vision in Carlyle's French Revolution'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

===French historians: Michelet and Taine===
[[File:Jules Michelet portrait older.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jules Michelet (1798–1874), later in his career.]]
[[File:Hippolyte taine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hippolyte Taine (1828–1893)]]

In his main work ''Histoire de France'' (1855), French historian [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874) coined the term [[Renaissance]] (meaning "rebirth" in [[French language|French]]), as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19-volume work covered French history from [[Charlemagne]] to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].  His inquiry into manuscript and printed authorities was most laborious, but his lively imagination, and his strong religious and political prejudices, made him regard all things from a singularly personal point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Mitzmanm ''Michelet, Historian: Rebirth and Romanticism in Nineteenth-Century France'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelet was one of the first historians to shift the emphasis of history to the common people, rather than the leaders and institutions of the country. He had a decisive impact on scholars. Gayana Jurkevich argues that led by Michelet:
:19th-century French historians no longer saw history as the chronicling of royal dynasties, armies, treaties, and great men of state, but as the history of ordinary French people and the landscape of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gayana Jurkevich|title=In Pursuit of the Natural Sign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV6wNgmwT4C&amp;pg=PA42|year=1999|page=42|isbn=9780838754139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippolyte Taine]] (1828–1893), although unable to secure an academic position, was the chief theoretical influence of French [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], a major proponent of [[sociological positivism]], and one of the first practitioners of [[Historicism|historicist]] criticism. He pioneered the idea of "the milieu" as an active historical force which amalgamated geographical, psychological, and social factors. Historical writing for him was a search for general laws. His brilliant style kept his writing in circulation long after his theoretical approaches were passé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alfred |last=Cobban |authorlink=Alfred Cobban |title=Hippolyte Taine, Historian of the French Revolution |journal=History |year=1968 |volume=53 |issue=179 |pages=331–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and constitutional history===
One of the major progenitors of the history of [[cultural history|culture]] and [[art history|art]], was the Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/historian/Jacob_Burckhardt.html Jakob Burckhardt Renaissance Cultural History &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siegfried Giedion]] described Burckhardt's achievement in the following terms: "The great discoverer of the age of the [[Renaissance]], he first showed how a period should be treated in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the social institutions of its daily life as well."&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], in ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His most famous work was ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'', published in 1860; it was the most influential interpretation of the Italian Renaissance in the nineteenth century and is still widely read. According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place.  His innovative approach to historical research stressed the importance of art and its inestimable value as a primary source for the study of history. He was one of the first historians to rise above the narrow nineteenth-century notion that "history is past politics and politics current history.&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed. Mark G Malvasi and Jeffrey O. Nelson, Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2004, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-19th century, scholars were beginning to analyse the history of institutional change, particularly the development of constitutional government. [[William Stubbs]]'s  ''Constitutional History of England'' (3 vols., 1874–78) was an important influence on this developing field. The work traced the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain until 1485, and marked a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature/Stubbs, William]]&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the theory of the unity and continuity of history should not remove distinctions between ancient and modern history. He believed that, though work on ancient history is a useful preparation for the study of modern history, either may advantageously be studied apart. He was a good [[palaeography|palaeographer]], and excelled in textual criticism, in examination of authorship, and other such matters, while his vast erudition and retentive memory made him second to none in interpretation and exposition.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Von Ranke and professionalization in Germany===
{{main article|Historiography of Germany}}
[[File:Leopold Von Ranke 1877.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]] established history as a professional academic discipline in Germany.]]

The modern academic study of history and methods of historiography were pioneered in 19th-century German universities, especially the [[University of Göttingen]]. [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886) at Berlin was a pivotal influence in this regard, and was the founder of modern source-based history.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick C. Beiser (2011) ''The German Historicist Tradition'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=w2c6YaKf9usC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green and Troup (eds.), ''The Houses of History'', p. 2: "Leopold von Ranke was instrumental in establishing professional standards for historical training at the University of Berlin between 1824 and 1871."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caroline Hoefferle, "Ranke was probably the most important historian to shape historical profession as it emerged in Europe and the United States in the late 19th century."&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Hoefferle, ''Essential Historiography Reader'' (Boston:  Pearson, 2011).68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, "The image of Ranke in American and German historical thought." History and Theory 2.1 (1962): 17–40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504333 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, he implemented the seminar teaching method in his classroom, and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents. Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age, including "memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s, an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''aussenpolitik'').&lt;ref&gt;E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&amp;nbsp;BC to AD&amp;nbsp;2000'' (2004) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources had to be solid, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity.

Ranke also rejected the 'teleological approach' to history, which traditionally viewed each period as inferior to the period which follows. In Ranke's view, the historian had to understand a period on its own terms, and seek to find only the general ideas which animated every period of history. In 1831 and at the behest of the [[Prussia]]n government, Ranke founded and edited the first historical journal in the world, called ''Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift''.

Another important German thinker was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose theory of historical progress ran counter to Ranke's approach. In Hegel's own words, his philosophical theory of "World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and of the consequent realization of this freedom.".&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;hl=en&amp;dq=%22represents+the+development+of+the+spirit's+consciousness+of+its+own+freedom+and+of+the+consequent+realisation+of+this+freedom.%22 p. 138].&lt;/ref&gt; This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;World history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself. The Orientals do not know that the spirit or man as such are free in themselves. And because they do not know that, they are not themselves free. They only know that '''One''' is free.... The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that '''Some''', and not all men as such, are free.... The [[Germans#Middle Ages|Germanic nations]], with the rise of [[Christianity]], were the first to realize that '''All''' men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence.&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;dq=%22World+history+is+the+record+of+the+spirit's+efforts+to+attain+knowledge+of+what+it+is+in+itself.+The+Orientals+do+not+know+that+the+spirit+or+man+as+such+are+free+in+themselves.+And+because+they+do+not+know+that,+they+are+not+themselves+free.+They+only+know+that+One+is+free.%22%22The+consciousness+of+freedom+first+awoke+among+the+Greeks,+and+they+were+accordingly+free;+but,+like+the+Romans,+they+only+knew+that+Some,+and+not+all+men+as+such,+are+free%22%22The+Germanic+nations,+with+the+rise+of+Christianity,+were+the+first+to+realize+that+All+men+are+by+nature+free,+and+that+freedom+of+spirit+is+his+very+essence.%22 p. 54].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] introduced the concept of [[historical materialism]] into the study of world historical development. In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. In his view five successive stages in the development of material conditions would occur in [[Western Europe]]. The first stage was [[primitive communism]] where property was shared and there was no concept of "leadership". This progressed to a [[Slavery|slave society]] where the idea of [[Social class|class]] emerged and the [[State (polity)|State]] developed. [[Feudalism]] was characterized by an [[aristocracy]] working in partnership with a [[theocracy]] and the emergence of the [[Nation-state]]. [[Capitalism]] appeared after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrew the feudal system and established a [[market economy]], with
[[private property]] and [[Parliamentary democracy]]. Marx then predicted the eventual proletarian revolution that would result in the attainment of [[socialism]], followed by [[Communism]], where property would be communally owned.

Previous historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations. Process of [[nationalization of history]], as part of [[Romantic nationalism|national revivals]] in the 19th century, resulted with separation of "one's own" history from common [[universal history]] by such way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that constructed history as history of a nation.&lt;ref name = "laboratory"&gt;{{Cite book

===Macaulay and Whig history===
[[File:Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] was the most influential exponent of the [[Whig history]]]]

[[Thomas Macaulay]] produced his most famous work of history, ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second]]'', in 1848.  His writings are famous for their ringing prose and for their confident, sometimes dogmatic, emphasis on a progressive model of British history, according to which the country threw off superstition, autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward-looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression. This model of human progress has been called the [[Whig history|Whig interpretation of history]].&lt;ref&gt;John Clive, ''Macaulay – the shaping of the historian'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

His legacy continues to be controversial; [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] wrote that "most professional historians have long since given up reading Macaulay, as they have given up writing the kind of history he wrote and thinking about history as he did."&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Himmelfarb, ‘Who Now Reads Macaulay?’, ''Marriage and Morals Among The Victorians. And other Essays'' (London: [[Faber and Faber]], 1986), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; However, J. R. Western wrote that: "Despite its age and blemishes, Macaulay's ''History of England'' has still to be superseded by a full-scale modern history of the period".&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Western, ''Monarchy and Revolution. The English State in the 1680s'' (London: Blandford Press, 1972), p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Whig history]], coined by [[Herbert Butterfield]] in his short book ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' in 1931, means the approach to historiography which presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment, culminating in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. In general, Whig historians emphasized the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s and [[scientific progress]]. The term has been also applied widely in historical disciplines outside of [[British history]] (the [[history of science]], for example) to criticize any [[Teleology|teleological]] (or goal-directed), hero-based, and [[Transhistoricity|transhistorical]] narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr, "When Is Historiography Whiggish?" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301–09 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709517 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul de Rapin|Paul Rapin de Thoyras]]'s history of England, published in 1723, became "the classic Whig history" for the first half of the 18th century,.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Trevor-Roper, 'Introduction', ''Lord Macaulay's History of England'' (Penguin Classics, 1979), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later supplanted by the immensely popular ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'' by [[David Hume]]. Whig historians emphasized the achievements of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. This included [[James Mackintosh]]'s ''History of the Revolution in England in 1688'', [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' and [[Henry Hallam]]'s ''Constitutional History of England''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nature of History'' (second edition 1980), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous exponent of 'Whiggery' was [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]], who published the first volumes of his ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James II]]'' in 1848. It proved an immediate success and replaced Hume's history to become the new orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; His 'Whiggish convictions' are spelled out in his first chapter:

{{quote|I shall relate how the new settlement was...successfully defended against foreign and domestic enemies; how... the authority of law and the security of property were found to be compatible with a liberty of discussion and of individual action never before known; how, from the auspicious union of order and freedom, sprang a prosperity of which the annals of human affairs had furnished no example; how our country, from a state of ignominious [[vassalage]], rapidly rose to the place of umpire among European powers; how her opulence and her martial glory grew together;... how a gigantic commerce gave birth to a maritime power, compared with which every other maritime power, ancient or modern, sinks into insignificance... the history of our country during the last hundred and sixty years is eminently the history of physical, of moral, and of intellectual improvement.}}

This consensus was steadily undermined during the post-World War I re-evaluation of European history, and Butterfield's critique exemplified this trend. Intellectuals no longer believed the world was automatically getting better and better. Subsequent generations of academic historians have similarly rejected Whig history because of its [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentist]] and teleological assumption that history is driving toward some sort of goal.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Feske, ''From Belloc to Churchill: Private Scholars, Public Culture, and the Crisis of British Liberalism, 1900–1939'' (1996), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticized 'Whig' assumptions included viewing the British system as the apex of human political development, assuming that political figures in the past held current political beliefs ([[anachronism]]), considering British history as a march of progress with inevitable outcomes and presenting political figures of the past as heroes, who advanced the cause of this political progress, or villains, who sought to hinder its inevitable triumph. J. Hart says "a Whig interpretation requires human heroes and villains in the story."&lt;ref&gt;J. Hart, "Nineteenth-Century Social Reform: A Tory Interpretation of History", ''Past &amp; Present'' (1965) 31#1 pp. 39–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
{{see also|:Category:Historiography by country}}
20th-century historiography in major countries is characterized by a move to universities and academic research centers. Popular history continued to be written by self-educated amateurs, but scholarly history increasingly became the province of PhD's trained in research seminars at a university. The training emphasized working with primary sources in archives. Seminars taught graduate students how to review the historiography of the topics, so that they could understand the conceptual frameworks currently in use, and the criticisms regarding their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, ''History: Professional Scholarship in America'' (1989) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ian |last=Hesketh |title=Writing history in Macaulay's shadow: J. R. Seeley, E. A. Freeman, and the audience for scientific history in late Victorian Britain |journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association/Revue de la Société Historique du Canada |volume=22 |issue=2 |year=2011 |pages=30–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Europe and the United States took leading roles in this development. The emergence of [[area studies]] of other regions also developed historiographical practices.

===France: ''Annales'' school===
{{main article|Annales school}}
[[File:Marc Bloch.jpg|thumb|upright|The 20th century saw the creation of a huge variety of historiographical approaches; one was [[Marc Bloch]]'s focus on social history rather than traditional political history.]]

The French [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] radically changed the focus of historical research in France during the 20th century by stressing long-term social history, rather than political or diplomatic themes. The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annales d'histoire économique et sociale'' journal was founded in 1929 in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the [[Année Sociologique]] (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue durée]]'') over events and political transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, "Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue durée in French Revolutionary Historiography", ''Past &amp; Present'', 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178–203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalités'', or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the ''Annales'' was to undo the work of the ''Sorbonnistes'', to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Hexter, "Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien", '' Historians'', pp. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  For early modern Mexican history, the work of [[Marc Bloch]]'s student [[Francois Chevalier (historian)|François Chevalier]] on the formation of landed estates ([[haciendas]]) from the sixteenth century to the seventeenth had a major impact on Mexican history and historiography,&lt;ref&gt;François Chevalier, ''La formation des grands domains au Mexique (terre et sociéte aux SVIe et XVIIe siècles)'' Paris, Institut de ethnologie 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; setting off an important debate about whether landed estates were basically feudal or capitalistic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Van Young]], “Rural History” in ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', José C. Moya, ed.  New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Van Young, "Mexican Rural History Since Chevalier:  The Historiography of the Colonial Hacienda," Latin American Research Review, 18 (3) 1983; 5–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

An eminent member of this school, [[Georges Duby]], described his approach to history as one that &lt;blockquote&gt;relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historical problem.

The second era of the school was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue durée]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures. His 'longue durée' approach stressed slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and major political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress slow change and the longue durée. They paid special attention to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They considered the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Harris |title=Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity |journal=[[History Workshop Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=57 |pages=161–174 |issn=1363-3554 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/849/ }} Only Ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that "in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric J. Hobsbawm|title=Interesting times: a twentieth-century life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQqAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.&lt;ref&gt;One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire &amp; mesure'' (1986—), devoted to quantitative history.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the ''Annales'' ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political and demographic research.&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge", 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist historiography===
{{Main article|Marxist historiography}}
{{Further information|Communist Party Historians Group}}
[[Marxist historiography]] developed as a school of historiography influenced by the chief tenets of [[Marxism]], including the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes ([[historical materialism]]). [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]'', which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. Although it lacked a rigorous engagement with archival sources, it indicated an early interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and it attempts a dialectical analysis. Another treatise of Engels, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]].

[[R. H. Tawney]] was an early historian working in this tradition. ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)&lt;ref&gt;[[William Rose Benét]] (1988) p.&amp;nbsp;961&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. He was profoundly interested in the issue of the enclosure of land in the English countryside in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in [[Max Weber]]'s thesis on the connection between the appearance of [[Protestantism]] and the rise of capitalism. His belief in the rise of the gentry in the century before the outbreak of the Civil War in England provoked the 'Storm over the Gentry' in which his methods were subjected to severe criticisms by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and John Cooper.

[[Historiography in the Soviet Union]] was greatly influenced by Marxist historiography, as [[historical materialism]] was extended into the Soviet version of [[dialectical materialism]].

A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history.

Christopher Hill's studies on 17th-century English history were widely acknowledged and recognised as representative of this school.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hill, (John Edward) Christopher (1912–2003)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/89437|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books include ''Puritanism and Revolution'' (1958), ''Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution'' (1965 and revised in 1996), ''The Century of Revolution'' (1961), ''AntiChrist in 17th-century England'' (1971), ''The World Turned Upside Down'' (1972) and many others.

[[E. P. Thompson]] pioneered the study of history from below in his work, ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', published in 1963. It focused on the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. In his preface to this book, Thompson set out his approach to writing history from below:

{{quote|text=I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the [[Luddite]] cropper, the "obsolete" hand-loom weaver, the "Utopian" artisan, and even the deluded follower of [[Joanna Southcott]], from the enormous condescension of posterity. Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience; and, if they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.}}

Thompson's work was also significant because of the way he defined "class." He argued that class was not a structure, but a relationship that changed over time. He opened the gates for a generation of labor historians, such as [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]] and [[Herbert Gutman]], who made similar studies of the American working classes.

Other important Marxist historians included [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Raphael Samuel]], [[A. L. Morton]] and [[Brian Pearce]].

Although Marxist historiography made important contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]], its chief problematic aspect was its argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of subjective and objective factors in creating outcomes. It increasingly fell out of favour in the 1960s and '70s. [[Geoffrey Elton]] was important in undermining the case for a [[Marxist historiography]], which he argued was presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the [[English Civil War]] was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was due largely to the incompetence of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings.&lt;ref&gt;See his essays 'The Stuart Century', 'A High Road to Civil War?' and 'The Unexplained Revolution' in G. R. Elton, ''Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government: Volume II'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

In dealing with the era of the Second World War, Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, "in sharp decline", because:
{{quote|there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. ''A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939–2000'' (2005) p 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Biography===
{{Further|Biography}}
Biography has been a major form of historiography since the days when [[Plutarch]] wrote the parallel lives of great Roman and Greek leaders. It is a field especially attractive to nonacademic historians, and often to the spouses or children of famous people, who have access to the trove of letters and documents. Academic historians tend to downplay biography because it pays too little attention to broad social, cultural, political and economic forces, and perhaps too much attention to popular psychology. The ",Great Man" tradition in Britain originated in the multi-volume ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (which originated in 1882 and issued updates into the 1970s); it continues to this day in the new ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]].'' In the United States, the ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' was planned in the late 1920s and appeared with numerous supplements into the 1980s.  It has now been displaced by the ''[[American National Biography]]'' as well as numerous smaller historical encyclopedias that give thorough coverage to Great Persons. Bookstores do a thriving business in biographies, which sell far more copies than the esoteric monographs based on post-structuralism, cultural, racial or gender history. [[Michael Holroyd]] says the last forty years ",may be seen as a golden age of biography" but nevertheless calls it the "shallow end of history."  Nicolas Barker argues that ",more and more biographies command an ever larger readership", as he speculates that biography has come "to express the spirit of our age."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Riall, "The Shallow End of History? The Substance and Future of Political Biography", ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (2010) 40#3 pp 375–397&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel R. Meister argues that:
:Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.&lt;ref&gt; Daniel R. Meister, "The biographical turn and the case for historical biography" ''History Compass'' (Dec. 2017) DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12436 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12436/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview abstract] &lt;/ref&gt;

===British debates===
{{Main article|Historiography of the United Kingdom}}
Marxist historian [[E. H. Carr]] developed a controversial theory of history in his 1961 book ''[[What Is History?]]'', which proved to be one of the most influential books ever written on the subject.&lt;ref name="Windshuttle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Windshuttle|first=Keith|title=The Real Stuff of History|publisher=Sydney Line|year=2001|url=http://www.sydneyline.com/Real%20Stuff%20of%20History.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211162744/http://www.sydneyline.com/Real%20Stuff%20of%20History.htm|archivedate=2008-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented a middle-of-the-road position between the empirical or  (Rankean) view of history and [[R. G. Collingwood]]'s idealism, and rejected the empirical view of the historian's work being an accretion of "facts" that he or she has at their disposal as nonsense.  He maintained that there is such a vast quantity of information that the historian always chooses the "facts" he or she decides to make use of. In Carr's famous example, he claimed that millions had crossed the Rubicon, but only Julius Caesar's crossing in 49 BC is declared noteworthy by historians.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26"&gt;Huges-Warrington, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 10;&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Carr argued that [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s famous dictum ''wie es eigentlich gewesen'' (show what actually happened) was wrong because it presumed that the "facts" influenced what the historian wrote, rather than the historian choosing what "facts of the past" he or she intended to turn into "historical facts".&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''What Is History?'', pp. 8–13&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Carr argued that the study of the facts may lead the historian to change his or her views.  In this way, Carr argued that history was "an unending dialogue between the past and present".&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr is held by some critics to have had a deterministic outlook in history.&lt;ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 27"&gt;Huges-Warrington, p. 27. One of his first and most influential critics was the British philosopher, Michael Oakeshott, 'What is History?' (1961), in idem, ''What is History and Other Essays'' (Exeter, 2004), 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have modified or rejected this use of the label "determinist".&lt;ref&gt;See M. Hewitson, ''History and Causality'' (Basingstoke, 2014), pp. 86–93.&lt;/ref&gt; He took a hostile view of those historians who stress the workings of chance and contingency in the workings of history. In Carr's view, no individual is truly free of the social environment in which they live, but contended that within those limitations, there was room, albeit very narrow room for people to make decisions that affect history.  Carr emphatically contended that history was a [[Social sciences|social science]], not an [[The arts|art]],&lt;ref name=HW28&gt;Huges-Warrington, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; because historians like scientists seek generalizations that helped to broaden the understanding of one's subject.&lt;ref name=HW28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Carr's most forthright critics was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that Carr's dismissal of the "might-have-beens of history" reflected a fundamental lack of interest in examining historical causation.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor-Roper asserted that examining possible alternative outcomes of history was far from being a "parlour-game" was rather an essential part of the historians' work,&lt;ref name="Trevor-Roper p. 73"&gt;Trevor-Roper, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; as only by considering all possible outcomes of a given situation could a historian properly understand the period.

The controversy inspired Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]] to write his 1967 book ''The Practice of History''. Elton criticized Carr for his "whimsical" distinction between the "historical facts" and the "facts of the past", arguing that it reflected "...an extraordinarily arrogant attitude both to the past and to the place of the historian studying it".&lt;ref&gt;Elton, Geoffrey ''The Practice of History'', London: Methuen, 1967 pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Elton, instead, strongly defended the traditional methods of history and was also appalled by the inroads made by [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ó Tuathaigh,M. A. G., ‘Irish Historical ",Revisionism": State of the Art of Ideological Project?’ in, Brady, Ciaran (ed.), Interpreting Irish History (Dublin, 2006), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Elton saw the duty of historians as empirically gathering evidence and objectively analyzing what the evidence has to say. As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. Elton saw political history as the highest kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as [[Marxism]].

===U.S. approaches===
{{main article|Historiography of the United States}}
Classical and European history was part of the 19th-century grammar curriculum. American history became a topic later in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Joyce, ''The First U.S. History Textbooks: Constructing and Disseminating the American Tale in the Nineteenth Century'' (Lexington, 2015). viii, 335 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the historiography of the United States, there were a series of major approaches in the 20th century.  In 2009–2012, there were an average of 16,000 new academic history books published in the U.S. every year.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=88#fig393 table IV-12b]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Progressive historians====
From 1910 to the 1940s, "Progressive" historiography was dominant, especially in political studies. It stressed the central importance of class conflict in American history. Important leaders included [[Vernon L. Parrington]], [[Carl L. Becker]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]], John Hicks, and [[C. Vann Woodward]].&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, ''History: Professional Scholarship in America'' (1965) pp 171–211&lt;/ref&gt; The movement established a strong base at the History Department at the University of Wisconsin with Curtis Nettels, William Hesseltine, [[Merle Curti]], [[Howard K. Beale]], Merrill Jensen, Fred Harvey Harrington (who became the university president), [[William Appleman Williams]], and a host of graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Buhle, ed., ''History and the New Left: Madison, Wisconsin, 1950–1970'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles A. Beard]] was the most prominent representative with his "Beardian" approach that reached both scholars and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

In covering the Civil War, Charles and Mary Beard did not find it useful to examine nationalism, unionism, states' rights, slavery, abolition or the motivations of soldiers in battle.  Instead, they proclaimed it was a:
:social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South. Viewed under the light of universal history, the fighting was a fleeting incident; the social revolution was the essential portentous outcome.... The Second American Revolution, while destroying the economic foundation of the slave-owning aristocracy, assured the triumph of business enterprise."  &lt;ref&gt;Charles A.  Beard and Mary R.  Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) vol 2 pp 54, 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] wrote the ''Age of Jackson'' (1945), one of the last major books from this viewpoint. Schlesinger made Jackson a hero for his successful attacks on the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. His own views were clear enough: "Moved typically by personal and class, rarely by public, considerations, the business community has invariably brought national affairs to a state of crisis and exasperated the rest of society into dissatisfaction bordering on revolt."&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, ''Age of Jackson'' (1945) p 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus history====
{{main article|Consensus history}}
Consensus history emphasizes the basic unity of American values and downplays conflict as superficial.  It was especially attractive in the 1950s and 1960s. Prominent leaders included [[Richard Hofstadter]], [[Louis Hartz]], [[Daniel Boorstin]], [[Allan Nevins]], [[Clinton Rossiter]], [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]],  and [[David M. Potter]].&lt;ref&gt;Dwight W. Hoover, "Some Comments on Recent United States Historiography", ''American Quarterly'' (1965) 17#2 Part 2: Supplement pp. 299–318 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2710801 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''That noble dream: The 'objectivity question' and the American historical profession'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988) pp 320–60&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1948 Hofstadter made a compelling statement of the consensus model of the U.S. political tradition:
{{quote|The fierceness of the political struggles has often been misleading: for the range of vision embraced by the primary contestants in the major parties has always been bounded by the horizons of property and enterprise.  However much at odds on specific issues, the major political traditions have shared a belief in the rights of property, the philosophy of economic individualism, the value of competition; they have accepted the economic virtues capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=The American Political Tradition: And the Men Who Made it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6k_G670uhZsC&amp;pg=PR35|year=1948|publisher=Knopf|pages=xxxvi–xxxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====New Left history====
Consensus history was rejected by [[New Left]] viewpoints that attracted a younger generation of radical historians in the 1960s. These viewpoints stress conflict and emphasize the central roles of class, race and gender. The history of dissent, and the experiences of racial minorities and disadvantaged classes was central to the narratives produced by New Left historians.&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, "Changing paradigms: The collapse of consensus history." ''Journal of American History'' (1989): 460–466. [http://tucnak.fsv.cuni.cz/~calda/Higham_Paradigms_ConsensusHistory.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novick, ''That noble dream: The "objectivity question" and the American historical profession'' (1988) pp 415–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Unger,  "The 'New Left' and American History: Some Recent Trends in United States Historiography." ''American Historical Review'' (1967): 1237–1263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1847792 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quantification and new approaches to history====
{{main article|Social history|Political history#United States: The new political history}}
'''[[Social history]]''', sometimes called the "new social history", is a broad branch that studies the experiences of ordinary people in the past.&lt;ref&gt;The "old" social history dealt with institutions like schools and churches, while the "new" dealt with students, teachers and churchgoers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  It had major growth as a field in the 1960s and 1970s, and still is well represented in history departments. However, after 1980 the "cultural turn" directed the next generation to new topics.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in U.S. universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations", ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34–43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth was enabled by the social sciences, computers, statistics, new data sources such as individual census information, and summer training programs at the [[Newberry Library]] and the [[University of Michigan]]. The New Political History saw the application of social history methods to politics, as the focus shifted from politicians and legislation to voters and elections.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "The Quest for Numeracy: Data and Methods in American Political History", ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 21#1 (1990), pp. 89–116 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/204919 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paula Baker, "The Midlife Crisis of the New Political History", ''Journal of American History'' (1999) 86#1 pp. 158–166 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2567411 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Science History Association]] was formed in 1976 as an interdisciplinary group with a journal ''[[Social Science History]]'' and an annual convention. The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as traditional historians counterattacked. [[Harvey J. Graff]] says:
{{quote|The case against the new mixed and confused a lengthy list of ingredients, including the following: history’s supposed loss of identity and humanity in the stain of social science, the fear of subordinating quality to quantity, conceptual and technical fallacies, violation of the literary character and biographical base of ",good" history (rhetorical and aesthetic concern), loss of audiences, derogation of history rooted in ",great men" and ",great events", trivialization in general, a hodge-podge of ideological objections from all directions, and a fear that new historians were reaping research funds that might otherwise come to their detractors. To defenders of history as they knew it, the discipline was in crisis, and the pursuit of the new was a major cause.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey J. Graff, "The Shock of the 'New’ (Histories)': Social Science Histories and Historical Literacies", ''Social Science History'' 25.4 (2001) 483–533, at p. 490;  in Project Muse&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, quantitative history became well-established in other disciplines, especially economics (where they called it "cliometrics"), as well as in political science. In history, however, quantification remained central to demographic studies, but slipped behind in political and social history as traditional narrative approaches made a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser,  "The revivalism of narrative: A response to recent criticisms of quantitative history." ''Social Science History'' (1984) 8#1: 133–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
{{further information|Historiography of Colonial Spanish America|Argentina|Latin American studies}}
[[Latin America]] is the former Spanish American empire in the Western Hemisphere plus Portuguese Brazil. Professional historians pioneered the creation of this field, starting in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, ''Latin American History: Essays on Its Teaching and Research, 1898–1965''. 2 vols. Austin: University of Texas Press 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The term “Latin America” did not come into general usage until the twentieth century and in some cases it was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ed. “Introduction” to ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', New York: Oxford University Press, p.  5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The historiography of the field has been more fragmented than unified, with historians of Spanish America and Brazil generally remaining in separate spheres.  Another standard division within the historiography is the temporal factor, with works falling into either the early modern period (or “colonial era”) or the post-independence (or “national”) period, from the early nineteenth onward. Relatively few works span the two eras and few works except textbooks unite Spanish America and Brazil. There is a tendency to focus on histories of particular countries or regions (the Andes, the Southern Cone, the Caribbean) with relatively little comparative work.

Historians of Latin America have contributed to various types of historical writing, but one major, innovative development in Spanish American history is the emergence of [[ethnohistory]], the history of indigenous peoples, especially in Mexico based on alphabetic sources in Spanish or in [[New Philology|indigenous languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, ed. ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' 4 vols. Austin: University of Texas Press 1972–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Salomon and Stuart B. Schwartz, eds. ''Cambridge History of Native Peoples of the Americas: South America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard E.W.  Adams and [[Murdo J. MacLeod (historian)|Murdo J. MacLeod]], eds. ''Cambridge History of Natives Peoples of the Americas: Mesoamerica'' 2 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the early modern period, the emergence of [[Atlantic history]], based on comparisons and linkages of Europe, the Americas, and Africa from 1450–1850 that developed as a field in its own right has integrated early modern Latin American history into a larger framework.&lt;ref&gt;see Bernard Bailyn, Atlantic History: Concept and Contours. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press 2005. The development of the field antedates this publication.&lt;/ref&gt; For all periods, global or world history have focused on the connections between areas, likewise integrating Latin America into a larger perspective. Latin America's importance to world history is notable but often overlooked. “Latin America’s central, and sometimes pioneering, role in the development of globalization and modernity did not cease with the end of colonial rule and the early modern period.  Indeed, the region’s political independence places it at the forefront of two trends that are regularly considered thresholds of the modern world. The first is the so-called liberal revolution, the shift from monarchies of the ancien régime, where inheritance legitimated political power, to constitutional republics... The second, and related, trend consistently considered a threshold of modern history that saw Latin America in the forefront is the development of nation-states.”&lt;ref&gt;Moya, “Introduction”, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical research appears in a number of specialized journals.  These include ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]]'' (est. 1918), published by the [[Conference on Latin American History]]; ''The Americas'', (est. 1944); ''[[Journal of Latin American Studies]]'' (1969);  ''Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies'',( est.1976)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.can-latam.org/journal&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bulletin of Latin American Research]]'', (est.  1981); ''Colonial Latin American Review'' (1992); and ''Colonial Latin American Historical Review'' (est. 1992). ''[[Latin American Research Review]]'' (est. 1969), published by the [[Latin American Studies Association]], does not focus primarily on history, but it has often published historiographical essays on particular topics.	

'''General works''' on Latin American history have appeared since the 1950s, when the teaching of Latin American history expanded in U.S. universities and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, ed. ''Latin American History: Essays on its Teaching and Research, 1898–1965''. 2 vols.  Austin: University of Texas Press 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most attempt full coverage of Spanish America and Brazil from the conquest to the modern era, focusing on institutional, political, social and economic history.  An important, eleven volume treatment of Latin American history is ''The Cambridge History of Latin America'', with separate volumes on the colonial era, nineteenth century, and the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell, editor. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America'' 11 volumes.  New York: Cambridge University Press 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small number of general works that have gone through multiple editions.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Keen and Keith Haynes, ''A History of Latin America'' 9th edition. Cengage 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Charles Chasteen, ''Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America'' 4th edition. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Skidmore and Peter H. Smith, ''Modern Latin America'' 9th edition. New York: Oxford University Press 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Major trade publishers have also issued edited volumes on Latin American history&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Holloway, ''A Companion to Latin American History''. Malden MA: Wiley-Blackwell 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and historiography.&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Reference works include the [[Handbook of Latin American Studies]], which publishes articles by area experts, with annotated bibliographic entries, and the ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Tenenbaum, ed. ‘’Encyclopedia of Latin American History’’ 5 vols. New York:  Charles Scribner’s Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
[[World history]], as a distinct field of historical study, emerged as an independent academic field in the 1980s. It focused on the examination of history from a global perspective and looked for common patterns that emerged across all cultures. The basic thematic approach of this field was to analyse two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]]&amp;nbsp;– (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together), and difference&amp;nbsp;– (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience).

[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'', took an approach that was widely discussed in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1960s his work was virtually ignored by scholars and the general public.  He compared 26 independent civilizations and argued that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.  He proposed a universal model to each of these civilizations, detailing the stages through which they all pass: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. The later volumes gave too much emphasis on spirituality to satisfy critics.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1965) to show how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. He then discusses the dramatic effect of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] on others in the past 500 years of history. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the globe. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.'' His emphasis on cultural fusions influenced historical theory significantly.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, "The Changing Shape of World History." ''History and Theory'' 1995 34(2): 8–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cultural turn===
The "cultural turn" of the 1980s and 1990s affected scholars in most areas of history.&lt;ref&gt;It missed some areas. Kevin W. Martin, "Middle East Historiography: Did We Miss the Cultural Turn?" ''History Compass'' (2014) 12#2 pp 178–186&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired largely by anthropology, it turned away from leaders, ordinary people and famous events to look at the use of language and cultural symbols to represent the changing values of society.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny, "Back and Beyond: Reversing the Cultural Turn?" ''American Historical Review'' (2002) 107#5 pp: 1476–1499 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/532855 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;

The British historian [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] finds that cultural studies has numerous spinoffs, or topical themes it has strongly influenced. The most important include [[gender studies]] and [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]], as well as memory studies, and [[film studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''What is Cultural History? '' (2nd ed. 2008), p 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatic historian [[Melvyn P. Leffler]] finds that the problem with the "cultural turn" is that the culture concept is imprecise, and may produce excessively broad interpretations, because it:
{{quote|seems infinitely malleable and capable of giving shape to totally divergent policies; for example, to internationalism or isolationism in the United States, and to cooperative internationalism or race hatred in Japan. The malleability of culture suggest to me that in order to understand its effect on policy, one needs also to study the dynamics of political economy, the evolution of the international system, and the roles of technology and communication, among many other variables.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn P. Leffler, "New Approaches, Old Interpretations, and Prospective Reconfigurations", ''Diplomatic History'' (1995) 19#1 pp 173–196, quotation at p 185&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Memory studies===
Memory studies is a new field, focused on how nations and groups (and historians) construct and select their memories of the past in order to celebrate (or denounce) key features, thus making a statement of their current values and beliefs.  Historians have played a central role in shaping the memories of the past as their work is diffused through popular history books and school textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;S. Berger and C. Lorenz, eds. , ''Nationalizing the Past: Historians as Nation Builders in Modern Europe'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  French sociologist [[Maurice Halbwachs]], opened the field with ''La mémoire collective'' (Paris: 1950).&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''On collective memory'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians examine the how the memory of the past has been constructed, memorialized or distorted. Historians examine how legends are invented.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, "'No Irish Need Apply': A Myth of Victimization", ''Journal of Social History'' (2002) 36#2 pp 405–429 [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/no-irish.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Schuman, Barry Schwartz, and Hannah d’Arcy. "Elite Revisionists and Popular Beliefs Christopher Columbus, Hero or Villain?." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'' (2005) 69#1 pp: 2–29 [http://www.barryschwartzonline.com/16406461.PDF online]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there are numerous studies of the memory of atrocities from World War II, notably the Holocaust in Europe and Japanese behavior in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Alon Confino, "Collective memory and cultural history: problems of method." ''American Historical Review'' (1997): 1386–1403. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2171069 in JSTOR]; [http://www.timeandspace.lviv.ua/files/session/confino_108.pdf another copy online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case studies are examined in Jeffrey K. Olick, et al. eds. ''The Collective Memory Reader'' (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fq8R3G-0t9gC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  British historian Heather Jones argues that the [[World War I#historiography|historiography of the First World War]] in recent years has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn. Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalization of politics, race, and the male body.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jones,  "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography." ''Historical Journal'' (2013) 56#3 pp: 857–878&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative of recent scholarship is a collection of studies on the "Dynamics of Memory and Identity in Contemporary Europe"&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lagenbacher, Bill Niven and Ruth Wittlinger, eds., ''Dynamics of Memory and Identity in Contemporary Europe'' (Berghahn, 2012) 248 pp. [http://www.h-france.net/vol14reviews/vol14no144demossier.pdf online 2014 review in H-FRANCE ]&lt;/ref&gt;  SAGE has published the scholarly journal ''Memory Studies'' since 2008, and the book series ‘Memory Studies’ was launched by Palgrave Macmillan in 2010 with 5–10 titles a year.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the field see Marek Tamm, ",Beyond History and Memory: New Perspectives in Memory Studies", ''History Compass'' 11/6 (2013): 458–473 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12050/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly journals==
The historical journal, a forum where academic historians could exchange ideas and publish newly discovered information, came into being in the 19th century. The early journals were similar to those for the physical sciences, and were seen as a means for history to become more professional. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was ''[[Annales. Économies, sociétés, civilisations]]'', a publication of the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] in France.  Journals now typically have one or more editors and associate editors, an editorial board, and a pool of scholars to whom articles that are submitted are sent for confidential evaluation.  The editors will send out new books to recognized scholars for reviews that usually run 500 to 1000 words. The vetting and publication process often takes months or longer. Publication in a prestigious journal (which accept 10% or fewer of the articles submitted) is an asset in the academic hiring and promotion process. Publication demonstrates that the author is conversant with the scholarly field.  Page charges and fees for publication are uncommon in history. Journals are subsidized by universities or historical societies, scholarly associations, and subscription fees from libraries and scholars. Increasingly they are available through library pools that allow many academic institutions to pool subscriptions to online versions. Most libraries have a system for obtaining specific articles through inter-library loan.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret F. Stieg, ''The Origin and Development of Scholarly Historical Periodicals'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
According to [[Lawrence Stone]], [[narrative]] has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as follows: it is organized [[chronological]]ly; it is focused on a single coherent story; it is descriptive rather than analytical; it is concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and it deals with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the 'new historians' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History", ''Past and Present'' 85 (Nov 1979) pp. 3–24, quote on p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and its use of clever examples rather than statistically verified empirical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History", ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis", ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics studied==
Some of the common topics in historiography are:
# Reliability of the sources used, in terms of authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.  (See also [[source criticism]]).
# Historiographical tradition or framework. Every historian uses one (or more) historiographical traditions, for example [[Marxist]], [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], "total history", or [[political history]].
# [[morality|Moral]] issues, guilt assignment, and praise assignment
# [[historical revisionism|Revisionism]] versus [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretations
# Historical [[metanarratives]] and metahistory.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaĭ Onufrievich Losskiĭ -History of Russian Philosophy 1951 – - Page 245 "It must not be imagined, however, that history and metahistory are entirely separate: "Metahistory is continually present as the background of history. That which is metahistorical breaks up both the cosmic endless sequence of events and the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Visva-bharati Quarterly 1956– Page 118  "8 Sometimes the term Metahistory is also used. But it implies going beyond, a transcendence of history and in this sense it is equated with metaphysics and theology. Sometimes historical time is distinguised from metahistorical eternity."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
How a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important decisions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts dealing with names, dates and places are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.

The most influential historiographical approaches are:

* [[Business history]]
* [[Comparative history]]
* [[Cultural history]]
* [[Diplomatic history]]
* [[Economic history]]
* [[Environmental history]], a relatively new field
* [[Ethnohistory]]
* [[Gender history]] including [[Woman's history]], [[Family history]], [[Feminist history]]
* [[History of medicine|History of Medicine]]
* [[History of Religion]] and [[Church history|Church History]]; the history of theology is usually handled under [[Theology]]
* [[Intellectual History]] and [[History of ideas]]
* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]]
* [[Local History]] and [[Microhistory]]
* [[Marxist historiography]] and [[Historical materialism]]
* [[Military history]], including naval and air
* [[Oral history]]
* [[Political history]]
* [[Public history]], especially museums and historic preservation
* [[Quantitative history]], [[Cliometrics]] (in economic history); [[Prosopography]] using statistics to study biographies
* [[History of religions]]
* [[Historiography of science]] 
* [[Social history]] and [[People's history|History from below]]; along with the French version the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] and the German [[Bielefeld School]]
* [[Subaltern Studies]], Regarding post-colonial India
* [[Urban history]]
** [[American urban history]]
* [[Whig history]], History as the story of continuous progress
* [[World history]]

'''Hsu Mo''' ({{zh|c=徐謨|p=Xu Mó|w=Hsu Mo}}; October 22, 1893 in [[Suzhou]], province of [[Jiangsu]] – June 28, 1956 in [[The Hague]]) was a Chinese [[lawyer]], [[politician]] and [[diplomat]]. He worked from 1931 to 1941 as deputy foreign minister of his country, as [[ambassador]] to [[Australia]] and to [[Turkey]], and from 1946 until his death as a judge at the [[International Court of Justice]].

==Life==
Hsu Mo was born in 1893 in Suzhou, and studied law at [[Peiyang University]] and at [[George Washington University]]. He received his doctorate in Australia at the [[University of Melbourne]]. In the 1920s, he worked first as a professor of [[international law]] and [[international relations]] at [[Nankai University]] and later as a [[judge]] in various district courts. In 1928, he moved to the [[Chinese Foreign Ministry]], where he worked as a consultant and later as Director of the European-American and Asian Department. Three years later, he became Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. After ten years in this position, he became Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Australia in 1941 and from 1944 to 1946 he was ambassador of his homeland in Turkey.

After the end of World War II, in April 1945, he participated on the [[United Nations]] Committee of Jurists in Washington DC, tasked with preparing draft statutes for the then contemplated International Court of Justice. He also served as the [[rapporteur]] of the Committee on Chapter VI of the [[United Nations Charter]] on the Regulations for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. A year later he was elected a judge of the International Court of Justice, where he worked until his death. His successor was his compatriot [[Wellington Koo]].

Hsu Mo became a member of the [[Institut de Droit International]] in 1948. He died in 1956, in The Hague.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8094">'''If This House Could Talk''' is a community based history and public art project, first created and produced by residents of the Cambridgeport section of Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Projects of a similar nature and with the same name take place annually in neighborhoods of Sacramento, California, Newburyport, Massachusetts, and other communities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ifhousecouldtalk.wordpress.com/category/about-the-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is to collect and present local history, and historical anecdotes, through a collaborative activity in which residents and businesses post hand written signs and graphics in front of their homes and businesses telling stories and offering information from the recent or not-so-recent past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/library/public-articles/iif-this-house-could.html] Preservation Forum, National Trust for Historic Preservation&lt;/ref&gt; The descriptive signs are on open display for passers-by to read and learn from as they walk along the streets. Exhibition of the signs may be an ongoing activity or an annual temporary event.

==Community Process==
This form of collaborative group activity may offer a way to initiate neighborhood conversation during both the creation and public display of the informational signs. In community settings the signs posted for outdoor view present a range of information from the architectural history of a specific building or part of the neighborhood, to personal experiences and stories of the current or historic residents of a particular house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radioboston.wbur.org/2011/10/06/if-this-house-could-talk] Radio WBUR Podcast&lt;/ref&gt; Public projects like If This House Could Talk offer neighborhood residents a way to present historical information with a personal voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cambridgehistory.org/discover/newsletters/chronicle-winter-cport-2011.pdf] Newtowne Chronicle, Cambridge Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; This type of community based project is a method for the presentation of [[Oral history]].  Presentation of history this way is related to, but not as formal or rigorous as, local history collected under the ideas of [[Public history]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichistory.org/what_is/definition.html] Definition of Public History&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of free and accessible presentation of information in public places encourages walking and exploration of a neighborhood in order to discover and learn from the signs and artworks. Sharing of local history may bring a community together through the engagement with common stories and sharing of values, and contribute to building a [[sense of place]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.preservationnation.org/2011/01/27/if-this-house-could-talk…-what-would-it-say/ ITHCT&lt;/ref&gt;  An increased appreciation for historical preservation is also a byproduct of the event.

==Critical Issues==
The historical information collected by activities such as If This House Could Talk do not necessarily have independent review or assessment and as such present history that may not be verifiable at a later date. Stories and content collected under this type of open community participation encourage the recollection and recording of local stories, however this type of history may be very personal and closer to the community based content collected by local amateur historians in the study of [[Local history]], than third party history that is traditionally researched, reviewed, and then presented by trained professional historians. The content of information presented in If This House Could Talk events is often more anecdotal or popular, and should not be confused with the more comprehensive perspective taken by the narratives of [[People's History]] that document and frame local events within a larger social and political context.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.permanentculturenow.com/introduction-to-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical review of the If This House Could Talk project in Cambridge, Massachusetts by MIT student researchers suggests that in many cases what is presented on the temporary signs are general architectural facts, rather than a sharing of personal stories that may have more power to encourage conversation and bring neighbors together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crisismedia.mit.edu/archives/354] Networked Cultures and Participatory Media: Contested Spaces, Conflict and Crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

In Newburyport, Massachusetts, the event is part of the Yankee Homecoming Heritage Tours, and is sponsored by the Newburyport Preservation Trust.  The Preservation Trust passes out free poster-board to encourage participation. The event is augmented by free home research workshops leading up to the event, where homeowners can explore the history of their house at the Newburyport Public Library's Archival center.  This includes access to local deeds, tax records, original source diaries, archival newspapers, and other material.  Residents are encouraged to involve their children and families in the research and creation of the signs - resulting a wide range of professional looking sings, as well as those made and decorated by children.  Stories are not limited to home research, but can include current day stories about the occupants (or former occupants) as well as items found on or near the property.

The Sacramento event did have signs. However, the project consisted of a series of free neighborhood workshops to help residents learn how to tell and share their collective stories, learn about the history of their homes, the people and their stories that lived in the neighborhood. Residents did learn about each other and engaged in workshops and the walking tour event. As a grass roots effort, the level of engagement is determined 1) by the residents' interest in participating, 2) and the cohesiveness that already existed in the neighborhood. As with all community engagement projects, neighbors need to have a reason or incentive to sustain their involvement on a regular basis. If this house could talk project, is a "friends making" opportunity that must become self-perpetuating to achieve any level of success. A one time event does not sustain community engagement.

== Newburyport's  "This House Could Talk " ==
[[Www.walknewburyport.com|Newburyport's "If This House  Could Talk"]] event has occurred annually since 2015.   It is a part of the annual "Yankee Homecoming" festival, which began in 1958, and was launched by New England artist Jack Frost to revive appreciation for the heritage and beauty of New England by bringing back natives and visitors to the region's towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yankeehomecoming.com/history/|title=History {{!}} Yankee Homecoming|website=yankeehomecoming.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first year of "This House Could Talk" was limited to Newburyport's south end, which included the Joppa area of the city.  It has since been expanded to incorporate the entire city of Newburyport, and has over 100 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walknewburyport.com|title=Newburyport|website=Newburyport|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Map.walknewbuyrport.com|map of the event is generated as people sign up online]], as there is no formally led tour and no paper-based walking guide - only online websites that are smart-phone friendly.

The Newburyport event is sponsored by [http://www.nbptpreservationtrust.org/ Newburyport's Preservation Trust], and is helped by support from the [https://www.newburyhistory.org/ Museum of Old Newbury] and the [https://www.newburyportpl.org/services/newburyport_archival_center Newburyport public library archival center].

[[Image:agrippa-capta.jpg|thumb|right|'Judaea Capta' coin issued by Agrippa II]]

'''Judaea Capta''' coins (also spelled '''Judea Capta''') were a series of commemorative coins originally issued by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] to celebrate the capture of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]] and the destruction of the Jewish [[Second Temple]] by his son [[Titus]] in 70 AD during the [[First Jewish–Roman War|First Jewish Revolt]]. There are several variants of the coinage. The reverse of the coins may show a female (representing Jerusalem?{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}) seated right in an attitude of mourning at the base of a palm tree, with either a captive bearded male (representing [[Judea|Judah]]?{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}})  standing left, with his hands bound behind his back, or the standing figure of the victorious emperor, or the [[Victoria (mythology)|goddess Victoria]], with a [[tropaion|trophy]] of weapons, shields, and helmets to the left.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Inscription and imagery==
The inscription appears in several versions, ''IUDAEA CAPTA'' ("Judaea [has been] conquered"/"conquered Judaea"), in rare cases the harsher ''IUDAEA DEVICTA'' or ''DEVICTA IUDAEA'' ("Judaea [has been] defeated"/"defeated Judaea"), and also ''DE IUDAEIS'' ("[the booty] from the Judaeans") and ''IUDAEA'' ("Judaea").&lt;ref&gt;D. Bernard Hoenig, "[https://members.bib-arch.org/biblical-archaeology-review/7/2/6  The Other Side of the Coin: Israel answers ancient Rome's Judea Capta series with Liberata medals]", ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' (BAR) 7:2, March/April 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moresino"/&gt; The inscription may also be in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''IOYΔAIAΣ EAΛΩKYIAΣ'',&lt;ref&gt;Nili Ahipaz, ''The Coins from Herodium — the Tomb Area'' (Chapter 10), in ''Herodium: Final Reports of the 1972–2010 Excavations Directed by Ehud Netzer'', Volume I: "Herod's Tomb Precinct", p. [http://herodium.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/team/Her1_Ahipaz.pdf  423]. Israel Exploration Society, Jerusalem 2015. {{ISBN|978-965-221-099-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a translation of the [[Latin]] ''IUDAEA CAPTA'', or it may sometimes be absent, in which case the assessment on whether the coin belongs to the series is made based on the typical imagery used by the mint.&lt;ref name="Moresino"&gt;{{cite book |author= Andrea Moresino-Zipper |title= Die Judaea-Capta-Münze und das Motiv der Palme. Römisches Siegessymbol oder Repräsentation Judäas? (The Judaea Capta coin and the image of the palm tree: Roman symbol of victory, or representation of Judaea?) |page=61, 64-67 |work= Jerusalem und die Länder: Ikonographie - Topographie - Theologie |series= Novum Testamentum et Orbis Antiquus/Studien zur Umwelt des Neuen Testaments (NTOA/StUNT) (Book 70) |editor= Gerd Theissen et al. |year= 2009 |location= Göttingen |publisher= Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn= 9783525533901 |lang= German |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3KbFImRPdT0C&amp;pg=PA61 |access-date= 26 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palm tree can appear on the coin either in combination with the mourning woman, or without her.&lt;ref name="Moresino"/&gt; Andrea Moresino-Zipper contests that in the former case, it is the woman who symbolises the defeated Judaea and the towering, dominating palm stands for victorious Rome, while in the latter case the palm tree does represent Judaea.&lt;ref name="Moresino"/&gt;

==History==
The Judaea Capta coins were struck for 25 years under Vespasian and his two sons who succeeded him as Emperor - Titus and [[Domitian]]. These commemorative coins were issued in bronze, silver and gold by mints in Rome, throughout the [[Roman Empire]], and in Judaea itself.&lt;ref name=pg15&gt;''Handbook of Biblical Numismatics'' p.[http://www.amuseum.org/book/page15.html  15]&lt;/ref&gt; They were issued in every denomination, and at least 48 different types are known.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Brin, ''Judaea Capta Coinage''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="judaea.chimehost.net"&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://judaea.chimehost.net/main/ivd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704033143/http://www.judaea.chimehost.net/main/ivd.html |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Only bronze 'Judaea Capta' coins were struck in [[Caesarea]], in the defeated Roman province of Judea. These coins are much cruder than the Roman issues, and the inscriptions are in Greek rather than Latin. The designs feature the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] writing on a shield, [[Minerva]] with a spear, shield, trophy and palm tree, etc. Most such coins were issued during the reign of the Emperor Domitian (81-96 AD).&lt;ref name=pg15/&gt;&lt;ref name="judaea.chimehost.net"/&gt;

Unusually, a 'Judaea Capta' coin was also minted by the Jewish ruler [[Agrippa II]], the great-grandson of [[Herod the Great]]. Brought up in Rome at the court of [[Claudius]], Agrippa was thoroughly Romanised and was a close friend of [[Titus]], whom he supported throughout the [[First Jewish–Roman War|First Jewish Revolt]]. His bronze coin was minted at [[Tiberias]] and shows a portrait of Titus on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] with the Greek inscription 'ΚΑΙΣΑΡ ΣΕΒΑΣ ΑΥΤΟΚΡ ΤΙΤΟΣ' (abbreviated for ''Καῖσαρ Σεβαστὸς Αυτοκράτωρ Τίτος'', in Latin: "[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] [[Imperator]] Titus"), while the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] depicted  the goddess Nike advancing right holding a wreath and palm branch over her shoulder, with a star in upper right field and the inscription 'ETO - KS BA  AGRI-PPA'.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Popular Bible-related interpretations==
To Jewish observers, the female figure may reflect the [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] prophecy of [[Isaiah]] ({{Bibleref2|Isaiah 3:8, 25-26}}): "For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen ... Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war. And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground".

The '''Khufu ship''' is an intact full-size vessel from [[Ancient Egypt]] that was sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] around 2500 BC. The ship now is preserved in the [[Giza Solar boat museum]]. The ship was almost certainly built for [[Khufu]]&lt;!-- Missing reference. How do we know it was built for Khufu?  --&gt; (King Cheops), the second pharaoh of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] of the [[Old Kingdom]] of Egypt. Like [[ancient Egyptian solar ships|other buried Ancient Egyptian ships]], it was apparently part of the extensive [[grave goods]] intended for use in the [[afterlife]], and contained no bodies, unlike northern European [[ship burial]]s.

Khufu's ship is one of the oldest, largest, and best-preserved [[Marine vessel|vessels]] from antiquity. It measures 43.6&amp;nbsp;m (143&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 5.9&amp;nbsp;m (19.5&amp;nbsp;ft) wide.

It was thus identified as the world's oldest intact ship and has been described as "a masterpiece of woodcraft" that could sail today if put into water, lake and river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwo.com/~lucumi/ships.html The Royal Ships of Egyptian Pharaohs]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vessel may not have been designed for sailing (no rigging) or paddling (no room).

The ship was one of two&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Excavates Ancient King's 4,500-Year-Old Ship|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/06/23/egypt-excavates-4500-year-old-pharaohs-boat/|accessdate=25 June 2011|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=23 June 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|quote=Archaeologists have begun excavating a 4,500-year-old wooden boat found next to the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of Egypt's main tourist attractions, Egypt's top antiquities official said Thursday.}}&lt;/ref&gt; rediscovered in 1954 by [[Kamal el-Mallakh]] – undisturbed since it was sealed into a pit carved out of the Giza bedrock. It was built largely of [[Cedrus libani|Lebanon cedar]] planking in the "shell-first" construction technique, using unpegged [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] of [[Christ's thorn]]. The ship was built with a flat bottom composed of several planks, but no actual [[keel]], with the planks and frames lashed together with [[Halfah grass]], and has been reconstructed from 1,224 pieces which had been laid in a logical, disassembled order in the pit beside the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Liesl |last2=Tyson |first2=Peter |title=Explore Ancient Egypt|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/explore-ancient-egypt.html |work=Nova |publisher=PBS |accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
It took years for the boat to be reassembled, primarily by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities' chief restorer, Ahmed Youssef Moustafa (later known as [[Haj Ahmed Youssef]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stratos |first=Anita |title=Barques, Barges, and Byblos Boats |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/aboat.htm|work=TourEgypt.net |publisher=Tour Egypt |accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before reconstructing the boat, he had to gain enough experience on Ancient Egyptian boat-building. He studied the reliefs carved on walls and tombs, and many of the little wooden models of ships and boats found in tombs. Haj Ahmed visited the Nile boatyards of Old Cairo and Ma'adi and went to Alexandria, where wooden river boats were still being made. He hoped that modern Egyptian shipwrights might have retained ship building methods that would suggest how Ancient Egyptians built their ships. Then he investigated the work of shipwrights who built in a different tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins |first=Nancy |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198001/the.smell.of.time.htm |title=The Smell of Time |work=Saudi Aramco World |publisher=Aramco Services Company |date=May 26, 1954 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
The history and function of the ship are not precisely known. It is of the type known as a "[[solar barge]]", a ritual vessel to carry the resurrected king with the sun god [[Ra]] across the heavens. However, it bears some signs of having been used in water, and it is possible that the ship was either a funerary "barge" used to carry the king's embalmed body from Memphis to Giza, or even that Khufu himself used it as a "pilgrimage ship" to visit holy places and that it was then buried for him to use in the afterlife.

The Khufu ship has been on display to the public in a specially built museum at the Giza pyramid complex since 1982. Its discovery was described as one of the greatest Ancient Egyptian discoveries in [[Zahi Hawass]]'s documentary ''[[Egypt's Ten Greatest Discoveries]]''.

The ship is housed in The Khufu Boat Museum, a small modern facility resting alongside the Great Pyramid. The first floor of the museum takes the visitor through visuals, photographs and writings on the process of excavating and restoring the boat. The ditch where the main boat was found is incorporated into the museum ground floor design. To see the restored boat, the visitor must climb a staircase leading to the second floor. Floor to ceiling windows allow for much sunlight and the wooden walkway takes the visitor around the boat where the visitor can get a close view of its impressive size- 143 feet long (44m) and 19.5 feet wide (6m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sarman |first=Danee |url=http://www.museumchick.com/museum-chick/2010/03/khufu-boat-museum-giza-egypt-felucca.html |title=Did Pharaohs Get Seasick?: Khufu Boat Museum: Giza, Egypt |publisher=MuseumChick.com. |date=March 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414182401/http://www.museumchick.com/museum-chick/2010/03/khufu-boat-museum-giza-egypt-felucca.html |archivedate=April 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lopez Museum''' is a Philippine [[art museum|art]] and [[history]] [[museum]] and [[library]] located in [[Pasig]], [[Philippines]] at the ground floor of the Benpres Building, Exchange Road corner [[Meralco Avenue]], [[Ortigas Center]].

== History ==

The Lopez Museum was founded on 13 February 1960 by Eugenio Lopez, Sr in honor of his parents, Benito Lopez and Presentacion Hofileña. Eugenio Lopez built the museum to provide scholars and students access to his personal collection of rare Filipiniana books, manuscripts, maps, archaeological artifacts and fine art.

Eugenio Lopez is known to many as a leading industrialist of post-[[World War II]] Philippines. With resources that came from sugar production, he pioneered in diverse fields of business including [[Transportation industry|transportation]] (bus, taxicab and air transport operations), [[mass media]] ([[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[The Manila Chronicle]]), [[Energy industry|energy]] ([[MERALCO]]) becoming one of the first Filipino successes in business in a then largely American dominated economy.

A staunch nationalist, Eugenio Lopez believed that by preserving and promoting the Filipino heritage, his country men would eventually develop sense of national pride and enable the country to develop a unified spirit ultimately resulting in ensuring a strengthening of a collective national soul in the succeeding generations.

He died in July 1975 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States, where he had lived in self-imposed exile since 1972, away from the oppression of [[martial law]]. He had led a full life as a leading industrialist and a media magnate, leaving behind him a legacy for the Filipino people.

== The art collection ==

As is the story for most museums built from a core of personal acquisitions, the Lopez Museum collection is an amalgam of objects reflecting the overt as well as latent idiosyncrasies of each of its curators and directors. Apart from constituting a seminal contribution to extant Philippine heritage, the Lopez Museum collection stands as one of the oldest, publicly accessible private art collections in the country.

Eminent historian Renato Constantino was Lopez Museum's first curator, from 1960 to 1972. Engaged by LMM founder and prominent antiquarian Eugenio Lopez, Sr (Eñing), it was only logical that it would be under his watch that the museum acquired Juan Luna's ''[[España y Filipinas]]'', a seminal work much cited for capturing the image of a country patronizingly led up the rungs of evolutionary colonial tutelage. Such acquisitions complemented the Philippine rare books and antiquarian map collection amassed by Eñing, who in consultation with renowned collector and connoisseur Alfonso Ongpin, further acquired other seminal and technically astute works by Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, and Fernando Amorsolo. A second key acquisition phase was led by Eñing's youngest son, Roberto Lopez who was inclined toward Philippine Modernism, thus improving this aspect of the LMM collection with works vetted under the supervision of art historian, Rod Paras Perez.

An even more pronounced and art historically-sensitive acquisition program was adopted under the term of Eugenio Lopez, Jr who was at the helm of LMM from 1993 to 1999. Lopez, Jr worked alongside a sharp professional complement made up of Mariles Ebro Matias, Joselina Cruz, and Maita Reyes who collaboratively elevated LMM's museum education, curatorial, and conservation programs unto previously unreached heights. It was during these successive phases that key works of national artists (Carlos Francisco, Napoleon Abueva, Hernando Ocampo, Vicente Manansala, Cesar Legaspi, Victorio Edades, Jeremias Elizalde Navarro, Arturo Luz, Jose Joya, Ang Kiukok, Benedicto Cabrera) as well as the works of younger, emergent voices further layered the discursive potential of LMM's visual art trove. The current leadership, under Oscar Lopez and Director Mercedes Vargas, intends to keep its library and art collection holdings current and significant, while keeping abreast with international museum standards relevant to contemporary exhibition discourse, heritage conservation, extension, and outreach.

Expectedly, the character of the Lopez Museum collection has cumulatively morphed with the institution's shifting concerns. Presently, one of the major challenges confronting LMM is the need to continually showcase segments of its permanent collection alongside contemporary Filipino creative expression couched within the frames of increasing interdisciplinarity and merging communication platforms. It is in this light that curation brings the possibility of infusing context and sub-text to an otherwise private quest for personal roots and a shared locus for nationalist heritage.

== The library collection: 600 years of history ==

Consisting of over 19,000 Filipiniana titles by about 12,000 authors, the Lopez Library houses an invaluable collection of Philippine incunabula, rare books, manuscripts, dictionaries, literary works in Western and vernacular languages, religious tracts, periodicals, newspapers, coffee table volumes, academic treatises, contemporary writing, maps, archival photographs, cartoons and microfilms. It remains a critical node in the small network of institutions devoted to ongoing Philippine scholarship produced locally and internationally.

Among its more important holdings are 21 rare titles of Philippine imprints dated from 1597 to 1800, 69 key titles from the 18th century, and 777 titles from the 19th century. The library's rare books and manuscripts include those of eminent printers, Tomas Pinpin, Raymundo Magysa, Nicolas Bagay, Laureano Atlas, and [[Juan Correa]]. The library is home to the first edition of Belarmin-Lopez's ''[[Doctrina Cristiana]]'' (Manila 1620) translated into [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]] (Libro a naisuratan amin ti bagas), Pedro Chirino's ''Relacion de las Islas Filipinas'', as well as key editions of Antonio de Morga's ''Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas'' (Jose Rizal's 1890 edition, Blair and Robertson's 1904 edition, and W. E. Retana's 1909 edition).

In addition to a huge aggregate of secondary works on the National Hero, Dr Jose Rizal authored by both Filipino and Western authors, the Lopez Library also serves as steward to 93 of Rizal's letters to his parents, sisters, brother and brothers-in-law, among other objects which constitute the most priceless items in LMM's Rizaliana collection.

Among other items worthy of note are a variety of dictionaries, grammar books, and LMM's collection of devotional literature: sermons, novenas, accounts of the lives of saints that were used as tools in the propagation of Roman Catholicism during the Spanish colonial period. Equally important and indispensable are such primary sources as the manuscripts and personal papers of individuals such as [[:ca:Pau Pastells i Vila|Pablo Pastells]], Gaspar de San Agustín, [[Eulogio Despujol]], H. L. Legarda, Manuel Sastron y Piñol, and Justo Zaragosa.

[[Microfilm]] copies of the Philippine Revolutionary papers, commonly known as the Philippine Insurgent Records, American Consular Reports (1817–1898) from the [[National Archives]], [[Washington, DC]], United States. and several reels of the British Consular Reports, circa 1844–1898, together with the H. H. Bartlett collection from the [[American Philosophical Society Library]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA, are among the significant additions to the library's growing microfilm collection which also includes the [[Tribune (disambiguation)|Tribune]] (1925–1945), [[Manila Chronicle]] (1945–1972), [[Harpers Weekly]], and other key periodicals which are already accessible through digitized versions.

LMM's deep archive of photographs includes a substantial collection of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, early years of the American regime, the Commonwealth era, the post-independence period, up to Martial Law. Other more recent additions that may be of interest to both researchers and casual readers are dissertations on the Philippines submitted to various universities and colleges in the United States (in xerographic and acid free reprints from the [[University Microfilm]], [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], USA). These dissertations cover the period of 1958–1997.

===LVN memorabilia===
On July 27, 2008, rare LVN memorabilia were donated to the Lopez Museum by the heirs of [[Narcisa de Leon|Doña Narcisa Buencamino vda. De Leon]], represented by Narcisa L. Escaler and Nieva Paz L. Eraña. LVN's name was coined, in 1938, from the first letters of the owners’ names: De Leon, Carmen Villongco and Eleuterio Navoa Jr. De Leon, known as Doña Sisang who became president after buying out the inactive partner-families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=126632  abs-cbnnews.com, Rare LVN memorabilia find a home in Lopez Museum]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digitization project: Preserving the library collections ==

One of two parallel and collaborative programs (the other being Conservation) that is envisioned to preserve and promote the Library collection, the Digitization Project aims to accomplish the following:

* capture, catalogue and store images of original materials
* make these images searchable/accessible/retrievable for a greater range of users
* protect and preserve the originals by reducing handling, and
* contribute to making the operation of the Library cost-efficient

== Exhibition program ==

Since its inception in the 1960s, the Lopez Museum has primarily been identified as a key viewing venue for important works by Spanish colonial period painters Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo. However, with the museum's transition to Pasig and a deliberate shift to more dynamic acquisition and exhibition programs, LMM spatially reconfigured its galleries and adjunct exhibition spaces to showcase key objects from the permanent collection alongside other newer, acquired pieces such as those by national artists Francisco, Manansala, Ocampo, Legaspi, Edades, Luz, et al. and commissioned installations and contemporary artifacts such as [[film]]s, [[Television program|TV clips]], [[video]], and other [[multimedia]] work.

Beginning in 2001, LMM instilled a semi-annual changing exhibit program in an effort to practice prudent resource use as well as infuse its exhibitions with a less-static character. This tactical shift sought to balance attention to interpreting segments of the permanent collection aongside exploring intersections in contemporary as well as pop-inflected artistic expression through curatorial intervention and the instigation of artists’ projects. LMM's exhibitions have included:

* Fixation: Notions of Obsession brought a selection of LMM's pieces in conversation with the object troves and installations of Raymond Red, Alfredo and Isabel Aquilizan, Ikoy Ricio, and Alice &amp; Lucinda;
* Projections: Maps, directions &amp; sites, distortions, charts, detours, rumblings &amp; ramblings, a seminal examination of the LMM map collection amidst territorial investigations in the works of Lordy Rodriguez, Mafe Baluyos, Erwin Leaño, and Lena Cobangbang;
* Grave Findings: A Reclamation Project allowed Maria Taniguchi to mimic and re-stage the excavations done in [[Calatagan]], [[Batangas]] the site from which pre-colonial funerary furniture now ensconced in the LMM collection was originally drawn;
* Juan Arellano: Drawing Space was a modest survey of paintings and drawings by the renowned American colonial period architect and re-invested with a contemporary re-reading in a multimedia installation by Datu Arellano;
* Babble, Bauble: Tweaking Femme was a visual attempt to look at female representation in images from LMM's art collection, contemporary film and television; and he concluded Fuzzy Logic: Art and Technology, which was an examination of the ambivalent relationships of thread art and science in the cross-generational practice of Kidlat Tahimik, Santiago Bose, Charlie Co, Yason Banal, Louie Cordero, Alfred Villaruel, Wire Tuazon, among others as juxtaposed against LMM pieces by Navarro, Roberto Chabet, Ray Albano, Galo and Hernando Ocampo, [[Alfonso A. Ossorio]], etc.

This current exhibition tract has thus far allowed the museum to attempt at tentative but less canonical and perhaps necessary re-consideration of the bodies of work of artists it has had a hand in validating through its collections. It has likewise created opportunities for LMM to interrogate its own museological track amidst the parallel practices of other institutions it works alongside with or to which it serves as de facto counterpoints to.

* The Sum of its Parts shows its heritage of unique expertise in conservation and acquisition in the collections or works by Hidalgo, Luna, Pacita Abad, Nena Saguil, Juvenal Sanso, Claudio Bravo, and contemporary artist Jonathan Olazo's installation work (taking off from his father, Romulo Olazo, known for his 1960s "Diaphanous Series": graphic art medium of printmaking).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=120321 abs-cbnnews.com, Lopez Memorial Museum showcases "The Sum of Its Parts"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keeping the Faith: Acts of Mediation featured contemporary artist Kiri Dalena, filmmakers Egay Navarro and Rica Concepcion, and sculptor Agnes Arellano showed their works respectively, alongside works of 19th century masters Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, national artists Vicente Manansala, J Elizalde Navarro, Benedicto Cabrera, and artists such as Jose Tence Ruiz and Danilo Dalena. Dalena's installation "Barricade, book of slogans, erased slogans, and isolation room" referenced images from the Lopez library archive of materials from the martial law period. The show also presents Navarro and Concepcion's documentary on the late Baguio artist Roberto Villanueva as well as Arellano's sculptural work "Angel of Death and Bronze Bullets." Curated by husband and wife team of Claro and Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez, the exhibit explores the notions of access across the registers of time and place. Eileen said, "As you come and see this exhibition, you would come away with a sense of how we've tried to negotiate the Bridges theme in terms of how, as human beings, we constantly have to deal with being made to stay put or move on literally and metaphorically ... Every exhibition here at Lopez opens up to us the privilege of engaging with contemporary artists who we strongly feel can bring into the museum new ideas and voices that challenge us to re-think and re-evaluate our intentions and museological practices." The exhibit was part of the annual project Zero In, undertaken by a consortium of private museums composed of Ateneo Art Gallery, Ayala Museum, Bahay Tsinoy, Lopez Museum and Museo Pambata.

== Education and publications programs ==

Apart from tending to its intrinsic stewardship function as a heritage institution, Lopez Museum has also consistently been proactive in the area of audience development. Thus, the museum has also been the site of a wide diversity of workshop offerings and thought-provoking public talks and roundtable conversations carried out alongside its archival and exhibition services. Over the past six years, LMM has invited exhibiting artists, critics, curators, cultural workers, as well as other cross-disciplinary academics and scholars to engage with the museum's menu of curatorial and outreach talking points which touch on a range encompassing psychology, sociology, political science, anthropology, the natural and physical sciences, to more emergent fields of discourse such as new media studies and pop culture. These events have allowed museum visitors and researchers to encounter first-hand such individuals as Ambeth Ocampo, Benedicto Cabrera, Cid Reyes, Patrick Flores, Kidlat Tahimik, among many others.

Students and lovers of geography, history, politics, art and education will delight in Lopez Memorial Museum's exhibits showcasing rare maps in one and school texts in the other. Maps are not just physical but charged political delimitations of territory in the exhibit ''Tutelage'' [http://lopezlink.ph/lopez-museum/403-exhibits] at the Library. The exhibit Double ''Take'' at the main gallery, features works from the museum's permanent collection, LVN archival photographs and a video installation by featured artist, director Raya Martin.

Also as an explicit demonstration of its commitment to scholarship are the slew of publications that have seen print under LMM's initiative. These include: ''The Philippine Insurrection Against the US'' edited by Renato Constantino, ''Juan Luna: The Filipino Painter'' by Santiago A. Pilar, ''Orchidiana Philippiniana'' by Helen Valmayor, ''Philippine Rariora'' by Mauro Garcia, ''Manansala Nudes and Fernando Zobel'' by Rod Paras-Perez. Its most recent releases are Locus: Interventions in Art Practice (co-published through the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and Pananaw ng Sining Bayan, Inc.) and LMM's contribution to the Philippine Centennial, Hidalgo and the Generation of 1872 by Alfredo Roces.

Throughout the years, LMM has also hosted continuing education classes in allied disciplines such as creative writing, book binding, book repair, drawing, cartooning, textile crafts among others. Several workshops catering to the museum professional have also been given and this include disaster preparedness and docent trainings

== Institutional collaborations ==

With the aim of further broadening its audience reach and deepening its network partnerships, Lopez Museum has helped initiate a consortium of cultural institutions called [[Zero-in]] (with the [[Ayala Museum]], and the [[Ateneo Art Gallery]] as original members). Since expanding to include [[Museo Pambata]] and [[Bahay Tsinoy]], the Zero-in consortium has come together annually to mount a multi-venue series of exhibitions that allow these institutions to explore avenues for potential synergy visà-vis their collections and interesting technical expertise. Now into its sixth year, Zero-in has launched outreach programs to public school teachers and students, and facilitated ongoing and past loans and projects among its member institutions. Lopez Museum has also partnered up in varying degrees with such institutions as the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]], [[Japan Foundation]], [[Casa Asia]], the [[Museum Foundation of the Philippines]], Metrobank Foundation, Prince Klaus Foundation, and [[CollAsia 2010]].

== The future: New media ==

Any learning institution in this age of information overloading faces the daunting task of keeping a largely distracted audience keyed into how the past and present converge, that is, without getting pulled into all sorts of unsustainable tracts. Now practically half-a-century old, the Lopez Museum finds itself precisely at that precarious perch, of having to run a tight ship amidst a rapidly changing communications technology landscape.

Lopez Museum “is a very traditional institution, but what I wanted to do was to explore ways to use new media and more visual learning. I also wanted to make the Museum more visible in all our network’s platforms—TV, radio and glossies (magazines)”, Director Vargas relates.

The Museum under Vargas is keenly aware of its need to engage its target publics not only in terms of developing critical reader-visitors but in making museums a more likely destination among those seeking time-worthy pursuits. She elaborates: “we’re not a museum-going public. People are more concerned with survival, with basic needs. The sad part is that the Filipino is so artistic—we have such a rich and varied culture but it does not take precedence because (so many) are below the poverty level. So, one of my goals is to promote museum awareness among the younger generation.”

As it passes into another half-century of further nurturing a new contingent of driven museum workers and crafters of culture, Lopez Museum looks forward to how it can dynamically play a role in taking stock of past and current intellectual production and giving this back to those who can make best sense of it in the everyday life of the present Filipino.

[[File:Astrological remedies.jpg|thumb|300px|right|This table, from an 18th-century [[Iceland]]ic manuscript, links astrological dates with the preparation of medicine.]]
Medical astrology posits the association of each sign of the [[zodiac]] with parts of the body, and was already mentioned by [[Marcus Manilius]] (1st century AD) in his epic [[poem]] (8000 verses) ''Astronomica''. The signs of the [[zodiac]] were believed to preside over the parts of the body, covering the body from head (Aries) to toe (Pisces).

[[File:Anatomical Man.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The anatomical-astrological human]]

After examining an individual's [[natal chart]], a medical astrologer may give advice to the client about the areas of the body in which they are most likely to experience trouble.  For instance, an individual with the Sun, Moon, [[Ascendant]], or many planets in the sign of Aries is presumed to have more headaches than other people because of the association of Aries with the head.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}''[[ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]''

He was murdered in [[Jerusalem]] by [[Palestinians]] during the [[First Intifada]].

==Biography==
Menahem Stern was born in 1925 in [[Białystok]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. His father was a [[Lithuania]]n [[misnaged]] while his mother came from a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] family. In his childhood he studied [[Hebrew]] and religious texts, but later acquired a general education that included [[Latin]]. In 1938 he immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] with his parents via [[Vienna]]. They settled in [[Haifa]], where he studied at the [[Hebrew Reali School]]. When the family moved to [[Tel Aviv]], he switched to Geulah high school, from which he graduated in 1942.

In 1943, after working on a [[kibbutz]] for a year, he enrolled in the [[Jewish history|History of the Jewish people]], General History and Classical Studies departments at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1950, he received his [[Master's degree|M.A.]].

In 1952, after his marriage to Hava Brenner, the niece of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] [[author]] [[Yosef Haim Brenner]], he spent two and a half years at [[Oxford]]. Upon his return to [[Jerusalem]] in 1954 he received the highest research award in Jewish Studies of the Warburg Foundation. After a year he began teaching at the university. In 1960 he received his [[Ph.D.]] and was appointed Lecturer of the History of the Jewish people in Second Temple period. In 1964 he was promoted to [[Senior Lecturer]], in 1966 to [[Associate Professor]] and in 1971 to Full Professor.

==Awards and honours==
In 1977, Stern won the [[Israel Prize]], for history of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web|title=Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1977 (in Hebrew) |url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashlag/Tashmab_Tashlag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashlaz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023718/http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashlag/Tashmab_Tashlag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashlaz |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, he was appointed to the Israeli National Academy of Science and became one of its most active members.

He was president of the Historical Society of Israel, a founder of the Zalman Shazar Center and an editor of "Zion". He was on the Executive Committee of the World Union of Jewish Studies and was very active in Yad Yitzhak Ben Zvi.

==Murder==
On June 22, 1989, Stern was murdered by Arab [[Terrorism|terrorists]] while walking to the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in [[Givat Ram]] through the [[Valley of the Cross]] in Jerusalem, as he did every day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindasog.com/public/terrorvictims.htm A History of Terrorism in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228022347/http://www.lindasog.com/public/terrorvictims.htm |date=2011-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left a wife, a son and three daughters.

He declares himself a conservative and advocate for the "three pillars of conservative politics" – Christianity, patriotism and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Кой идва след старите кучета|url=http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/bulgaria/2009/03/20/693238_koi_idva_sled_starite_kucheta/|work=Capital.bg|publisher=Economedia|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also critical of the legal framework of abortion and [[same-sex marriage]].

== Biography ==
He is born on June 3, 1979 in the family of his father, the artist [[Nikolay Nikolov-Zikov]] and his mother, a doctor. In 1998 he graduated from the [[NGDEK|National School for Ancient Languages and Cultures]]; he then graduated as bachelor in political science at [[Sofia University]] (2002) and master of political management (2004). He's married and has three daughters. His wife Pavlina is the granddaughter of [[Yordan Sokolov]] – notable politician from the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) and [[Chairperson of the National Assembly of Bulgaria|Speaker]] of the 38th [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]] of [[Bulgaria]].

=== Professional career ===
Since 1999 he has been publishing articles in popular right-wing newspapers such as Democracy, Pro and Anti and Seven. In 2000 he joined the analysis department of UDF. After the divide of UDF in 2004 Nikolov became head of the political section of [[Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria]] (DSB). From 2008 to 2009 he ran his own political TV show – "Thursday Club".

Petar Nikolov was awarded a PhD by [[New Bulgarian University]] (NBU) in 2010 and is assistant professor of political science in NBU since then. In 2011 he published his first book ''The Birth of Bulgarian conservatism''; the year after he published ''The House of Sratsimir'', which was then continued by his next historical monograph ''The True story of the Principality of Vidin''. In 2017 Nikolov's fourth monograph, ''The Political Conservatism'', came out of print, written in co-authorship with his colleague from NBU Dr. [[Irena Todorova]].
From 2015 to 2017 Petar Nikolov is the editor-in-chief of the academic magazine ''[[Conservative Quarterly]]''.

=== Political career ===

Nikolov first ran for parliament in 2009, leading the list of DSB in [[Lovech]]. Although he didn't become an MP, his positive performance was awarded with a seat in the national committee of the party by the leader [[Ivan Kostov]]. He then quickly becomes Kostov's main spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Кой идва след старите кучета|url=http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/bulgaria/2009/03/20/693238_koi_idva_sled_starite_kucheta/|work=Capital.bg|publisher=Economedia|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolov was the strategist behind Proshko Proshkov's campaign for mayor of Sofia in 2011. Proshkov won the internal elections in DSB and became the party nominee but subsequently couldn't defeat the sitting mayor. Due to internal conflicts Nikolov and Proshkov left the party together with [[Daniel Mitov]] and [[Hristo Angelichin]] (future minister and deputy minister of foreign affairs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Изгубеното поколение на ДСБ|url=http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/bulgaria/2012/03/30/1798965_izgubenoto_pokolenie_na_dsb/|work=Capital.bg|publisher=Economedia|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all joined [[Meglena Kuneva]]'s party [[Bulgaria for Citizens Movement]] (BCM) in 2012. With BCM in 2013 Nikolov ran another unsuccessful MP campaign.

In 2014 Petar Nikolov founded the [[Institute for Right-Wing Policy]] which aimed to promote and facilitate the coalition between [[GERB]] and the [[Reformist Bloc]]. After the coalition came into being, Nikolov was appointed parliamentary secretary of the [[Government of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] by PM [[Boyko Borissov]].

Nikolov delivered a surprise in 2017, announcing that he's going to run for parliament from the list of [[United Patriots]]. Although he performed well above his party's average result, he still couldn't make it into the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National assembly]].  Initially, during the formation of the coalition between GERB and the United Patriots, his candidacy was promoted to the post of [[Ministry of Culture (Bulgaria)|culture minister]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Културата се оказа Гордиевият възел в преговорите между ГЕРБ и Патриотите|url=https://offnews.bg/news/Politika_8/Kulturata-se-okaza-Gordieviiat-vazel-v-pregovorite-mezhdu-GERB-i-Patri_653513.html|work=OffNews.bg|publisher=Off Media|accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then Petar Nikolov was appointed for [[Ministry of Education and Science (Bulgaria)|Deputy Minister of Education and Science]].

Fraser was born on 6 April 1918.&lt;ref name="obit - Independent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Peter Fraser|last=Hornblower|first=Simon|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-fraser-403427.html|accessdate=8 July 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in [[Carshalton]], Surrey.&lt;ref name="obit - Annual of the British School at Athens"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornblower|first=Simon|title=Peter Fraser MA, MC, FBA (1918–2007)|journal=The Annual of the British School at Athens|year=2008|volume=103|pages=1–7|jstor=30245259|doi=10.1017/s0068245400000046}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[City of London School]], [[Single-sex education|boys']] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] [[day school]] in the [[City of London]], England.&lt;ref name="obit - Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Peter Fraser|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2080303.ece|accessdate=8 July 2013|newspaper=The Times|date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a classical scholarship to [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] where he studied for [[Honour Moderations|mods]] the first part of ''[[Literae Humaniores]]''. His studies were interrupted by his military service in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; He returned to Oxford after the war. He wrote a thesis on [[Hellenistic]] [[Rhodes]], which he entered for and won the prestigious [[Conington Prize]].&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt;

==Military service==
With [[World War II]] interrupting his studies, Fraser joined the [[Seaforth Highlanders]], [[British Army]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="Who Was Who"&gt;{{cite web|title=FRASER, Peter Marshall|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U16394|work=Who Was Who|publisher=A &amp; C Black|accessdate=8 July 2013|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] on 16 August 1941, having attended an Officer Cadet Training Unit. He was given the [[service number]] 201494.&lt;ref name="LG 29 August 1941"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35262 |date=29 August 1941 |pages=5093–5094  |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was because of his knowledge and interest in Classical Greece, that he was recruited by the [[Special Operations Executive]].&lt;ref name="All Souls Commemoration" /&gt; Between 1943 and 1945, he was involved in the British Military Mission to [[Axis occupation of Greece|Axis occupied Greece]].&lt;ref name="Who Was Who" /&gt; On 12 July 1943, he parachuted into Greece near the town of [[Kalamata]]. He gradually moved through the [[Peloponnese]] to the [[Argolis and Corinthia Prefecture]]. There he spent the winter of 1943 and the spring of 1944. His mission was to arm and assist the 'officer bands', the non-communist [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] groups. However, the pre-existing structure of the [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] meant that by October 1943 only the communist resistance were strong enough to continue the fight against the occupiers. Fraser described his relationship with the [[EAM-ELAS]] as "the worst, since my original
mission in that area was to try to find and, having found, to arm non-ELAS '[[andartes]]' ".&lt;ref name="All Souls Commemoration" /&gt;

In 1944, he led a raid on a Nazi [[airfield]] near [[Argos]], resulting in its successful destruction.&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; By the end of the war, he was effectively the commander of [[Volos]].&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt;

==Academic career==
In 1948, Fraser was made [[University Lecturer]] in Hellenistic History at the [[University of Oxford]]. As he was not made a [[fellow]] of one of the colleges at this time, he did not undertake [[Tutorial system|tutorial teaching]], but focused on research and lecturing.&lt;ref name="All Souls Commemoration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Marshall Fraser- A Commemoration|url=http://stathis.research.yale.edu/documents/FraserMemorial.pdf|publisher=All Souls College|accessdate=8 July 2013|author1=Professor Stathis Kalyvas |author2=Professor Fergus Millar |author3=Professor Tony Honoré |format=pdf|date=31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s, he taught [[undergraduates]], including [[George Forrest (historian)|George Forrest]], [[Ancient Rome|early Roman history]] from a Greek perspective.&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt; In 1954, he was appointed Fellow of [[All Souls College]], the post-graduate only college, where he would supervise doctoral students.&lt;ref name="bio - British Academy" /&gt; He supervised [[Fergus Millar]] during his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D. Phil.]].&lt;ref name="All Souls Commemoration" /&gt; He was promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Hellenistic History in 1964.&lt;ref name="Who Was Who" /&gt; He retired from his university lecture post in 1985 and from his college fellowship in 1987.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt;

He held a number of college appointments at All Souls. He was [[Bursar|Domestic Bursar]] between 1962 and 1965. He was Sub-Warden from 1980 to 1982, and from 1985 to 1987, served as acting [[Warden (college)|warden]] of the college.&lt;ref name="Who Was Who" /&gt; He held the position in place of [[Patrick Neill, Baron Neill of Bladen|Patrick Neill]] during the first two years of his period as [[Vice-Chancellor]].&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt;

He held a number of positions outside the University of Oxford. He succeeded [[Peter Megaw]] in 1968 as director of the [[British School at Athens]]. He held the position to 1971.&lt;ref name="Who Was Who" /&gt; He was Visiting Professor of Classical Studies at [[Indiana University Bloomington]] for the academic year 1973 to 1974.&lt;ref name="All Souls Commemoration" /&gt; He chaired the [[Society of Afghan Studies]] from 1972 to 1982.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt;

==Later life==
Fraser was made an [[Emeritus]] Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]] in 1995, a position he held till his death.&lt;ref name="bio - British Academy" /&gt;

He died on 15 September 2007, at the age of 89. He was survived by his six children and his third wife. His ashes were interred in the British Military Cemetery on the Greek island of [[Cephalonia]].&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3907">'''Peter Langtoft''', also known as '''Peter of Langtoft''' ({{lang-fro|Piers de Langtoft}}; died {{circa}} 1305) was an [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English historian and chronicler]] who took his name from the small village of [[Langtoft, East Riding of Yorkshire|Langtoft]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].

Langtoft was an [[Augustinian]] canon regular at [[Bridlington]] Priory who wrote a history of England in [[Anglo-Norman literature|Anglo-Norman verse]], popularly known as ''Langtoft's Chronicle''.  The history narrates the history of England from the legendary founding of Britain by [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] to the death of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langtoft|first1=Peter|title=Chronicle of England, Part 3: The Reign of Edward I|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-GG-00001-00001/664|website=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first part of Langtoft's [[Chronicle]] is translated from [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'', and the second part is drawn from a number of sources, including [[Henry of Huntingdon]]'s ''Historia Anglorum''.  The third part is widely considered to be original work by Langtoft, and he includes in it details not recorded elsewhere such as the fate of [[Gwenllian of Wales|Gwenllian]], daughter of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], Prince of Wales.  On the whole, the Chronicle is virulently anti-Scottish and famously contains nine 'songs', in both [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle English language|Middle English]], supposedly capturing the taunts between English and Scottish soldiers during the Anglo-Scottish conflicts of the late-13th and early-14th centuries.

''Langtoft's Chronicle'' was the source of the second part of [[Robert Mannyng]]'s ''[[Mannyng's Chronicle|Middle English Chronicle]]'', completed around 1338. Piers Langtoft's ''Chronicle'', as translated, illustrated and improv'd by [[Robert Mannyng|Robert of Brunne]], was also transcribed and published, in two volumes, by [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]] in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Langtoft, [[Robert Mannyng|Robert of Brunne]], [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgIAQAAMAAJ ''Peter Langtoft's Chronicle''] (1725) in two volumes.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Gellately''' (born 1943) is a Canadian academic who is one of the leading historians of modern Europe, particularly during World War II and the Cold War era.

He earned his B.A., B.Ed., and M.A. degrees at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] and his Ph.D. at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mun.ca/gazette/past/issues/vol38no12/gellately.php|title=Dr. Robert John Gellately|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Gazette|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He began his professional career at [[Cornell University]], followed by positions at the [[University of Western Ontario]] and [[Clark University]], where he was the Strassler Family Professor in Holocaust History.  Since 2003, he has been the Earl Ray Beck Professor of History at [[Florida State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Florida State University - Curriculum Vitae Robert J Gellately [www.fsu.edu/cvdb/RGELLATELY.rtf] Retrieved 14 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He often teaches classes about World War II and the Cold War, but his extensive interest in the Holocaust has led to his conducting research regarding other genocides as well. He is occasionally known to give lectures on specific genocides. Gellately has very strict guidelines for what he will deem a genocide, and has had several televised debates regarding his somewhat controversial views.

Gellately's most recent work is ''Stalin's Curse: Battling for Communism in War and Cold War'' (Knopf (March 5, 2013).
Gellately recently published a set of original documents by [[Leon Goldensohn]] dealing with the 1945–46 [[Nuremberg trials]] of war criminals in ''The Nuremberg Interviews: An American Psychiatrist's Conversations With The Defendants and Witnesses'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 2004).

His other books include ''Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, 1933–1945'' (Oxford University Press, 2001). It has been published in German, Dutch, Spanish, Czech, Portuguese and Italian. Japanese and French translations are in press. ''Backing Hitler'' was chosen as a main selection for book clubs in North America and the United Kingdom.

In the book ''Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, 1933–1945'', Gellately argues that the Gestapo were not in fact all-pervasive and intrusive as they have been described.  The Gestapo only numbered 32,000 for the entire population of Germany, and this clearly limited their impact.  In the city of Hanover there were only 42 officers.  Instead, Gellately says that the atmosphere of terror and fear was maintained by 'denunciations' from ordinary Germans, whereby they would inform any suspicious 'anti-Nazi' activity to the local Nazi authority.  According to Gellately, these denunciations were the cause of most prosecutions, as in Saarbrücken 87.5 per cent of cases of 'slander against the regime' came from denunciations.  This diminished the Gestapo's role in maintaining fear and terror throughout the Third Reich, however they still proved to be a powerful instrument for Hitler and continued to provide the security apparatus needed for the Nazi Regime.

His first book was ''The Politics of Economic Despair: Shopkeepers in German Politics, 1890–1914'' (London, 1974). In 1991 he published ''The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy, 1933–1945'' (Oxford University Press). It has been translated into German and Spanish.

In addition, Gellately has co-edited a volume of essays with Russian specialist [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], ''Accusatory Practices: Denunciation in Modern European History, 1789–1989'' (University of Chicago Press, 1997). With his colleague [[Nathan Stoltzfus]] (also at [[Florida State University]]) he co-edited a collection called ''[[Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany]]'' (Princeton University Press, 2001). With [[Ben Kiernan]], Director of the Genocide Studies program at Yale, he recently co-edited ''The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003).

Professor Gellately has won numerous research awards, including grants from the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] in Germany and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]]. Many of the books written or edited by him are used as textbooks in college classrooms across America.

'''Silivri''' (Selymbria) is a city and a district in [[Istanbul Province]] along the [[Sea of Marmara]] in Turkey, outside metropolitan [[Istanbul]], containing many holiday and weekend homes for residents of the city. The largest city in the district is also named Silivri. The mayor is Özcan Işıklar ([[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]]).

Silivri is located bordering [[Büyükçekmece]] to the east, [[Çatalca]] to the north, [[Çorlu]] and [[Marmara Ereğli]] (both districts of [[Tekirdağ Province]]) to the west, [[Çerkezköy]] to the north-west (one of [[Tekirdağ Province]]) and with the Sea of Marmara to the south. It is with an area of {{convert|760|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} the second largest district of [[Istanbul Province]] after [[Çatalca]]. The seat of the district is the city of Silivri.

The district consists of 8 towns and 18 villages, and its population is 155,923 (2013 census). 75,702 in the city of Silivri, the remaining in the surrounding towns and villages – listed below.

Established in 2008, Turkey's most modern and Europe's largest [[Silivri Prison|prison complex]] is located {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Silivri.

==History==
[[File:The fort and town of Silivria, the ancient Selymbria, on the Sea of Marmara - Francis Hervé - 1832.jpg|thumb|''The fort and town of Silivria, the ancient Selymbria, on the Sea of Marmara – Drawn from nature by [[Francis Hervé|F. Hervé]], Esq.'' (about 1832).
Courtesy of Gürhan Altan, Istanbul]]
Silivri, the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Selymbria''' or '''Selybria''' ({{lang-el|Σηλυ(μ)βρία}}), owed its historical importance to the natural harbor and the position on the major commercial roads. It was a colony of [[Megara]] founded on a steep 56&amp;nbsp;m high hill east of the bay, but excavations show that it was a Thracian settlement before it was a Greek colony.

According to [[Strabo]], the city's name is a combination of the name of the mythological founder of the city, Selus, and the Thracian word that Strabo thought was used for'' polis'', "bria". This, however, did not mean polis,&lt;ref name="cah"/&gt; and had another meaning.

Silivri is the birthplace of the physician [[Herodicus]], and was an ally of the [[Athens|Athenians]] in 351 BC. Until the second half of the 2nd century BC, the city could preserve its autonomy, but after its neighbours [[Byzantium]] and [[Marmara Ereğlisi|Perinthos]] became more powerful,  the city fell under their control during the next centuries. The settlement shrank into a village under the governance  of the Roman Empire. In the early 5th century, the town was officially renamed '''Eudoxiopolis''' (Εὐδοξιόπολις) in [[Greek language|Greek]], during the reign of the Byzantine emperor [[Arcadius]] (377–408), after his wife [[Aelia Eudoxia]], though this name did not survive.  In 805 AD, the Bulgarian Khan [[Kroum]] pillaged the town. In the late 9th century, Emperor [[Michael III]] constructed a fortress on the top of the hill, the ruins of which still remain, during an era in which the [[Byzantine Empire]] suffered attacks by [[Saracen]] [[pirate|corsair]]s and [[Russians]]. With the [[Fourth Crusade]], and the fall of Constantinople to the [[Latin Empire]] in 1204, the fortress fell in quick succession to the [[Latin Empire]], Bulgarian, back to the Latins and finally was recaptured by the Byzantine successor state of the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1247, who were finally able to recapture Constantinople and restore the empire in 1261.

In 1346, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s became an ally of the pretender for the Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzenus]] (1292–1383), and helped him against his rival [[John V Palaeologus]] (1332–1391). The same year, Sultan [[Orhan I]] married Theodora, the daughter of John VI in Selymbria.

In 1399, Selymbria fell to the Ottomans, marking their complete encirclement of Constantinople by land in Europe. Many contemporary observers believed from then on it was a mere matter of time before the Ottomans took the Byzantine capital. However, after their disastrous defeat at the hands of [[Timur]] the Ottomans returned Selymbria and several other possessions to the Byzantines in 1403. It was sometimes attacked by the Ottomans in later years, but was not captured.

During the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Silivri, along with [[Epibatos]], stood up against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies, and surrendered only after the city had fallen. Selymbria extended out of the walls only during the Ottoman era because the non-[[Muslim]] residents like [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and [[Jews]] lived within the city walls, and the Turks built their houses outside the walls at the coast. While the non-Muslims were engaged mostly in growing grapes, [[vinification]] and [[silk]] production, the Turks earned their life by fishing and making yogurt. The town remained a summer resort during the Ottoman time, as it was during the Byzantine era.

[[File:OldBridgeSilivri01.JPG|thumb|Mimar Sinan Bridge in Silivri.]]
On the order of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], architect [[Mimar Sinan]] built 1562 a stone bridge with 33 arches just west of Silivri. The historical bridge, called "Uzunköprü" (The "Long Bridge"), is still in use today, however one arch is not visible due to sedimentation.

Prior to World War I, some Silivrian Jews immigrated to the town of [[Camagüey]], [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="bh"/&gt; [[Russia]]ns occupied Silivri on February 5, 1878 for 1 month until 3 March 1878. [[Bulgaria]]ns occupied it on November 16, 1912 for 9 months until May 30, 1913.

During the war, many more [[Sephardim]] in the city left as conditions worsened due to the war.  Many of these Turkish Jews emigrated to the United States settling primarily in New York and Seattle.  Others went to Palestine, France and South America.

According to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], Silivri became a part of Greece on July 20, 1920. However, [[Italy|Italians]] took it over from the withdrawing Greek troops on October 22, 1922, according to the [[Armistice of Mudanya]]. Finally, Turkish forces entered Silivri on November 1, 1922. It was part of [[Çatalca]] province between 1923–1926 and was bounded to [[Istanbul Province]] in 1926. It was enlarged with joining of Gümüşyaka (formerly Eski Ereğli) village from [[Çorlu]] district.

==Holiday resort==
{{Tone|date=June 2011}}
[[File:Silivri06.JPG|thumb|left|Marina and Promenade of Silivri in the background]]
During the summer months, the population increases 4–5 times. Silivri is {{convert|67|km|mi|abbr=on}} far from the city center of Istanbul, and is a popular summer resort for many Istanbul residents with its {{convert|45|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} coast. It is on the highway {{TUR-D|100}} and the motorway {{TUR-O|3}} {{Highway E (Europe)|80}}, which connect Turkey to Europe via [[Edirne]]. It takes about an hour and a half to get here from the city so is feasible for use in the summer months as a weekend and holiday retreat, although the road out here is heaving with traffic in summer.

Being so accessible from Istanbul, the Marmara coast has long been used for holidaying by Istanbul's people. As the city has grown, these facilities have moved further and further away. Once [[Florya]] and [[Yeşilköy]] were resorts, today it is Tekirdağ and even further. Silivri had its heydey in the 1960s and 1970s as families would come by the busload to complexes of holiday flats that were built on the beach. Most had their own stretch of beach, perhaps with their neighbours' raw sewage running straight into the sea. The Marmara Sea here has suffered from pollution in the 1980s and 1990s but now efforts have been made to clean it up and people do swim. Some of these places have sports centres, discos, go-kart tracks, games rooms for the kids etc. and many Istanbul families have pleasant memories of trips to Silivri in the 1970s and 1980s, sitting on the beach in the summer moonlight while the kids run about until they drop from tiredness. Some still go today. All the facilities are located in the holiday housing area, the town centre of Silivri has little to offer in the way of cinema, theatre or any other cultural amenities.

Now the coast has also been blessed with resort hotels and country clubs with sports facilities including golf courses, horse riding centres and tennis courts, health and conference centers. At weekend the area is crowded with day trippers.

With all this development it is hard to find a stretch of open coastline.

The winter months are cold here, as bitter weather blows across Thrace from the [[Balkans]], and holiday homes in Silivri are not much used from mid-September until May or even June.

== Agriculture ==
[[File:YogurtmanStatue, Silivri.JPG|150px|thumb|Statue of historic yogurtman in Silivri]]
The district has great agricultural potential thanks to its almost flat landscape, mild [[Thrace|Thracian]] climate and yield-effective soil, and in the 1950s and 1960s the pasture was so rich that the [[yogurt]] of Silivri was renowned. Now the reputation of the yogurt has declined due to poor quality control and mismanagement of the brand. The Silivri Yoğurt Festivali used to be a major event but nowadays there is less interest and in some years it is not even held. [[Wheat]] (246&amp;nbsp;km²), [[sunflower]] (105&amp;nbsp;km²) and [[barley]] (50&amp;nbsp;km²) are cultivated here. Vineyards were once important but have declined since the 1970s. [[Livestock]] is still important.

==Sports==
[[File:SilivriStadium 4.JPG|thumb|left|Silivri Müjdat Gürsu Stadium.]]
Silivri has two sports clubsi Silivrispor and Alibeyspor. Established in 1957, Silivrispor has two active branches, football and basketball.&lt;ref name="ss"/&gt; Silivrispor's professional football team play in the [[TFF Third League|Apor Toto 3rd Şeague]].&lt;ref name="tff1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ltv"/&gt; The basketball section eas founded in 2014.&lt;ref name="shh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sha"/&gt; Alibeyspor, named after a neighborhood of Silivri, was established in 1989.&lt;ref name="tff2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abs"/&gt; The club's main activity is in football. Their amateur football team play in the [[Turkish Amateur Football Leagues|Istanbul Super Amateuar League]],&lt;ref name="al1"/&gt; and the women's team in the [[Women's football in Turkey#Women's Third League|Turkish Women's Third League]].&lt;ref name="al2"/&gt;

Sport venues in Silivri are the 2,700-seating capacity Müjdat Gürsu Stadium,&lt;ref name="ise1"/&gt; named after [[Müjdat Gürsu]] (1971–1994) a local footballer, and Alibey Sport Hall.&lt;ref name="ise2"/&gt;

'''Society for the National Heritage of Iran''' ({{lang-fa|انجمن آثار ملی ایران}} "''anjoman asar-e meli''") or "SNH" for short, was a [[Grassroots|grass root]] political and archeological group created by a group of educated, and nationalistic [[Iran]]ians in 1922, toward the end of the [[Qajar]] governance in Iran.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The society was composed of influential Iranian figures of the time with the overall goal of preservation of Iranian [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], archeological sites, and protection of the [[Iranian culture]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and Cultural Politics Under Reza Shah: The Pahlavi State, New Bourgeoisie and the Creation of a Modern Society in Iran|author1=Bianca Devos |author2=Christoph Werner |year=2013|pages=129–136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=Society+for+National+Heritage+of+Iran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HVk6U5nwCOjMsQT2-YLADg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Society%20for%20National%20Heritage%20of%20Iran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/anjoman-e-aar-e-melli-aam-the-national-monuments-council-of-iran-established-in-1301-s |title=Anjoman-e Āsar-e Melli |last1=Sadiq |first1=I|date=15 Dec 1985|website=Encyclopedia Iranica |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran in 1922 was influenced by internal and external forces, and the SNH reflects this tug of war between what was the external forces mainly from Europe, and internal/social factors.

==Background==

Early 1900s were time of discovery and archeological exploration in Iran. It was also time of social and political change. The [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1906 had rocked the perception of the absolute control of the king in society. It created an [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian Parliament]] and had reduced the monarch's power.&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Persian Literary Humanism|author=Hamid Dabashi|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqWIhuwtppUC&amp;pg=PT223&amp;dq=Persian+constitutional+revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JW86U4yBE_DJsQTqr4DgBQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Persian%20constitutional%20revolution&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Revolution was in some ways the first political expression of the public sphere, that the poets and the literati, now completely out of the Qajar court had drafted with diligence and steadfast determination.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; The foreign interest in archeology and Iranian history has also peaked with several well known scholars from [[France]], [[England]] and [[Russia]] vying for control. France in particular was very influential in preservation of the Iranian artifacts and in fact the involved French parties exhibited both interest in Persian history, and archeology and at the same time feared that these artifacts would be dispersed and sold.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; France would play a critical role in protection of Iranian artifacts but ironically it also wanted an absolute monopoly for all Persian artifacts in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|author1=Prudence Oliver Harper |author2=Joan Aruz |author3=Françoise Tallon |author4=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1992|pages=16–18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDWJ_KBHwe4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=French+monopoly+in+Persia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O4s6U5XMI9WxsQSCpYG4Ag&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=French%20monopoly%20in%20Persia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renown French archeologist [[Jacques de Morgan]] in fact wanted to preserve Persian art to the point that in 1897 proposed to the Naser al-Din Shah the idea of creation of a [[National Museum of Iran|National Archeological museum]] in [[Tehran]].

In spite of his pure interest in Persian artifacts in Iran, after the first few seasons of archeological excavations in Iran yielded numerous rare finds, de Morgan changed his opinion and advocated an absolute French monopoly on all finds and proposed transfer of all Iranian discoveries to France.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; This attitude was not only unique to de Morgan and was shared by all French emissaries to Iran. In spite of their great contribution to Iranian artifacts specially in such places as [[Susa]], France's insistence on its absolute monopoly would lead to other foreign powers being involved in Iran and the development of resentment by the secular Iranian intellectuals who did not want Iran's history broken up and exported.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt; France's prime position in Iran, specially through influences on political figures such as the Prime minister [[Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Amin al-Sultan]] under [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] meant that France could convince the king to abandon the project.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; In fact Naser al-Din shah abandoned the project and it was not till years later when the National Museum's construction took place in 1917 under the supervision of [[Morteza Gholi Bayat|Morteza Khan Momtas al-Molk]] (Morteza Gholi).&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

It was in this context that after the [[1921 Persian coup d'etat]] led by [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] and [[Zia'eddin Tabatabaee]] and unification of Iran, a group of patriotic, educated Iranian figures namely [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]] (Zoka al-Molk), [[Ebrahim Hakimi]] (Hakim al-Molk), and [[Hassan Pirnia]] (Moshir al-Dowleh) created a cultural group that would later be known as the SNH with the aim of protecting and advocating Iran's patrimony.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran and the International System|author1=Anoushiravan Ehteshami |author2=Reza Molavi |publisher=Routledge|year=2012|pages=155–156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5o-oAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=society+for+national+heritage+of+Iran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oYg6U5_5DOnSsASDmICwDw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=society%20for%20national%20heritage%20of%20Iran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and Achievements==

The goal of the SNH was in a general sense to preserve, protect and promote Iranian patrimony but in a specific sense it focused on three aspects: 1) Establishing a museum and library in Tehran and Ending the prestigious but monopolized French archeology in Iran, 2) proper identification, registration of all artifacts and monuments that were in need of repair or catalog, and 3) preparing and recording a list of all antiques in possession of government or other groups pertaining to ancient Iran's history.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The group would be instrumental in eliciting the proper funds from the Iranian Parliament in order to achieve the aforementioned goals.

===Architectural Projects===

The group was able to secure enough funds from the Iranian parliament to remodel and build the [[Tomb of Ferdowsi]]&lt;ref name=b/&gt; as well as being critical in its design and its use of the [[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid architectural]] styling. The project was started in 1928 and ended in 1934 to coincide with [[Ferdowsi Millenary Celebration]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The group also expanded and had close connection to other secular figures at the times including [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]], and [[Keikhosrow Shahrokh]]. The official group members and the ancillary associates were critical in the decision making process and in fact often influenced each other. Perhaps as impressive as the group's involvement was in creation of the Tomb of Ferdowsi in [[Tus, Iran]], it was an equally critical player in creation of the Tomb of Avicenna (Mausoleum of [[Avicenna]]) in [[Hamedan]], Iran in 1944.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The group was also involved in creation of [[Saadi Shirazi]]'s mausoleum in [[Shiraz]], Iran, creation of [[Nadir Shah]] mausoleum and museum in [[Mashhad]], Iran, creation of the mausoleum of [[Baba Tahir]], in Hamedan, Iran, and creation of tomb of [[Omar Khayyam]] in [[Nishapur]], Iran.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The group was involved in countless culturally-themed architectural endeavors. The table at the bottom of this article denotes their most significant contributions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Archeological Monopoly===

Although not directly involved in ending the French monopoly, the SNH was part of a broader national movement to end French monopoly in Iran and to nationalize the ownership of the artifacts. The group invited speeches by such archeological figures at the time as [[Ernst Herzfeld]] head of German Institute of Oriental Archeology, and the well known American archeologist [[Arthur Upham Pope]] in form of conferences.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The first publication of the group was in fact made with help of Herzfeld and was a list of all historical archeological sites in Iran.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; Reza Shah did not interfere with the works of Ernst Herzfeld or the French archeologists neither did he take sides, but he did ensure that their excavations go smooth and that Persian monuments are recovered with the best portion of them going to Iranian ownership.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The combined efforts of the SNH and other cultural and historical groups at the time led to Iran having the majority monopoly over the recovery of its own artifacts and discoveries.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Linguistic Influence===

Although primarily an architectural and political entity, the SNH also advocated or assisted individuals who had hoped for a revitalization of the Persian language. One major move at the time of SNH was de-listing Arabic loan words and replacing them with old or new Persian words. Even though SNH was involved in publications and advocacy of a more cohesive Persian language, it was intellectuals such as Sadiq Kiya and Ibrahim Purdavus who through their publications, and their focus on Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]] created a Persian vocabulary that was mainly New, Middle, or Old Persian in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystics, Monarchs, and Messiahs: Cultural Landscapes of Early Modern Iran|author=Kathryn Babayan|publisher=Harvard CMES|year=2002|pages=490–493|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLoUePLTdfgC&amp;pg=PA492&amp;dq=Reza+Shah+Persian+words&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p6U6U6OFIqqhsQTFioG4CQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Reza%20Shah%20Persian%20words&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acta Iranica|author=Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin|publisher=Brill|year=1978|pages=409|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdZNEOza3TwC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=sadiq+kiya+persian+words&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d6Y6U6jPDYugsQTtsIGYCw&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sadiq%20kiya%20persian%20words&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless through its publications SNH was a force behind removing of foreign words from [[Persian language|Persian]].

===Legacy===
Nearly every significant Persian poet whose mausoleum is in Iran has benefited from SNH's involvement. SNH has been critical in protection and identification of Iranian artifacts and language as well. [[Iran]] having a significant Pre-Islamic history, as well an equally significant history after Islam, has always suffered from a [[dichotomy]] in its loyalties between what is essentially a desire for heritage and one that is a desire for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Iran: Politics of Resistance|author=Shabnam Holliday|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2013|pages=78–80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ebTVxwXYBaYC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=iraniyat+vs.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=86k6U-zpHKjMsQTE-oHYBw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iraniyat%20vs.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political systems in Iran seem not to be immune to this dichotomy as well. The SNH and indeed the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] seem to embrace the Iranian identity&lt;ref name=a/&gt; but ignore the Islamic identity of Iran, whilst the current regime in Iran, headed by Muslim clerics, seems to ignore or downplay Iranian identity in favor of an Islamic identity.

'''''The Jesus Papers: Exposing the Greatest Cover-Up in History''''' &lt;ref&gt;Michael Baigent, ''The Jesus Papers: Exposing The Greatest Cover-Up In History'' (HarperSanFrancisco, 2006). {{ISBN|978-0-06-082713-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by author [[Michael Baigent]] published in 2006.  Providing his detailed history of Jesus' life and crucifixion; using papers that, according to the author, were covered up.  The book documents the political context of Jesus' birth, and then goes on to examine the history of the migration of the family of Jesus, the chronicles of his teachings, and his death. The book was published on the same day that ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]] became available as a [[paperback]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Dunn, Craig Bubeck, ''The Gospel According to Dan Brown'', page 91 (David C. Cook, 2006). {{ISBN|978-0-7814-4440-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

In ''The Jesus Papers'', author Michael Baigent claims that after having been taken down alive from the Cross, Jesus was removed from the tomb at night by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Nicodemus]], then smuggled away to Egypt along with his wife, [[Mary Magdalene]]. They moved to [[Narbonne]] in the south of France in AD 38, following unrest in Cairo, close to where they had settled (in or near the Temple of Onias). Other Jewish families had settled in Narbonne claiming descent from King David.

Michael Baigent claims the source of [[Bérenger Saunière]]'s wealth was derived from his knowledge and discovery that this was all historically factual, after the priest had found hidden documents (also taking for granted that the source of the priest's wealth was mysterious). Baigent argues that Station XIV of the Cross in the church of  [[Rennes-le-Château]], showing a Full Moon, indicates that the Sabbath/Passover had begun, and showing Joseph of Arimathea carrying the live body of Jesus ''out'' of the tomb.

Michael Baigent claims to have seen two papyrus documents - the "Jesus papers" - written in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], discovered in the Old City of Jerusalem during the 1960s. Baigent claimed these documents dated to AD 45 and were letters to the Sanhedrin from ''bani meshiha'' ("the Messiah of the Children of Israel"), defending himself against the allegation that he claimed to be the [[Son of God]].

Baigent claims these two papyrus documents were authenticated by the Israeli archaeologists [[Yigael Yadin]] and Naham Avigad, which distressed [[Pope John XXIII]]. Baigent claimed the Pope asked Baigent's friend to destroy these two papyrus documents, but he refused and said he would release them after 25 years. However, the documents have not been released because of the rift this information would create between Israel and the Vatican, also creating a revivalism of [[Antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Foster, ''The Jesus Inquest: The Case For and Against The Resurrection of The Christ'' (Monarch Books, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-84994-811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hershel Shanks]], reviewing ''The Jesus Papers'' for ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', commented on the "foolishness of its central thesis", noting how Baigent had seen papyri written in Aramaic, a language that he did not understand, yet was able to say that what he saw dated from "about A.D. 34" - Shanks noted that archaeological finds cannot be dated so precisely, adding that the two previous famous archaeologists who had allegedly seen this papyri were now conveniently dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/reviews/review-jesus-papers.asp Jesus’ Confession: I Am Not the Physical Son of God, reviewed by Hershel Shanks]&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin McClure, reviewing the book for ''[[Fortean Times]]'' commented how the author was unable to obtain photographs of the said papyri, adding that "Baigent records no further effort to investigate these supposedly amazing documents, and appears not to have approached any academic body or community for help".&lt;ref&gt;''Fortean Times'' No 210 (June, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The Biblical historian Craig Evans has described the book as "one of the worst examples of pseudo-scholarship ever published".&lt;ref&gt;quotation from Evans, p. 852. Review of Craig Evans ''Jesus and the Remains of His Day: Studies in Jesus and the Evidence of Material Culture,'' reviewed by Charles Quarles, 2016, ''Journal of Evangelical Theologicial Society'' 59.4:850-852.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are criticisms that the release of the book was timed with the release of ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' film version in an attempt to cash in on the marketing hype. Baigent's response is on p.&amp;nbsp;355 of the book, where he points out that the publication schedule had been set by Harper Collins long before.  Around the same time of the book's release, Baigent was also involved in a plagiarism lawsuit against author [[Dan Brown]], which he acknowledges in the postscript.  The lawsuit claims that Brown improperly used information from ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (which Baigent co-wrote) for Brown's novel ''The Da Vinci Code''.  This too has drawn speculation that the lawsuit and trial were merely a publicity vehicle for Baigent's new book, although the £3 million costs that remain under appeal will likely negate any gain proceeds from the sale of the book.  On 7 April 2006, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge Peter Smith rejected the copyright infringement claim by Michael Baigent and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]], and [[Dan Brown]] won the court case.

== Interviews ==

Baigent appeared on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' in an interview with [[Lester Holt]], in which he claimed that he had seen the papers referred to in the title.  Baigent says the papers themselves prove that Jesus existed after his crucifixion, and therefore he could not have been put to death.  Baigent referred to Jesus the mystical man rather than to Jesus the mythical messiah, and to books containing teachings attributed to Jesus that were voted out of the Christian Bible centuries ago.

Michael Baigent also appeared in another similar televised interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', 26 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,193189,00.html Cover-Up involved in the Story of Jesus?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The timeline below details the ongoing investigation into the [[2012 Benghazi attack|September 11, 2012 attack]] upon the [[United States|American]] diplomatic mission at [[Benghazi]], in [[Libya]]. The attack and the investigation are the subject of much controversy in the American political sphere.

!September&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported: "American and European officials said that while many details about the attack remained unclear, the assailants seemed organized, well trained and heavily armed, and they appeared to have at least some level of advance planning." The article also noted that a senior Obama administration official told reporters that "it was clearly a complex attack," but provided no details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Libya Attack Brings Challenges for U.S|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/us-envoy-to-libya-is-reported-killed.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=September 12, 2012|first1=David D.|last1=Kirkpatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBS News]] reported that Wanis al-Sharef (also spelled al-Sharif), a Libyan Interior Ministry official in Benghazi, said that an angry mob had gathered outside the consulate to protest a U.S.-made film that ridicules Islam's Prophet Muhammad. According to al-Sharef, the mob stormed the consulate after the U.S. troops who responded fired rounds into the air to try and disperse the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Assault on U.S. consulate in Benghazi leaves 4 dead, including U.S. Ambassador J.

CBS News later reported that U.S. officials said the attack was not an out-of-control demonstration as first suspected, but a well-executed assault. From the wording of the report it is unclear whether the protesters were a group distinct from the attackers or were the attackers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Evidence points to a terrorist attack in Libya|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57511799/evidence-points-to-a-terrorist-attack-in-libya/|work=CBS News|date=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] published a video interview of a local Libyan on the consulate compound right after the attack, who presumed and empathized that the attack was in response to the [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/12/benghazi-us-consulate-video|title=Benghazi's US consulate ablaze after armed assault - video|publisher=The Guardian|date=2012-09-12|accessdate=2012-10-18|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Washington Post]] reported that U.S. officials and Middle East analysts said that the attack "may have been planned by extremists and inspired by al-Qaeda."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=U.S. officials: Attack on consulate in Libya may have been planned|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/news-agencies-us-ambassador-to-libya-killed-in-attack-outside-consulate/2012/09/12/665de5fc-fcc4-11e1-a31e-804fccb658f9_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=September 12, 2012|first1=Karen|last1=DeYoung|first2=Michael|last2=Birnbaum|first3=William|last3=Branigin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release, the [[Quilliam (think tank)|Qulliam Foundation]], a counter-extremism think tank based in London, stated that the "military assault" was not related to the film but was to "avenge the death of [[Abu Yahya al-Libi]], al-Qaeda's second in command killed a few months ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

[[BBC]] reported that Libya's deputy ambassador to London, Ahmad Jibril, named [[Ansar al-Sharia (Benghazi, Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]], also known as [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]], as the perpetrators. They also said a Libyan reporter told them that the attack was executed by as many as 80 militiamen "armed with assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and [[14.5 mm KPV heavy machine gun|14.5 mm anti-aircraft machine guns]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=US sends Marines to Libya after ambassador's killing|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/sep2012/liby-s13.shtml|work=BBC News|date=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/us-envoy-to-libya-is-reported-killed.html?pagewanted=all|title=Libya Attack Brings Challenges for U.S|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 12, 2012|first1=David D.|last1=Kirkpatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputy Interior Minister Wanis al-Sharif of the Libyan government told a news conference in Benghazi that it was likely that the perpetrators had been [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] loyalists, suggesting the attack could have been intended as a revenge for the extradition of [[Abdullah al-Senoussi]] (Gaddafi's former intelligence chief) from Mauritania the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/latest_news.php?nid=40752|title=US ambassador to Libya killed in rocket attack|publisher=The Daily Star|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a briefing to congressional staffers, State Department Under Secretary [[Patrick F. Kennedy|Patrick Kennedy]] said that the attack appeared planned because it was so extensive and because of the "proliferation" of small and medium weapons.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{Cite news|title=At least 1 arrest in killings of Americans in Libya|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/13/world/africa/libya-us-ambassador-killed/index.html|work=CNN|date=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN]] reported that the attackers were part of an [[Al Qaeda]] spinoff group. They spoke with Sen. [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-Calif.), who said the killings were possibly linked to the terrorist group blamed for the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] hijackings. According to Sen. Feinstein, "The weapons were somewhat sophisticated, and they blew a big hole in the building and started a big fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Libyan authorities arrest 4 in deadly terror attack|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-13/news/33823216_1_terror-attack-anti-islam-film-world-trade-center|work=New York Daily News|date=September 13, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Armed Services Committee was briefed by Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] about the response to the situation in Libya. Afterwards, Senate Armed Services Chairman [[Carl Levin]] (D-MI) was quoted as saying, "I think it was a planned, premeditated attack." He added that he did not know the group responsible for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=|publisher=|date= September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SITE Intelligence Group]] released a report that said [[al-Qaeda]] claimed that the attack was in revenge for the killing of the network's number two Sheikh [[Abu Yahya al-Libi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/al-qaida-says-us-consulate-attack-revenge/story-e6freuz9-1226474918266 Al-Qaida says US consulate attack 'revenge' | thetelegraph.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking points prepared by the CIA, stated "The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. Consulate and subsequently its annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations." &lt;ref name="washpost"/&gt;

In an interview with NPR in Benghazi, President Mohammed el-Megarif said that foreigners infiltrated Libya over the past few months, planned the attack, and used Libyans to carry it out.&lt;ref name="NPR_Benghazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/16/161228170/consulate-attack-preplanned-libya-s-president-says|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|author=Leila Fadel|date=September 16, 2012|accessdate=September 16, 2012|title=Consulate Attack Preplanned, Libya's President Says}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to el-Megarif: "The idea that this criminal and cowardly act was a spontaneous protest that just spun out of control is completely unfounded and preposterous. We firmly believe that this was a precalculated, preplanned attack that was carried out specifically to attack the U.S. Consulate." He said the attackers used the protesters outside the consulate as a cover, and there is evidence showing that elements of [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]], an extremist group in eastern Benghazi, were used by foreign citizens with ties to [[al-Qaida]] to attack the consulate.&lt;ref name="nbcnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/26/14105135-libyan-president-to-nbc-anti-islam-film-had-nothing-to-do-with-us-consulate-attack?lite |title=Libyan president to NBC: Anti-Islam film had 'nothing to do with' US Consulate attack - World News |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice appeared on several Sunday morning talk shows and stated, "Putting together the best information that we have available to us today our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of-- of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video.  What we think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as this was unfolding.  They came with heavy weapons which unfortunately are readily available in post revolutionary Libya.  And it escalated into a much more violent episode."&lt;ref name="Meet the Press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/49051097/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/september-benjamin-netanyahu-susan-rice-keith-ellison-peter-king-bob-woodward-jeffrey-goldberg-andrea-mitchell/#.UF_LHI1lTng|title=September 16: Benjamin Netanyahu, Susan Rice, Keith Ellison, Peter King, Bob Woodward, Jeffrey Goldberg, |publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=September 16, 2012|accessdate=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-us-ambassador-united-nations-susan-rice/story?id=17240933 |title='This Week' Transcript: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice |publisher=ABC News |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57513819/face-the-nation-transcripts-september-16-2012-libyan-pres-magariaf-amb-rice-and-sen-mccain/ |title='"Face the Nation" transcripts, September 16, 2012: Libyan Pres.

Senator [[John McCain]] (R-AZ), the top Republican on the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], voiced suspicion that the attack was planned in advance and not prompted by the furor over the film. He noted that "[m]ost people don't bring rocket-propelled grenades and heavy weapons to demonstrations.

Fox News reported that an "intelligence source on the ground in Libya" said "there was no demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi" before the attack.&lt;ref name="FOX News no demonstration"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/17/obama-administration-libyan-president-clash-over-explanation-on-consulate/|title=No demonstration before attack on US Consulate, source says|publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|author1=Catherine Herridge, James Rosen  |author2=Pamela Browne |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2012-09-17|accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source was quoted as saying, "There was no protest and the attacks were not spontaneous." The source also said that the attack "was planned and had nothing to do with the movie." The source said the assault came with no warning at about 9:35&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time and included fire from more than two locations.

Representative [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] (R) Michigan, the chairman of the [[House Intelligence Committee]], said in an interview with [[Real Clear Politics]] that there were reports that the Consulate sustained "indirect fire, artillery type fire from mortars.

The director of the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], [[Matthew G. Olsen|Matthew Olson]], appeared before the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee]]. During the hearing Olsen said that the Americans killed in Libya died "in the course of a terrorist attack."&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{Cite news|title=Benghazi attack called 'terrorist'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/benghazi-attack-called-terrorist/2012/09/19/90e74b52-0290-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html|work=Washington Post|date=September 19, 2012|first=Karen|last=DeYoung}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he said that "the facts that we have now indicate that this was an opportunistic attack," one in which heavily armed militants took advantage of an ongoing demonstration at the Consulate.

Sen. [[Susan Collins]] (R-Maine) disagreed with Olsen's statement that the attack did not appear pre-planned. She said, "Based on the briefings I have had, I've come to the opposite conclusion. I just don't think that people come to protests equipped with RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] and other heavy weapons.

A statement released by the Director of Public Affairs for the [[Director of National Intelligence]], Shawn Turner, on the intelligence related to the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, read in part:&lt;ref name="dni" /&gt; "As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. It remains unclear if any group or person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their members to participate. However, we do assess that some of those involved were linked to groups affiliated with, or sympathetic to al-Qa'ida. We continue to make progress, but there remain many unanswered questions. As more information becomes available our analysis will continue to evolve and we will obtain a more complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attack."

Around 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., the guards heard cries of "Allahu akbar!"—"God is great"—three times from outside the walls, then a voice called out in Arabic "You infidels!" and the attackers raced inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Libya guards speak out on attack that killed U.S. ambassador|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/10/world/la-fg-libya-us-guards-20121011|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=October 15, 2012|first=Shashank|last=Bengali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times reported that witnesses of the attack knowledgeable of the circumstances were very convinced that it was carried out by a group of local Islamic militants in response to the video.

On or about 15 June 2014 American military and law enforcement personnel operating in Libya captured Ahmed Abu Khattala, who had been secretly indicted in the U.S. for his alleged role as a mastermind and/or ring-leader in the Benghazi attack.

Senate Committee on Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs made its first request for documents and briefings into the circumstances surrounding the attack. In separate letters to Secretary Hillary Clinton, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, the committee requested a classified briefing for members of the committee. The briefing is to address [[threat assessment]]s before the attack, security needs, requests for security, description and chronology of the attack, and what the Obama administration knew about the attack in the immediate aftermath and "whether any initial public statements issued by members of the Administration in the days following the attack were inaccurate and, if so, why."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 18, 2012|title=Senators request documents from DNI, DOD, State Department on Benghazi investigation|publisher=Senate Committee on Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs|url=http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/senators-request-documents-from-dni-dod-state-department-on-benghazi-investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. officials told The Associated Press that the CIA station chief in Libya compiled intelligence reports within 24 hours of the attack that indicated there was evidence it was carried out by militants, using the pretext of demonstrations against U.S. facilities in Egypt against the film to cover their intent. The report from the station chief was written late Wednesday, Sept. 12, and reached intelligence agencies in Washington the next day. It was not clear how widely the information was circulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://apnews.myway.com/article/20121019/DA20G2701.html|title=CIA found militant links a day after Libya attack|date=October 19, 2012|agency=Associated Press |author=Kimberly Dozier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA Director [[David Petraeus]] testified in closed hearings to both congressional intelligence committees. Speaking with reporters after the hearing, Representative Peter T. King (R-NY), Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said that Petraeus testified that he knew that the attack was a terrorist attack linked to [[al-Qaeda]] affiliates and not sparked by a protest over an anti-Islam video, as White House officials and President Obama had said for days afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Petraeus said CIA saw Benghazi attack as terrorism|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/11/16/petraeus-benghazi-hearing/1708373/|work=USA Today|date=November 17, 2012|first1=Oren|last1=Dorell}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The original talking points put out by the CIA were different from what was later put out," King said. "Petraeus says his initial assessment was from the start it was a terrorist attack." King said a CIA analyst specifically told lawmakers that the al-Qaeda affiliates line "was taken out."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Intel officials unable to say who changed CIA talking points on Libya, lawmaker says|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/11/16/petraeus-to-testify-knew-libya-was-terrorism-from-start-source-says/|work=Fox News|date=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other House members in attendance at the hearing said that Petraeus made clear that the modifications of the original talking points were not done for political reasons. Petraeus "was adamant there was no politicization of the process, no White House interference or political agenda," said Rep. [[Adam Schiff]] (D-CA). "He completely debunked that idea." Regarding Ambassador [[Susan Rice]]'s comments during television interviews after the attack, Schiff went on to say that the, according to Petraeus, the comments "reflected the best intelligence at the time that could be released publicly". "There was an interagency process to draft it, not a political process," Schiff said. "They came up with the best assessment without compromising classified information or source or methods. So changes were made to protect classified information."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Petraeus believed terrorists behind Libya attack|url=https://news.yahoo.com/petraeus-believed-terrorists-behind-libya-attack-145946656--politics.html|author1=Kimberly Dozier  |author2=Nedra Pickler |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Associated Press|date=November 16, 2012|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Petraeus's statements during the hearing, administration officials were concerned that, by publicly disclosing the involvement of Al Qaeda affiliates and sympathizers in the attack, those groups would be tipped off that US government agencies were aware of their involvement.&lt;ref name="Petraeus-Avoid-Tipping"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Petraeus Says U.S. Tried to Avoid Tipping Off Terrorists After Libya Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/world/africa/benghazi-not-petraeus-affair-is-focus-at-hearings.html|author=Eric Schmitt|work=New York Times|date=November 16, 2012|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Washington Post]] reported that, since the attack, the CIA and other intelligence analysts have settled on a hybrid view of the attack, suggesting that the Cairo protest sparked militants in Libya, who quickly mobilized the assault on U.S. facilities in Benghazi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Petraeus tells Congress that Benghazi attack was terrorism|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/petraeus-arrives-on-capitol-hill-for-closed-door-benghazi-hearings/2012/11/16/ab0dd2f8-2fea-11e2-ac4a-33b8b41fb531_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=November 16, 2012|first1=Karen|last1=DeYoung|first2=Ed|last2=O'Keefe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details about possible al-Qaeda links were not in initial talking points used by both Petraeus and UN Ambassador Susan Rice because they were preliminary and based on classified sources, intelligence officials said.

In a White House press briefing to reporters, Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters: "There was no protest outside the Benghazi facility. To this day, it is the assessment of this administration and of our intelligence community and certainly the assessment of your colleagues and the press who have interviewed participants on the ground in the assault on our facilities in Benghazi that they acted at least in part in response to what they saw happening in Cairo and took advantage of that situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is clear that the information that she gave the American people was incorrect when she said that it was a spontaneous demonstration triggered by a hateful video." Rice later issued a statement saying: "We explained that the talking points provided by the intelligence community, and the initial assessment upon which they were based, were incorrect in a key respect: there was no protest or demonstration in Benghazi.... While, we certainly wish that we had had perfect information just days after the terrorist attack, as is often the case, the intelligence assessment has evolved."

{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}

In [[archaeology]] the term '''Toumba''' stands for mounds covering [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and early [[Iron Age]] settlements in [[Greece]]. At first they were considered as Grave hills, hence the name that derived from the word ''[[Tomb]]''. However excavations showed that they are not tombs but structures like settlements, religious centers, or homes located at different depths depending on their date of use, like [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]s.

A Toumba found in [[Assiros]] was the site of a burial, but it contains evidence of being used as a granary. It contained, among other things, a hearth, storage space, and cereal straw.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, K. A., 1989, “Excavations at Assiros Toumba 1988: A Preliminary Report,” ''The Annual of the British School at Athens,'' 84, 447-463.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a Toumba in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] was found to contain fragments of processed cereal grains. These have been dated to 2100-1900 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Soultana Maria Valamoti, June 2002, “Food remains from Bronze Age Archondiko and Mesimeriani Toumba in Northern Greece?” Vegetation History and Archaeobotany, 11(1-2), 17-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transportation Security Administration''' ('''TSA''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] that has authority over the security of the traveling public in the United States. It was created as a response to the [[September 11 attacks]].

Chiefly concerned with [[air travel]], the TSA employs screening officers in airports, armed [[Federal Air Marshal Service|Federal Air Marshals]] on planes, and mobile teams of dog handlers and explosives specialists.

==Constitution==
The TSA was created as part of the [[Aviation and Transportation Security Act]], sponsored by [[Don Young]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:HR03150: |title=THOMAS |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ernest Hollings]] in the [[United States Senate|Senate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:S.1447: |title=THOMAS |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Title 49 of the United States Code|49 USC]] § 114(d)&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the 107th [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], and signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on {{#dateformat:November 19, 2001}}. Originally part of the [[United States Department of Transportation]], the TSA was moved to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] on {{#dateformat:March 9, 2003}}.

==History and organization==
[[File:US-TransportationSecurityAdmin-DOTSeal.svg|thumb|180px|Seal when under the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]]]]
The TSA was created as a response to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016|title=Front Matter|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.13110/criticism.58.3.fm|journal=Criticism|volume=58|issue=3|doi=10.13110/criticism.58.3.fm|issn=0011-1589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first administrator, [[John Magaw]], was nominated by President Bush on December 10, 2001, and confirmed by the Senate the following January. The agency's proponents, including Transportation Secretary [[Norman Mineta]], argued that only a single federal agency would better protect air travel than the private companies who operated under contract to single airlines or groups of airlines that used a given terminal facility.

Prior to its creation, private security firms managed air travel security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/airports-before-911_us_57c85e17e4b078581f11a133&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was charged with developing policies to protect U.S. transportation, especially in [[airport security]] and the prevention of [[aircraft hijacking]].

TSA Screeners represent a case of a large scale staffing project completed over a short period. The only effort in U.S history that came close to it was the testing of recruits for the armed forces in the Second World War. TSA screeners, during the period from February to December 2002, 1.7 million applicants were assessed for 55,000 positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Work in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Industrial and Organizational Psychology|last=Landy|first=Frank J.|last2=Conte|first2=Jeffery M.|publisher=Wiley; 4 edition|date=December 26, 2012|isbn=9781118291207|location=|pages=263|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[U.S. state|state]], local, and regional partners,{{who|date=November 2015}} the TSA oversees security for highways, railroads, buses, mass transit systems, pipelines and [[port]]s. However, the bulk of the TSA's efforts are in aviation security. The TSA is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at more than 450 U.S. airports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tsajobs.tsa.dhs.gov/tsajobs/ TSA Jobs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807083858/https://tsajobs.tsa.dhs.gov/tsajobs/ |date=August 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private screening did not disappear under the TSA, which allows airports to opt out of federal screening and hire firms to do the job instead. Such firms must still get TSA approval under its [[Screening Partnership Program]] (SPP) and follow TSA procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Greg fulton|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1228247,00.html |title=An Airport Screener's Complaint |publisher=Time.com |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the U.S. airports with privately operated checkpoints are [[San Francisco International Airport]]; [[Kansas City International Airport]]; [[Greater Rochester International Airport]]; [[Tupelo Regional Airport]]; [[Key West International Airport]]; [[Charles M. Schulz – Sonoma County Airport]]; and [[Jackson Hole Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.gov/affairs/tsa2902.htm TSA Announces Private Security Screening Pilot Program], TSA press release June 18, 2002 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050904192312/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/tsa2902.htm |date=September 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsa.gov/press/releases/2007/press_release_01042007.shtm TSA Awards Private Screening Contract] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916061700/http://www.tsa.gov/press/releases/2007/press_release_01042007.shtm |date=September 16, 2012 }}, TSA press release January 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===New headquarters===
In August 2017, the [[General Services Administration]] announced the new headquarters would be built in [[Springfield, Virginia]]. The new, 625,000-square-foot headquarters will be a short distance from the [[Franconia-Springfield Station|Franconia-Springfield Metro station]] and is projected to cost $316 million for a 15-year lease. The facility is expected to open in mid-2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sernovitz |first=Daniel J. |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/08/24/gsa-picks-a-new-headquarters-site-for-the-tsa.html |title=At long last, GSA picks a new headquarters site for the TSA |work=[[Washington Business Journal]] |date=2017-08-24 |accessdate=2017-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
[[File:Office buildings in Pentagon City.JPG|thumb|TSA headquarters located in [[Pentagon City|Pentagon City, Arlington County, Virginia]]]]
When TSA was established by the [[Aviation and Transportation Security Act]] in the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], the position was referred to as the '''Under Secretary of Transportation for Security'''. Following the TSA's transfer to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], the position was reclassified as the '''Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration'''. The position has also been referred to as the '''Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for the Transportation Security Administration'''.

There have been seven administrators and six acting administrators in TSA's 15-year history.

Following the passage of the [[FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018]] which included a provision known as the TSA Modernization Act, the Administrator's term was set as a five year term retroactive to the start of current Administrator David Pekoske's term. It also made the Deputy Administrator a [[Political appointments in the United States|politically appointed]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atwonline.com/security/us-transportation-security-administration-reauthorized-through-2021 |title=US Transportation Security Administration reauthorized through 2021 |last=Goldstein |first=Ben |date=October 4, 2018 |website=ATWonline.com |publisher= [[Aviation Week]]|access-date=October 23, 2018 |quote=The bill modifies the agency’s leadership structure by setting a five-year term for the administrator of TSA and makes the deputy administrator a position appointed by the president}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) provide security and protection of air travelers, airports and aircraft.  This includes:
* Operating various screening equipment and technology to identify dangerous objects in baggage, cargo, and on passengers, and preventing those objects from being transported onto aircraft.
* Performing searches and screening, which may include physical interaction with passengers (e.g., pat-downs, search of property, etc.), conducting bag searches and lifting/carrying bags, bins, and property weighing up to 70lbs.
* Controlling terminal entry and exit points.
* Interacting with the public, giving directions and responding to inquiries.
* Maintaining focus and awareness while working in a stressful environment which includes noise from alarms, machinery and people, crowd distractions, time pressure, and disruptive and angry passengers, in order to preserve the professional ability to identify and locate potentially life threatening or mass destruction devices, and to make effective decisions in both crisis and routine situations.
* Engaging in continuous development of critical thinking skills, necessary to mitigate actual and potential security threats, by identifying, evaluating, and applying appropriate situational options and approaches.  This may include application of risk-based security screening protocols that vary based on program requirements.
* Retaining and implementing knowledge of all applicable Standard Operating Procedures, demonstrating responsible and dependable behavior, and is open to change and adapts to new information or unexpected obstacles.&lt;ref name="usajobs.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/454238900/|title=Transportation Security Officer (TSO)|website=USAJOBS|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Behavior Detection Officers: In 2003, the TSA implemented the [[Screening of Passengers by Observation Technique]] (SPOT), which expanded across the United States in 2007.  In this program, Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs), who are TSOs, observe passengers as they go through [[security checkpoint]]s, looking for behaviors that might indicate a higher risk.  Such passengers are subject to additional screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/03/27/revealed-tsas-closely-held-behavior-checklist-spot-terrorists/|title=Exclusive: TSA's Secret Behavior Checklist to Spot Terrorists|work=The Intercept}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Federal Flight Deck Officer]] (FFDOs) are the airline pilots working for the U.S. airlines, who are deputized as federal [[law enforcement officers]] (FLEOs) to carry out the law enforcement duties within their specific jurisdictions (flight deck) and only from the time their aircraft doors are closed and until they are opened. FFDOs have the power to arrest, apply force (only within their jurisdiction) and are required to carry a federally issued firearm. Only active airline pilots are eligible for the FFDO program, which is available for a limited enrollment on a volunteer basis. FFDO's are trained by the [[Federal Air Marshal Service]] and deputized by the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. Their primary goal is to work with (or without) the FAM team to defend the flight deck from [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] or any other terrorist threats to their aircraft.
| Transportation Security Inspectors (TSIs): They inspect, and investigate passenger and cargo transportation systems to see how secure they are.

===Uniforms===
In 2008, TSA officers began wearing new uniforms that have a blue-gray 65/35 polyester/cotton blend duty shirt, black pants, a wider black belt, and optional short-sleeved shirts and black vests (for seasonal reasons).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/68MleQZ7P?url=http://www.tsa.gov/assets/pdf/foia/TSA_MD_1100_73_2_FINAL_070621.pdf TSA Management Directive No. 1100.73-2 – TSO Dress and Appearance Responsibilities] Retrieved May 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The first airport to introduce the new uniforms was [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]]. Starting on September 11, 2008, all TSOs began wearing the new uniform. One stripe on each [[shoulder board]] denotes a TSO, two stripes a Lead TSO, and three a Supervisory TSO.

TSOs are issued badges similar to those carried by [[police officers]], which has led to complaints from the latter group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2008-06-15-tsa-badges_N.htm|title=TSA's new policelike badges a sore point with real cops|last=Frank|first=Thomas|date=June 16, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the TSA budget comes from a $2.50 per-passenger tax. The Obama administration had proposed tripling this fee by 2019, with most of the increase going to reduce the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/US/tsa-fee-taxes-air/2013/12/10/id/540999|title=TSA Fee Would Double Under New Proposal|work=Newsmax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening processes and regulations==
[[File:Transportation Security Administration officer screening a bag.jpg|thumb|right|TSA agent screening [[luggage]]]]

===Passenger and carry-on screening===

====Identification requirements====
{{See also|No Fly List}}

The TSA requires that passengers show a valid ID at the security checkpoint before boarding their flight.  Valid forms of identification include [[passport]]s from the U.S. or a foreign government, state-issued photo identification, or military ID. Passengers that do not have ID may still be allowed to fly if their identity can be verified through an alternate way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids | title=Acceptable IDs | publisher=Transportation Security Administration | work=tsa.gov | date=August 26, 2013 | accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passenger names are compared against the [[No Fly List]], a list of about 21,000 names ({{as of|2012|lc=y}}) of suspected terrorists who are not allowed to board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57370284/no-fly-list-doubles-in-a-year-now-21000-names/|title=No-fly list doubles in a year – now 21,000 names|date=February 2, 2012|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger names are also compared against a longer list of "selectees"; passengers whose names match names from this list receive a more thorough screening before being potentially allowed to board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/10/22/no.fly.lists/index.html|title=Terrorist watch lists shorter than previously reported|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|date=October 22, 2008|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the lists has been widely criticized on the basis of errors in how those lists are maintained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/29/opinion/la-oe-schoenfeld29-2009dec29|title=Politics and the no-fly list|last=Schoenfeld|first=Gabriel|date=December 29, 2009|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for concerns that the lists are [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]], and for its ineffectiveness at stopping [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], who attempted to detonate plastic explosives in his underwear, from boarding an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-12-31/news/0912310150_1_no-fly-list-umar-farouk-abdulmutallab-watch-list|title=Plane bombing plot: No-fly list procedure needs revamping, critics say|last=Tankersley,|first=Jim|date=December 31, 2009|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the airport security checkpoint, passengers are screened to ensure they are not carrying prohibited items. These include most sorts of sharp objects, many sporting goods such as baseball bats and hockey sticks, guns or other weapons, many sorts of tools, flammable liquids (except for conventional lighters), many forms of chemicals and paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/prohibited-items|website=tsa.gov|title=Prohibited Items|publisher=Transportation Security Administration|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, passengers are limited to {{convert|3.4|USoz|lk=in}} of almost any liquid or gel, which must be presented at the checkpoint in a clear, one-quart [[Zipper storage bag|zip-top bag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/3-1-1-carry-ons|title=3-1-1 for Carry-ons|publisher=Transportation Security Administration|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411045917/http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/3-1-1-carry-ons|archivedate=11 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions on liquids were a reaction to the [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot]].

In October 2013, the TSA announced that it had begun searching a wide variety of government and private databases for information about passengers before they arrive at the airport.

====November 2010 enhanced screening procedures====
Beginning in November 2010, TSA added new enhanced screening procedures.

TSA encouraged flyers to choose scanners by emphasizing the "intrusive" nature of the "enhanced" patdown.  These changes were said to be made in reaction to the [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] bombing attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2010/11/new-poll-says-61-oppose-new-airport-security-measures.html|title=Poll finds 61% oppose new airport security measures|last=Martin|first=Hugo|date=November 23, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the TSA began putting [[Backscatter X-ray|backscatter X-ray scanners]] and [[millimeter wave scanner]]s machines into airports. The TSA refers to these two technologies as Advanced Imaging Technologies, or AIT. Critics sometimes refer to them as "naked scanners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/11/29/oukin-uk-germany-bodyscanner-idUKTRE4AS1V320081129|title=Germany plans lab tests for airport naked scans|author=Reuters Editorial|date=29 November 2008|work=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passengers are directed to hold their hands above their heads for a few seconds while front and back images are created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/tsa-removes-x-ray-body-scanners-from-major-airports|title=TSA Removes X-Ray Body Scanners From Major Airports|last=Grabell|first=Michael|date=October 19, 2012|work=Pro Publica|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the operator sees an anomaly on the scanner, or if other problems occur, the passenger will also have to receive the pat-down.

Full body scanners have also proven controversial due to privacy and health concerns.

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has called the scanners  a "virtual strip search."&lt;ref name="Puzzanghera"&gt;

Instead, one generic figure is used for all passengers and small yellow boxes are placed on areas of the body requiring additional screening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cheapflights.com/2011/02/tsa-tests-modesty-saving-threat-detection-software/ News.cheapflights.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723181430/http://news.cheapflights.com/2011/02/tsa-tests-modesty-saving-threat-detection-software/ |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TSA announced in 2013 that the [[Rapiscan Systems|Rapiscan's]] backscatter scanners would no longer be used, due to the fact that the manufacturer of the machines could not produce "privacy software" to abstract the near-nude images that agents view and turn them into stick like figures. The TSA will continue to use other full body scanners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130409115649/http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20130121/TRAVEL02/301210002/TSA-dumps-near-naked-Rapiscan-body-scanners]"TSA dumps near-naked Rapiscan

=====Reverse screenings=====
In April 2016, TSA Administrator, Peter V. Neffenger told a Senate committee that small airports had the option to use "reverse screening" – a system where passengers are not screened before boarding the aircraft at departure, but instead are screened upon arrival at the destination. The procedure is intended to save costs at airports with a limited number of flights.&lt;ref&gt;700WLW NewsRadio - Cincinnati, OH  https://web.archive.org/web/20160816064154/http://700wlw.iheart.com/onair/aviation-blog-jay-ratliff-43304/tsas-moneysaving-plan-screen-after-the-14643459/&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reactions=====
After the November 2010 initiation of enhanced screening procedures of all airline passengers and flight crews, the [[US Airline Pilots Association]] issued a press release stating that pilots should not submit to full body scanners because of unknown radiation risks and calling for strict guidelines for pat-downs of pilots, including  evaluation of their fitness for duty after the pat-down, given the stressful nature of pat-downs.&lt;ref name="Sharkey"&gt;Joe Sharkey, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/business/16road.html?_r=1&amp;ref=joe_sharkey Screening Protests Grow as Holiday Crunch Looms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221235651/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/business/16road.html?_r=1&amp;ref=joe_sharkey |date=February 21, 2015 }}, ''[[New York Times]]'', November 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040738/http://usairlinepilots.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7709several President’s Message], [[US Airline Pilots Association]] press release, November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Two airline pilots filed suit against the procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Everly and Randy Heaster, [http://www.kansascity.com/2010/11/19/2454162/airline-security-gets-private.htm Airline security gets private]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}, [[The Kansas City Star]], November 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In  July 2011, the D.C. Circuit court of appeals ruled that the TSA did violate the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] by failing to allowing a public notice and comment rule making period. The Court ordered the agency to "promptly" undertake a public notice and comment rule making.

== Screening effectiveness ==
Undercover operations to test the effectiveness of airport screening processes are routinely carried out by the TSA's Office of Investigations&lt;ref name="Elias2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elias|first=Bart|title=Airport Passenger Screening: Background and Issues for Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nW3kZay_eKEC&amp;pg=PT11|accessdate=7 April 2013|date=April 2010|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=9781437923223|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] [[Inspector General]]'s office.

A report by the  [[Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General]] found that TSA officials had collaborated with [[Covenant Aviation Security]] (CAS) at [[San Francisco International Airport]] to alert screeners to undercover tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/mgmtrpts/OIG_07-04_Oct06.pdf |author=[[Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General]] |title=Review of Allegations Regarding San Francisco International Airport, OIG-07-04 |format=PDF |date=October 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527231442/https://www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/mgmtrpts/OIG_07-04_Oct06.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From August 2003 until May 2004, precise descriptions of the undercover personnel were provided to the screeners.

A report on undercover operations conducted in October 2006 at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] was leaked to the press. The screeners had failed 20 of 22 undercover security tests, missing numerous guns and bombs. The [[Government Accountability Office]] had previously pointed to repeated covert test failures by TSA personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=screeners28&amp;date=20061028 Airport screeners fail to see most test bombs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131175452/http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=screeners28&amp;date=20061028 |date=January 31, 2008 }}, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', October 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/airlines/newark-airport-screeners-fail-to-find-hidden-weapons-in-federal-test-211044.php?mail2=true Screeners at Newark fail to find 'weapons'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301181902/http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/airlines/newark-airport-screeners-fail-to-find-hidden-weapons-in-federal-test-211044.php?mail2=true |date=March 1, 2007 }}{{spaced ndash}}Agents got 20 of 22 'devices' past staff.

In July 2007, the ''[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]'' of [[Albany, New York]] reported that TSA screeners at [[Albany International Airport]] failed multiple covert security tests conducted by the TSA. Among them was a failure to detect a fake bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fake Bomb Eludes Airport Test |url=http://archives.timesunion.com/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6466589 |work=Times Union |location=Albany, NY |date=July 4, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ABC News Houston reported in an article about a man who accidentally took a forgotten gun through airport security, that "the failure rate approaches 70 percent at some major airports".&lt;ref name=quinn&gt;{{cite news|last=Quinn|first=Kevin|title=Man boards plane at IAH with loaded gun in carry-on|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7848683|accessdate=May 12, 2011|newspaper=ABC News KTRK-TV/DT Houston|date=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 TSA fired 36 screeners at the [[Honolulu International Airport|Honolulu airport]] for regularly allowing bags through without being inspected.&lt;ref&gt;Poole, Robert (2011-09-19) [http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-10/travel/tsa.screeners_1_tsa-officers-administrator-john-pistole-bags?_s=PM:TRAVEL Massive firing at HNL Honolulu Airport]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011044529/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-10/travel/tsa.screeners_1_tsa-officers-administrator-john-pistole-bags?_s=PM%3ATRAVEL |date=October 11, 2012 }}, [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, a report from the [[Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General]] stated that the TSA "does not have a complete understanding" of breaches at the nation's airports, with some hubs doing very little to fix or report security breaches. These findings will be presented to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/15/us/tsa-breaches/index.html?hpt%3Dhp_bn1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305091656/http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/15/us/tsa-breaches/index.html?hpt=hp_bn1 |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }} Report: TSA Security Breaches Mishandled&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintended consequences of 2002 screening enhancements===
Two studies by a group of [[Cornell University]] researchers have found that strict airport security has the unintended consequence of increasing road fatalities, as would-be air travelers decide to drive and are exposed to the far greater risk of dying in a car accident.&lt;ref name="cornell1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cornell2" /&gt; In 2005, the researchers looked at the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and found that the change in passenger travel modes led to 242 added driving deaths per month.&lt;ref name="cornell1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Garrick|author2=Vrinda Kadiyali |author3=Daniel H. Simon |date=February 10, 2005|title=The Impact of 9/11 on Road Fatalities: The Other Lives Lost to Terrorism|journal=[[Social Science Research Network|SSRN]] Electronic Journal|issn=1556-5068|doi=10.2139/ssrn.677549|ssrn=677549}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, they estimated that about 1,200 driving deaths could be attributed to the short-term effects of the attacks. The study attributes the change in traveler behavior to two factors: fear of terrorist attacks and the wish to avoid the inconvenience of strict security measures; no attempt is made to estimate separately the influence of each of these two factors.

In 2007, the researchers studied the specific effects of a change to security practices instituted by the TSA in late 2002. They concluded that this change reduced the number of air travelers by 6%, and estimated that consequently, 129 more people died in car accidents in the fourth quarter of 2002.&lt;ref name="cornell2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aem.cornell.edu/faculty_sites/gb78/wp/JLE_6301.pdf |title=AEM.cornell.edu |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolating this rate of fatalities, ''New York Times'' contributor [[Nate Silver]] remarked that this is equivalent to "four fully loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver |first=Nate |url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/the-hidden-costs-of-extra-airport-security/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |title=The Hidden Costs of Extra Security - NYTimes.com |publisher=Fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com |date= November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 study also noted that strict airport security hurts the airline industry; it was estimated that the 6% reduction in the number of passengers in the fourth quarter of 2002 cost the industry $1.1 billion in lost business.&lt;ref name="Blalock2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Garrick|author2=Vrinda Kadiyali |author3=Daniel H.

==Data security incidents==

===Employee records lost or stolen===
In 2007, an unencrypted computer [[hard drive]] containing [[Social Security Administration|Social Security]] numbers, bank data, and payroll information for about 100,000 employees was lost or stolen from TSA headquarters. Kip Hawley alerted TSA employees to the loss, and apologized for it. The agency asked the [[FBI]] to investigate. There were no reports that the data was later misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18497134/ |title=TSA Computer Hard Drive Missing |agency=Associated Press |author=Matt Apuzzo |date=May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-16-tsa-missing-drive_N.htm|title=TSA: Missing hard drive left unprotected|date=July 16, 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== REAL ID and air travel ==
Passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2005, the REAL ID Act established minimum security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards and prohibits federal agencies, like TSA, from accepting licenses and identification cards for official purposes from states that do not meet these standards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/resources/realid_factsheet_071516-508.pdf|title=TSA Real ID and Air Travel|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.tsa.gov/|publisher=|access-date=November 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115140432/https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/resources/realid_factsheet_071516-508.pdf|archivedate=November 15, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enforcement dates ===
Beginning January 22, 2018, driver's licenses or state IDs issued by states that are not in compliance with the REAL ID Act and have not been granted an extension by DHS may not be used to fly within the U.S.

Beginning October 1, 2020, every traveler will need a REAL ID-compliant license or state ID or another acceptable form of identification to fly within the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Current list of acceptable IDs ===
* Driver's licenses or other state photo identity cards issued by [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (or equivalent) in accordance with [[REAL ID Act|REAL ID]] enforcement
* [[United States passport|U.S. passport]]
* [[United States Passport Card]]
* DHS trusted traveler cards ([[Global Entry]], [[NEXUS (frequent traveler program)|NEXUS]], [[Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection|SENTRI]], [[Free and Secure Trade|FAST]])
* [[United States Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card|U.S. Military ID]] (active duty or retired military and their dependents, and DoD civilians)
* [[Permanent residence (United States)|Permanent resident card]]

A 2013 report by the Homeland Security Department Inspector General's Office charged that TSA was using criminal investigators to do the job of lower paid employees, wasting millions of dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/25/politics/tsa-investigators-pay/|title=Audit shows highly paid TSA investigators perform lesser tasks|author=Mike M.

On December 3, 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed the [[Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act (H.R. 2719; 113th Congress)]] in response to criticism of the TSA's acquisition process as wasteful, costly, and ineffective.&lt;ref name=techreform1&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push tech reform at TSA|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/technology/191721-house-to-push-tech-reform-at-tsa|accessdate=4 December 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18 July 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bipartisan Legislation Introduced to Reform TSA's Acquisition Process|url=http://homeland.house.gov/press-release/bipartisan-legislation-introduced-reform-tsa-s-acquisition-process|publisher=Committee on Homeland Security of the US House of Representatives|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the bill became law, it would require the TSA to develop a comprehensive technology acquisition plan and present regular reports to Congress about its successes and failures to adhere to this plan. An April 2013 report from the [[Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General]] indicated that the TSA had 17,000 items with an estimated cost of $185.7 million stored in its warehouses on May 31, 2012.&lt;ref name=oigreportonwarehouse&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Anne L.|title=Transportation Security Administration Logistics Center - Inventory Management|url=http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-82_Apr13.pdf|publisher=Office of Inspector General - Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auditors found that "TSA stored unusable or obsolete equipment, maintained inappropriate safety stock levels, and did not develop an inventory management process that systematically deploys equipment."&lt;ref name="oigreportonwarehouse"/&gt;

In January 2014, [[Jason Edward Harrington]], a former TSA screener at [[O'Hare International Airport]], said that fellow staff members assigned to review body scan images of airline passengers routinely joked about fliers' weight, attractiveness, and [[Human penis|penis]] and breast sizes. According to Harrington, screeners would alert each other to attractive female passengers with the code phrase "Hotel Papa" so that staff would have an opportunity to view the passengers' nude form in body scanner monitors and retaliated against rude flyers by delaying them at the checkpoint. TSA Administrator John Pistole responded by saying that all the scanners had been replaced and the screening rooms disabled. He did not deny that the behaviors described by Harrington took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New TSA in town,' agency says in response to screener's charges|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/31/22527381-new-tsa-in-town-agency-says-in-response-to-screeners-charges?lite&amp;lite=obinsite|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, actress [[Susan Sarandon]] claimed that during the entire time of the Bush administration she was "harassed everytime I came into the country". She said that she hired two lawyers to contact the TSA to determine why she had been targeted but that she assumed it was because she was critical of the Bush administration. She said the harassment stopped after her attorneys followed up a second time with the TSA.&lt;ref&gt;Interview on The Late, Late Show with James Corden. CBS Corporation. May 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, a case heard in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit Appeals Court]] ruled that TSA agents are not "investigative or law enforcement officers" and thus are not liable under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] (FTCA). The case extended from a woman who had been detained and arrested by TSA in 2006 but later the criminal charges were acquitted in court; she had sought damages under the FTCA for damages related to the false arrest and related matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tsa-lawsuit/tsa-screeners-win-immunity-from-abuse-claims-appeals-court-idUSKBN1K125W | title = TSA screeners win immunity from abuse claims: appeals court | first = Jonathan | last = Stempel | date = July 11, 2018 | accessdate = July 11, 2018 | publisher =[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
A CBS telephone poll of 1137 people published on November 15, 2010 found that 81% percent of those polled approved TSA's use of full-body scans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101124133835/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/15/politics/main7057902.shtml Poll: 4 in 5 Support Full-Body Airport Scanners] [[CBS]] News, November 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; An ABC/Washington Post poll conducted by Langer Associates and released November 22, 2010 found that 64% of Americans favored the full-body X-ray scanners, but that 50% think the "enhanced" pat-downs go too far; 37% felt so strongly.

Only 1% of those surveyed rated the agency's work as excellent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/11/business/la-fi-mo-tsa-survey-20120911|title=Many frequent travelers say TSA is doing poor job|last=Martin|first=Hugo|date=September 11, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations of the TSA==
In 2013 The Office of Inspector General published a reported titled "TSA's Actions Insufficient to Address Inspector General Recommendations to Improve its Office of Inspection".  The report touched upon several topics of misconduct but the main focus of the report was of the TSA criminal investigators who received a premium on their pay despite not meeting the minimum qualification to be eligible for this pay.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-123_Sep13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The TSA Office of Accountability Inspection Act of 2015 published by the Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation, was based on a report of an investigation which found issues with the TSA. The act also followed up the  Office of Inspector General's 2013 report, mandating that the TSA should comply with Federal Regulation and correct the wage of the TSA's Criminal Investigators.&lt;ref&gt;TSA Office of Accountability Act, https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114srpt111/pdf/CRPT-114srpt111.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Had no action been taken this misuse of funds was estimated to cost taxpayers, in a span of five years, $17 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-114publ53/pdf/PLAW-114publ53.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In response the TSA contracted a consulting firm to assist the TSA with the Office of Inspector General recommendations. However Office of Inspector Generals has found the TSA's response lacking as they have yet to fix a majority of the issues brought up in the report.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/pr/2015/oigpr_071315.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls for abolition==

The three-line '''[[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|Resolution]] 338''', adopted on October 22, 1973, called for a [[ceasefire]] in the [[Yom Kippur War]] in accordance with a joint proposal by the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]].  The resolution stipulated a cease fire to take effect within 12 hours of the adoption of the resolution. The "appropriate auspices" was interpreted to mean American or Soviet rather than UN auspices. This third clause helped to establish the framework for the [[Geneva Conference (1973)]] held in December 1973.

The resolution was passed at the 1747th UNSC meeting by 14 votes to none, with one member, the [[People's Republic of China]], not participating in the vote. The fighting continued despite the terms called for by the resolution, brought [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 339|Resolution 339]] which resulted in a cease fire.

The resolution states:

{{quote|The Security Council,

Calls upon all parties to present fighting to cease all firing and terminate all military activity immediately, no later than 12 hours after the moment of the adoption of this decision, in the positions after the moment of the adoption of this decision, in the positions they now occupy;

Calls upon all parties concerned to start immediately after the cease-fire the implementation of Security Council Resolution 242 (1967) in all of its parts;

Decides that, immediately and concurrently with the cease-fire, negotiations start between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.}}

==Binding or non-binding issue==
The alleged importance of resolution 338 in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] supposedly stems from the word "decides" in clause 3 which is held to make [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|resolution 242]] binding. However the decision in clause 3 does not relate to resolution 242, but rather to the need to begin negotiations on a just and durable peace in the Middle East that led to the Geneva Conference which Syria did not attend.

The argument continues; Article 25 of the [[United Nations Charter]] says that UN members "agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council". It is generally accepted that Security Council resolutions adopted according to Chapter VII of the UN Charter in the exercise of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace in accordance with the UN Charter are binding upon the member states.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Rosalyn, ''The Advisory Opinion on Namibia: Which UN Resolutions Are Binding Under Article 25 of the Charter?'', in 21 ''Int'l &amp; Comp. L.Q.'' 286 1972 pp. 270–66, pp. 285–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Legal Consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia, notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)" in ''[1971] I.C.J. Reports'' pp. 4–345, pp 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars applying this doctrine on the resolution assert that the use of the word "decide" makes it a "decision" of the Council, thus invoking the binding nature of article 25.&lt;ref&gt;Rostow, Eugene V. "The Illegality of the Arab Attack on Israel of October 6, 1973." ''The American Journal of International law'', 69(2), 1975, pp. 272–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal force added to Resolution 242 by this resolution is the reason for the otherwise puzzling fact that SC 242 and the otherwise seemingly superfluous and superannuated Resolution 338 are always referred to together in legal documents relating to the conflict.

The more obvious need for the use of Resolution 338 is that it requires all parties to cease fire and states when that should occur, without which Resolution 242 can't be accomplished.

Some scholars have advanced the position that the resolution was passed as a non-binding [[Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VI recommendation]].&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Gerald M., ''Israel and Iraq: United Nations Double Standards – UN Charter Article 25 and Chapters VI and VII'' (2003) [http://www.middle-east-info.org/gateway/unitednations/Israel%20and%20Iraq%20-%20UN%20Double%20Standards.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn, Talia, "The Status of Palestine/Land of Israel and Its Settlement Under Public International Law" in ''Nativ Online'' No.1 Dec. (2003) [http://www.acpr.org.il/english-nativ/authors/einhorn-t.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators assert that it probably was passed as a binding [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kattan, Victor,''Israel, Hezbollah, and the use and abuse of self-defence in international law'' (2006) [http://www.arabmediawatch.com/amw/Articles/Analysis/tabid/75/newsid395/2932/Israel-Hezbollah-and-the-use-and-abuse-of-self-defence-in-international-law/Default.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution contains reference to neither Chapter VI nor Chapter VII.

==Adoption of the Resolution==
Egypt and Israel accepted on October 22 Resolution conditions. Syria, Iraq, and, Jordan rejected the Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia'' http://www.eleven.co.il/article/10954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;232. Memorandum of Conversation, Tel Aviv, October 22, 1973, 2:30–4 p.m // ''Arab–Israeli Crisis and War'', 1973, р. 662–666&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution requirements of the Resolution by Egypt and Israel==
An October 22 United Nations-brokered ceasefire quickly unraveled, with each side blaming the other for the breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/GL0/362/14/PDF/GL036214.pdf?OpenElement |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201171027/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/GL0/362/14/PDF/GL036214.pdf?OpenElement |archive-date=2016-02-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::::'''According to some sources, Egypt broke the cease-fire first:'''
The cease fire soon violated because Egypt's Third Army Corps tried to break free of the Israeli Army's encirclement. The Egyptian action and the arrival of more Soviet equipment to Cairo permitted Israel to tighten its grip on the Egyptians&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSe0gs-YaTkC&amp;pg=PA827&amp;lpg=PA827&amp;dq=The+cease+fire+soon+violated+because+Egypt%27s+Third+Army+Corps+tried+to+break+free+of+the+Israeli+Army%27s+encirclement.+The+Egyptian+action+and+the+arrival+of+more+Soviet+equipment+to+Cairo+permitted+Israel+to+tighten+its+grip+on+the+Egyptians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i4sQ5xB9JH&amp;sig=QElbSiGORGI5S4Qge0jWbneVs1s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GztAUcynEsPUygGmj4DICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20cease%20fire%20soon%20violated%20because%20Egypt%27s%20Third%20Army%20Corps%20tried%20to%20break%20free%20of%20the%20Israeli%20Army%27s%20encirclement.%20The%20Egyptian%20action%20and%20the%20arrival%20of%20more%20Soviet%20equipment%20to%20Cairo%20permitted%20Israel%20to%20tighten%20its%20grip%20on%20the%20Egyptians&amp;f=false Chronological History of U.S. Foreign Relations by Lester H. Brune and Richard Dean Burns (Nov 22, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;
::::'''According to other sources, Israel broke the cease-fire first:'''
On October 22 the superpowers brokered UN Security Council Resolution 338. It provided the legal basis for ending the war, calling for a cease-fire to be in place within twelve hours, implementation of Resolution 242 'in all its parts' and negotiations between the parties. This marked the first occasion the Soviets had endorsed direct negotiations between the Arabs and Israel without conditions or qualifications. Meir, who was not consulted, was offended by this fait accompli, though she had little option but to comply.

Nevertheless, Meir was determined to gain the maximum strategic advantage before the final curtain came down on the conflict. Given the entanglement of the Egyptian and Israeli armies, the temptation was too great for the Israelis to resist. After a final push in the Sinai expelled the Egyptians, Meir gave the order to cross the Canal.

Israel's refusal to stop fighting after a United Nations cease-fire was in place on October 22 nearly involved the Soviet Union in the military confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;[Academic Journal.Stephens, Elizabeth.

'''Zabihollah Safa''' ({{lang-fa|ذبیح‌اللّه صفا}}) (May 7, 1911 in [[Shahmirzad]], [[Iran]] – April 29, 1999 in [[Lübeck]], [[Germany]]) was a scholar and professor Emeritus of [[Iranian Studies]] at the [[University of Tehran|University]] of [[Tehran]].

His main contribution to the field of [[Iranian studies]] is seen in his seminal and comprehensive works on the history of Persian literature. He was also a regular contributor to the [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]].

== Education ==

"After primary and secondary education in [[Babol]] and Tehran, he attended the Dar al-Mo’allemin-e Ali (later Daneshsara-ye Ali) and the University of Tehran where he received a doctorate in Persian literature in 1943. His thesis, a comprehensive study of epic narratives in Iran (Hamaseh – sarai dar Iran) was later published as a book and illustrated his ability to synthesize a vast range of readings into a coherent manual for teaching.

== Professional life ==

The topic chosen for his thesis was also an indication of his life long love for his country and his determination to bear witness through his writing to major literary, philosophic and scientific contributions made by Iranians to civilization at large.
His precocious talents and productivity also manifested itself in his journalistic activities as a young man. As early as 1933 he began contributing to the influential journal Mehr, and was its chief editor from 1937 to 1941.

He was also a capable administrator, again using his talents for organized and systematic work to the full. He taught at the University of Tehran from 1941, was appointed to the chair of Persian literary history in 1948, and was dean of the Faculty in 1963-1967.
Upon retirement, he became an emeritus professor in 1969. He also held high positions in other administrative spheres including the UNESCO commission in Iran and on the board of the ''Red Lion and Sun Organization'' (the Iranian counterpart to the [[Red Cross]]).

It is however, for his work as an editor of many classical texts and above all, for his monumental ''History of Persian Literature'' and his valuable anthology (translated into French in the [[UNESCO]] Collection as Anthologie de la poésie persane by [[Gilbert Lazard]], Roger Lescot and [[Henri Massé]], Paris, 1964) that he will be best remembered. ”

== Awards ==

Z. Safa has won several awards: a.o. Decoration (medal) for Science (1. class) (Cultural Ministry (1936), ''Nesân-e sepâs'', 1. class (1947), ''[[Palmes Académiques]]'' Rang Commandeur (French Government) (1970), ''Neshan-e Taj'' (1977), ''[[Ehsan Yarshater]]'' prize (1997)
