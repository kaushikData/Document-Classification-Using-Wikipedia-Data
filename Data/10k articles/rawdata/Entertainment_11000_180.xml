"'''$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)'''", also known as "'''$pringfield'''", is the tenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} [[The Simpsons (season 5)|fifth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on December 16, 1993. In the episode, [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] decides to legalize gambling to revitalize its economy. A casino owned by [[Mr. Burns]] is created and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] gets a job as a [[blackjack]] dealer. Meanwhile, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] develops a [[gambling addiction]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] starts his own casino, and Burns develops an odd personality in a parody of [[Howard Hughes]].

The episode was written by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], and directed by [[Wes Archer]]. [[Gerry Cooney]] and [[Robert Goulet]] guest starred as themselves. The episode features cultural references to the films ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Rain Man]]'', and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 11.7, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
[[File:Robert Goulet photo.jpg|thumb|170px|Special guest star [[Robert Goulet]]]]
The economy of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] is in decline, so [[Mayor Quimby]] listens to suggestions from citizens on how to improve it. [[Principal Skinner]] states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], likes the idea. [[Mr. Burns]] and Mayor Quimby work together to build a [[casino]], where [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a [[slot machine]]. She wins and almost immediately becomes [[problem gambling|addicted]] to gambling. Meanwhile, since [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts [[Robert Goulet]] to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a [[Howard Hughes]]-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinating in jars, and wearing tissue boxes instead of shoes.

Due to her addiction, Marge spends every waking moment at the casino and neglects her family. For instance, she forgets to help [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] make a costume for her geography pageant. Enraged, Homer bursts into the casino and barges around searching for Marge. The security cameras capture Homer's rampage, and when Mr. Burns sees him he demotes him back to his old job at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|power plant]]. After realizing how much he misses the plant, Mr. Burns decides to return. Homer confronts Marge with her behavior, and she finally realizes that she has a problem. Lisa does win a special prize in the geography pageant, as Homer's poor costume design gives Lisa the appearance that she did the work all by herself. [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] receives the same prize, as his costume is simply a note taped to his shirt that reads "[[Idaho]]".

==Production==
[[File:Bill Oakley2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bill Oakley]] was one of the writers of the episode. |alt=A portrait of a man with black hair looking at the viewer]]
The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in [[Mississippi]] that was introducing [[riverboat gambling]].&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "$pringfield" |medium=DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley said another inspiration for it was that there had not been many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how "crummy" the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how "crummy" and "dismal" Springfield was.&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "$pringfield" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The "way they radiate out" had always amazed him.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt; Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results.&lt;ref name="Archer"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Archer, Wes |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "$pringfield" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to [[James Bond]]. The staff liked the scene, so they decided to put it in the [[clip show]] episode "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]".&lt;ref name="Mirkin"/&gt;

There was a brief period when the episode had a different subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain [[Planet Hollywood]]. Groening had been told by a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in ''The Simpsons'', the creators of the restaurant, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Sylvester Stallone]], would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of ''The Simpsons'' were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.&lt;ref name="Groening"/&gt;
Instead, [[Gerry Cooney]] and [[Robert Goulet]] guest starred as themselves. Executive producer [[David Mirkin]] enjoyed directing Goulet because he was "such a good sport" and had "a great sense of humor".&lt;ref name="Mirkin"/&gt; Oakley thought it was nice that Goulet was willing to make fun of himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt; This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the [[Siegfried and Roy]]-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their [[white tiger]], Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. ''The Simpsons'' production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was "bound to happen" sooner or later.&lt;ref name="Mirkin"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Mirkin, David |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "$pringfield" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rich Texan]] also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as "Senator" by Homer.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
[[File:Howard Hughes.jpg|thumb|Mr. Burns's paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness, and his refusal to leave his bedroom once the casino opens, is a parody of American magnate [[Howard Hughes]].]]
The title is a reference to the 1964 film ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'', the music of which was composed by [[Laurie Johnson]]. Two of his songs, ''Happy-go-lively'' and ''Rue de la park'' can be heard within the News on Parade segment at the beginning of the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jul/16/stanleykubrick2 |title=Stanley and Bart... another Kubrick legend |date=July 16, 1999 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=March 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns' bed looks similar to the one occupied by [[Keir Dullea]]'s character [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|Dave Bowman]] in the end of the 1968 film, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Tom Cruise]] appear at the casino to reprise their roles from the 1988 film ''[[Rain Man]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Homer is impressed by the card-counting abilities of a man who resembles Raymond Babbitt, Hoffman's character in the film.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=[[The Simpsons episode guides#The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family|The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]] |others=Created by Matt Groening; edited by Ray Richmond and Antonia Coffman. |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperPerennial]] |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |isbn=978-0-06-095252-5 |page=131 |ref={{harvid|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]]'s show at midnight is similar to [[Bill Cosby]]'s 1971 album ''[[For Adults Only]]'', which was recorded at a casino at midnight.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Marge reminds Homer that his lifelong dream was to be a contestant on the television show ''[[The Gong Show]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Burns's paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness, and his refusal to leave his bedroom once the casino opens, parodies American magnate [[Howard Hughes]], who had [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and was involved in the casino business in his later years. The "Spruce Moose", an absurdly tiny wooden plane Burns makes in the episode, is a parody of Hughes' impractically enormous wooden plane, derisively nicknamed the "[[Hughes H-4 Hercules|Spruce Goose]]".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Homer parodies the scene in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' when the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] demonstrates his newly acquired intelligence by (incorrectly) reciting the law that governs the lengths of the sides of an [[isosceles triangle]]. Unlike in the film, somebody correctly points out that the [[Pythagorean theorem]] recited applies only to [[right triangle]]s, not all isosceles triangles.&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Groening, Matt |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "$pringfield" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "$pringfield" finished 35th in the ratings for the week of December 13 to December 19, 1993, with a Nielsen Rating of 11.7, translating to 11 million households. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nielsen Ratings/December 13–19 |work=Long Beach Press-Telegram |page=C6 |date=December 22, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that "this excellent episode includes a surprising number of concurrent plots. Homer also works in the casino and tries to care for the family without Marge.

'''Adolphe Appia''' (1 September 1862 – 29 February 1928), son of Red Cross co-founder [[Louis Appia]], was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] architect and theorist of [[stage lighting]] and [[décor]].

Appia is best known for his many scenic designs for [[Wagner]]’s operas. He rejected painted two-dimensional sets for three-dimensional "living" sets because he believed that shade was as necessary as light to form a connection between the actor and the setting of the performance in time and space. Through the use of control of light intensity, colour and manipulation, Appia created a new perspective of scene design and stage lighting.

Directors and designers have both taken great inspiration from the work of Adolphe Appia, whose design theories and conceptualizations of Wagner’s operas have helped to shape modern perceptions of the relationship between the performance space and lighting. One of the reasons for the influence of Appia’s work and theories, is that he was working at time when electrical lighting was just evolving. Another is that he was a man of great vision who was able to conceptualize and philosophize about many of his practices and theories.

The central principle underpinning much of Appia’s work is that artistic unity is the primary function of the director and the designer. Appia maintained that two dimensional set painting and the performance dynamics it created, was the major cause of production disunity in his time. He advocated three elements as fundamental to creating a unified and effective [[mise en scene]]:
# Dynamic and three dimensional movements by actors
# Perpendicular scenery
# Using depth and the horizontal dynamics of the performance space
(Brockett 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, O. ''History of the Theatre'', Allyn and Bacon, Boston, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appia saw light, space and the human body as malleable commodities which should be integrated to create a unified mise en scene. He advocated synchronicity of sound, light and movement in his productions of Wagner’s operas and he tried to integrate corps of actors with the rhythms and moods of the music. Ultimately however, Appia considered light as the primary element which fused together all aspects of a production and he consistently attempted to unify musical and movement elements of the text and score to the more mystical and symbolic aspects of light. He often tried to have actors, singers and dancers start with a strong symbolic gesture or movement and end with another strong symbolic pose or gesture. In his productions, light was ever changing, manipulated from moment to moment, from action to action. Ultimately, Appia sought to unify stage movement and the use of space, stage rhythm and the mise en scene.

Appia was one of the first designers to understand the potential of stage lighting to do more than merely illuminate actors and painted scenery. His ideas about the staging of "word-tone drama", together with his own stagings of [[Tristan und Isolde]] ([[Milan]] 1923) and parts of the [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]] ([[Basle]] 1924-25) have influenced later stagings, especially those of the second half of the twentieth century.

For Appia and for his productions, the mise en scene and the totality or unity of the performance experience was primary and he believed that these elements drove movement and initiated action more than any thing else (Johnston 1972). Appia’s designs and theories went on to inspire many other theatre creators such as [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Jacques Copeau]] and [[Wieland Wagner]].

'''Anti-siphoning laws''' and regulations are designed to prevent [[pay television]] broadcasters from buying [[monopoly]] rights to televise important and culturally significant events before [[free-to-air]] television has a chance to bid on them.  The theory is that if such a monopoly was allowed, then those unable or unwilling to obtain access to the pay television service would be unable to view the important and culturally significant events. Generally the laws allow pay-TV to bid for such monopoly rights only if free-to-air television has declined to bid on them.

Notable examples of such policies are present in Australia and the United Kingdom. Anti-siphoning in the [[United States]] was introduced by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] in 1975 and was soon overturned as unconstitutional. Some sports leagues do contractually obligate that their broadcasters include a certain number of telecasts on over-the-air television as part of their overall contracts. For games broadcast exclusively by pay television channels, the [[National Football League]] similarly requires [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]], over-the-air [[simulcast]]s in the markets of the teams involved, to ensure that all of a team's games are available locally on broadcast television.

{{main|Anti-siphoning laws in Australia}}

Anti-siphoning laws in Australia cover specific listed events, such as all [[Olympic Games]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]], the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[Rugby World Cup]], and [[Rugby League World Cup]] finals, events in major sports (such as association football, cricket, and rugby tests) that involve Australian senior national teams or are hosted by Australia, and culturally-significant events such as the [[Australian Football League]] and [[National Rugby League]] premierships, the [[State of Origin series]], all games in the [[Australian Open]], the [[Melbourne Cup]] horse race, the [[Bathurst 1000]], the [[Australian Grand Prix]], and the [[Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017C00987|title=Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No. 1) 2010|last=Communications|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aus-ott"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-siphoning laws are duping viewers, says ASTRA boss|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/antisiphoning-laws-are-duping-viewers-says-astra-boss/news-story/099c060ea4f23d3840139f876e9271a5|website=The Australian|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/government-proposes-reduce-anti-siphoning-list-100-events-442921|title=Government proposes to reduce anti-siphoning list by 100 events|date=2017-05-06|work=Mumbrella|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
Indian law requires all sporting events of "national importance" to be simulcast by the state-owned terrestrial channel [[DD National]] if their rights are held by a pay television service. [[Tata Sky]], a DTH satellite provider co-owned with [[Star Sports]], challenged the rule, arguing that it devalued its exclusive rights to these events, since all television providers must carry DD National by law. In 2017, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that the "must-share" provision applies only to terrestrial television and [[DD Free Dish]], and that pay television providers [[Blackout (broadcasting)|may not re-transmit]] these telecasts from DD National, thus requiring customers of these services to subscribe to the respective pay channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/sc-order-dilutes-doordarshan-presence-in-dth-cable-space/articleshow/60218544.cms|title=SC order dilutes Doordarshan presence in DTH, cable space|work=Mumbai Mirror|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionpost.com/television/star-warns-cable-tv-dth-platforms-against-re-transmitting-dds-feed-of-india-cricket-matches/|title=Star warns cable TV, DTH platforms against re-transmitting DD’s feed of India cricket matches|website=Television Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) approved draft "must-have" regulations, requiring designated events to be carried by free-to-air channels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top sports events must air free: NBTC|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Top-sports-events-must-air-free-NBTC-30193747.html|work=The Nation|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The [[Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events]] regulates that coverage of certain major sporting events (known as "Category A" events, covering certain major domestic events and major international competitions such as the Olympics and FIFA World Cup) must be broadcast primarily on a free-to-air channel (but can share coverage with pay channels), while certain events known as "Category B" events can be shown on pay channels, but supplemental coverage (such as highlights or a delayed broadcast) must be provided by a free-to-air channel.

==United States==
In the early days of [[cable television]] the [[Federal Communications Commission]] refused to regulate it. In 1958 the FCC ruled that cable TV was not a [[common carrier]] and thus is not subject to FCC jurisdiction. In 1960 the FCC lobbied ''against'' placing cable TV under its jurisdiction, arguing that the administrative burden is inadequate to low perceived threats of unchecked cable development. In 1965 the FCC changed its stance and imposed [[must-carry]] rules, requiring cable providers to carry local free-to-air channels, and banned importation of distant channels that duplicated content available on local free-to-air channels.

In the end of the 1960s the public and the government raised concerns that cable operators can outbid free-to-air channels and "siphon" popular content, first of all sports, off the free air.&lt;ref name=P21&gt;Perrine, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific events like the [[Super Bowl]] were deemed particularly vulnerable due to greater [[Elasticity (economics)|inelasticity of demand]].&lt;ref name=P22&gt;Perrine, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 the FCC imposed anti-siphoning regulations that limited the operations of sports and film channels. Under the regulations, cable channels could not devote more than 90% of their time to film and sports, and could not broadcast films less than three years old. Specific (i.e. annual) sporting events could not be "siphoned off" by cable at all if they had been broadcast on free airwaves during any of the previous five years.&lt;ref name=P22/&gt; Cable coverage of regular season games in popular championships was limited so that only a fraction of all games could be shown on cable.&lt;ref name=P22/&gt; Should sports coverage on free-to-air channels decrease, stipulated the FCC, cable operators had to decrease their sports programming proportionately.&lt;ref name=P22/&gt; Administrative record, however, did not support FCC allegations of "siphoning".&lt;ref name=P23&gt;Perrine, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=July 2015}}

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and a number of cable providers contested the FCC ruling in courts as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=P22/&gt; In 1977 the [[DC Circuit Court]] consolidated these cases in ''[[HBO|Home Box Office]] vs. the FCC'' and found that the FCC trespassed over the rights guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The court ruled that cable bandwidth is not a scarce resource, thus it is not subject to limitations allowed by the ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission|Red Lion vs. the FCC]]'' ruling. The court applied the [[United States v. O'Brien|O'Brien test]] (the FCC failed two of its four "prongs"&lt;ref name=P23/&gt;) and found that the degree of limitation of free speech imposed by the FCC was inadequate, "grossly overboard"&lt;ref name=P23/&gt; and thus "arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional".&lt;ref name=P22/&gt;

In recent years, a growing number of major domestic and international sporting events previously aired by free-to-air channels have migrated to pay-TV outlets. Since 2007, excluding the World Series, [[Major League Baseball]]'s postseason playoffs have largely moved to cable, while [[ESPN]] airs the majority of [[bowl games]] of [[college football]] (including the [[College Football Playoff]] and [[College Football Playoff National Championship|National Championship]], and those owned and operated by its subsidiary [[ESPN Events]]). Three of the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]]s are aired exclusively by ESPN (the French Open is held by [[Tennis Channel]] and [[NBC]]), and the majority of regional broadcasts in major leagues are now shown primarily by [[regional sports network]]s (with relatively few or no games broadcast on local free-to-air TV unless it is either nationally televised or only aired over-the-air due to RSN rights conflicts).

Some experts have attributed the decline of professional boxing to the move of boxing from FTA network television to premium pay-television, with boxing matches almost exclusively being shown on HBO, Showtime, or pay-per-view and ownership consolidated to those networks and a few selective promotion organizations.

Ratings for college football's national championship, NASCAR's Sprint Cup championship race, tennis majors, and golf's Open Championship have suffered from the siphoning to ESPN.  NASCAR's new 2015-24 television contract with Comcast's [[NBCUniversal]] for [[NBC]] and their cable network [[NBC Sports Network]] during the second half of the season requires the broadcast of the championship race to be on NBC, where in previous years it only aired on ESPN.  Likewise, golf's [[The Open Championship]] returned to network television in 2016, with weekend coverage on NBC and early round coverage on [[Golf Channel]]. Both the [[Premier League]] and The Open are unique in that network television coverage is available in the United States, while their home country is on pay television.

=== National Football League ===
{{see also|National Football League on television#National games}}
The [[National Football League]] implements an anti-siphoning policy as part of its television contracts. The majority of Sunday games are broadcast on over-the-air television by either [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] or [[Fox NFL|Fox]] in order to reach the largest audience possible, although the games broadcast during the main afternoon windows are determined by the viewer's region, and viewers must purchase the [[out-of-market sports package]] [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] (which is carried exclusively by [[DirecTV]]) in order to view games that are not shown in their region. Certain flagship games are also broadcast nationally on network television, including [[NBC]]'s weekly ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'', as well as the three annual [[NFL on Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day games]], and the entirety of the post-season.

[[ESPN]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', as well as selected ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games on [[NFL Network]], are only televised nationally on pay television. In these cases, NFL rules require simulcasts of the games to be [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to television stations within the home markets of the teams that are participating.  This ensures that the games are still available on broadcast TV in the local markets, whilst maintaining cable exclusivity for the games outside of the market. Beginning in 2014, ESPN has also held rights to a post-season [[NFL Wild card|wild card game]]; in the first year of this arrangement, the game was only simulcast in the markets of the teams involved, as with its other games. However, in 2015, ESPN announced that it would begin to simulcast the game nationally on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]] (which returned the NFL to the network for the first time since [[Super Bowl XL]]) instead.&lt;ref name="espnabc2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=ESPN to again simulcast its NFL Wild Card Playoff game on ABC|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/espn-to-again-simulcast-its-nfl-wild-card-playoff-game-on-abc.html |author=Ken Fang |work=Awful Announcing |date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Thursday Night Football'' package previously aired exclusively on NFL Network. The package generated a major controversy in December 2007, due to a Saturday-night game in the package between the [[2007 New England Patriots – New York Giants game|New England Patriots and New York Giants]], where the Patriots were vying to become the first team since 1972 to have completed the regular season with a perfect record. At the time, NFL Network was not carried by all major television providers ([[Xfinity|Comcast]] and [[Time Warner Cable]] insisted that they be able to carry NFL Network on a sports tier), and concerns were expressed by critics, such as then [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]], that the "historic" game would not be available to the majority of viewers outside of the teams' markets (where the game was to air on [[WWOR-TV]], [[WCVB-TV]], and [[WMUR-TV]]) if it were not nationally-televised on broadcast television. The NFL compromised by allowing CBS and NBC to simulcast the game, in addition to the three team market stations and NFL Network; commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] stated that the decision was "in the best interest of our fans."&lt;ref name="07PatriotsGiants"&gt;{{cite web | last = Donohue | first = Steve | title = NFL to Simulcast Patriots-Giants Game on CBS, NBC | publisher = Multichannel News | date = 2007-12-26 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/news/cable-operators/nfl-simulcast-patriots-giants-game-cbs-nbc/330859 | accessdate = 2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement did generate some controversy among broadcasters; WWOR owner [[Fox Television Stations]] and WCVB/WMUR owner [[Hearst-Argyle Television]] argued that the simulcast devalued what would have been their exclusive local rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6515726.html|title=NFL Working Toward Local Accords Over Patriots Game|last=|first=|date=|website=Multichannel News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101123638/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6515726.html|archive-date=January 1, 2008|dead-url=true|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, as part of an overall effort to increase the prominence of the Thursday games, several of the games began to be broadcast and co-produced by CBS, in simulcast with NFL Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/04/07/Media/NFL-Thursday-nights.aspx|title=Execs expect strong NFL slate for CBS|website=Sports Business Daily|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 and 2017 seasons, this block of games began to be split between CBS and NBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/02/01/nfl-reaches-deal-with-cbs-nbc-to-split-thursday-night-football/|title=NFL reaches deal with CBS, NBC to split ‘Thursday Night Football’|last=Boren|first=Cindy|date=2016-02-01|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; but moved to Fox in 2018.&lt;ref name="foxnfldraft"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/sports/football/fox-nfl-draft.html|title=Fox to Broadcast N.F.L.

'''Belarusfilm''' ({{lang-be|Беларусьфільм}}, {{lang-ru|Беларусьфильм}}) is the main [[film studio]] of [[Belarus]].

==History==

Depending on your source, Belarusfilm, under the name [[Belgoskino]] was founded either in 1924&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belarusfilm.by/studio/history/ Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|pages=vol. 3, p. 99|year=1970|location=Moscow|language=Russian|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the ''Soviet Belarus'' studio (''Савецкая Беларусь'') in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], the studio was moved to [[Minsk]] in 1939. Film production was interrupted by [[World War II]], and restarted in 1946, when the studio assumed its current name.

In [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the studio was dubbed ''Partizanfilm'', due to the large output of films portraying the [[Soviet partisan]]'s struggle against [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] occupation. The studio was, however, also renowned for its [[children's film]]s.

The studio has to date made 131 animated films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_studia&amp;sid=28&amp;sp=2 Chronological list of Belarusfilm animated films] at [[animator.ru]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first project was a coproduction with [[Soyuzmultfilm]] in 1963; a [[stop motion]] feature film called ''Attention! The Magician is in the City!''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_film&amp;fid=2371 ''Attention! The Magician is in the City!''] at animator.ru&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent animated film production, however, did not begin until 1972.

Most of the output has been in [[Russian language|Russian]] rather than [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]].

Belarusfilm is also a co-organizer of the [[Listapad]] film festival held in [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]] in November.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6425">==History==
Biblical storytellers place themselves in line with the [[oral tradition]] of the Biblical time-period, understanding that the normal mode of engaging with the Bible during this time was through the public reading of scripture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%204:13;&amp;version=47; 1 Timothy 4:13]&lt;/ref&gt; or in the retelling of stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Biblical storytelling as a discipline may be traced to Tom Boomershine, a longtime professor at [[United Theological Seminary]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] who experimented with the idea of memorising stories in the Bible and performing them during his years in [[seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbsint.org/What%20Is%20NOBS.wmv What is NOBS movie 1:35]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Tom Boomershine explains his introduction to Biblical Storytelling&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he together with Gil Bartholomew (now Adam Bartholomew) then went to begin the Network of Biblical Storytellers (NBS). Biblical storytelling guilds began to form internationally, with one forming in [[Australia]] in 1990, one in [[Canada]] in 1996, and later ones in the [[United Kingdom]] and in [[Singapore]]. Boomershine was also the founder and former chair of the Bible in Ancient and Modern Media group in the [[Society of Biblical Literature]], which researches the art and practice of Biblical storytelling in the ancient and modern world as well as how different media have been and continue to be used to disseminate Biblical material.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomboomershine.org/pages/abouttom.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianbook.com/bible-ancient-modern-media-story-performance/9781556359903/pd/359903&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

===Internalization===
The term [[memorization]] is rarely used when describing storytelling because it usually is taken to mean [[rote learning]]. Instead the process is described as 'internalization' or 'committing to deep memory'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nobs.org/what_is.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this process the general expectation is that the storyteller will be able to tell the story with 95% content accuracy and 75% verbal accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homileticsonline.com/subscriber/interviews/dewey.asp Interview with Dennis Dewey&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques may be used as follows:
#Making sure the script is easy to read
#Breaking up the story into scenes
#Identifying key words and phrases
#Identifying locations
#Investigating and understanding characters
#Tracking the emotional journey
#Understanding how the story functions in the wider context

===Presentation===
[[Image:KableDaleStorytelling.jpg|frame|right|Kable Dale from The Backyard Bard]]
Presenting a story from the Bible borrows many techniques from [[acting]], yet in many ways it is quite a distinct art form. Instead of solely taking on one character, the storyteller describes the entire scene in the imagination of the audience. Because storytelling is usually done without many [[Theatrical property|props]] or sets, this requires the storyteller to visualise the scene of the story in order to describe it physically whilst telling the story. A number of techniques may be used:
#'''Locations''' - Using consistent places in the space for locations and characters in the story.
#'''Reacting''' - Acting as an emotional guide for the audience.
#'''Gesturing''' - Pointing or gesturing to show the audience where objects are in the imaginary scene.
#'''Miming''' - Interacting with things or characters to give them a tangible reality.
#'''Acting Out''' - Demonstrating events or actions whilst talking about them.
#'''Characterization''' - Using different tones of voice/accents or different stances to distinguish different characters and to give them depth and meaning.

==Types==

===Single person performances===
Much of Biblical Storytelling is done as a single storyteller learning one story from the Bible and performing it:
* when the Bible passage would normally be read (e.g. in Church meeting)
* as a special drama for an occasion (the death and resurrection of Jesus for an Easter event)
* in a meeting of storytellers to share stories

===Epic storytelling===
At events where storytellers are gathering together, an ''Epic Storytelling'' may be set where different parts of the longer story are distributed to those coming together before the gathering and the epic story is told at the event with each of the storytellers telling their sections.

===Ensemble storytelling===
[[Image:EnsembleStorytelling.jpg|frame|right|180px|Ensemble Storytelling in ''Daniel - Dream Interpreter'' by The Backyard Bard]]
In a theatrical Biblical Storytelling performance with multiple storytellers, there may be only one ''speaking'' storyteller at a time, so the other storytellers may be used to enhance the telling in the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebackyardbard.com/Workshops/EnsembleStorytelling.pdf A workshop on Ensemble Storytelling by The Backyard Bard]&lt;/ref&gt;
* by being non-verbal characters in the scene
* to be part of the set
* lines could be distributed or said in unison for dramatic effect
* by adding a soundscape (e.g. cheering, mourning, laughing or making sound effects)

==Synopsis==

===Setting and overview===
The series is set in the [[Rocky Mountains]] at a [[summer camp]] mirroring a BSA-structured camp. [[GLAAD]] describes ''Camp Abercorn'' as "A new fictional dramatic web series... follow[ing] the staff [who] develop as leaders, or Compass Guides, while learning and growing away from the pressures of school and work."&lt;ref name=Katz1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz1|first1=Joeli|title=Camp Abercorn web series spotlights room for improvement in Boy Scouts|url=http://www.glaad.org/blog/camp-abercorn-web-series-spotlights-room-improvement-boy-scouts|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=GLAAD|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp is typical of scouting camps that generally deal with social interactions that are almost exclusively between males.

===Characters===
Colin: Colin hails from [[London]] and is a direct descendant of one of the Compass Guides founders. He wants nothing to do with the camp.

Mark: Mark is Camp Abercorn's new director.

Russell: Russell is a "archetypical life-time scout" who is the [[shooting sports]] director at Camp Abercorn.&lt;ref name=Hinzmann1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinzmann|first1=Dennis|title=Fund This: Camp Abercorn Parallels Boy Scout Summer Camp|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2014/07/29/fund-%E2%80%9Ccamp-abercorn%E2%80%9D-parallels-boy-scout-summer-camp|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=Out.com|date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ralph1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ralph|first1=Matt|title=Actor who played Buddy Garrity starring in new summer camp series|url=http://www.summercampculture.com/actor-who-played-buddy-garrity-starring-in-new-summer-camp-series/|accessdate=3 August 2014|publisher=Summer Camp Culture|date=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zak: Zak is Russell's protege, and also happens to be gay.

===Plot===
A British teenager angry with the world, a closeted Eagle Guide, and a Shooting Sports Director with a thirst for power, are part of the colorful staff that collide at Compass Guide Camp. A mysterious new Camp Director with a militant past (and pet chicken) finds he’s not sure where he’s going, but he’s leading the way.

==Impact==
Jeffrey Simon, executive producer of the series, hopes to "re-direct the conversation away from executives in fancy offices and bring it back to the values of scouts and importance of camp".&lt;ref name=Harrington1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harrington|first1=Tom|title=Meet the former Boy Scout behind Boy Scouts webseries 'Camp Abercorn'|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/boy-scout-webseries-camp-abercorn/|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=Daily Dot|date=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with "I am in awe of what activist organizations like Scouts for Equality and their LGBT allies have done and are still doing to bring change to the BSA. Boycotts and activism can go far to change policy, but no amount of lecturing can change people. What can change people are stories. What can change hearts and minds are stories."&lt;ref name=spidvid1&gt;{{cite news|title=An Inside Look Into the Dramatic Series Camp Abercorn|url=http://www.spidvid.com/blog/2014/07/camp-abercorn-interview/|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=Spidvid|date=15 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052445/http://www.spidvid.com/blog/2014/07/camp-abercorn-interview/#|archive-date=2014-08-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series, acting as one of those stories, brings more attention to the BSA's policy of excluding gay men serving in leadership positions.&lt;ref name=Geoffroy1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geoffroy|first1=Kyler|title=NEW WEBSERIES ‘CAMP ABERCORN’ TO SPOTLIGHT BOY SCOUTS BAN ON GAY LEADERS: VIDEO|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2014/07/new-webseries-camp-abercorn-to-spotlight-boy-scouts-ban-on-gay-leaders-video.html|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=Towle Road|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gus1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gus|title=Camp Abercorn: A New Dramatic Series|url=http://queermeup.com/featured-2/camp-abercorn-new-dramatic-series/|accessdate=3 August 2014|publisher=Queer Me Up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rukkle1&gt;{{cite news|title=New Web Series ‘Camp Abercorn’ Needs Your Help|url=http://rukkle.com/gay-news/camp-abercorn-funding-indiegogo/|accessdate=3 August 2014|publisher=Rukkle|date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon continued, "I hope this series will help bring back some interest in the Boy Scouts. We need an organization to train our future leaders; leaders that believe in the power of equality. I hope I can one day join the troop and give back to the organization that gave me so much."&lt;ref name=Papa1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Papa|first1=Rocco|title=New online series plans to shed light on gay equality in the Boy Scouts|url=http://lgbteen.org/2014/08/new-online-series-plans-to-shed-light-on-gay-equality-in-the-boy-scouts/|accessdate=3 August 2014|publisher=LGBT Teen|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club Nintendo''' was the name of several publications and a better-known [[customer loyalty program]] provided by [[Nintendo]]. The loyalty program was free to join and provided rewards in exchange for consumer feedback and loyalty to purchasing official Nintendo products. Members of Club Nintendo earned credits or "coins" by submitting codes found on Nintendo products and systems, which could be traded in for special edition items only available on Club Nintendo. Rewards included objects such as playing cards, tote bags, controllers, downloadable content, and warranty extensions on select Nintendo products.

On January 20, 2015, it was announced that Club Nintendo would be discontinued in North America on June 30, 2015 and in Europe and Japan on September 30, 2015 due to an upcoming new loyalty program. ''[[Flipnote Studio 3D]]'' later became available to all North American Club Nintendo members for free for a limited time, and users who signed up to the European version of the new loyalty program during the launch period received Flipnote Studio 3D for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://club2.nintendo.com/program-notice/ |title=Nintendo.com - Club Nintendo Program Notice |website=Club2.nintendo.com |date=2015-01-20 |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501202603/http://club2.nintendo.com/program-notice/ |archivedate=2017-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/News/2015/January/Important-information-about-the-discontinuation-of-Club-Nintendo-949921.html |title=Important information about the discontinuation of Club Nintendo &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/information/2015/0120.html |title=「クラブニンテンドー」サービス終了のお知らせ｜サポート情報｜Nintendo |website=Nintendo.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315172513/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/information/2015/0120.html |archivedate=2017-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2015, after suddenly announcing their business partnership venture with [[DeNA]], Nintendo stated that they were working with them on a new, cross-platform membership service called [[My Nintendo]] to supersede Club Nintendo for the [[Wii U]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], and [[Nintendo Switch]], alongside other devices such as [[Tablet computer|tablets]], [[smartphone]]s and [[Personal computer|PCs]]. It was initially launched in Japan on March 17, 2016, alongside Nintendo's first mobile title, ''[[Miitomo]]''.&lt;ref name="NL-cites-DeNA-work"&gt;{{cite web |first=Damien |last=McFerran |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/nintendo_teases_cross-platform_club_nintendo_successor_in_conjunction_with_dena |title=Nintendo Teases Cross-Platform Club Nintendo Successor In Conjunction With DeNA |publisher=[[Nintendo Life]] |date=2015-03-17 |accessdate=2015-03-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320001723/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/nintendo_teases_cross-platform_club_nintendo_successor_in_conjunction_with_dena |archivedate=2015-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
===Europe===
In [[Europe]], ''Club Nintendo'' was the name of three magazines which started publishing in 1989. The European version was published in several languages, and there were separate publications for [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Italy]] and [[Slovenia]]. All were later discontinued and eventually replaced. The last German issue was published in August 2002.&lt;ref name="silius1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nesfountain.silius.net/clubnintendo.shtml |title=Account Suspended |website=Nesfountain.silius.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065509/http://nesfountain.silius.net/clubnintendo.shtml |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
''[http://revistaclubnintendo.com/ Club Nintendo]'' is the name of the official Nintendo [[magazine]] in [[Mexico]]. The magazine was founded in December 1990 by José "Pepe" Sierra and Gustavo "Gus" Rodríguez. It was the first magazine in Mexico about Nintendo made by fans of video games, and quickly became the leading game magazine in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Australia===
In [[Australia]] ''Club Nintendo'' was a magazine that started in 1991 and was published by Catalyst Publishing in Melbourne. Roughly 31 pages in length, it featured very few screenshots of games. Australia eventually received their own version of [[Nintendo Magazine System (Australia)|Nintendo Magazine System]] by which time this magazine had ceased. Catalyst Publishing later took over Nintendo Magazine System in 1996 from the previous publisher.

==Loyalty program==
The Club Nintendo [[loyalty program]] offers rewards to members who collect points (sometimes referred to as "Stars" or "Star Points", the program is also commonly known as the '''Stars Catalogue'''; the North American Club uses "[[Super Mario (series)#Coins|Coins]]") which are gained primarily by purchasing and registering certain first-party hardware and software titles by Nintendo. Points are also awarded for the purchase of select third-party titles, and can also be obtained by participating in surveys, inviting others to become a Club Nintendo member or even simply visiting a web site.

Rewards range from digital content such as [[computer wallpaper]], music and mobile phone ringtones, to physical items such as keyrings, calendars, T-shirts and other clothing items, to premium items such as soundtrack albums and game controllers. Some of the premium rewards included Club Nintendo exclusive video games, offered as either digital content ([[WiiWare]], [[DSiWare]]) or a physical item ([[Wii]], [[Nintendo DS|DS]]) depending on how, on a game by game basis, they were offered. Many reward items were exclusive to particular Club Nintendo territories, and physical items sometimes were only available in limited quantities.

===Japan===
Club Nintendo (Japanese: クラブニンテンドー) is an official Nintendo club for [[Japan]]ese fans. It launched on October 31, 2003 and was the second Nintendo reward program to be set (Coming after the European Nintendo VIP 24:7 program) but was the first to be called '''Club Nintendo'''.

The Japanese Club Nintendo offers rewards such as [[Wii Remote]]s with television remote control functionality, exclusive and unreleased to market games such as ''[[Tingle's Balloon Fight DS]]'' and ''[[Exclamation Warriors Sakeburein]]'', game soundtrack [[Compact Disc|CDs]] (like Touch! Generations Soundtrack) and exclusive accessories such as a [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] style [[Classic Controller]] for the Wii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/835/835801p1.html |title=SNES Controller for Wii - IGN |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129112435/http://wii.ign.com/articles/835/835801p1.html |archivedate=2009-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Club Nintendo in [[Europe]] was launched as '''Nintendo VIP 24:7''' on May 3, 2002, to coincide with the European launch of the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. It promised exclusive news, reviews, previews and forums to members. However, because released titles are often delayed in European countries (usually due to localization), the exclusive features could be often found elsewhere on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingworldx.com/features/AcrossthePondEuropeanGamec.shtml |title=GamingWorld - X Clusive Across the Pond: European Gamecube Launch Special |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019021843/http://www.gamingworldx.com/features/AcrossthePondEuropeanGamec.shtml |archivedate=2006-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To coincide with the release of the [[Wii]], VIP 24:7 was renamed to Club Nintendo and adopted the Japanese Club Nintendo logo.

The Club Nintendo of Europe featured a Star Points system, where members could exchange stars earned by registering games and consoles for items in the Stars Catalogue, and for [[Wii Points]] to use in the [[Wii Shop Channel]], which were available only in sets of 100, 300, 500 and 1000 Points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nintendo Europe Wii Points Card Shop |first= |title=Wii Points Card Shop |publisher=Nintendo |date=2007-12-07 |url=https://wiipointscard.nintendo-europe.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121217164816/https://wiipointscard.nintendo-europe.com/ |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, a maximum of two Wii Points Cards per day and per account were available for purchase; this later changed to one a day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121217165150/https://wiipointscard.nintendo-europe.com/faq/uk_faq.html] &lt;/ref&gt; Starting in September 2008, stars could also be used to buy singles and albums at the music online store, emusu.com, a website of which has shutdown.

Members enter PIN codes found on inserts included with certain games and hardware to earn stars. These can range from 100 to 1000 stars in value. Upon registering as a member on Nintendo of Europe's website, one is rewarded with 250 stars. Encouraging other people to register with Nintendo of Europe earns members 250 stars per sign-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/register/index.jsp |title=Nintendo |website=Webarchive.loc.gov |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050822122836/http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/register/index.jsp |archivedate=2005-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After registering, members can choose to receive special emails from Nintendo, which can include surveys which also reward members with stars. Daily visits to the website also once earned members 5 stars per day, but this was later removed.

===North America===
In 2002, a registration program titled My Nintendo (not to be confused with the loyalty program of the same name, ''[[My Nintendo]]'') began in North America. It allowed consumers to register their games and consoles online using a printed code included with the products, with no direct physical rewards or benefits for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.ca/2002/english/register.shtml |title=Nintendo Game Boy Player |website=Nintendo.ca |date=2003-11-11 |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064112/http://www.nintendo.ca/2002/english/register.shtml |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions began being raised over Club Nintendo's conspicuous absence in the region by 2005. In 2007, then-vice president of Marketing and Corporate Affairs for Nintendo of America Inc. (NOA) [[Perrin Kaplan]] stated that the inclusion area of the United States is much larger than all the other Club Nintendo countries, and that the program was considered prohibitively expensive to set up.

The North America catalog was developed in conjunction with Nintendo Australia{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} and uses [[Super Mario (series)#Coins|Coins]] instead of Stars.

Program participants who meet 300-Coin "Gold" or 600-Coin "Platinum" benchmarks within the Club Nintendo year (July 1–June 30) also receive exclusive items. Platinum Rewards are usually premium items, such as plush hats or posters. However, in 2014, there were no physical rewards for either Platinum or Gold, instead a selection of Wii/3DS games which were already released on the [[eShop]] were offered. In the past, some of the most notable Platinum Member rewards were a special standalone WiiWare version of ''[[Punch-Out!! (Wii)|Punch-Out!!]]'' titled ''[[Doc Louis's Punch-Out!!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marcel van Duyn |url=http://wiiware.nintendolife.com/news/2009/07/take_on_doc_louis_in_a_club_nintendo_exclusive_punch_out_game |title=Take on Doc Louis in a Club Nintendo Exclusive Punch-Out!!

In 2011, Nintendo of America started offering download codes for downloadable games as rewards, available for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] and the [[Wii U]] consoles as well as the [[Wii]] or the Wii U via Wii Mode, of which would typically range from 100 to 250 coins. There were eight games offered (originally two to four), which would change roughly each month. When orders for the non-game rewards were closed from April 18, 2014 until May 13, 2014, 5 different games were added, making a total of 9 games.

===Oceania===
Club Nintendo in [[Australia]] was launched on April 24, 2008 to coincide with the release of ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', with the website, catalogue and product registration going live on March 11, 2009 using the same system offered by Nintendo of Europe.&lt;ref name="Vooks"&gt;{{cite web |author=Today |url=http://www.vooks.net/club-nintendo-australia-goes-live-were-not-kidding/ |title=Club Nintendo Australia goes live (we're not kidding) - General News from |publisher=Vooks |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427101406/http://www.vooks.net/club-nintendo-australia-goes-live-were-not-kidding/ |archivedate=2017-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nintendo Australia]] asserted that the Australian Club Nintendo reward catalogue would be unique from that of Club Nintendo Europe and Club Nintendo Japan, and was developed in conjunction with Nintendo of America. However, unlike its North American counterpart, the Australian service used Stars instead of Coins - the same as its European counterpart.

Most games either distributed or published by Nintendo Australia after ''Mario Kart Wii'' contained a card that allows buyers to register their games for Club Nintendo points.

Club Nintendo Australia was available for both Australians and New Zealanders, as Nintendo Australia manages Nintendo's operations in New Zealand as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Life|first1=Nintendo|title=Nintendo Australia Lists eShop Offerings Redeemable Via Club Nintendo Stars Catalogue|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/04/nintendo_australia_lists_eshop_offerings_redeemable_via_club_nintendo_stars_catalogue|website=Nintendo Life|date=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118035611/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/04/nintendo_australia_lists_eshop_offerings_redeemable_via_club_nintendo_stars_catalogue|archivedate=18 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Club Nintendo launched in [[South Africa]] in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nintendo.co.za/NOE/en_ZA/news/2008/the_new_nintendo_of_south_africa_website_launches_8752.html]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.za/News/2009/The-new-Nintendo-of-South-Africa-website-launches-260986.html |title=The new Nintendo of South Africa website launches &amp;#124; 2009 &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100209/http://www.nintendo.co.za/News/2009/The-new-Nintendo-of-South-Africa-website-launches-260986.html |archivedate=2017-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
Club Nintendo was also the name given to a customer service program operating in Spain in the 1990s. Players buying a console, a video game or an accessory were able to fill a form and send it to Nintendo's headquarters in the country by mail. After doing it, the player would receive a Club Nintendo plastic card with their name, an associate number, the image of Mario and Nintendo's logo. The main purpose of this was to receive telephone support about clues and tricks on how to progress through the games and being able to receive the Club Nintendo magazine for free during a year.&lt;ref name="silius1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="photobucket1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c24/PEKEPRINCE/carnetclubnintendo2.jpg |format=JPG |title=Photographic image |website=124.photobucket.com |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113232222/http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c24/PEKEPRINCE/carnetclubnintendo2.jpg |archivedate=2016-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="photobucket1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pictures2.todocoleccion.net/tc/2012/05/23/P3310162.JPG |format=JPG |title=Photographic image |website=Pictures2.todocoleccion.net |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214054116/http://pictures2.todocoleccion.net/tc/2012/05/23/P3310162.JPG |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some criticism came from the fact that the Nintendo of Europe Stars Catalogue was only available to members in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and later [[Portugal]] and [[Russia]]. [[Bergsala]], which was responsible for all Nintendo-related distribution in [[Scandinavia]], closed down Club Nintendo in the region at the end of the year 2006 because it was not economically viable to keep it going.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.se/arkivet/faq/club-nintendo |title=Club Nintendo - finns det i Sverige? - Nintendo i Sverige |language=sv |publisher=Nintendo.se |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610202046/http://www.nintendo.se/arkivet/faq/club-nintendo |archivedate=2015-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, the American Club Nintendo came under fire for offering only digital games for its Platinum and Gold members, who need to spend lots of money to get to that position and were offered games they had already purchased. During the same timeframe, news sites repeatedly pointed out that Nintendo of America's offerings were much smaller than that of Europe and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/07/16/club-nintendo-2014-gold-platinum-rewards/|title=Nintendo of America Unveils 2014 Club Nintendo Rewards, and They’re Not Good|website=Technobuffalo.com|accessdate=2017-04-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427103702/https://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/07/16/club-nintendo-2014-gold-platinum-rewards/|archivedate=2017-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Downloads were only available on the European (UK) Club Nintendo from the middle of March 2015 compared to the American Club Nintendo that had them for two additional months.

==Discontinuation==
On January 20, 2015, Nintendo announced that it would be discontinuing Club Nintendo in all regions during the year, and succeeding it with a new loyalty program that the company has named [[My Nintendo]]. Prior to this announcement, in September 2014 the company had major changes done to the Japanese edition of Club Nintendo, including abolishing member rank and making hardware ineligible for registration, including then-upcoming [[New Nintendo 3DS]].&lt;ref name="Vooks-cites-JPN-CN"&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Vuckovic |url=http://www.vooks.net/nintendo-making-huge-changes-to-club-nintendo-in-japan/ |title=Nintendo making huge changes to Club Nintendo in Japan |publisher=Vooks.net |date=2014-09-25 |accessdate=2015-02-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208114621/http://www.vooks.net/nintendo-making-huge-changes-to-club-nintendo-in-japan/ |archivedate=2015-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later partially reflected on the Australian Club Nintendo, as members could not register the New Nintendo 3DS either, which was available in the region since November 2014.&lt;ref name="Vooks-cites-AUS-CN"&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Vuckovic |url=http://www.vooks.net/no-club-nintendo-points-coming-with-new-3ds-and-new-3ds-xl-in-australia/ |title=No Club Nintendo points coming with New 3DS and New 3DS XL in Australia |publisher=Vooks.net |date=2014-11-07 |accessdate=2015-02-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120182248/http://www.vooks.net/no-club-nintendo-points-coming-with-new-3ds-and-new-3ds-xl-in-australia/ |archivedate=2015-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2014, the North American Club Nintendo was experiencing a great lack of physical rewards compared to other regions.

In North America on February 2, 2015, Nintendo released a final batch of games with 117 titles (118 with the Club Nintendo exclusive title ''Grill-Off with Ultra Hand!'', which was previously available). Among the final batch of games was also ''Doc Louis's Punch-Out!!'', another previous Club Nintendo exclusive title. On January 20, 2015, products released after the date were not eligible for registration with Club Nintendo. The final day to earn Coins, register products with Club Nintendo, or sign up for new Club Nintendo membership was on March 31, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Club Nintendo Program Notice|url=http://club2.nintendo.com/program-notice/|accessdate=3 February 2015|date=January 20, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501202603/http://club2.nintendo.com/program-notice/|archivedate=1 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the final day was on October 1, 2015.

==Replacement==
{{Main article|My Nintendo}}

{{nihongo|'''[[My Nintendo]]'''|マイニンテンドー|Mai Nintendō}} is a [[Loyalty program]] provided by [[Nintendo]], and the successor to Club Nintendo. The system rewards allows players to earn points from using software or purchasing games, which can then be spent on rewards such as digital games or discounts. The program launched on March 17, 2016 in Japan and March 31, 2016 in the rest of the world, launching alongside Nintendo's first mobile app, ''[[Miitomo]]''.

On November 16, 2017, it is reported that Comcast attempted to purchase [[21st Century Fox]], following the news 10 days earlier that [[The Walt Disney Company]] negotiated with Fox to acquire the same assets. Like Disney, the deal included 20th Century Fox, cable entertainment and broadcast satellite networks including [[FX (TV channel)|FX Networks]], [[National Geographic Partners]], [[Fox Sports Networks]], and international channels such as [[Star India]] and [[Sky plc]]. It would not include the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], [[Fox Television Stations]], [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and [[Fox News]] units, all which will be spun-off into a new independent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/comcast-21st-century-fox-acquisition-talks-report-1202210244/|title=Comcast-Fox Deal Talks Latest Entry Into Media Merger Mania|last1=C.

On February 5, 2018, a new report by [[CNBC]] claims that despite the Disney/Fox deal, Comcast is considering topping Disney's $52.4 billion offer once the [[AT&amp;T]]–[[Time Warner]] merger goes through, after the Department of Justice Antitrust Division sued to block the merger on November 20, 2017.

On May 7, 2018, Comcast announced a potential bid against Disney's effort to acquire Fox after it spoke to investment banks about making a $60 billion cash offer, pending on approval of the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/4-reasons-comcast-covets-fox/|title=4 reasons Comcast covets Fox|last=Gibson|first=Kate|work=CBS|date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, several Fox investors expressed interests in inking a deal with Comcast due to their all-cash offer as opposed to Disney's $52.4 billion stock offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/15/comcasts-all-cash-bid-could-pit-murdoch-against-fox-shareholders.html|title=Comcast's all-cash bid could pit Murdoch against Fox shareholders|work=CNBC|date=May 15, 2018|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, Comcast officially announced a $65 billion counter-offer to acquire the 21st Century Fox's assets that Disney offered to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17457244/comcast-21st-century-fox-film-tv-studios-acquisition-deal-announced|title=Comcast makes $65 billion offer to steal 21st Century Fox away from Disney|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on June 20, 2018, Disney and Fox announced that they had amended their previous merger agreement, upping Disney’s offer to $71.3 billion (a 10% premium over Comcast's $65 billion offer), while also offering shareholders the option of receiving cash instead of stock.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-20/fox-agrees-to-sweetened-bid-from-disney-dealing-blow-to-comcast|title=Disney Sweetens Offer for Fox to $71 Billion, Outbidding Comcast|website=Bloomberg|last=Turner|first=Nick|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, the [[United States Department of Justice]] gave antitrust approval to Disney under the condition of selling Fox's 22 regional sports channels, to which the company has agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/us-set-to-give-antitrust-approval-for-disney-fox-deal.html|title=Disney wins US antitrust approval to buy Fox assets|work=CNBC|date=June 27, 2018|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day, Disney and Fox shareholders scheduled July 27, 2018 as the day to vote on Fox's properties being sold to Disney, giving Comcast enough time to make a higher counter-offer for the assets of Sky.&lt;ref name="Vote-07-27-Variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/disney-fox-shareholder-voting-date-1202861184/|title=Disney, Fox Set Shareholder Voting Date for $71 Billion Deal|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 28, 2018|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vote-07-27-LATimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-disney-fox-shareholders-vote-20180628-story.html|title=Disney and Fox schedule July 27 shareholder votes on merger — upping pressure on Comcast|last=James|first=Meg|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 28, 2018|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on July 12, 2018, the Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal with the D.C. Circuit to reverse the District Court's approval for AT&amp;T acquisition of Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]). Although analysts say that the chances of the DOJ win are small, they say it is the "final nail in the coffin for Comcast's Fox chase.

====Acquisition of Sky====
{{main|Sky plc#Takeover by Comcast}}
On February 27, 2018, Comcast offered to purchase 61% stake in Sky plc at a value of £12.50 per-share, approximately £22.1 billion. 21st Century Fox, which owns 39% stake in Sky, had previously declined a US$60 billion acquisition offer by Comcast in favour of its deal with Disney, due to anti-competition concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43209100|title=Murdoch bid for Sky challenged by US giant|date=27 February 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/comcast-mulls-renewed-21st-century-fox-pursuit-1202285921/|title=Comcast Mulls Renewing Its 21st Century Fox Assets Pursuit – Report|last=Haring|first=Bruce|date=12 February 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/comcast-fox-bid-disney-merger-1202694858/|title=Comcast May Make Another Bid for 21st Century Fox (Report)|date=12 February 2018|work=Variety|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBCUniversal CEO [[Steve Burke (businessman)|Steve Burke]] stated that purchasing Sky would roughly double its presence in English-speaking markets, and allow for synergies between the respective networks and studios of NBCUniversal and Sky.

On April 12, the [[Panel on Takeovers and Mergers]] ruled that Disney had to acquire all of Sky within 28 days of fully acquiring Fox if the latter's acquisition of Sky is not completed by the time the merger is done, or if Comcast's counter-offer isn't accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/disney-will-be-forced-to-acquire-all-of-sky-if-foxs-takeover-of-uk-pay-net-is-not-complete-before-mega-deal-1202362838|title=Disney Will Be Forced To Acquire All Of Sky If Fox’s Takeover Of UK Pay Net Is Not Complete Before Mega-Deal|last=White|first=Peter|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=April 12, 2018|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 25, 2018, Comcast made its formal counter-bid for Sky plc, offering £12.50 per-share; Sky subsequently withdrew its recommendation of the Fox bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43891132|title=Comcast starts £22bn bidding war for Sky|last=Wilson|first=Bill|date=25 April 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=25 April 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 2018, [[Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Matt Hancock]] cleared both 21st Century Fox and Comcast's respective offers to acquire Sky plc.

In 2004 and 2007, the [[American Customer Satisfaction Index]] (ACSI) survey found that Comcast had the worst customer satisfaction rating of any company or government agency in the country, including the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. The ACSI indicates that almost half of all cable customers (regardless of company) have registered complaints, and that cable is the only industry to score below 60 in the ACSI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=90 The American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''First Quarter, 2004''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312061951/http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=90 |date=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast's Customer Service Rating by the ACSI surveys indicate that the company's customer service has not improved since the surveys began in 2001. Analysis of the surveys states that "Comcast is one of the lowest scoring companies in ACSI. As its customer satisfaction eroded by 7% over the past year, revenue increased by 12%." The ACSI analysis also addresses this contradiction, stating that "Such [[pricing power]] usually comes with some level of monopoly protection and most cable companies have little competition at the local level. This also means that a cable company can do well financially even though its customers are not particularly satisfied."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=169&amp;Itemid=168 American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''First Quarter, 2007''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827175226/http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=169&amp;Itemid=168 |date=August 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=157&amp;c=Comcast+Corporation&amp;i=Cable+%26+Satellite+TV American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''Scores By Company: Comcast Corporation'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116182816/http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=157&amp;c=Comcast+Corporation&amp;i=Cable+&amp;+Satellite+TV |date=November 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comcast was given an "F" for its corporate governance practices in 2010, by [[Corporate Library]], an independent shareholder-research organization. According to Corporate Library, Comcast's board of directors ability to oversee and control management was severely compromised (at least in 2010) by the fact that several of the directors either worked for the company or had business ties to it (making them susceptible to management pressure), and a third of the directors were over 70 years of age. According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' nearly two-thirds of the flights of Comcast's $40 million corporate jet purchased for business travel related to the NBCU acquisition, were to CEO Brian Roberts' private homes or to resorts.&lt;ref name=Maremont&gt;{{cite news

In February 2017, Comcast was ordered by the self-regulatory [[Advertising Self-Regulatory Council|National Advertising Review Board]] to cease using a claim based on [[Speedtest.net]] data that it has "America's fastest internet", stating that "Ookla’s data showed only that Xfinity consumers who took advantage of the free tests offered on the Speedtest.net website subscribed to tiers of service with higher download speeds than Verizon FiOS consumers who took advantage of the tests." They were also ordered to stop using a claim that the company offers the "fastest in-home Wi-Fi", which was poorly substantiated.&lt;ref name="ars-fastestnot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Not so fast—Comcast told to stop claiming it has "fastest Internet"|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/comcast-should-stop-claiming-it-has-fastest-internet-ad-board-rules/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyber Monday''' is a marketing term for the Monday after the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] holiday in the [[United States]]. It was created by retailers to encourage people to [[online shopping|shop online]]. The term was coined by [[Ellen Davis (businesswoman)|Ellen Davis]] and Scott Silverman, and made its debut on November 28, 2005 in a [[Shop.org]] press release entitled "'Cyber Monday' Quickly Becoming One of the Biggest Online Shopping Days of the Year".&lt;ref name = "Cyber Monday"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyber-monday-quickly-becoming-one-of-the-biggest-online-shopping-days-of-the-year-55695037.html |title='Cyber Monday' Quickly Becoming One of the Biggest Online Shopping Days of the Year | work= Shop.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the Monday after Thanksgiving, and most of the time falls in November, but if Thanksgiving is on November 27 or 28, it will fall in December. The date range is November 26 to December 2, and is always four days after the holiday.

According to the Shop.org/[[Bizrate]] Research 2005 eHoliday Mood Study, "77 percent of online retailers said that their sales increased substantially on the Monday after Thanksgiving, a trend that is driving serious online discounts and promotions on Cyber Monday this year (2005)".

In 2017, Cyber Monday online sales grew to a record $6.59 billion, compared with $2.98 billion in 2015, and $2.65 billion in 2014. However, the average order value was $128, down slightly from 2014's $160.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundivo.com/stats/cyber-monday-statistics/|title=Cyber Monday Statistics and Trends|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber Monday has become the online equivalent to [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] and offers a way for smaller retail websites to compete with larger chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swider|first=Matt|title=Cyber Monday 2017|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/cyber-monday-2017-the-best-deals|work=TechRadar|accessdate=November 23, 2017|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, it has become an international marketing term used by online retailers across the world.

==Origin of term==
The term "Cyber Monday" was coined by [[Ellen Davis (businesswoman)|Ellen Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tschorn|first1=Adam|title=Cyber Monday? Not so much|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/18/image/ig-online18|accessdate=May 20, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutter|first1=John D.|title=Why 'Cyber Monday' is mostly myth|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/11/29/cyber.monday.hoax/|accessdate=May 20, 2015|date=November 29, 2010|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used within the [[Electronic commerce|ecommerce]] community during the 2005 holiday season. According to Scott Silverman, the head of Shop.org, the term was coined based on 2004 research showing "one of the biggest online shopping days of the year" was the Monday after Thanksgiving (12th-biggest day historically).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Retailers also noted the biggest period was December 5 through 15 of the previous year. In late November 2005, ''The New York Times'' reported: "The name Cyber Monday grew out of the observation that millions of otherwise productive working Americans, fresh off a Thanksgiving weekend of window shopping, were returning to high-speed Internet connections at work Monday and buying what they liked."&lt;ref name="Online sales"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/technology/30iht-cyber.html?scp=12&amp;sq=cyber%20Thursday&amp;st=cse |title=Online sales take off on 'Cyber Monday' |date=November 11, 2005 |work=The New York Times |author= Michael Barbaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, a lot of people had slow Internet at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro.com/business/local_business/cyber-monday-overtakes-black-friday-as-top-shopping-day/article_8a47c851-53c8-5a68-879e-313b3d7b22d6.html|title=Cyber Monday overtakes Black Friday as top shopping day|last=Barron|first=Richard M.|work=[[News and Record]]|date=November 23, 2017|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online spending===
In 2006, comScore reported that online spending on Cyber Monday jumped 25% to $608 million,&lt;ref name="Spending Beats Forecast"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2006/11/Cyber_Monday_E-Commerce_Beats_Forecast | date = November 2006 | title=Cyber Monday E-Commerce Spending Beats Forecast; Climbs 25 Percent Versus Last Year to $608 Million |work= comScore}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21% to $733 million in 2007,&lt;ref name = "Strong Week"&gt;{{cite news | date = December 2007 | url = http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2007/12/Cyber_Monday_Holiday_E-Commerce |title=Cyber Monday Spending Propels Holiday E-Commerce to Strong Week of More than $4 Billion in Sales | work = comScore}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 15% to $846 million in 2008.&lt;ref name = "Spending Jumps"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2008/12/Cyber_Monday_Sales_Reach_846_Million | title = E-Commerce Spending Jumps 15 Percent on Cyber Monday to $846 Million, the Second Heaviest Online Spending Day on Record | date = December 2008 |work=comScore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, comScore reported that online spending increased 5 percent on Cyber Monday to $887 million and that more than half of dollars spent online at US Web sites originated from work computers (52.7 percent), representing a gain of 2.3 percentage points from last year.&lt;ref name= "Heaviest Online Spending"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2009/12/Cyber_Monday_Online_Sales_Up_5_Percent_vs._Year_Ago_to_887_Million_to_Match_Heaviest_Online_Spending_Day_in_History | title = Cyber Monday Online Sales Up 5 Percent vs. Year Ago to $887 Million to Match Heaviest Online Spending Day in History | date = December 2009 | work = comScore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buying from home comprised the majority of the remaining share (41.6 percent) while buying from international locations accounted for 5.8 percent.  According to comScore chairman Gian Fulgoni, "comScore data have shown that Cyber Monday online sales have always been driven by considerable buying activity from work locations. That pattern hasn't changed. After returning from the long Thanksgiving weekend with a lot of holiday shopping still ahead of them, many consumers tend to continue their holiday shopping from work.  Whether to take advantage of the extensive Cyber Monday deals offered by retailers or to buy gifts away from the prying eyes of family members, this day has become an annual ritual for America's online holiday shoppers."&lt;ref name="Heaviest Online Spending"/&gt;

In 2010, comScore reported the first-ever $1 billion online shopping day ($1028M), an increase of 16 percent over 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-us-holiday-shopping,0,5612342.story| title= Cyber Monday biggest spending day online ever, firm says sales top $1 billion|last=Anderson|first=Mae|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, comScore reported that Cyber Week saw US consumers spend over $6 billion online from November 28 to December 2.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news |title='Cyber Week' Results in Record Online Spending of $6 Billion |work=WBNG |date=December 6, 2011 |url=http://www.wbng.com/news/state/135055538.html/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212232748/http://www.wbng.com/news/state/135055538.html |archivedate=December 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, comScore reported that Cyber Monday saw a 17% increase in sales from 2011, totaling $1.465 billion.&lt;ref name= "2012 Prediction Results"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://bestcyberweek.com/articles/prediction-results-2012 | title = Cyber Monday Prediction Results for 2012 | date = August 2013 | work = BestCyberWeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Cyber Monday sales continued their growth and recorded their highest grossing day ever at $2.29 billion.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 2014, the average planned expenditure is $361 per person. 46 percent people expect to pay with credit cards and 43 percent expect to pay with debit cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.ibtimes.com/black-friday-2014-why-most-americans-wont-shop-black-friday-or-cyber-monday-1725906| title= Black Friday 2014: Why Most Americans Won’t Shop On Black Friday Or Cyber Monday|last= Menton |first=Jessica|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales are up 8.1% as of 6 p.m. ET, according to IBM Digital Analytics.

In 2016, according to Adobe Digital Insights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmo.com/adobe-digital-insights/articles/2016/11/8/2016-holiday-shopping-up-to-the-minute-data-from-adi.html|title=2016 Holiday Shopping: Up-To-The-Minute Data From ADI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber Monday hit a new record with $3.45 billion, and which was the first time that online sales in one single day surpassed $3 billion in US history.

===Employers and online shopping===
U.S. employers have been cracking down on employees using company equipment and company time for non-work-related purposes, including Cyber Monday. As of November 2011, 22% of employers had fired an employee for using the Internet for non-work related activity; 7% of human resource managers surveyed had fired an employee for holiday shopping; and 54% of employers were blocking employees from accessing certain websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2011/11/22/shopping-on-the-clock-cyber-monday-in-the-workplace-infographi/ | title = Shopping On The Clock: Cyber Monday In The Workplace |work= aol.com |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cybermondaysniper.com/safety/ | title = Staying Safe Online On Cyber Monday | work = www.cybermondaysniper.com/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140913055413/http://www.cybermondaysniper.com/safety/ | archivedate = 2014-09-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CareerBuilder's annual Cyber Monday survey, more than half of workers (53%) say they spend at least some work time holiday shopping on the Internet, up 3% from 2015. Of this group, 43% spend an hour or more doing so, compared to 42% from 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=11/22/2016&amp;id=pr978&amp;ed=12/31/2016|title=53% of Employees Are Using Time at Work to Shop Online, Increase From Last Year, Finds Annual CareerBuilder Survey - CareerBuilder|website=www.careerbuilder.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

===Americas===

====Argentina====
According to Argentine press, Cyber Monday was celebrated on November 11, 2014, and marked a tenfold growth in users taking advantage of online sales over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/cyber_monday-descuentos_online-turismo-tecnologia-consumo_0_1246675383.html|title=Cyber Monday: creció 10 veces la cantidad de compradores |last1= |first1= |date=November 11, 2014 |website=Clarín.com |language=Spanish |accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
Cyber Monday came to Canada in 2008.&lt;ref name="Star"/&gt; The ''[[National Post]]'' featured an article, in the November 25, 2010, edition, stating that the parity of the [[Canadian dollar]] with the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] caused many Canadian retailers to have [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] and Cyber Monday sales of their own. According to the article, an estimated 80% of Canadians were expected to participate in Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.&lt;ref name="arts.nationalpost.com"&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = National Post | title = Retail therapy: Canadians prep for black Friday, cyber Thursday | date = November 25, 2010 | url = http://arts.nationalpost.com/2010/11/25/retail-therapy-canadians-prep-for-black-friday-cyber-Thursday/ | series = Arts | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation has been made that with all major US television broadcasters—which are typically available to Canadians—emphasizing Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales for stores that are also doing business in Canada, Canadian retailers needed to mimic sales offerings in order to keep Canadian dollars from being spent in the US.&lt;ref name="arts.nationalpost.com"/&gt;

By 2011, around 80% of online retailers in Canada were participating in Cyber Monday.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/specialsections/blackfriday/article/1291394--canadian-retailers-fight-back-against-black-friday-deals Canadian retailers fight back against Black Friday deals], Toronto Start 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Deus Ex: Human Revolution''''' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Eidos Montréal]] and published worldwide by [[Square Enix]] in August 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]: a version for [[OS X]] released the following year. It is the third game in the ''[[Deus Ex]]'' series, and a prequel to the original ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]''. The gameplay—combining [[first-person shooter]], [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements—features exploration and combat in environments connected to multiple city-based hubs, in addition to quests that grant experience and allow customization of the main character's abilities with items called Praxis Kits. Conversations between characters feature a variety of responses, with options in conversations and at crucial story points affecting how some events play out.

Set in the year 2027, ''Human Revolution'' focuses on ex-SWAT officer Adam Jensen, who is employed as security officer for Sarif Industries, a company on the leading edge of advanced and controversial [[artificial organ]]s dubbed "augmentations". An attack on Sarif Industries that apparently kills researcher and Adam's ex-girlfriend Megan Reed also leaves Adam critically injured. To save him, company CEO David Sarif subjects him to an extensive augmentation procedure: six months later, now recovered and possessing advanced augmentations, Adam sets out to pursue his attackers and the shadowy organization behind them. The story explores themes of [[transhumanism]], the growing power of [[megacorporation]]s, and their impact on [[social class]]. It also uses the series' recurring [[cyberpunk]] setting and [[conspiracy theory]] motif.

Development of ''Human Revolution'' began in 2007 with a small team within the fledgling Eidos Montréal studio, after multiple aborted attempts to create a sequel at original developer [[Ion Storm]] following the 2003 release of ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]''. The two key influences were the myth of [[Icarus]], a thematic element carried over from ''Deus Ex''; and the artwork and ideas of the [[Renaissance]], which influenced the story, graphics and music while combining with the series' typical cyberpunk elements. The open-ended nature of the gameplay was tricky for the team to achieve; as a result, the boss battles were outsourced to another developer due to time constraints. The music, composed by [[Michael McCann (composer)|Michael McCann]], focused on ambiance and three-layered compositions over character themes and overt melodies.

''Human Revolution'' was first announced in 2007, soon after beginning development. Its official title and release window were announced in 2010. After release, a downloadable episode titled ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution – The Missing Link|The Missing Link]]'' was developed, featuring improvements on the original gameplay. A [[director's cut]], featuring further improvements and post-release and promotional content, was released in 2013 for the original platforms and [[Wii U]]. ''Human Revolution'' received critical acclaim, with praise going to its player-driven plot, general gameplay, and freedom of choice in both story and character customization. The major criticisms went to its boss fights and recurring technical problems. The director's cut received additional praise for its revamped gameplay elements. ''Human Revolution'' spawned a spin-off titled ''[[Deus Ex: The Fall]]'', and the direct sequel ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Deus Ex Human Revolution screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A street corner in Lower Hengsha, one of the game's hub levels. Shown are the HUD with available hotkey options, Adam's health and currently equipped weapon and ammunition level.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;]]
''Deus Ex: Human Revolution'' is an [[action role-playing game]] with incorporated [[first-person shooter]] and [[Stealth game|stealth]] mechanics. Players take the role of Adam Jensen, a man equipped with mechanical cybernetic implants called augmentations.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UPpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; The game's environments, ranging from open world hubs to more scripted environments, are explored in [[First-person (video games)|first-person]], although actions such as hiding behind cover, conversing with [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs), and some attack animations switch to a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person view]]. In these environments, players can find NPCs that will advance both the main story quest and optional side quests: completing quests, along with other actions such as combat with enemies, rewards Adam with [[experience point]]s, which raise his experience level. Also accessible are black market vendors which supply equipment and weapons for Credits, the in-game currency.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Interactive objects within environments can be highlighted, although these options are either turned off on the hardest difficulty or can be turned off in the options menu by the player.&lt;ref name="DEHhighlight"/&gt;

There are a variety of ways to approach the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam can take a stealthy approach, avoiding guards and security devices, again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between cover elements and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, in addition to an assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and raising an alarm.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UPpreview"/&gt; A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam to fall from great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;

At multiple points within the game, Adam partakes in conversations with NPCs related to main and side quests. When talking, Adam is presented with three different conversation options that affect the outcome of conversations: choosing the right option can help with completing objectives while choosing the wrong option closes off that route and forces the player to find an alternate solution. A "Social" augmentation enables better reading of an NPC's expression and judging their psychological profile, improving chances of selecting the right dialogue option.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UPpreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; While in the game's environments, Adam finds terminals and computers that can be accessed either with a password or through hacking. When hacking, the hacking screen is summoned, which shows the pathway through a device's security system to access the information: the pathway is accessed by opening "directory" nodes to reach the registry. Different nodes have different ratings, affecting how easily they can be accessed. Various devices have different grades of difficulty, which in turn dictate how many times hacking may be attempted. Each hacking attempt activates a Diagnostic Sub-Routine which works to stop the hack, activating a time limit once it is alerted. Adam can use additional skills and items to lengthen the time, such as software to stop or instantly capture nodes or fortify captured nodes to increase the time limit.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt; Successful hacks yield experience points, Credits, and sometimes additional items.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Deus Ex Timeline}}

===Setting===
''Human Revolution'' takes place in the year 2027, 25 years prior to the original ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]''. The ''Deus Ex'' series is set in a [[cyberpunk]] future rife with secret organizations and conspiracies: among these forces is the [[Illuminati in popular culture|Illuminati]].&lt;ref name="SilStoryElements"/&gt; Leading up to ''Human Revolution'', there have been marked improvements in human society, with people actively combating [[global warming]], finding cures for a large variety of diseases, and improving [[Sustainable energy|green energy]]. Alongside this, global [[megacorporation]]s have come to eclipse government authority in power and influence, while [[Mercenary|private military]] forces dwarf the sanctioned armies of [[First World]] countries. Advances in [[biotechnology]] and [[cybernetics]] have led to the development of "augmentations", advanced [[artificial organ]]s capable of greatly improving and [[Human enhancement|enhancing]] the human body's performance. The development of augmentation technology has triggered the creation of a new social divide: those with augmentations become the world's new upper class citizenry and are touted as the future of humanity, while normal humans form the majority of the lower-class population.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHEventureDM"/&gt; Augmentations also come with the necessity of taking Neuropozyne, a limited and expensive [[immunosuppressive drug]] that stops the body rejecting the technology.&lt;ref name="PolyStory"/&gt; By the events of ''Human Revolution'', society is being divided between "augs", humans who have accepted augmentation technology; and normal humans who are either morally opposed to it, too poor to afford it, or whose bodies actively reject it. The tensions between the two factions begin generating open conflict.&lt;ref name="DEHmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHEventureDM"/&gt;

===Characters===
The main protagonist is Adam Jensen: coming from a humble background in [[Detroit]], he worked as a leader with the local [[SWAT]] squad until he refuses to follow a questionable order and is turfed out. After this, he is taken on as a security manager at Sarif Industries, a local company at the leading edge of augmentation technology. A fellow at the company is Megan Reed, a researcher for Sarif and Adam's ex-girlfriend. His employer is company CEO David Sarif, who is instrumental in saving Adam after he was left near-dead at the beginning of the game.&lt;ref name="SilStoryElements"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyStory"/&gt; Adam meets many key characters during his missions between [[Detroit]], [[Montreal]] and the new [[Shanghai]] metropolis of [[Hengsha Island|Hengsha]]. These include Sarif's chief pilot Faridah Malik; Sarif systems engineer Frank Pritchard; Eliza Cassan, a media personality and public face of Picus Communications; William Taggart, founder of the anti-augmentation group Humanity Front; Hugh Darrow, who founded augmentation technology but is one of those genetically incapable of using them; Zhao Yun Ru, CEO of the Tai Yong Medical megacorporation; and the "Tyrants" mercenary squad, composed of leader Jaron Namir and his associates Lawrence Barrett and Yelena Fedorova.&lt;ref name="PolyStory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHignCharacters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHcharacters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeLocations"/&gt;

===Plot===
''Note: While the general plot of Human Revolution follows a distinct path, many elements are subject to the player's decisions. The game also offers several subplots which the player may or may not encounter, depending on their actions within the game. This synopsis concentrates on the main, unavoidable plot thread of the game.''

On the eve of unveiling a new type of augmentation that will end dependence on Neuropozyne, Sarif Industries is attacked by a group of heavily augmented terrorists known as the Tyrants, who slaughter the staff. Megan Reed and a number of other scientists are presumed dead in the attack. Adam Jensen is grievously wounded in the attack.  David Sarif saves Jensen's life by giving him advanced augmentations that turn him in a half-machine super-soldier. Curiously, Jensen's body does not attempt to reject the implants, and therefore he does not need to take Neuropozyne.

Months later, Adam is summoned to deal with another terrorist attack on Sarif Industries, this time by a group of anti-augmentation radicals. Curiously, one of the terrorists is augmented, and Jensen finds him trying to steal weapon blueprints from a computer. The augmented terrorist shoots himself in the head before Jensen can capture him. Frank Pritchard later discovers that the augmented terrorist was being controlled remotely by some unknown hacker. Pritchard tracks the hacking signal to an abandoned factory in Highland Park. Adam discovers the Tyrants guarding a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] detention camp, but they are moving out after the failure of the Sarif raid. Adam confronts and defeats one of the mercenaries, Barrett, who tells him to go to the newly built [[Hengsha Island|Hengsha]] [[megacity]] in [[China]] before killing himself with a grenade.

Together with pilot Faridah Malik, Adam travels to Hengsha and tracks down the hacker, Arie van Bruggen, who is being both hunted by [[private military company|private security company]] Belltower Associates and hidden by local triad leader Tong Si Hung. Van Bruggen directs Adam to find evidence inside Tai Yong Medical, the world's largest augmentation technology manufacturer and Sarif's main rival. Infiltrating Tai Yong, Adam finds footage of a call between Namir and Zhao Yun Ru, which confirms that Megan and the other missing scientists are alive and that Eliza Cassan is somehow involved. Confronting Zhao in her penthouse apartment, he learns that she is allied to a powerful organization that controls global interests before she triggers security and forces him to leave. Traveling to the Picus corporate building in Montreal, Jensen tracks down Eliza, revealed to be an [[artificial intelligence]] construct designed to influence the media. Despite her programming, she has begun to question her role and offers to help Adam. After he defeats Tyrant member Fedorova, Eliza gives him footage directing him to Doctor Isaias Sandoval, aide to William Taggart.

Back in Detroit, Sarif admits to Adam that the Illuminati are behind the attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his involvement in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a biochip replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one of the scientists, taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by Belltower. The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages to stow away in a stasis pod in the wake of a staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret [[Singapore]] base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the biochip malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new biochip to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research into augmentation rejection. She confesses that her cure for augmentation rejection was based on Jensen's DNA.

Moments later, Darrow appears live on television and broadcasts a modified signal that throws any augmented person with the new biochip into a fear-driven, murderous frenzy. Jensen evacuates the scientists, and commandeers an orbital flight module to reach Panchaea. He confronts Darrow, who reveals that he wants humanity to abandon the augmentation technology he invented, because he believes it will destroy human identity. Adam sets out to disable Panchaea's Hyron Project supercomputer and end the broadcast; on the way, he encounters Taggart and Sarif, who each urge him to side with them and further their own agendas. At the heart of Panchaea, Jensen first confronts Zhao Yun Ru when she tries to hijack the signal for her own use; then Eliza, who offers Jensen four choices. Jensen can either broadcast the full truth and distance humanity from augmentations; rig the broadcast so it throws suspicion on the Humanity Front and allows further development of augmentation technology; send out a report blaming the incident on contaminated Neuropozyne so Taggart's group and by extension the Illuminati find new support; or destroy Panchea, leaving no-one to "spin the story". Depending on the choice and whether Jensen has taken a pacifist or violent approach through the game, his final narration varies.

In a post-credits scene, Megan meets with Bob Page, the main antagonist of ''Deus Ex'', to discuss her employment in "the nanite virus chimera" and "D project": prior to this, Page instructs his cohort Morgan Everett to search the Hyron Project for salvageable technology for the 'Morpheus Initiative': these are the precursors to the creation of the Denton clones, the manufactured nanotechnological "Gray Death" virus and the "Helios" artificial intelligence, key parts of the plot of ''Deus Ex''.&lt;ref name="GSstorysofar"/&gt;

==Development==
The original ''Deus Ex'' and its sequel ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War|Invisible War]]'' were developed by [[Ion Storm]], with varying involvement of series creator and studio co-founder [[Warren Spector]] and designer [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]]. After the release of ''Invisible War'', multiple attempts were made to develop a sequel, even after Spector left Ion Storm. The two main projects were dubbed ''Deus Ex: Insurrection'', which used the same engine as ''Invisible War'' while moving away from its divisive mechanics; and ''Deus Ex 3'', which aimed to be an open world game with a branching narrative. An aborted attempt, intended as the fourth ''Deus Ex'' project following ''Insurrection'', led to the development of ''[[Project Snowblind]]''. Prospective development on the third ''Deus Ex'' game was halted when, following further staff departure and financial difficulties, the studio's owner [[Eidos Interactive]] closed them down in 2005.&lt;ref name="EuroSequels"/&gt;

Concept development on ''Human Revolution'' began in early 2007, shortly after the founding of [[Eidos Montréal]].&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DE3announced"/&gt; The team at this point was fairly small, consisting of producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, senior designer François Lapikas, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête. The early period was devoted to research before performing brainstorming sessions to create the game's basic concepts. One of the concepts established early on was that it would be an ambitious project and they needed to bring the key staff on board as early as possible.&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt; They started with playing the first two games, determining what they liked and disliked about the original ''Deus Ex'', and how they could carry over or improve these points.&lt;ref name="GDC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHgamer"/&gt; An early decision was to remain true to the series' core values, despite ''Human Revolution'' being essentially a series reboot.&lt;ref name="GamaDEHinterview"/&gt; When presenting their project to Eidos management, they presented multiple sheets of their concept, and after two days the game was [[Green-light|green-lit]].&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt; The entire main staff were newcomers to the ''Deus Ex'' series, providing a large challenge to the development team as a whole.&lt;ref name="DEH-RPSinterview"/&gt; During the early design process, one of the things that worked well was the blueprint testing process and cutting items that would either not fit into the game or would make the project too large to handle.&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt; The most difficult period for the development team was the opening two-year period, which was described as a "vertical slice" through the game concepts, when they were trying to bring a piece of ''Human Revolution'' to retail quality before extending that out across the whole game.&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeInterview"/&gt;

''Human Revolution'' was planned for consoles and Microsoft Windows systems, and one of the things Dugas insisted upon was that the PC version would not be a port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be as close as possible in gameplay feel.&lt;ref name="DEH-RPSinterview"/&gt; The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department [[Visual Works]], and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works.&lt;ref name="EuroInterview2010"/&gt; Visual Works were involved with the project since 2009, following the acquisition of Eidos by [[Square Enix]].&lt;ref name="MankindVisual"/&gt; It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes.&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt; For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by [[Crystal Dynamics]] for use in their [[Tomb Raider: Underworld|upcoming next-generation ''Tomb Raider'']]. This was part of a technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form.&lt;ref name="DEHengine"/&gt; Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt;

===Game design===
Lapikas was responsible for multiple aspects of the game as lead designer, including the cover system, augmentations, conversations, hacking, combat and stealth AI, interactive objects, and general balancing. When creating the gameplay, the team settled on four pillar concepts: "Combat", "Stealth", "Hacking", and "Social".&lt;ref name="GDC"/&gt; While gameplay took place primarily in first-person, a feature that had been part of the ''Deus Ex'' series since its inception, during certain actions the camera switched to a third-person view. This was because the team wanted to create a connection between players and Adam despite the risk that it might break immersion.&lt;ref name="DEHspong"/&gt; Augmentations were designed to be customizable by players depending on playstyle, but unlike the previous two ''Deus Ex'' games, the use of mechanical augmentations and switches to third-person view enabled the player to see their changes affect Adam's appearance.&lt;ref name="EuroInterview2010"/&gt;

For combat, multiple references were used. These included ''[[Rainbow Six: Vegas]]'' for the cover system and tactical combat; ''[[F.E.A.R.]]'' for the design of AI; ''[[BioShock]]'' for the interlinking of weapon and obstacle types; the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series for the regenerating health system; and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' for multiple aspects including the inventory system, game economy and contextual actions.&lt;ref name="GDC"/&gt; Regenerating health ended up being divisive among the fanbase during the game's run-up to release, despite it being seen as a necessary inclusion in the modern gaming market.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt; Combat was intended to be easy-to-understand and visceral, with enemy types ranging from normal humans to augmented humans to robots, all mixed and matched for different combat situations. For stealth gameplay, the team used ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' as reference for the AI and alert systems, and ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay]]'' for the general organic feel of stealth. They had similar precepts to combat, wanting to make this style's rules and rewards clear to players.&lt;ref name="GDC"/&gt; Interactive hacking was one of the earliest things the team had decided upon, alongside not including [[quick time event]]s.&lt;ref name="IGNinterview"/&gt; The Hacking mechanics were inspired by the [[tabletop role-playing game]] ''[[Shadowrun]]''. They were designed to invoke tension, and require a survey of both the surroundings and the security system while at the same time providing rewards. Social interactions followed similar patterns, becoming an extension to the general gameplay, with a similar risk-reward system.&lt;ref name="GDC"/&gt;

The team had originally wanted to create the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by the boss fights in ''Metal Gear Solid''.&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GDC"/&gt; As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them in time for the game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, but that would have negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design.&lt;ref name="GDMhuman"/&gt; In the end, development of the boss battles was outsourced to Grip Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating the boss battles and incorporating them into the framework of ''Human Revolution''. For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style to bear on the project. They also attempted to balance the boss fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within ''Human Revolution'' so it would be accessible to all players.&lt;ref name="DEHbossOutsource"/&gt;

===Scenario===
The script of ''Human Revolution'' was written by Mary DeMarle, who was narrative director and main writer.&lt;ref name="DEHshackWriter"/&gt; While she did act as chief writer, DeMarle also worked on a number of other people throughout development so the story could be conveyed through environments and dialogue, along with handling how its progression was influenced by player choices.&lt;ref name="EuroIntervire2011"/&gt; Sheldon Pacotti, main writer for the first two ''Deus Ex'' titles, was brought in as story consultant during the early stages, and was also contacted regularly through production to ensure that the storyline fitted properly within the series chronology.&lt;ref name="DEHconsultant"/&gt; A total of four writers worked on the game, including author [[James Swallow]].&lt;ref name="IGNdance"/&gt; DeMarle was brought onto the project four months into its development, after it had been decided that it would be prequel to the first game, focusing on mechanical rather than nanotechnological enhancement technology. As part of her research, DeMarle looked up multiple subjects, from speculated [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] to the current level of biotechnology: the final story was influenced in large part by her reading of non-fiction and writings concerning [[transhumanism]].&lt;ref name="EuroIntervire2011"/&gt; DeMarle compared the game's study of transhumanism through main character Adam to that in the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', while also using the video game medium to put questions surrounding the ethics and motivations surrounding transhumanism in a nuanced way. She also stated that Adam being forced to confront these issues in person was the narrative's central irony, something that had previously been explored using different narrative elements in ''Deus Ex''.&lt;ref name="DHEventureDM"/&gt; The ending, which was ultimately decided using a choice of buttons, was chosen because of technical and time constraints while retaining player interaction.&lt;ref name="DEH-RPSinterview"/&gt; While the gameplay evolved continually through development and some elements required cutting, the story remained almost unchanged, instead being further refined and improved to work out plot holes.&lt;ref name="SilStoryComment"/&gt;

When creating the character of Adam Jensen, DeMarle wanted to give him a well-defined personality, and this necessitated balancing it with the narrative's player-driven nature.&lt;ref name="DEHshackWriter"/&gt; One of the biggest challenges was creating the various dialogue choices, as she needed to imagine what a character would say if they were hostile when she might normally portray them as benign. Multiple layers of dialogue were created within these variances to create different atmospheres within the narrative. There was standard dialogue with minor characters, more complex dialogue with major characters in quests, and what DeMarle termed "conversation boss fights", dialogue tied to the gameplay where social skill could help the player reach an objective.&lt;ref name="EuroIntervire2011"/&gt; When creating characters, the team drew inspiration from the character portrayals in the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series.&lt;ref name="DEH-RPSinterview"/&gt; When designing the corporate side, DeMarle particularly cited the backgrounds of [[Howard Hughes]], [[Richard Branson]] and [[Bill Gates]] as inspiration for the powerful CEO figures in the narrative of ''Human Revolution''.&lt;ref name="EuroIntervire2011"/&gt; She also noted the way in which corporations had gained greater power than governments in the narrative, something that paralleled political comments on corporate power at the time.&lt;ref name="DHEventureDM"/&gt;

The world of ''Human Revolution'' was designed to parallel the Greek myth of [[Icarus]]; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew too close to the sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes.&lt;ref name="EuroInterview2010"/&gt; The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. ''[[The Children of Men]]'' was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, ''Bioshock'' gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the ''[[X-Men]]'' franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels ''[[Deception Point]]'', ''[[The Firm (novel)|The Firm]]'', and [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' saga]] as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect]]'' franchises.&lt;ref name="GDC"/&gt; DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided [[social class]] system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in ''Deus Ex'', such as exploring a [[culture of fear]]; the workings of a [[surveillance state]]; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in ''Human Revolution''.&lt;ref name="DHEventureDM"/&gt; To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.&lt;ref name="DEHshackWriter"/&gt;

===Art design===
[[File:Deux Ex Human Revolution Hengsha concept art.jpg|thumb|right|Concept artwork of the city hub of Hengsha. While still carrying cyberpunk themes, the aesthetics and colors drew inspiration from [[Renaissance]]-era artwork.&lt;ref name="IGNdance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHconcept"/&gt;]]
Jonathan Jacques-Belletête acted as the game's art director, being in charge of creating its look.&lt;ref name="PCGart"/&gt; The two key visual themes were the Icarus myth and the artwork of the [[Renaissance]]: both were woven in on a narrative and visual level.&lt;ref name="EuroInterview2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHEvisuals"/&gt; In terms of colors, the team drew inspiration from notable Renaissance artists, including [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Rembrandt]]. The color scheme was dominated by black and gold: black represented the game's [[dystopia]]n aspects, while the gold both humanity and hope for the future.&lt;ref name="IGNdance"/&gt; The Renaissance styling originally permeated everything, but they were ending up with crates looking like [[baroque]] furniture, so they toned it down and blended it with modern and cyberpunk elements. During development, the team coined the term "cyber-renaissance" to define their blending of Renaissance styling, [[cyberpunk]] elements, and the Icarus myth.&lt;ref name="DHEvisuals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEXHdevelop"/&gt; An extensive amount of concept art was created for the game: while the majority was handled by artists Richard Dumont and Eric Gagnon, other contributors included Jim Murray, Brian Dugan, Theirry Doizon, Trong Nguyen and Sébastien Larroudé.&lt;ref name="DEHconcept"/&gt;

While cyberpunk remained a core part of the game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works that might have been classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like ''Blade Runner'', the team wanted to create something original within the genre.&lt;ref name="PCGart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEXHdevelop"/&gt; Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of ''Human Revolution'' in relation to the original ''Deus Ex'', which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original ''Deus Ex'' used technological elements common at the time it was made such as 4:3 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] monitors and landline telephones, ''Human Revolution'' used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while ''Deus Ex'' was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, ''Human Revolution'' focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.&lt;ref name="DEXHdevelop"/&gt;

Jacques-Belletête worked on character designs with Murray, whose previous work included artwork for the comic series ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''. Before designing character costumes, Jacques-Belletête looked extensively at modern fashion. As focusing purely on Renaissance styling would have resulted in clothing styles deemed "too allegoric" to work in the game, they redesigned them so they included Renaissance and cyberpunk elements while resembling clothing people would wear in the present day and not appearing cliched.&lt;ref name="DHEvisuals"/&gt; For Adam's character design, the team looked at multiple protagonist from cyberpunk fiction, from ''Blade Runner'' to the original ''Deus Ex''. Their main wishes were to incorporate sunglasses and a trench coat.&lt;ref name="EuroInterview2010"/&gt; Jacques-Belletête moderated his design to combine Renaissance aesthetics with the cyberpunk thematics: he defined it as being able to see Adam's augmented state in combat during the brief third-person camera moments while still seeing him having a meal in a high-class restaurant. One design which had him sleeveless throughout the game was scrapped as it made him "look like a douche". Instead, they created two looks: a sleeveless action-oriented look for missions, and a sleeved trench coat with a high collar and geometric patterning to portray the Renaissance elements.&lt;ref name="DHEvisuals"/&gt; In total, it took two years and a half to finalize Adam's design, with multiple designs being rejected as they failed to properly balance the cyberpunk and Renaissance elements.&lt;ref name="DEXHdevelop"/&gt;

The team wanted to make the game as consistently realistic as possible, wishing to avoid the situation of realistic character models standing in front of low-resolution backgrounds.&lt;ref name="DHEvisuals"/&gt; They created varying degrees of technical advancement for different locations: the most realistic location they created was the Detroit hub, while the most advanced was the two-level fictional metropolis of Hengsha.&lt;ref name="PCGart"/&gt; Architecture in the Detroit area was inspired by then-modern buildings from Japan and Europe.&lt;ref name="IGNdance"/&gt; Jacques-Belletête spent a long time researching furniture designs while creating interiors for in-game environments, joking that they could fill an [[IKEA]] catalogue with the results.&lt;ref name="EdgeLocations"/&gt; Multiple other hub locations were planned, including the upper levels of Hengsha, and an area of Montreal dubbed "Plateau" that featured "very specific architecture, called tri-plexes, with twirling exterior staircases made of [...] old metal". At the beginning of production, there were even plans to feature a hub location in [[India]]. When it became clear how much work it would be, the team cut out what could not be managed. Upper Hengsha was built but never finished before being scrapped.&lt;ref name="EdgeLocations"/&gt;

The music of ''Human Revolution'' was composed by [[Michael McCann (composer)|Michael McCann]], who worked on the score from 2008 to 2011. McCann also handled production, performance, mixing and arranging. Additional arrangements were done by Francois Arbour and Eric Arvisais. Vocals were provided by Andrea Revel and Courtney Wing.&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt; McCann, when comparing ''Human Revolution'' with his prior work on [[Ubisoft]]'s ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent]]'', stated that the latter could be scored more like a feature film due to its linear nature, while ''Human Revolution''{{'}}s non-linear approach to both gameplay and story made composition more challenging.&lt;ref name="GSmccann"/&gt; McCann's music for ''Human Revolution'' was focused around the game's multilayered dualistic themes, which he described as "technology/nature, past/future, wealth/poverty", all of which were encompassed by the general transhumanist theme.&lt;ref name="SumMccann"/&gt; McCann and sound director Steve Szczepkowski initially started out using dark electronic scoring typical of the cyberpunk genre, but during the three-year period he worked on the game the music gradually became more "organic". He was influenced by the visuals' Renaissance styling, convincing him to blend organic and traditional cyberpunk elements.&lt;ref name="GSmccann"/&gt; The electronic elements were influenced by the film music of [[John Carpenter]], [[Vangelis]], and the band [[Tangerine Dream]]. The acoustic mood elements were inspired by the work of [[Lisa Gerrard]], [[Ennio Morricone]] and [[Elliot Goldenthal]]. Outside films, he was strongly influenced by electronic bands and musicians, such as [[Amon Tobin]] and the band [[Massive Attack]].&lt;ref name="CinemaMccann"/&gt;

The musical structure was defined by him as "three-sided", mimicking the thematic use of triangles in the game. His three musical elements were acoustics (vocals, strings) representing the past; electronic music representing the future; and the present being a mixture of the two in both style and instrumentation. Vocals also evoked slight religious overtones, which again connected to the use of the number three due to the number's [[3 (number)#In religion|multiple religious associations]], in turn suggested and influenced by the Renaissance atmosphere. Another example of three-fold design was the ambient music, which needed to vary between quiet, tense and active depending on Adam's situation: each piece was constructed as a standalone cue that would interact with its fellows depending on the flow of gameplay. This presented a challenge to McCann about the handling of themes and melodies, as short cues might grow repetitive over time. Individual environments were also designed to contrast each other musically. An example given by McCann was different areas of the main city hubs: in the wealthy areas of Hengsha, the music evokes light and wealth, while in the poor areas of Detroit, it would be dark to reflect lawlessness and the surrounding decay.&lt;ref name="GSmccann"/&gt; This necessity of intertwining music with the environment meant that McCann needed to keep the music minimal enough to be unobtrusive while still being noticeable.&lt;ref name="SumMccann"/&gt;

McCann did not design any specific character themes, instead keeping any recurring themes ambiguous. He gave both stylistic and technical reasons for this: technically the music system was too simple to allow for a large number of unique musical cues, and stylistically it worked on a technical and musical level for there to be no specific musical themes influencing the player's judgement of characters and situations. The cues for hacking sequences were created fairly early in the process, and was one of a group of cues McCann created during a break from the project.&lt;ref name="SumMccann"/&gt; A piece he commented on in 2010 was "Icarus", the game's main theme. He created special versions for the game's reveal trailer, including a six-minute version broken into five sections for the director's cut of the trailer. He worked on creating the theme for two months, starting out with piano, vocals and minimal synthesizer work before building the full layers onto it. The final layer added were "synth arpeggios" that completed the piece's transformation into a full piece of cyberpunk-themed music. The "Icarus" theme, and by extension the soundtrack, also tied into the game's overall themes and motifs.&lt;ref name="CinemaMccann"/&gt;

A soundtrack disc was included in the limited "Augmented Edition".&lt;ref name="DEHversions"/&gt; An official album, ''Deus Ex: Human Revolution Original Soundtrack'', was released on November 15, 2011. It was released through [[Sumthing Distribution|Sumthing Else Music Works]] as a physical and digital release.&lt;ref name="DEHostRelease"/&gt; The album contained 25 tracks created from 50 out of the 200 pieces created for the game. The tracks included both cues from the game and arranged versions used in trailers. McCann chose the tracks to represent the game's story, drawing on the various styles of the music as a whole.&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt; He used the official album release to accentuate what he had been doing for the soundtrack as a whole. He initially wanted the soundtrack to be two discs, but realized that this would lead to repetition, so limited himself to a single disc. The remaining unreleased pieces were left out because of that potential repetition.&lt;ref name="SumMccann"/&gt; The soundtrack received praise from multiple music critics:&lt;ref name="OSVreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGMreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGFreview"/&gt; Original Sound Version's Gideon Dabi, commenting on the game's music prior to the album's commercial release, was highly positive about McCann's work, calling it "a tremendous upgrade over its predecessors" and praising its low-key impact.&lt;ref name="OSVreview"/&gt; Simon Elchlepp, writing for Video Game Music Online, gave the album 4/5 stars: he called it "a very satisfying experience", praising the score's connection to the game's themes and overall quality despite some perceived missteps about use of its main theme.&lt;ref name="VGMreview"/&gt; RPGFan's Liz Maas said that, while it trended towards being generic, with the track " Barrett Boss Fight" being most guilty of this, it managed to remain consistent with its themes and was worth buying.&lt;ref name="RPGFreview"/&gt;

==Release==
A third entry in the ''Deus Ex'' series was stated to be in development at Eidos Montréal in May 2007 by Eidos France director Patrick Melchior during an interview on [[MusiquePlus]]. At the time, Eidos did not comment on the story.&lt;ref name="DEHconfirmed"/&gt; Eidos Montréal project manager Stéphane D'Astous confirmed the game's existence in November, stating that concept approval had only just been granted.&lt;ref name="DE3announced"/&gt; An initial [[teaser trailer]] was released on November 26, 2007.&lt;ref name="KotakuTeaser"/&gt; The game's official title, first details, and original release window were announced at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]]. It was published worldwide by Square Enix.&lt;ref name="DEHreveal"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "DEHstatus"/&gt; While originally scheduled for 2010, the game was shifted to beyond April the following year so the team could further polish the gameplay.&lt;ref name= "DEHstatus"/&gt; It was released for PlayStation 3 (PS3), Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows [[personal computer]]s (PC). The gameplay was identical across all platforms barring control schemes.&lt;ref name="VG247platforms"/&gt; Originally Eidos had intended to make the PC retail version of the game [[Regional lockout|region locked]]. The reason behind this was due to DVD limitations which meant the languages on the game had to be split.&lt;ref name="PCregion"/&gt; However, due to negative reaction from the public, this lock was not implemented.&lt;ref name="PCregionNo"/&gt;

The PC port was outsourced by Eidos Montréal to Nixxes Software, who also worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of ''[[Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light]]''. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team wanted to make a quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a [[DirectX#DirectX 11|DirectX 11]] renderer that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by [[Advanced Micro Devices]].&lt;ref name="GSpyPC"/&gt; The game was also ported to [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[OS X]] platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by [[Feral Interactive]], who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as ''Bioshock'' and ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' to the platform.&lt;ref name="GamaFerel"/&gt;

It released in August 2011 in major Western regions: it released in North America on August 23,&lt;ref name="DEHreleaseNA"/&gt; Australia on August 25,&lt;ref name="DEHreleaseAUS"/&gt; and Europe on August 26.&lt;ref name="DEHreleaseEU"/&gt; In addition to the standalone releases, special editions were created featuring extra content in North America and Europe. The "Explosive Mission Pack" included a mission focusing on a central character from ''Deus Ex'' along with additional weapons and equipment. The "Augmented Edition" included all content from the "Explosive Mission Pack" in addition to new equipment and in-game bonuses. The European version sported a few extra items than the North American version. A separate pack included codes to unlock ''Deus Ex''-themed items for ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' for pre-orders on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name="DEHversions"/&gt; The OS X port released on April 26, 2012. The version released was the "Ultimate Edition", including all pre-order content in addition to [[downloadable content]] (DLC) released the previous year.&lt;ref name="MacReleaseDate"/&gt; A minor controversy arose around the PC version when video game retailer [[GameStop]] started removing content from the original packaging. GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for free access to ''Human Revolution'' on [[OnLive]], an online gaming service, stating that the coupon promoted a competitor of one of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and [[Impulse (software)|Impulse]], which it had recently acquired. As an apology, GameStop began giving customers a $50 gift card in-store to those who purchased copies of ''Deus Ex: Human Revolution'' for PC prior to August 26 and who brought the issue to their staff.&lt;ref name="DEHgstop1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHgstop2"/&gt;

The game was localized for and released in Japan for PS3 and Xbox 360, and included all pre-order content. The PS3 version also included the English voice track.&lt;ref name="DEHjpRelease"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHEjpZ"/&gt; The game's subtitle was cut for Japan, releasing simply as ''Deus Ex''.&lt;ref name="DEHjpDelay"/&gt; It was given a "Z" rating by country's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] entertainment rating board, equivalent to the North American [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]'s "Adults Only" rating, although it still underwent editing to remove some overtly violent and suggestive content, the display of which is prohibited under Japanese law.&lt;ref name="DHEjpZ"/&gt; Initially planned for release alongside Bandai Namco's ''[[Tales of Xillia]]'', it was pushed forward into the following month due to CERO requesting a further edit.&lt;ref name="DEHjpDelay"/&gt; It eventually released on October 20.&lt;ref name="DEHjpRelease"/&gt;

A DLC episode set during the main game, ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution – The Missing Link]]'', released digitally on October 18 for Steam and [[Xbox Live]], and October 19 for [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN).&lt;ref name="DEHmissingRelease"/&gt; It likewise debuted in Japan for the console versions: it released on PSN on March 7, 2012, and March 20 for Xbox Live.&lt;ref name="DLCjp1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLCjp2"/&gt; Set during a transitional event in-game, the plot sees Adam captured and stripped of his augmentations, having to escape and navigate a cargo ship and then a base operated by Belltower.&lt;ref name="DEmissingEuro"/&gt;

Plans for DLC were first announced in August 2010, with it being planned as an extension of the game.&lt;ref name="VG247dlc"/&gt; The developers initially did not plan for DLC, with it beginning development later in the game's production when the visual theme was finalized. Despite using only core team members, development was slow due to the main focus being on ''Human Revolution''. For ''The Missing Link'', the team improved the lighting, gameplay mechanics, player freedom, and character animation. The DLC was developed entirely at Eidos Montréal, and this gave the team the opportunity of developing a boss fight with multiple solutions, something they regretted not being able to do with the main game.&lt;ref name="DEH-RPSinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEmissingEuro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroInterviewDLC"/&gt;

===''Director's Cut''===
A [[director's cut]] of ''Human Revolution'', titled ''Deus Ex: Human Revolution – Director's Cut'', was announced in April 2013. It was co-produced by Eidos Montréal, Australian developer [[Straight Right]] — who had previously handled the Wii U port of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' — and Canada-based Snowed In Studios.&lt;ref name="EuroDirectors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DirectorsSnow"/&gt; Originally announced as a Wii U exclusive, it was later announced that it would also release on its original platforms.&lt;ref name="DEHdcMulti"/&gt; One of the major changes was the boss arenas: while they could not create non-lethal options to take down bosses, the team created alternate strategies for players who took a stealthy and otherwise non-lethal path. They also made adjustments to the energy system, improved enemy AI, and upgrades to the lighting and shading systems. These changes were carried over from the development of ''The Missing Link'', which had been developed based on the team's wishes to improve on aspects of the main game. While previous ports of major games for Wii U had been underwhelming in the eyes of the gaming public, Eidos Montréal saw it as a chance to create the "ultimate" version of ''Human Revolution''.&lt;ref name="EuroDirectors"/&gt;

The Wii U version of ''Director's Cut'' was priced higher than the other console versions: according to the staff, this was because of its added features.&lt;ref name="DEHdcPrice"/&gt; Console versions included a second screen option for some functions: the [[Wii U GamePad]] was used for the Wii U, [[PlayStation Vita]] for the PS3 version, [[Xbox app|Xbox SmartGlass]] for the Xbox 360 version.&lt;ref name="DEHdcRelease"/&gt; When originally developed for the Wii U, it was intended to make playing the game easier, along with evoking some of the early impressions from the initial CGI trailer from 2010.&lt;ref name="EuroDirectors"/&gt; The decision to port ''Director's Cut'' to multiple platforms was based on fan feedback requesting a multiplatform release.&lt;ref name="DEHdcMulti"/&gt; The ''Director's Cut'' included all the additional content alongside the main game, from the added equipment to the DLC episode ''The Missing Link'', here  incorporated into the main game. Also included was audio commentary from the developers activated using icons scattered through levels, and a documentary on the game's creation.&lt;ref name="EuroDirectors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHdcDetails"/&gt; For owners of the original version, a cheap upgrade option was offered, with the price varying depending on how much of the additional content owners possessed.&lt;ref name="DEHdcDetails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHdcUpgrade"/&gt; It released for Wii U, PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on October 22, 2013.&lt;ref name="DEHdcRelease"/&gt; It released on OS X, April 16, 2014. Like the main game, its port was handled by Feral Interactive.&lt;ref name="DEHdcMac"/&gt;

A promotional limited comic series was produced in the run up to the game's release. The comic was written by [[Robbie Morrison]], and drawn by Sergio Sandoval and [[Trevor Hairsine]].&lt;ref name="DEHcomicA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHcomicB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GBinterviewComic"/&gt; The cover art was handled by Murry, while both McMarle and Jacques-Belletête took supervisory roles for the story and artwork respectively.&lt;ref name="GBinterviewComic"/&gt; The comic was published by [[DC Comics]] between February 9 and June 20, 2011.&lt;ref name="DEHcomicA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHcomicB"/&gt;

A spin-off novel, ''Deus Ex: Icarus Effect'', was written by Swallow.&lt;ref name="DEHIwriter"/&gt; It was a story set around the same time as the main game, following new characters Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso as they uncover a hidden conspiracy.&lt;ref name="IcarusInfo"/&gt; First announced in July 2010, it was published by [[Titan Books]] on February 22, 2011.&lt;ref name="IcarusInfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHIpage"/&gt; A second novel by Swallow, ''Deus Ex: Fallen Angel'', was released as a free online download alongside the release of the ''Director's Cut'': the novel details Malik's early life in Hengsha.&lt;ref name="DEHdcRelease"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHFinfo"/&gt; A film adaptation was also announced, planned by Eidos Montréal and [[CBS Films]]: based on the story of ''Human Revolution'', [[Scott Derrickson]] was attached as director and co-writer, [[C. Robert Cargill]] as co-writer, and [[Roy Lee]] and Adrian Askarieh as producers.&lt;ref name="DEHmovie1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEHmovie2"/&gt;

The game received widespread critical acclaim upon release. Review aggregate site [[Metacritic]] gave the game scores of 90/100 for PC, and 89/100 for PS3 and Xbox 360. These were based on 52, 50 and 70 critic reviews respectively.&lt;ref name="MetaPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MetaPS3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meta360"/&gt; Reception of ''Director's Cut'' was also generally positive: Metacritic gave the Wii U and PC versions scores of 88/100 and 91/100, respectively based on 30 and 4 critic reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaDCpc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MetaDCwiiu"/&gt;

Tom Bramwell of [[Eurogamer]] praised the story's fit within the game mechanics, additionally praising the side quests for how they fleshed out the world and positively comparing the dialogue and character interaction to a boxing match.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Andrew Reiner called the story and world "riveting" despite Jensen being a weak character.&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd, writing for [[GameSpot]], positively noted the story's style and exploration of contemporary themes.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Arthur Gies of [[IGN]] found the story held up throughout despite some awkward writing.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Tom Francis did not comment much on the story, rather noting its scale and the various environmental details that fleshed it out for players.&lt;ref name="PCGreview"/&gt; Mike Channell of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' called the game one of the most intelligently-written games for the console, praising both the main narrative and side quests despite some supporting characters' stories being left unfinished.&lt;ref name="OXMreview"/&gt; ''[[Famitsu]]'' noted that the game had a high amount of player choice, positively referencing the conversation choices presented to them.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt;

Bramwell was positive about the overall gameplay, citing hacking as his favorite activity, although he noted that the game's limitations stood out because of the overall quality.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; Reiner was positive about the general experience, but found fault in the enemy AI and general balancing issues.&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt; VanOrd praised the freedom of choice and playtime, but found the weak enemy AI distracted from the overall experience.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Gies likewise praised the amount of choice offered to players, finding its stealth and action gameplay equally strong.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Francis positively compared the number of options open to the player to the original ''Deus Ex'' despite some linear design choices, praised the hacking for its more interactive form than earlier series titles, and generally enjoyed both the action and stealth gameplay.&lt;ref name="PCGreview"/&gt; Channell, while noting that pre-augmentation combat was "clumsy", was generally positive about the way combat evolved and praised its focus on stealth and conversation mechanics.&lt;ref name="OXMreview"/&gt; ''Famitsu'' was highly positive about the gameplay, feeling that it successfully hybridized the role-playing and first-person shooter genres, praising character customization and enemy AI.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; Unanimous criticism was directed at the boss battles, which multiple critics found either poorly executed or at odds with the rest of the experience.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OXMreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGreview"/&gt;

Bramwell positively noted the level design while criticizing repetition within interior environments.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; Reiner found Jensen's voice actor inexpressive and facial animations "robotic", but praised the soundtrack despite its similarity to the music of ''Mass Effect'' and generally lauded the world design.&lt;ref name="GIreview"/&gt; VanOrd, while praising the visuals, found the facial animations dated and noted long load times as being among some of the technical problems encountered.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Gies greatly praised the game's artstyle and music, while also noting technical difficulties and faulting the voice acting.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Frances similarly called the mission environments "gorgeous".&lt;ref name="PCGreview"/&gt; Channel praised its visuals, and called its voice acting "impeccable".&lt;ref name="OXMreview"/&gt;

In his review of the ''Director's Cut'', IGN's Brian Albert, despite noting inconsistencies in enemy behavior, shared much of his praised with the original version in addition to the added gameplay mechanics and improved boss battles.&lt;ref name="IGNreviewDC"/&gt; GameSpot's VanOrd again noted dated facial animations and poor AI, but generally praised other aspects of the ''Director's Cut'', particularly pointing out the improvements to boss battles.&lt;ref name="GSreviewDC"/&gt; Bramwell, again writing for Eurogamer, particularly praised the revamped boss battles and the inclusion of additional content such as ''The Missing Link'' that did not function properly as a standalone release. He also echoed much of his praise for the original game.&lt;ref name="EUROreviewDC"/&gt; Michael Gapper of ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' stated that all the changes made to the game for the ''Director's Cut'' had improved it for the better, praising its gameplay balance and freedom of choice in addition to the new features.&lt;ref name="ONMreviewDC"/&gt;

[[Image:Digicomp front.png|thumb|350px|A front view of the Digi-Comp I version 2.0]]
The '''Digi-Comp I''' was a functioning, mechanical digital [[computer]] sold in kit form. It was originally manufactured from [[polystyrene]] parts by [[E.S.R., Inc.]] starting in 1963 and sold as an educational toy for US$4.99.

==Operation==
In essence, the Digi-Comp I contained three mechanical [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], providing an ability to connect them together in a programmable way using thin vertical wires that are either pushed, or blocked from moving, by a number of cylindrical pegs. The whole arrangement was 'clocked' by moving a lever back and forth. Different configurations of these cylinders caused the Digi-Comp to compute different [[boolean logic]] operations. With a three binary digit (3-bit) readout of the state of the flip-flops, it could be programmed to demonstrate binary logic, to perform various operations such as addition and subtraction, and to play some simple logic games such as [[Nim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Trevor|title=K'nex Computer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkUd9rYkYnA|website=YouTube|publisher=Trevor Woodhouse|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductions==
The '''Digi-Comp I version 2.0''' was made available by Minds-On Toys in 2005 as a relatively inexpensive [[Paperboard|binder's board]] version of the original Digi-Comp with a much enhanced instruction manual.&lt;ref name="MOT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mindsontoys.com/kits.htm?dc1_main.htm |title=Minds-On Toys - Kits |date= |accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successor, the [[Digi-Comp II]], was not programmable, but in effect a visible calculator. A two-level masonite platform with guides served as the medium for a supply of marbles that rolled down an inclined plane, moving plastic cams as they fell.&lt;ref name="FODC2077"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/friendsofdigicomp/message/2077 |title=Yahoo friendsofdigicomp |date= |accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Engleby''''' is a novel by the author [[Sebastian Faulks]]. It tells the tale of a working-class boy who wins a place at an esteemed university and becomes a murder mystery after the disappearance of a girl at a nearby college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2077508,00.html ''The Guardian'', 12/5/2007, 'Engleby']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

Mike Engleby attends an [[Oxbridge|'ancient university']] studying English at first, but switches over to natural sciences after he begins to doubt the legitimacy of the subject. He is infatuated with a girl named Jennifer Arkland, whose name he only discovered on posters advertising her running for a society committee. He begins to attend the society in order to meet her and attends her history lectures, in a different faculty, despite not studying it.

He does not perform as well as expected on his second year exams but takes part in the production of a student film in Ireland involving Jennifer. While there he reads Jennifer's letters and begins to reflect about his past.

He remembers his time at the grammar school he attended, his dad's death and his subsequent scholarship to Chatfield – a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] for the children of navy servicemen.

At Chatfield he was bullied by the prefects and by other students, gaining the name "Toilet Engleby" by asking for permission to go to the toilet rather than [[U and non-U English|"lavatory"]] during a lesson. One prefect, Baynes, steals a cake sent to him by his mother and later forces Engleby to take a bath in cold water. He begins to steal, at first to pay for letters to his sister, but he soon escalates to frequent theft and begins to buy cigarettes to sell on to other pupils.

Engleby assaults Baynes who suffers from head injuries and broken leg in the attack which is staged to look line an accident. Mike meets a boy named Stevens to whom he takes an immediate dislike. He is outgoing, enthusiastic, plays rugby and is liked by his year. His final memory of Chatfield is of forcing Stevens to take a cold bath, just as Baynes had done to him previously.

Jennifer Arkland disappears half-way through her final year after a party attended by Mike, who at some point stole Jennifer's diary, which he begins to read and memorise its contents. Mike is questioned by the police about the disappearance of Jennifer and claims Jennifer to be his girlfriend. As other students have also been interviewed, some statements have been made by other students that Mike is homosexual, which doesn't tally up for the investigating officers. His alibi fails to stand up but no concrete evidence against him is found and the investigation is suspended.

Mike fails to attain a first in his final exams. He moves to London and makes a living by drug dealing, eventually becoming a journalist. He assumes the name Michele Watt as the left-wing paper he writes for is seeking to have more female writers. After a while he changes his assumed name to Michael Watson, as he claims he no longer needs to pretend to be a woman and it was convenient for him to keep a similar name.

He reveals that during his time at university he began to have panic attacks and that he has been taking 'blue pills' on the advice of a doctor at a mental health hospital he was taken to, after collapsing during a panic attack.

He meets and starts a relationship with a woman working at the same paper, Margaret, whom he then moves in with.

Years later, Jennifer's body is unearthed and Mike is called in for questioning. It is revealed that a shirt the officers took from his college rooms during the investigation was checked using newly developed DNA techniques and was shown to have Jennifer's blood on it.

Mike pleads guilty to the murder of Jennifer Arkland. He explains that he murdered Jennifer as she came home from a party, offering her a ride and refusing to let her get out. He drove to a remote location and, when she offered to do anything to be let go, he killed her. He adds that he also may have murdered a German woman called Gudrun Abendroth in London and had attacked Baynes while at Chatfield, causing injuries, then thought to be accidental, which contributed to Baynes' premature death some time later.

He pleads limited responsibility and after analysis by psychiatrist Dr. Exley he is diagnosed with a personality disorder and is sent to a mental institution. He is never released but eventually attains a sense of peace, teaching many of the other patients various basic skills.

==Themes==

===Unreliable narration===
The narration is from the perspective of Engleby himself, and he often obscures or misrepresents the events around him. This is most noticeable in the disappearance of Jennifer, to which he gives no indication of his involvement until very near the end of the novel. 

===Mental illness===
Engleby suffers from numerous panic attacks throughout the course of the novel and takes medication to prevent symptoms of anxiety. He occasionally alludes to feeling isolated, but rejects the idea that he suffers from depression. Late in the novel, a psychological professional diagnoses him with [[schizoid personality disorder]] and some narcissistic tendencies, while maintaining that he does not suffer any biological mental illness like [[schizophrenia]].

===Treatment of women===
Engleby idolizes Jennifer throughout the novel. He stalks her by following her into lectures and attending her societies. He is frustrated when she pleads to leave the car when he presumes to give her a lift home and deliberately takes a wrong turn to prolong their time together. He later kills her, apparently for accidentally threatening his sexual potency after he drives her off into a secluded area. He appears to consider women fundamentally different from men, and dismisses demands for sexual equality as 'flak from grumpy feminists', calling ideas of female equality 'lies'.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Reviews of the novel were mixed, with many critics citing the almost unlikable narrator as a negative factor.

Phil Hogan of ''[[The Observer]]'' said, "The character of Engleby's oddness, though, is harder to fathom. His prose has that flat, stilted quality familiar to the modern reader as a sign of moral vacuity, but does he have to be so uninteresting with it?" He went on to say, "The eventual arrival of men in white coats – a welcome introduction of sane voices – heralds the most successful section of the book. Relieved of the burden of faux suspense, ideas kept at the fringe by passing ephemera are foregrounded, themes blossom. This, you sense, is what Faulks has been waiting for – the chance to engage more directly with his subject. His prose, freed from the shackles of a troubled mind, starts to shine too. The trouble is it shines too late."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/06/fiction.sebastianfaulks ''The Observer'', 6/5/2007, 'The wizard of odd']&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Shilling of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' said, "Like ''[[Human Traces]]'', ''Engleby'' is distinguished by a remarkable intellectual energy: a narrative verve, technical mastery of the possibilities of the novel form and vivid sense of the tragic contingency of human life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3665008/The-inside-of-an-outsiders-mind.html ''The Telegraph'', 10/5/2007, 'The inside of an outsider's mind']&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrence Rafferty of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "At one point, near the end, when both the character and his creator seem to be getting slightly desperate, Engleby throws out the possibility that the 'idea of self' may be no more than a 'necessary fiction.' Maybe it is. 'Engleby' isn't."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Rafferty-t.html ''The New York Times'', 16/9/2007, 'Cantabrigian Psycho']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Footwork''' is a genre of music and [[street dance]] that originated in [[Chicago]] during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/27/footwork-street-dance-chicago|title=Footwork takes competitive dancing to the Chicago streets|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|first=Hazel|last=Sheffield|date=2010-05-27|access-date=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance involves fast movement of the feet with accompanying twists and turns, and usually takes place as part of a "[[Street dance#Battles|battle]]".&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/12/14/131834348/chicago-s-footwork-music-and-dance-get-a-transatlantic-lift|title=Chicago's Footwork Music And Dance Get A Transatlantic Lift|date=December 6, 2010|author=SAMI YENIGUN and WILLS GLASSPIEGEL|publisher=''[[National Public Radio]]''|access-date=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style was popularized outside Chicago by inclusion in the [[music video]] for [[Dude 'n Nem]]'s 2007 single "Watch My Feet".&lt;ref name=ChiReader&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/gyrobase/chicago-footwork-juke-house-dance-style-mtv/Content?oid=1604529&amp;storyPage=2|title=Music for Feet:The Chicago dance style footwork already has MTV's attention.

The music style has evolved from the earlier, rapid rhythms of [[Ghetto house#Chicago Juke|juke]] and ghetto house, a change pioneered by [[RP Boo|R.P. Boo]].&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; It may draw from styles such as [[drum and bass]], utilizing double-time clave triplets, syncopated toms and prominent [[sub-bass]].&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=Jacob|title=Fancy footwork: how Chicago's juke scene found its feet again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/30/fancy-footwork-how-chicagos-juke-scene-found-its-feet-again|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracks also frequently feature heavily syncopated [[sample (music)|samples]] from [[rap music|rap]], [[pop music|pop]] and other sources, and are often around 160 bpm.&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cush|first1=Andy|title=Jlin’s Rust Belt Modernism|url=http://www.spin.com/featured/jlin-may-2017-cover-story/|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Footwork also incorporates the club culture cultivated in disco, house and techno.

Radio station [[Afropop Worldwide]] remarked on the genre and its developments in 2011, saying that:
{{cquote|The most recent development in house's evolution, however, is a sound called 'footwork'. On Friday evenings at the Underground Tracks Factory, teenagers face off and improvise footwork dance battles. Their feet fly at insane speeds, something of a cross between house dance, tap dancing and breakdancing footwork. It looks like a dance from another dimension. The music they dance to is related to juke, but it's way more spacious, with more rhythmic complexity. Some tracks like "Reverb" by DJ Rashad are downright experimental walls of pulsating noise that would make [[John Cage]] proud. All these styles speak to the truth that house music never really left Chicago, as is often said. Its legacy continues to reverberate and mutate throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Midwest Electric: The Story of Chicago House and Detroit Techno |episodelink= |url=http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/826 |access-date=June 17, 2011 |series=[[Afropop Worldwide]] |serieslink=|credits= |network=[[Public Radio International]] |airdate=2011-06-16 |time=7:30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5754">'''Gambling in Vietnam''' has been illegal, even though locals have been gambling for centuries. Until the late 20th Century, the only legal option was the lottery.  The government opened three major lotteries available to the public. &lt;ref name=online&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.onlinebetting.com/legal/vietnam/ |title=Gambling Law for Vietnam |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=onlinebetting.com |publisher= |access-date=November 3, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A late 1940’s travelogue notes that merchants kept bowls of dice at their stalls to engage in gambles with their customers when “housewives would routinely bet on the days their horoscope was fortunate" which means that on slightly more than fifty percent of such occasions they return home empty-handed and with the housekeeping money gone." " There is no estimate on the black market gambling sector, but it is estimated to be worth billions of dollars. &lt;ref name=asiatimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutt |first=David |date=October 8, 2018 |title=Short on cash, Vietnam punts on gambling |url=http://www.atimes.com/article/short-on-cash-vietnam-punts-on-gambling/ |work=Asia Times |location= |access-date=November 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort the combat illegal gambling, the government has slowly begun to make gambling legal, while cracking down on major illegal gambling rings. In March 2018, the government shut down a $420 million gambling ring that implicated two senior government officials and some 90 other people (including junior government officials) in the sting. In September 2018, leader of an illegal online sports betting ring was sentenced to nine years in jail; the operation was worth some US$26 million. A separate online gambling ring shut down in last 2017 was thought to be worth US$89 million. [[Xinhua]] also reported a rash of pawn shops popping up during the 2018 World Cup, whose only purpose was to serve local gamblers. &lt;ref name=asiatimes/&gt;

The country opened the doors for locals to play games of chance on an experimental basis starting in 2017. The country has eight casinos open for foreign passport holders, with investors seeking to open up the larger domestic customer base, in an attempt to stimulate economic growth. As part of a three year experiment, locals are permitted to enter casinos if they can show monthly income exceeding 10 million dong (US$449) and have to pay 1 million dong entry tax. &lt;ref name=forbes&gt; {{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Muhammad |date=February 9, 2017 |title=How Vietnam Is Changing Its Gambling Rules To Win Foreign Investment |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/muhammadcohen/2017/02/09/how-vietnam-is-changing-its-gambling-rules-to-win-foreign-investment/#5b4fc10e30e7 |work=Forbes |location= |access-date=November 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has also recently announced plans (as of 2017) to legalize sports betting, as part of a strategy to increase foreign investment and tax revenues &lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

On June 14, 2018, the National Assembly passed a bill legalizing sports betting, with government oversight. This follows a 2017 decree which legalized betting on international football games, horse races, and greyhound races. All players must be at least 21 years of age, with the minimum bet set at 1000 dong and a maximum of one million dong per day. Players wishing to enter a casino must also be at least 21 years old, have the permission from their family to do so and not have a criminal record. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnam-legalizes-sports-betting.html/ |title=Vietnam Legalizes Sports Betting |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 20, 2018 |website= Dezan Shira &amp; Associates|publisher= |access-date=November 3, 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Casinos==

The largest hotel-casino in Vietnam (as of 2017) is the Grand- Ho Tram, controlled by [[Philip Falcone]], opened in 2013. The US$1 billion building has a 550 room hotel, a [[Greg Norman]] designed golf course and second hotel tower under construction as of 2017. &lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;
In order to operate a casino, foreign investors are required to invest over $2 billion in order to qualify for casino licenses.  In 2018, construction has begun along a three-kilometer (2-mile) stretch of coastline in central Vietnam where the country’s biggest casino is set to open. Suncity Group Holdings Ltd of Macau has invested $4 billion in the Hoiana project, that covers almost 1,000 hectares and includes shops, restaurants, golf courses and water parks. The casino will be owned by SunCity, keeping a one-third stake in the project. VinaCapital, a Vietnamese investment management and real estate firm, and the Hong Kong-based VMS Investment Group will also hold similar ownership stakes in the project. &lt;ref name=construction&gt;{{cite news |last=Master |first=Farah |date=April 20, 2018 |title=In Vietnam, a mega casino rises with the help of a Macau junket company |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-casino/in-vietnam-a-mega-casino-rises-with-the-help-of-a-macau-junket-company-idUSKBN1HR0JQ|work=reuters |location= |access-date=November 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another casino opened in 2013 is the Ho Tram, which is a multi-billion dollar facility, located a two-hour drive from Ho Chi Minh City. &lt;ref name=construction/&gt;

Two other casinos are under construction in 2018, one in Van Don in the northern province of Quang Ninh, and one on Phu Quoc island. These are part of the pilot project to allow locals to enter casinos. The Van Don is scheduled to open in 2019 and will also be run with management service agreement given to SunCity. &lt;ref name=construction/&gt;

'''''Ghost World''''' is a 2001 [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Terry Zwigoff]] and starring [[Thora Birch]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Steve Buscemi]]. Based on the [[Ghost World|comic book of the same name]] by [[Daniel Clowes]], with a screenplay co-written by Clowes and Zwigoff, the story focuses on the lives of Enid (Birch) and Rebecca (Johansson), two teenage outsiders in an unnamed American city. They face a rift in their relationship as Enid takes interest in an older man named Seymour (Buscemi), and becomes determined to help his romantic life.

The film debuted at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] in 2001. It had little box office impact, but was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] and has become a [[cult film]].

==Plot==
Best friends Enid and Rebecca face the summer after their high school graduation, with no plans for their future other than to find jobs and live together. The girls are cynical social [[outcast (person)|outcast]]s, but Rebecca is more popular with boys than Enid. Enid's diploma is withheld on the condition that she attend a remedial art class. Even though she is a talented artist, her art teacher, Roberta, believes that art must be socially meaningful and dismisses Enid's sketches as nothing more than "light entertainment".

The girls see a [[Personals|personal ad]] in which a lonely, middle-aged man named Seymour asks a woman he met recently to contact him. Enid makes a [[prank phone call]] to Seymour, pretending to be the woman and inviting him to meet her at a diner. The two girls and their friend, Josh, secretly watch Seymour at the diner and make fun of him. Enid soon begins to feel sympathy for Seymour, and they follow him to his apartment building. Later they find him selling vintage records in a garage sale. Enid buys an old [[blues]] album from him, and they become friends. She decides to try to find women for him to date.

Enid has meanwhile been attending her remedial art class, and she persuades Seymour to lend her an old poster depicting a grotesquely caricatured black man, which was once used as a promotional tool by [[Coon Chicken Inn]], the fried chicken franchise now known as Cook's Chicken, where Seymour works as a manager. Enid presents the poster in class as a social comment about racism, and Roberta is so impressed with the concept that she offers Enid a scholarship to an art college.

Seymour receives a phone call from Dana, the intended recipient of his personal ad. Enid encourages him to pursue a relationship with Dana, but she becomes unexpectedly jealous when he does so.

Enid and Rebecca's lives start to diverge. While Enid has been spending time with Seymour, Rebecca has found a job at a coffee shop, has made new friends and has become more interested in clothing and boys. Enid also finds a job so she can afford to rent an apartment with Rebecca, but her attitude gets her fired after only one day. The girls argue, and Rebecca abandons the idea of living with Enid.

At the end of the summer, Enid and Seymour's lives fall apart. When Enid's poster is displayed in an art show, school officials find it so offensive they force Roberta to give her a failing grade and revoke the scholarship. Enid turns to Seymour for solace, resulting in a drunken one-night stand. Seymour breaks up with Dana, and is called to account at work when the Coon Chicken poster is publicized in a local newspaper. He unsuccessfully tries to contact Enid, only for Rebecca to tell him about Enid's prank phone call, describing the way they mocked him at the diner. Seymour is upset and ends up in a violent confrontation with Josh, resulting in his being injured and hospitalized. Enid visits him in an effort to apologize, causing him to realize that he has no chance of any kind of future with her.

After everything that has occurred, Rebecca and Enid have ceased to be friends, and Enid gives in to her childhood fantasy of running away from home and disappearing. She has seen an old man, Norman, continually waiting at an out-of-service bus stop for a bus that will never come. Finally, as Enid watches from across the street, Norman boards an out-of-service bus. The next day, while Seymour discusses the summer's events with his therapist, Enid returns to the bus stop and boards the out-of-service bus when it arrives.

==Production and technique==
The film was directed by [[Terry Zwigoff]] with cinematography by [[Affonso Beato]]. Zwigoff and ''Ghost World'' comic creator [[Daniel Clowes]] wrote the screenplay together. Years later, Clowes admitted that learning how to write the screenplay came with a significant learning curve. He recalled, "I started by trying to transcribe the comic into Final Draft. I figured that’s how you do an adaptation. Then I tried throwing everything away and writing an entirely new story that was very different from the book. And I synthesized those two things into a final screenplay. The actual film itself is very different from the script we wrote. We ended up jettisoning the last twenty pages and rethought the whole thing as we were filming. It was really held together by hair and spit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McKittrick |first=Christopher |date=March 23, 2017 |title=Wilson: A Walking Id|journal=''Creative Screenwriting'' |publisher= |volume= |issue= |page= |url=https://creativescreenwriting.com/wilson/ |accessdate=March 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwigoff and Clowes presented Beato with the task of making a [[comic book]] look to the movie. They asked for a fresh technique: earlier examples of the form such as ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' were dismissed as literal-minded and "insulting" to the art form.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hall |first=Emily |authorlink= |date=July 19, 2001 |title=The Humanity of Failure |journal=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |publisher= |volume= |issue= |page= |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-humanity-of-failure/Content?oid=8069 |accessdate=February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Clowes, cameraman Beato "really took it to heart," carefully studying the style and color of the original comics.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; The final cut is just slightly oversaturated, purposefully redolent of "the way the modern world looks where everything is trying to get your attention at once."&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt;

Zwigoff also added his individual vision to the adaptation, particularly in his capture and [[Film editing|editing]] of [[languid]], lingering shots, a technique derived from his experience as a [[documentarian]].&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; Another notable touch is his minimal use of extras in the film, making the city and its streets intentionally empty – Clowes notes approvingly, "It captures this weird feeling of alienation in the endless modern consumer culture."&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt;

Music in the film includes "[[Jaan Pehechan Ho]]" by [[Mohammed Rafi]], a dance number choreographed by [[Herman Benjamin]] from the 1965 [[Bollywood]] musical ''[[Gumnaam]]'' which Enid watches and dances to early in the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/from-gumnaam-to-ghost-world-to-lost |title=FROM 'GUMNAAM' TO 'GHOST WORLD' TO...

There are songs by other artists mentioned in the film, including [[Lionel Belasco]], which are reflective of the character Seymour, and of director [[Terry Zwigoff]]. Zwigoff is a collector of [[78 RPM]] [[Gramophone record|records]], as portrayed by Seymour. Other tracks are by [[Vince Giordano]], a musician who specializes in meticulous recreations of songs from old 78 RPM records.

Referenced in the film is [[R. Crumb &amp; His Cheap Suit Serenaders]], a band that Zwigoff played in. Enid asks Seymour about the band's second album, ''Chasin' Rainbows'', and Seymour replies, "Nah, that one's not so great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabbard |first=Krin |title=Black Magic: White Hollywood and African American Culture |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2004 |pp=229–230 |isbn=0813533848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missing from the soundtrack is "[[What Do I Get?]]" by [[Buzzcocks]], which can be heard when Enid dresses up like a punk, and the song "A Smile and a Ribbon" by [[Patience and Prudence]].

==Release==
''Ghost World'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] on June 16, 2001 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2001/07/a_ghost_world_preview.html |title=A Ghost World Preview |last=Truitt |first=Eliza |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=July 2001 |accessdate=July 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to lower than average recognition by audiences, but admiration from critics. It was also screened at several film festivals worldwide including the [[Fantasia Festival]] in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2001/07/26/ghost-world-cometh |title=GHOST WORLD COMETH |last=Head |first=Steve |work=[[IGN]] |date=July 26, 2001 |accessdate=July 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
Following the film's theatrical exhibition in the United States, ''Ghost World'' was released on VHS and DVD format via [[MGM Home Entertainment]] in early 2002. Additional features include deleted and alternative scenes, "Making of Ghost World" featurette, Gumnaam music video "Jaan Pehechaan Ho", and the original theatrical trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s411ghost.html |title=Ghost World |work=[[DVD Talk]] |date=January 31, 2002 |accessdate=July 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Special Edition of the film received an official Blu-ray release on May 30, 2017 from [[The Criterion Collection]], with a [[4K resolution|4K]] transfer, interviews with the performers, and [[audio commentary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukethompson/2017/05/26/blu-ray-criterion-ghost-world-scarlett-johansson-thora-birch-steve-buscemi-daniel-clowes/#70f2b4581a1e |title=Blu-ray Review: The Ground-Breaking, Post-Ironic 'Ghost World' Comes To Criterion, As It Deserves |last=Thompson |first=Luke Y. |work=[[Forbes]] |date=May 26, 2017 |accessdate=July 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/28687-ghost-world |title=Ghost World |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |accessdate=July 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
With a [[Limited release|limited commercial theatrical run]] in the United States, ''Ghost World'''s commercial success was minimal. The film was released on July 20, 2001 in five theaters grossing $98,791 on its opening weekend; it slowly expanded to more theaters, reaching a maximum of 128 by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt; It went on to make $6.2 million in North America and $2.5 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $8.7 million, just above its $7 million budget.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{mojo title|ghostworld|Ghost World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''Ghost World'' received a 92% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "With acerbic wit, Terry Zwigoff fashions Daniel Clowes' graphic novel into an intelligent, comedic trip through deadpan teen angst."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|ghost_world|Ghost World}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also holds a score of 88 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 31 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim."&lt;ref&gt;{{Metacritic film|ghost-world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, "I wanted to hug this movie. It takes such a risky journey and never steps wrong. It creates specific, original, believable, lovable characters, and meanders with them through their inconsolable days, never losing its sense of humor."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=''Ghost World'' | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | publisher= | date=August 3, 2001 | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010803/REVIEWS/108030301/1023 | accessdate=February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[A. O. Scott]] praised Thora Birch's performance as Enid: "Thora Birch, whose performance as Lester Burnham's alienated daughter was the best thing about ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', plays a similar character here, with even more intelligence and restraint." In his ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' review, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] wrote, "Birch makes the character an uncanny encapsulation of adolescent agonies without ever romanticizing or sentimentalizing her attitudes, and Clowes and Zwigoff never allow us to patronize her."&lt;ref name="rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite news | last=Rosenbaum | first=Jonathan | title=Women of Substance | work=[[Chicago Reader]] | publisher= | date=August 10, 2001 | url= http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/women-of-substance/Content?oid=906165 | accessdate=February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Andrew Sarris]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' disliked the character of Enid: "I found Enid smug, complacent, cruel, deceitful, thoughtless, malicious and disloyal...Enid's favorite targets are people who are older, poorer or dumber than she is."&lt;ref name="sarris"&gt;{{cite news | last=Sarris | first=Andrew | title=So You Wanna Be a Country-and-Western Star: More Like 'Ghastly World' | work=[[The New York Observer]] | publisher= | date=August 5, 2001 | url=http://observer.com/2001/08/so-you-wanna-be-a-countryandwestern-star/ | accessdate=February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite news | last=Scott | first= A.

Arnold wrote, "Unlike those shrill, hard-sell teen comedies on the other screens, ''Ghost World'' never becomes the kind of empty, defensive snark-fest that it targets. Clowes and Zwigoff keep the organic pace of the original, and its empathic exploration of painfully changing relationships."&lt;ref name="arnold"&gt;{{cite news | last=Arnold | first=Andrew D | title=Anticipating a ''Ghost World'' | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=July 20, 2001 | url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,168182,00.html | accessdate=February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Dean of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' addressed the concerns of comics fans head-on: "Those with higher expectations – and, certainly, ''[[Ghost World]]'' purists – are likely to experience at least a degree of disappointment. Some of the comic's air of aimless mystery has been paved over with the semblance of a Hollywood plot, and to that extent, the movie is a lesser work than the comic. But it's still a far better movie than we had a right to expect." According to Dean: "The injection of a relatively trite plot situation into ''Ghost World''{{'}}s more enigmatic stream of events is perhaps forgivable, since the film might otherwise never have been produced. Its greatest sin, the misappropriation of Enid's longing, is not so forgivable, though the overlap between Zwigoff's distaste for modernity and Enid's distrust of social acceptability makes it almost palatable. In any case, we want to forgive it, because so much is right about the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Michael | last=Dean | title=Ghost Story | url=http://archives.tcj.com/236/r_ghost.html | work=[[The Comics Journal]] | year=2001 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414151301/http://archives.tcj.com/236/r_ghost.html | archivedate=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an "A-" rating and [[Owen Gleiberman]] wrote, "''Ghost World'' is a movie for anyone who ever felt imprisoned by life, but crazy about it anyway."&lt;ref name="gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gleiberman | first=Owen | title=Devoutcast | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher= | date=July 27, 2001 | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,255537,00.html | accessdate=February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for the ''[[LA Weekly]]'', [[Manohla Dargis]] wrote, "If Zwigoff doesn't always make his movie move (he's overly faithful to the concept of the cartoon panel), he has a gift for connecting us to people who aren't obviously likable, then making us see the urgency of that connection."&lt;ref name="dargis"&gt;{{cite news | last=Dargis | first=Manohla | title=Everyone's Too Stupid! | work=[[L.A.

'''Hester Latterly''' is a main character of [[Anne Perry]]'s ''Monk'' detective series. She is a nurse by trade who served with [[Florence Nightingale]] in the Crimea. Upon her return home in 1856 she finds her family in a shambles and meets [[William Monk]] who is investigating a crime related to her family. Her inquisitive nature eventually allows her to help Monk in his investigations, despite annoying him at first. After trying to work in a free hospital, she is fired for insubordination and takes to private nursing clients. After this, with the help of her friend Callandra Daviot, she opens a clinic for injured and sick prostitutes in the Central London slums. She marries William Monk 4 years after they meet. They have no children yet, but have adopted a '[[mudlark]]' named Scuff.

'''James Campbell''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] stand-up [[comedian]].

==Information==
{{As of|2005}}, Campbell has been running comedy workshops in [[London]] for would-be comedians between the ages of seven and thirteen.  These children are then given the opportunity of performing [[open spots]] in his Comedy4Kids shows.

He has also  performed in front of Queen Elizabeth II of England and in the Albert Hall &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.thejamescampbell.com/schools.php|title=TheJamesCampbell.com - James Campbell: writer, storyteller and comedian|publisher=James Campbell|date=|accessdate=2013-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011714/http://www.thejamescampbell.com/schools.php|archivedate=2013-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell has also written a play, ''The Onomatopoeia Society'' (a play about a group of squiggles, who are paid to collect dung), which was performed at the [[2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

In 2008, Campbell had a brief role in an experiment on Laughter on the BBC1 show, ''[[Child of Our Time]]''. In October 2011, he appeared on the CBBC children's programme ''[[Blue Peter]]'', teaching children how to do jokes.

He has also signed a deal with Hodder children's books for a new series of books called ''Boyface'', about a child called Boyface Antelope, the series will be released later in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thejamescampbell.com/ |title=TheJamesCampbell.com - James Campbell: writer, storyteller and comedian |publisher=James Campbell |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discography==
* ''Comedy 4 Kids''
* ''The epic saga of the Microwave frog'' (James's first novel)
* ''The Tales Of Creamy Mouse'' (a children's novel, parodying The Canterbury Tales)
* ''The Wimpety Wam''(a sequel to ''The tales of creamy mouse'', but aimed at a younger age group)
* ''Cutlery Wars''
* ''The Onomatopoeia Society'' (a satirical novel for children)
* ''Fat Round Cat'' (a children's novel, first published in 2002)
* ''A desaise'' (a horror-comedy children's novel)
* ''Boyface'' (not yet published)

==Recycled jokes==
Many jokes appear many times in Campbell's; events, shows and books, these include:
*Grand Theft tractor. A story in which the characters of ''Grand Theft auto'' go out looking for adventure, and accidentally get a job on a farm
*When advertising, he uses slogans like; ''if your parents don't buy my new book for you, it's obviously because they don't love you'' and ''if you don't buy my new CD, your eyes will fall out and monsters will eat you''
*The magical sock of Loch Negoch. A song in which a man tries to find the Loch Ness monster, but he ends up in ''Loch Negoch'', where an evil magical sock lives.

In March 1972, Flynt created the ''Hustler Newsletter,'' a four-page, black-and-white publication of information about his clubs. This item became so popular with his customers that by May 1972 he expanded the Hustler Newsletter to 16 pages and in August 1973, to 32 pages. As a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]] the United States entered an economic recession; [[Hustler Club]] customers tightened their spending and Flynt had to find financing to pay his debts or go bankrupt. He decided to turn the ''Hustler Newsletter'' into a national sexually explicit magazine. He paid the start-up costs of the new magazine using [[sales tax]]es collected in the clubs. In July 1974, the first issue of ''[[Hustler]]'' was published. Although the first few issues went largely unnoticed, within a year it became highly lucrative and he was able to pay his tax debts.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Flynt and Kenneth Ross, ''An Unseemly Man: My Life As A Pornographer, Pundit And Social Outcast'' (1996) {{ISBN|0-7871-1143-0}}, page 88 and 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around 3 million (current circulation is below 500,000). In November 1974, Hustler showed the first "pink-shots," or photos of open [[vagina]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Flynt and Kenneth Ross, ''An Unseemly Man: My Life As A Pornographer, Pundit And Social Outcast'' (1996) {{ISBN|0-7871-1143-0}}, page 91&lt;/ref&gt; Flynt had to fight to publish each issue as many people, including his distribution company, found the magazine too sexually explicit and threatened to have it removed from the market. Shortly thereafter, Flynt was approached by a [[paparazzo]] who had taken nude pictures of former First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] while she was [[sunbathing]] on vacation in 1971. He purchased them for $18,000 and published them in the August 1975 issue.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Flynt and Kenneth Ross, ''An Unseemly Man: My Life As A Pornographer, Pundit And Social Outcast'' (1996) {{ISBN|0-7871-1143-0}}, page 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; That issue attracted widespread attention, and one million copies were sold within a few days. Now a millionaire, he bought a $375,000 (1976 dollars) [[mansion]].

==Other magazines==
After 1976, Larry Flynt Publications expanded to include many [[pornographic magazines]] as well as mainstream titles under its umbrella. Other pornographic magazines included:
* ''Hustler's Taboo'', which specializes in [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] material, such as the depiction of [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]] and [[urolagnia]].
* ''[[Barely Legal (magazine)|Barely Legal]]'', a primarily softcore magazine focusing on models between 18 and 23
* ''Hustler XXX'', a more generic hardcore offering
* ''Hustler [[Beaver Hunt]]'', featuring amateurs and reader-submitted photos
* ''Hustler's Leg World''
* ''[[Asian Fever]]'', focusing on [[Asian people|Asian]] models
* ''Hustler's [[Chic (magazine)|Chic Magazine]]'', started in 1976 and aimed at a more upscale clientele than Hustler.
* ''Hustler's Busty Beauties'' is a [[softcore pornography|softcore]] magazine which specializes in photographs of women with extremely large breasts.

In 1988, [[Gail Harris]], founder and CEO of Falcon Foto created, developed and produced from conception the first niche magazine, [[Barely Legal (magazine)|Barely Legal]], for Larry Flynt Publications; it became one of Flynt's best-selling titles, second only to Hustler Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-07-18/features/0107180183_1_adult-entertainment-harris-web-masters|title=X-rated photo czarina shows how to market a body of work|date=July 18, 2001|author=Dretzka, Gary|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/23/local/me-36698|title=Moving From Back Alleys on to Wall St.|first=James P.|last=Pinkerton|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of Barely Legal revolutionized the porn industry with 22 copycat titles appearing, as well as format changes in established publications and in the video medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=45989845&amp;page_url=//www.falconfoto.com/whois&amp;page_last_updated=2000-10-27T18:29:24&amp;firstName=Gail&amp;lastName=Harris Zoominfo; Gail Harris]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynot.com/content/104619-ynotnews-interviews-gail-harris-falcon-foto.html YNOTNews Interviews Gail Harris From Falcon Foto Published on May 15th, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Barely Legal is published 13 times per year by Larry Flynt's Larry Flynt Publications, and is sometimes marketed as Hustler Barely Legal. Hustler Video also produces a Barely Legal line of videos. Less frequently, LFP publishes Barely Legal Hardcore magazine, which depicts young women engaging in hardcore sex.

When the market for men's magazines softened in the late 1990s, LFP expanded into production of [[adult video]]s through its [[Hustler Video]] subsidiary, and moved further into the mainstream publishing market. To accommodate this expansion, the company moved its headquarters to [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], where it remains to this day. It launched a series of special-interest magazines, such as ''Camera &amp; Darkroom Photography'', ''PC Laptop Computers'' and ''Maternity Fashion &amp; Beauty''.&lt;ref name="Pederson, Jay 2000"&gt;Pederson, Jay. International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 31. St. James Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[RIP (magazine)|RIP Magazine]]'' was a [[music magazine]] covering [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. It was the first non-pornographic publication produced by LFP, and was edited by [[Lonn Friend]], who had previously edited ''Hustler'' and ''Chic''. Writers included rock journalist, Judy Wieder, Mick Wall, and Andy Secher.

It published 14 bi-monthly issues of ''[[TurboPlay Magazine]]'' (June/July 1990 &amp;ndash; August/September 1992) dedicated to covering [[TurboGrafx-16]] and TG-CD hardware and software. It was a spin-off publication of ''[[Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment]]'' (''VG&amp;CE''), a popular multi-platform gaming magazine of the late 1980s / early 1990s. Every issue of TurboPlay was 32 pages in length and a yearly subscription cost $9.95. L.F.P. published three bi-monthly issues of ''DUOWORLD'' magazine (July/August 1993 &amp;ndash; November/December 1993) before it was canceled. ''DuoWorld'' was very similar in format to ''TurboPlay'', but with a focus on the newly released TurboDuo console (i.e. ''TurboMail'' and ''TurboNews'' became ''DuoMail'' and ''DuoNews'', respectively). 

''[[Tips &amp; Tricks (magazine)|Tips &amp; Tricks]]'' (later ''Tips &amp; Tricks Codebook'') is a [[video game journalism|video game magazine]] published by LFP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips &amp; Tricks Magazine Trimmed|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/73380-Tips-Tricks-Magazine-Trimmed|publisher=Escapist Magazine|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips &amp; Tricks Magazine gets shafted, editorial staff laid off|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/06/26/tricks-and-tips-magazine-gets-shafted-editorial-staff-laid-off/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of its existence, the publication was devoted almost exclusively to [[strategy guide|strategies]] and [[cheat code|codes]] for popular [[video game]]s. It began as a spin-off from ''VideoGames'' magazine, which in itself morphed out of ''[[VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment]].''  ''VG&amp;CE'' and ''VideoGames,'' like ''Tips &amp; Tricks'', were published by LFP following the purchase of ''[[A.N.A.L.O.G.]]'', ''ST-LOG'' and other computer magazines from publishers Michael DesChenes &amp; Lee Pappas in the late 1980s.
 
As the 21st century approached, [[magazine]] sales further declined. Together, the company's 31 periodicals had a monthly circulation of between 2.5 and 3 million.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} This was a far cry from the 1970s, when Hustler alone sold that many copies each month.&lt;ref name="Pederson, Jay 2000"/&gt; Because of this LFP focused on turning its magazine and video titles such as ''Hustler'', ''[[Barely Legal (magazine)|Barely Legal]]'', ''Busty Beauties'', ''[[Beaver Hunt]]'', and ''[[Asian Fever]]'' into profitable websites.

By 1998, estimates LFP was doing $135 million in annual sales with 51,112 periodicals published and 7,812 movies and or video tapes produced.&lt;ref name="Pederson, Jay 2000"/&gt;

==Hustler Video==
[[Hustler Video]] is a [[pornographic film]] [[film studio|studio]] owned by LFP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/lfp/--ID__48039--/free-co-profile.xhtml |title=LFP Company Description |publisher=[[Hoover's]] |accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Hustler Video bought [[VCA Pictures]],&lt;ref name=VCA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/9322.html |title=IT'S NOW OFFICIAL: HUSTLER ACQUIRES VCA; DEAL COMES A YEAR AFTER VIVID PACT, CEMENTING HUSTLER AS... |publisher=[[AVN (magazine)|AVN]] |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903140044/http://business.avn.com/articles/9322.html |archivedate=2009-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which maintains a separate brand identity within the LFP conglomerate.&lt;ref name=VCA/&gt; Hustler Video has produced several top-selling and award-winning films, such as ''[[Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle]]'', ''[[Snoop Dogg's Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp]]'' and ''[[Who's Nailin' Paylin?]]''.
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2010 when AIDS Healthcare Foundation lodged a complaint against the Hustler Video group for not requiring the actors to wear condoms and thereby contributing to the spread of HIV, Michael H. Klein, the President of LFP responded by saying the company would not back down from shooting raw sex videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,2014131,00.html |title=Michael H. Klien on Condomless Sex Videos |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |accessdate=2011-05-19 |date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hustler Clubs==
The [[Hustler Club]] is a chain of strip clubs. In 1968, Flynt opened the first Hustler Club which featured semi-clothed girls. One Hustler Club in Dayton quickly lead to a chain of clubs with the same name in Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo, and Akron. By early 1970, he had eight clubs and 300 employees.&lt;ref name="Pederson, Jay 2000"/&gt; In 1974 with profits from ''Hustler'' magazine far surpassing those of the Hustler Clubs, Flynt decided to get out of the bars business and be a publisher full-time.&lt;ref name="Pederson, Jay 2000"/&gt; For close to 30 years the Hustler Club name lay dormant. In the early 2000s (decade), LFP began to license the Hustler Club name for new clubs across the country. Currently there are Hustler Clubs in 6 U.S. states and 3 countries.

'''Dame Lauren Alesha Masheka Tanesha Porticia Fenston Estonia Monaveen Vervain Felicia Jane Cooper''' is a fictional character in ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]''. Lauren is one of the show's main characters and is played by [[Catherine Tate]]. The character is "killed off" in the 2007 Christmas Special which aired on 25 December.

Lauren is a 15-year-old schoolgirl with a surly attitude and was most widely known for her phrase "Am I bovvered?" (i.e. bothered - the "v" in the word takes the place of the "th" that should be there; see [[th-fronting]]). When feeling angry or embarrassed, she frequently replies with defensive responses such as "Am I bovvered?", "Do I look bovvered?" or "Are you disrespecting me?", among others. As demonstrated through her clothing and mannerisms, Tate portrays Lauren as a caricature of a [[Chav]]. 

She claimed to have been made a Dame at the end of her sketch on the Royal Variety Performance 2005.

==''The Catherine Tate Show''==
In series one, sketches feature Lauren arguing with authority figures such as [[train]] conductors and teachers, as well as her best friend Liese Jackson (played by [[Niky Wardley]]) and love interest Ryan Perkins (played by [[Mathew Horne]]). She normally utters her trademark catchphrases only after being provoked or embarrassed. Lauren is one of the most popular characters with fans, and is arguably the most recognizable from the show. She is listed as "Fly Girl" on the series one DVD.

In series two, Lauren becomes more offensive than ever before. One notable change is that Lauren starts being insulting without provocation, while in the past, her catchphrase of "Am I bovvered?" was only used after she believed that she had been wronged in some way. She is now aged 15 and, according to one of her teachers, in grave danger of leaving school with no [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]].

In the 2005 Christmas special, her singing is revealed as poor when she, Liese and Ryan as "the Flygirl Collective and MC Perkins" audition for ''[[Fame Academy]]''. In their audition, they sing their own rendition of "[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]] which is poorly received by [[Richard Park (broadcaster)|Richard Park]].

In series three, she spends the summer holidays working at "Billy's Burger Bar". Her attitude at school remains the same as before. She has a new rival for Ryan's affections (played by [[Natalie Cassidy]]), and falls for a fake marriage proposal from Ryan. She is due to marry Ryan in the final episode, but he jilts her at the altar because of his embarrassment of Lauren after she sings a very squeaky, off-key version of [[Celine Dion]]'s "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" to him.

Despite Lauren's blatant disregard for authority, and [[chav]]-like demeanor, she sometimes shows surprising intelligence. She is well-versed in the [[Periodic table]], she apparently knows [[Shakespeare]], knows how to say "Am I bovvered?? in [[British Sign Language]], and she even speaks [[French language|French]], once surprising her French teacher by asking her "Regardez mon visage. Suis-je bovvered? Est-ce que vous appelez ma mère une [[Wiktionary:pikey|pikey]]? Est-ce que vous appelez mon père un [[Romani people|gypo]]?" ("Look at my face. Am I bovvered? Are you calling my mum a pikey? Are you calling my dad a gypo?"), although she refuses to speak any French for her oral exam.

==Other appearances==
Lauren made an appearance during the [[BBC]]'s [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] [[telethon]] in March 2005. The sketch features fans of [[McFly (band)|McFly]] asking the group questions. Lauren decides to ask them: "Why are you so rubbish?" When told by [[Simon Amstell]], who is hosting the segment, that only positive questions are allowed, Lauren uses a variety of her [[catch phrase]]s, including "Am I bovvered?" ("I ain't McBovvered") and continues to question them in a harsh manner. Lauren is then "ordered" to put a more positive question to the group, and confuses them with [[Busted (band)|Busted]], asking "Are you gutted that [[Charlie Simpson|Charlie]] left?" She is told to leave the set, and as she does so, she asks [[Danny Jones]] from McFly to sign her knee, but walks away promptly saying "You can't even spell."&lt;ref name="guardianprofile"&gt;"[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1673257,00.html The Guardian profile: Catherine Tate]". ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Lauren appeared in a sketch for the [[Children in Need]] telethon. The sketch is a crossover with ''[[EastEnders]]''. The scene is set when Lauren arrives in [[Walford]] in search of [[revenge]] on [[Stacey Slater]], who has apparently stolen her boyfriend. She looks for her in the launderette, where she finds [[Little Mo Mitchell]], who tells her that Stacey is not there. She then makes an appearance in the [[The Queen Victoria|Queen Vic]], and [[Peggy Mitchell]] finds herself getting increasingly frustrated and annoyed with Lauren, who asks, "Are you a [[Cockney]]? Are you a Cockney sparrow?" (pronounced "cockerney").&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_4450000/newsid_4452400/bb_rm_4452426.stm Catherine Tate appears in Walford]". [[BBC News]]. Retrieved February 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy then orders Lauren out of her pub with immediate effect.

In November 2005, Lauren was a featured sketch at the 77th [[Royal Variety Performance]]. After Lauren embarrasses herself in front of the audience, Ryan points out that the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] is laughing at her. Looking up at the Royal Box, she asks "Are you disrespecting me?" and mimicks the Queen's accent, asking, "Is one bovvered?".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4454382.stm Tate asks if Queen is 'bovvered']". [[BBC News]]. Retrieved December 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  She receives a phone call, answers timidly "Hello, yes, thank you." and hangs up. When asked who it was, she announces "I've just been made a dame."

On 16 March 2007, Tate appeared twice on [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] as Lauren. Guests in the sketches included [[David Tennant]]. Tennant plays her new English teacher, Mr. Logan, who after being goaded by Lauren for his Scottish accent and resemblance to [[Tenth Doctor|The Doctor]], is finally pushed over the edge when she asks him if he fancies [[Billie Piper]]. He threatens to fail her, and Lauren proceeds to do her 'Am I bovvered?' routine in Shakespearean style 'Amest I bovvered, forsooth?' with many other famous lines changed "looketh at my face" followed by a recitation of [[Sonnet 130]] off the top of her head ending with a definitive "Bite me alien boy". Mr. Logan then reveals he actually ''is'' the Doctor, as he produces the [[sonic screwdriver]] from inside his jacket and turns her into a 5" [[Rose Tyler]] [[Doctor Who merchandise#New series merchandise|action figure]] with it, quoting ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' by saying "[[wikiquote:Romeo and Juliet#Act II|A Rose by any other name would smell as sweet]]". The figure proclaims that it "still ain't bovvered".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxB1gB6K-2A Comic Relief - Catherine Tate &amp; David Tennant] ''[[YouTube]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Blair]] also makes a [[cameo appearance]], when Lauren is on work experience at [[Downing Street]]. Upon Lauren attempting to tell Blair who the most famous person she had met was, he asks her if he is "bovvered", much to the astonishment of Lauren. He then instructs her to "look at his face" and acknowledge that "no part of it is bovvered". He then orders her out of his office, prompting Lauren to shout back that the most famous person she has met is [[Ross Kemp]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfkjvagVsRI Comic relief - Lauren Cooper meets Tony Blair] ''[[YouTube]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/22/ntate121.xml Catherine Tate hails Blair's comic skills]".

=="Death"==
In the 2007 Christmas special of ''The Catherine Tate Show'', Lauren dies after falling from a [[waterfall]] while [[kayak]]ing,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://entertainment.aol.co.uk/bovvered-lauren-to-be-killed-off/article/20070718055509990003 Bovvered Lauren to be killed off]".

Retrieved December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; having ignored warnings from a local man, after asking him "Are you a [[yokel]]?" and "Were you married to your sister? But is your cousin your mum? Is your dad your brother? Are you your own father?" At the end of the episode, Liese and Ryan are seen standing beside her gravestone that says:

:::''In Loving Memory''

:::''LAUREN COOPER''
:::''1992-2007''

:::''I Still Ain't Bovvered''

==Influence==
In 2006, Lauren's catchphrase word "bovvered" was named [[Word of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/10/12/bovvered_wins_word_of_the_year_award.html 'Bovvered' wins Word of the Year award]" ''[[The Guardian]]'' Retrieved October 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the OED commented: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"'Am I bovvered?' and its follow-up, 'Does my face look bovvered?' had already come to be seen as the perfect expression of a generation of teenagers and their speaking style." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alan Carr]] spoofed Lauren in a sketch on Catherine Tate's episode of ''[[The Friday Night Project]]''.

In a recurring spoof on NBC's [[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]], Jimmy Fallon performs in character as a vampire version of [[Robert Pattinson]] talking about things that bother him whilst in a tree.

A 2016 update to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] added the word "bovver", which had been current since 1871, and had been "made famous by comedian Catherine Tate ".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/07/from-bovver-to-budgie-smugglers-the-latest-entries-to-the-oed From bovver to budgie smugglers: the latest entries to the OED]".

The following is a list of '''[[Philippines|Philippine]] [[television]] [[television ratings (audience measurement)|ratings]] for 2009''' coming from [[AGB Nielsen Philippines]] (AGB) and [[Taylor Nelson Sofres]] (TNS).

For AGB Nielsen, Mega Manila accounts for about 48% of total TV households in urban Philippines. The Mega Manila and Luzon markets combined account for about 67% of the total TV households in urban Philippines. Non-urban households aren't included in both Mega Manila and NUTAM surveys. For TNS, Mega Manila comprises about 56% of national households.

==Markets==
{{see|AGB Nielsen Philippines}}
Note that the National Urban Television Audience Measurement (NUTAM) does not represent the entire Philippines but only urban areas; NUTAM markets comprise 39% of the entire country. The Mega Manila market comprises 55% of the NUTAM market.

&lt;!-- By this time, the title below is not NUTAM, its Nationwide because TNS provides national ratings. Please clarify this... --&gt;

==National Urban Television Audience Measurement==
Monthly NUTAM ratings from AGB will be available after January.

:{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}

==Artists==
&lt;!--
When adding artists, please place artist in order of Hot 100 hits.
If the artist had 10 Hot 100 hits, 9 Top 40 hits, 8 Top 10 hits and 7 No. 1s, that artist should be inserted behind the artist having 10, 10, 9, 8 hits, etc. The Hot 100 rankings - not AC, R&amp;B, UK – are the determiner of artist order. Please do not introduce any artist at the top of the list.
--&gt;

Empty columns mean the artist did not chart hit singles in those charts or genres of music.

This table can be sorted numerically or alphabetically on any category by clicking the icon below the heading.
&lt;!--- When adding artists, please insert into chronological order (Hot 100, then follows) ---&gt;

'''Lito Cruz''' (May 14, 1941 – December 19, 2017) was a prominent Argentine stage director and motion picture actor.

==Life and work==
Lito was born Oscar Alberto Cruz in the working-class [[La Plata]] suburb of [[Berisso]] in 1941, and began performing in local theatres at the age of 15. Graduating from a La Plata secondary school, he continued to pursue his calling in La Plata's growing independent [[theatre]] scene.

Enrolling at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] School of Architecture and Urbanism in 1961, he made time for performances throughout his studies. Following his 1964 graduation, he enrolled at the prestigious [[Arts Faculty, Universidad de Chile|University Theatre Institute of Chile]] (ITUCH) and returned to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1968. He was cast by Argentine playwright [[Roberto Cossa]] in a [[short film]] adaptation of his ''Los taitas'' ("The Uncles") and the following year, co-founded the Experimental Theatre Team of Buenos Aires (ETEBA) with Augusto Fernándes. ETEBA produced an adaptation of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', ''La leyenda de Pedro'', which was well received and earned Cruz international esteem following its tour through festivals at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Berlin]] and [[Florence]]. ETEBA was invited to perform their ''El sapo y la serpiente'' ("The Toad and the Serpent") at the [[Munich Olympics]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=lito&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litocruz.com.ar/html/litocruz.php|title=Lito Cruz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruz was Professor of Acting at the National Drama Conservatory between 1972 and 1975, where he directed [[Peter Handke]]'s ''The Ward Wants to be Warden'' among other avant-garde works. This experience earned him a [[U.S. Department of State]] scholarship to attend [[Lee Strasberg]]'s prestigious [[Actors Studio]] in [[New York City|New York]] and a fellowship with the [[Gulbenkian Foundation]] of [[Portugal]] to attend the [[University of Porto]]'s Drama School. Returning to Buenos Aires, he continued to direct his [[experimental theatre]] school, which became one of Argentina's most coveted drama schools.&lt;ref name=lito/&gt; His production of [[Eduardo Pavlovsky]]'s politically charged ''El Señor Galíndez'' led to the bombing of the Payró Theatre by the fascist commando group, the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=331847|title=Lito Cruz, 27 años después|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been given a number of supporting film roles since his appearance in ''Los taitas,'' Cruz was cast as the happy-go-lucky ghost of an assassinated stockyards worker in [[Fernando Solanas]]' ''[[Sur (film)|Sur]]'' (1987), a chronicle of the lives of a working-class [[Barracas, Buenos Aires|southside borough]] in Buenos Aires during Argentina's brutal [[National Reorganization Process|last dictatorship]]. He devoted himself to his drama school, however, accepting only brief supporting roles in film until, in 1996, he was cast in Mario Levin's ''Sotto voce'' ("Whispers") as Walensky, a gruff southside bar owner embroiled in intrigue.&lt;ref name=lito/&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{IMDb name|190384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lito Cruz increased his prominence as an advocate for [[theatre in Argentina]] during the 1990s, which had been the victim of intimidation during the 1970s and financial woes, since. He was named director of the Argentine Actors' Association and "Action for Culture, Theatre and Visual Arts," a leading advocacy group for its field in Argentina. This work led to his appointment as National Theatres Director in 1995, a position he leveraged to help have [[Argentine Congress|Congress]] pass the "National Theatre Law" in 1998. The bill helped protect struggling stages against demolition and guaranteed annual subsidies for the art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/1997/09/27/e-05001d.htm|title=Apoyo económico a los grupos de teatro independiente|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lito Cruz continued his work as head of the drama school that now bears his name, while having accepted more starring roles in film. Some of the most notable have been that of a retired military officer guarding a family secret in [[Fito Páez]]'s ''Vidas privadas'' (a 2001 drama that helped secure [[Mexican cinema|Mexican]] star [[Gael García Bernal]]'s prominence in cinema) and as an aging intellectual facing a crossroads in life in [[Mario Sábato]]'s ''India Pravile'' (2003), among others. He continues his work as an advocate for his art in government, as well, as Director of the [[Province of Buenos Aires]] Comedy and the Coliseo Podestá Theatre in La Plata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/04/29/espectaculos/c-01002.htm|title=Ley para el teatro independiente|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=734774|title=Lito Cruz, al frente del Coliseo Podestá|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruz created and produced ''Sueños de [[Milonga (music)|milongueros]]'' in 2009, a musical written in homage to authors [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Alejandro Dolina]], and cartoonist/satirist [[Roberto Fontanarrosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/10/05/espectaculos/c-02012183.htm|title=Siempre voy a ser un actor que baila|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Long Gone Days''''' is an [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] [[role-playing]] [[video game]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[MacOS|OSX]] and [[Linux]], being developed by BURA. The original [[Game demo|demo]] was written, developed, and illustrated by Camila Gormaz. It features the first hour of the story, and was released for Windows and OSX on May 13, 2016.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://laburatory.itch.io/lgd|title=Long Gone Days by Camila Gormaz|website=itch.io|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on March 28, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/510540|title=Long Gone Days on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Long Gone Days'', the player controls Rourke, a soldier from an underground [[unrecognized country]] named "The Core", after he's deployed to a mission in [[Kaliningrad]], Russia. After discovering the truth about the [[Military operation|operation]] he was part of, he decides to [[Desertion|desert]] and find a way to prevent the upcoming war his homeland wants to provoke.

The demo received mostly positive reviews,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gamejolt.com/games/long-gone-days/151330|title=Game Jolt - Indie Games for the Love of It|website=Game Jolt|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=690609875|title=Steam Greenlight :: Long Gone Days|website=steamcommunity.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; praising its writing and art. Reviewers especially enjoyed the use of a [[Morale]] system to motivate other party members, and the topical issues covered by the plot.

== Plot ==
''Long Gone Days'' takes place on the [[Earth]] during the present time, in an unofficial country named The Core, whose exact location is unknown. In this place, every individual is trained from birth for their job, so they can become experts by the time they become adults. The main character of the story, Rourke, is a [[Sniper|military sniper]] who has never visited the surface. He's chosen as a last-minute replacement for an operation to aid the [[Polish Armed Forces|Polish forces]] in Kaliningrad, without much time to review the briefing.

During this mission, after the player eliminates the targets they were assigned to shoot, Rourke finds out all of them were [[civilian]]s, and he's told by the [[squad]]'s [[combat medic]], Adair, that it is in fact a [[False flag|false flag operation]]. Rourke is shocked by the revelation, and by the fact nobody in his squad seems to mind the [[war crime]]s they are committing, and without much thought, he finally takes the decision to desert. Intrigued by the outcome, Adair makes up his mind to follow Rourke along.

Taking advantage of his [[Military Operational Specialty|specialty]], Adair reports a false illness that requires transferring Rourke to the nearest [[field hospital]], using this as an excuse to escape. Even though they are walking in the opposite direction of their two bases in Kaliningrad, their plan is quickly discovered as they get seen by [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drones]] and fellow soldiers from a nearby base they weren't told about, thus realizing the operation is much bigger than they were informed of.

The demo ends with Rourke and Adair being chased by their own allies, as they have become deserters and enemies of The Core, while they try to process what are they going to do with their lives from now on.

== Gameplay ==
''Long Gone Days'' is a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] with [[visual novel]] elements that uses a [[top-down perspective]]. It features a traditional [[turn-based RPG]] combat, which allows the player to select which body-part of the enemy to aim. Since the story doesn't have fantasy or supernatural elements, instead of [[Magic (gaming)|magic]], the characters rely on morale. This [[Attribute (role-playing games)|stat]] can be raised or lowered by the choices the player may choose during dialogues in and outside battles, and it affects how each party member will perform in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/280149/Long_Gone_Days_RPG_explores_wars_emotional_impact_on_soldiers.php|title=Long Gone Days : RPG explores war's emotional impact on soldiers|last=Couture|first=Joel|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; If their Morale reaches zero, the character loses their will to fight.

Besides the turn-based combats, the game also features a first-person sniper mode, which consists of [[Game mechanics|seek and find mechanics]].

Since the story is set in the real world, the [[Non-player character|NPCs]] will speak in their [[First language|native language]] depending on the country the characters are in. The player can recruit [[Language interpretation|interpreters]] in order to buy at shops and complete [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]].

== Development ==
''Long Gone Days'' was originally conceived in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/01/26/long-gone-days-rpg-story-12-years-making/|title=Long Gone Days, An RPG With A Story 12 Years In The Making|date=2016-01-26|website=Siliconera|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Gormaz as an [[RPG Maker 2000]] project, but it wasn't until 2015 that the [[Video game development|development]] of the demo began. The game was announced for the first time on the [[RPG Maker]] [[Internet forum|forums]] and TIG Source on January 17, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/54939-long-gone-days-demo-now-on-indiegogo/|title=Long Gone Days (DEMO) [NOW on Indiegogo]|website=RPG Maker Forums|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-02}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=52516.0|title=Long Gone Days - Modern-Day Character-Driven RPG (INDIEGOGO/Demo)|website=forums.tigsource.com|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lgdays.tumblr.com/post/144303784647/long-gone-days-demo-is-out-long-gone-days-is-a|title=Long Gone Days {{!}} Devlog|last=Days|first=Long Gone|website=Long Gone Days {{!}} Devlog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Windows version of the demo was released, and an OSX port was released on July 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lgdays.tumblr.com/post/147410137272/long-gone-days-is-now-available-for-mac-thanks-to|title=Long Gone Days {{!}} Devlog|last=Days|first=Long Gone|website=Long Gone Days {{!}} Devlog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2016, Gormaz launched a [[Crowdfunding in video games|crowdfunding]] campaign on the website [[Indiegogo]]. The campaign reached its goal on August 11, 2016, ending with US$21,300 raised by 567 people.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/long-gone-days-a-2d-modern-day-military-rpg-anime-videogames/x/14368299#/|title=Long Gone Days - A 2D Modern-Day Military RPG|website=Indiegogo|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the developer, the game will be around 4 to 5 hours long, and it will have two different endings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The demo of ''Long Gone Days'' received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, mostly appreciating the art style and the story. It received a score of 4.7/5 on [[Game Jolt]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; based on 480 ratings, and 5/5 on [[Itch.io]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Reviewers praised the game's focus on the use of [[Language interpretation|interpreters]], with Maddi Chilton of [[Kill Screen]] commenting "Not only do they add realism to a game that deals with international military, but they bring into the spotlight something that people often forget: it's not only the soldiers shooting guns that are crucial to a war".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/long-gone-days-brings-dystopia-us/|title=Long Gone Days imagines the world of war that's coming for us - Kill Screen|date=2016-07-14|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 it was registered as a company, with a board of directors, with the intention of creating the regional archive for the Midlands.  MACE took on this role when James Patterson was appointed as its director in 2000. It is now an independent limited company and a registered charity (as Media Archive of Central England Ltd) based at the [[University of Lincoln]].

As the principal moving image archive service provider in the Midlands, MACE works with a wide range of partners across the regions to help people to experience their moving image heritage.

A '''mother's boy''', also '''mummy's boy''' or '''mama's boy''', is a man who is excessively attached to his [[mother]] at an age at which men are expected to be independent (e.g. live on their own, be economically independent, be married or about to be married). Due to cost of living of some states, this is a viable option for many single men or even newlyweds. Anecdotally, this age of independence varies throughout each stratum of every human society in the world, sometimes greatly. A mother's boy may be effete or effeminate, or might be perceived as being macho, or might have a [[personality disorder]], such as [[avoidant personality disorder]], or might be [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]], so that the mother acts as a caregiver.

In classical Freudian [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, the term [[Oedipus complex]] denotes a child's [[Libido|desire]] to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that a child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London, 2nd Ed. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JosephChilders"&gt;Joseph Childers, Gary Hentzi eds. ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism''  (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; If this identification fails, the boy remains a lifelong "mama's boy."

Being mother-bonded is sometimes seen as a sign of weakness, and has a [[social stigma]] attached to it in many places, although in other places it may be more acceptable or perceived as normal. A mother-bonded man is seen to give control of his own life to his mother.

== Causes ==

=== '''Psychological/Psychoanalytical''' ===
It is generally accepted that mothers and the social experiences they provide for their children, have a huge influence on the child’s social behaviour. American psychiatrist David M. Levy’s wrote in his seminal work on maternal behaviour:

“His outlook on life, his attitude towards people, his entire psychic well-being, his very destiny is presumed to be altered by the maternal attitude […] If human behaviour is influenced so markedly by maternal attitudes, then surely the most important study of man as a social being is a study of his mother’s influence on his early life.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=David M.|date=Fall 1938|title=Maternal Overprotection|url=|journal=Psychiatry|volume=1|pages=561|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘mama’s boy’ is not a clinical definition, but is understood as a particular kind of mother-son dynamic that reflects co-dependency, while also resulting in a number of social, emotional and emotional intelligence, and even physical deficiencies when seen in the most extreme cases &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Despite limited academic literature on the long-term effects of maternal overprotection in creating grown ‘mama’s boys’, a man’s abnormal dependency on his mother for emotional, financial, moral, and other kinds of support are widely believed to originate in a prolonged, mutually dependent relationship with his mother in the first years of life. This relationship may be caused by a number of factors, including the mother’s personality, social and maternal anxieties, relationship or separation from the father, cultural context and expectations, lack of emotional, social, or financial independence, or prior experiences with child-raising. Often a mother’s excessive care in early infancy is triggered by a child’s unexpected illness, birth defects, or accidents, and may be prolonged treatment that does not end even when it is no longer needed &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

In psychoanalysis, this mutually-dependent relationship and the deficiencies it brings between mother and son may be explained as a direct result of maternal overprotection, a specific kind of maternal relationship that develops in early infancy, often in the first year of life. Although defining ‘overprotection’ as an extreme form of behaviour can be difficult due to cultural, social, and economic backgrounds of families, in clinical settings cases are usually deemed extreme according to the norms within the mother’s cultural ingroup. In D. M. Levy’s study, children displaying “emotional disturbance” as a result of prolonged contact and infantilizing treatment by their mothers were hospitalized by the efforts of their fathers, teachers, social workers, and other figures in close proximity to their mother, pressuring her to seek extra help for her child’s resulting behaviour &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Clinical views ====
Clinical studies have shown two main relationship dynamics that characterize overprotection:

''&lt;u&gt;Submissive child – dominating mother&lt;/u&gt;'' 

The submissive child is often socially awkward, unable to relate to other children, experiences anxiety when physically separated from his mother, lacks the ability to make strong, independent decisions because of mother’s dominance. His dependency on his mother is reinforced by her overly-dominating decisions and presence in his social life, and her desire to control his social, physical, and emotional environments as a way of ‘protecting’ him from perceived harms of the outside world.

''&lt;u&gt;Aggressive child – indulgent/submissive mother&lt;/u&gt;''

This kind of mother-son relationship gives near-complete dominance to the son, making his every wish the responsibility of the mother to fulfill. Often, the son of a submissive, indulgent mother who is also overprotective may experience the opposite in personality shaping, and display infantile power, showing a tendency to manipulate his situations in order to be the centre of attention; losing his temper when crossed or corrected, may be sexually or physically aggressive in later life and relationships. Levy describes this relationship as: “A process in which infantile power, unmodified, expands into a monstrous growth that tends to subjugate the parents” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Theoretical Approaches ===
''Maternal Love:'' 

Early years have paramount influence on later life. This thinking conforms to the Freudian Oedipus complex, where the mother plays important role and investment in the child’s material, emotional, and physical reception and understanding of pleasure and other feelings&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (564), and where the son displays a behavioural disposition to compete, manipulate, and exhibit  a temperament to gain his mothers attention. In several cases within Levy’s study, few of these boys displayed sexual responses to their mother&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (585-6)

''Maternal Attitude:''

This viewpoint emphasizes that the style or stage of life set by the mother on the son influences and projects the child’s relationship to his mother to the rest of the world. A son who exhibits hunger for power and dominance, anger when crossed, or a desire to be at the centre of attention in social situations with other children were likely spoiled with constant attention, devotion, and obeisance by his mother (564). 

In a normal mother-son relationship, four basic patterns of maternal care include: 

* '''Physical and social contacts''' with friends, relatives, family members; where a child is exposed to social situations and himself learns how to create, maintain, and strengthen relationships
* '''Infantile care''' is a basic instinct for many mothers, this includes close contact and affection, cleaning, feeding, nursing, and other forms of physical and emotional nurture
* '''Protection against danger''', ensuring that the child is safe and taking care to protect them from harm and danger in the best way possible
* '''Balancing between disciplining and indulging the child''', correcting a child’s mistakes in ways that are healthy and appropriate for their age, personality, intellect, and behaviour

In the case of maternal overprotection, the patterns are pushed to their extremes and are consistent across behavioural characteristics:

* '''Excessive contact''' with the mother. She is always present in the child’s life, even when it is not appropriate – such as in school, or as a stand-in for friends and external social networks. When contact is excessive, infantilization and prevention of the child’s independent growth are natural outcomes (584). Examples include constant companionship of mother and child, prolonged nursing care, excessive fondling, sleeping with mother long past infancy (589)
* '''Infantilizing'''. This unwillingness or inability allow her son develop into an adult is often seen to reflect the mother’s wish that her son remains an infant forever. She still treats him like a baby, feeding and preparing food for him, taking direction of his wardrobe and other decisions he should be making independently, all out of either a submission to his every will or treating him like a helpless child who cannot make these decisions on his own.
* '''Prevention of independent behaviour'''. Similar to the previous characteristic, the mother won’t let her son grow up or take any risks, stunting his emotional, social, and even in some cases, physical development. 
* '''Lack OR excess of maternal control''' – a mother lacking in control cannot modify or change her child’s behaviour. In extreme form, she is subservient to her child, who possesses her full attention and services in the first year of life. The latter, excess of maternal control, is the opposite: a dominant mother who perceives experiences outside of her presence or control as a threat to her social monopoly over her son.

These characteristics often overlap, and are consistent with the presence of related dynamics like sibling rivalry, marital relations, maternal rejection, paternal roles, other behavioural problems and experiences that shape personality, such as disease, family life, and infantile experience &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[562]

=== '''Socio-economic''' ===
In Italian culture in particular, the decision to stay home until marriage was more common for men who were unemployed.  Traditionally, people have turned to their family in times of economic uncertainty, and historically can be seen as the only guarantee of survival in uncertain times.  

=== Historical ===

== Cultural ==

=== '''Popular Culture''' ===
With several different books, poems and a Hollywood movie titled “Mama’s boy”, it is the more popular and common form of referencing this term. 

'''Books

''The Mama's Boy Myth: Why Keeping Our Sons Close Makes Them Stronger'' by Kate Stone Lombardi was published in 2013. In it, Lombardi argues that the stigma associated with the term is undeserved and a close relationship with his mother is beneficial for the son's development. 

'''Poetry'''

'''Film &amp; Television'''

A Hollywood movie titled Mama's Boy was released in 

==== Meme ====
[[File:Mamas boy meme .jpg|thumb]]
A lesser known meme has been created to mock mama's boys. This meme is often used in a way that insults the subject's manhood or insinuates some sort of sexual relationship between the boy and his mother. 

=== Italian Culture ===
In Italian Culture, it is much more accepted, and oftentimes even encouraged, for a son to live at home until marriage. This is seen more with Italian men than women and accredited to the especially strong bond Italian men tend to form with their mothers. These men are referred to as "figli per sempre," which translates as "sons forever." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200803/global-psyche-forever-mammas-boy|title=Global Psyche: Forever Mamma's Boy|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often shown in pop culture versions of Italian families, where the mother is the strong matriarch.    

=== '''Stigma''' ===
The term "mama's boy" is often used in a degrading manner to refer to someone who is "soft" or lacks manliness. The relationship to the mother, as opposed to a more "manly" father figure, is shown as emasculating, and is often used as either a comedic device or a way to show someone as undesirable in platonic or romantic relationships. The mother is also stigmatized, considered to be coddling her soon or stunting his maturation. This is the only parent-child relationship that has been subject to this type of stigma. Father-daughter relationships are the most stark contrast: a close relationship to her father is considered vital for her self-esteem later on.   

However, the opposite school of thought has recently arisen. Popular figures like LeBron James, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have cited their close relationships with their mothers as being critical for their success. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/05/09/opinion/drexler-mamas-boys/index.html|title=Opinion: Raise your son to be a mama's boy - CNN|last=Drexler|first=By Peggy|work=CNN|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is science to support this as well. Studies have found that son's that have a strong bond with their mothers tend to have less behavioral problems, lower rates of delinquency, better quality romantic relationships, and a higher sense or morality. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/05/09/opinion/drexler-mamas-boys/index.html|title=Opinion: Raise your son to be a mama's boy - CNN|last=Drexler|first=By Peggy|work=CNN|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''NX Files''''' is an action martial arts multi-season video series broadcast online. Created by Robert Baldwin, John Purchase, Alain Moussi and Stephan Roy; the [[webisodes]] are filmed and produced in [[Orleans, Ontario]], Canada. [http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20061214/CPARTS/612140393&amp;SearchID=73271273466437]

NX Files chronicles the out-of-this-world adventures of Team Xtreme, a group of young Martial Artists. A source of power called the NX Secret gives each member of Team Xtreme a unique special ability. They must fight to protect this secret from a band of [[ninja]]s and an evil dark lord.

== Show summary ==

Team Xtreme consists of 7 members, [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] instructors. After discovering the NX Secret, each member developed super powers such as speed, ability, and strength.

The villains in NX Files are a ruthless band of evil ninjas known as the Kurai Kai. Led by Lord Tragos, a former member of Team Xtreme, the Kurai Kai attempts to steal the NX Secret from Team Xtreme.

Aside from ninjas, Team Xtreme must also deal with advanced beings known as Archons and vicious animal-like creatures called Hybrids.

'''Season 1'''

In Season 1, Team Xtreme was introduced to the world. The seven young members must use their martial arts skills and their special super abilities to fend against a mysterious band of ninjas called the Kurai Kai. It is soon revealed to the Team that the leader of the Kurai Kai, a mysterious dark figure known as Lord Tragos is in fact their dear old friend Tornado, who has been currupted and transformed by the evil powers of Mugen Kurai. Lord Tragos' ultimate plan is to steal the NX Secret from Team Xtreme in order to quench his own thirst for power.

'''Season 2'''

In Season 2, Team Xtreme takes a step into a larger world. The conflict between them and Kurai kai suddenly seems tiny in comparison to what is happening beyond. When the Archon Mr. Black tells Spike of a new threat called the Hybrids, he entrusts him with a quest to find the only weapon capable of destroying them. In the meantime however, the Hybrid leader Golock travels to the lair of the Kurai Kai and enlists a reborn Lord Tragos to help him find the weapon first.

The foundations of '''negotiation theory''' are [[decision analysis]], [[behavioral decision making]], [[game theory]], and [[negotiation analysis]].
Another classification of theories distinguishes between Structural Analysis, Strategic Analysis, Process Analysis, Integrative Analysis and [[behavioral analysis]] of negotiations.

Individuals should make separate, interactive decisions; and ''negotiation analysis'' considers how groups of reasonably bright individuals should and could make joint, collaborative decisions. These theories are interleaved and should be approached from the synthetic perspective.

==Common assumptions of most theories==

Negotiation is a specialized and formal version of conflict resolution most frequently employed when important issues must be agreed upon. Negotiation is necessary when one party requires the other party's agreement to achieve its aim. The aim of negotiating is to build a shared environment leading to long-term trust and often involves a third, neutral party to extract the issues from the emotions and keep the individuals concerned focused. It is a powerful method for resolving conflict and requires skill and experience. Zartman defines negotiation as "a process of combining conflicting positions into a common position under a decision rule of unanimity, a phenomenon in which the outcome is determined by the process." Druckman (1986) adds that negotiations pass through stages that consist of agenda setting, a search for guiding principles, defining the issues, bargaining for favorable concession exchanges, and a search for implementing details. Transitions between stages are referred to as turning points. &lt;ref&gt;Druckman, D. (1986). "Stages, crises, and turning points: Negotiating military base rights, Spain and the United States." ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 30 (2): 327-360.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most theories of negotiations share the notion of negotiations as a process, but they differ in their description of the process.

Structural, strategic and procedural analysis build on rational actors, who are able to prioritize clear goals, are able to make trade-offs between conflicting values, are consistent in their behavioral pattern, and are able to take uncertainty into account.

Negotiations differ from mere coercion, in that negotiating parties have the theoretic possibility to withdraw from negotiations.
It is easier to study bi-lateral negotiations, as opposed to multilateral negotiations.


==Structural analysis==

Structural Analysis is based on a distribution of empowering elements among two negotiating parties.  Structural theory moves away from traditional Realist notions of power in that it does not only consider [[Power (sociology)|power]] to be a possession, manifested for example in economic or military resources, but also thinks of power as a relation.

Based on the distribution of elements, in structural analysis we find either power-symmetry between equally strong parties or power-asymmetry between a stronger and a weaker party. All elements from which the respective parties can draw power constitute structure. They may be of material nature, e.g., [[hard power]], (such as [[weapon]]s) or of social nature, i.e. [[soft power]], (such as [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, [[contract]]s or [[precedent]]s).

These instrumental elements of power, are either defined as parties’ relative position (resources position) or as their relative ability to make their options prevail.

Structural analysis is easy to criticize, because it predicts that the strongest will always win. This, however, does not always hold true.

==Strategic analysis==

According to structural analysis, negotiations can therefore be described with [[matrice]]s, such as the [[Prisoner's dilemma]], a [[concept]] taken from [[game theory]]. Another common game is the [[Chicken (game)|chicken dilemma]].

Strategic analysis starts with the assumption that both parties have a [[veto]]. Thus, in essence, negotiating parties can cooperate (C) or defect (D). Structural analysis then evaluates possible outcomes of negotiations (C, C; C, D; D, D; D, C), by assigning values to each of the possible outcomes. 
Often, co-operation of both sides yields the best outcome. The problem is that the parties can never be sure that the other is going to cooperate, mainly because of two reasons: first, decisions are made at the same time or, second, concessions of one side might not be returned. Therefore the parties have contradicting incentives to cooperate or defect. If one party cooperates or makes a concession and the other does not, the defecting party might relatively gain more.

[[Trust (social sciences)|Trust]] may be built only in repetitive [[game]]s through the emergence of reliable patterns of behavior such as [[tit-for-tat]].

This table illustrates the options and possible outcomes of the Negotiator's Dilemma.

==Process analysis==

Process analysis is the theory closest to haggling. Parties start from two points and converge through a series of concessions. As in strategic analysis, both sides have a veto (e.g. sell, not sell; pay, not pay). Process analysis also features structural assumptions, because one side may be weaker or stronger (e.g. more eager to sell, not willing to pay a certain price).
Process Analysis focuses on the study of the dynamics of processes. E.g. both Zeuthen and Cross tried to find a formula in order to predict the behavior of the other party in finding a rate of concession, in order to predict the likely outcome.

The process of negotiation therefore is considered to unfold between fixed points: starting point of discord, end point of convergence. The so-called security point, that is the result of optional withdrawal, is also taken into account.

An important feature of negotiation processes is the idea of turning points (TPs). A considerable amount of research has been devoted to analyses of TPs in single and comparative case studies as well as experiments. Considered as departures in the process, Druckman (2001, 2004) has proposed a three-part framework for analysis in which precipitating events precede (and cause) departures which have immediate and delayed consequences. Precipitating events can be external as when a mediator becomes involved, substantive as when a new idea is proposed, or procedural as when the formal plenary structure becomes divided into committees. Departures can be abrupt or relatively slow and consequences can be escalatory, moving away from agreement, or de-escalatory, moving in the direction of agreement. Using this framework in a comparative study of 34 cases, Druckman (2001) discovered that external events were needed to move talks on security or arms control toward agreement. However new ideas or changed procedures were more important for progress in trade or political negotiations. Different patterns were also found for interest-based, cognitive-based, and values-based conflicts (Druckman, 2005) and between domestic and international negotiations (Hall, 2012).  

Turning points are also analyzed in relation to negotiation crises or disruptions in the flow of the talks. Earlier research showed that TPs are more likely to occur in the context of crises, often in the form of changes that put the talks back on track and transition to a new stage (Druckman, 1986, 2001). A key to resolving crises is reframing the issues being discussed. The choice to reframe was shown to occur more frequently among negotiators when their trust is low and transaction costs are high (Druckman and Olekalns, 2013). The research to date on TPs has generated ideas likely to stimulate further studies. Some of these ideas include a search for the underlying mechanisms that can explain the emergence of TPs. Foremost among these are flexibility and adaptability in response to crises or violations of expected behavior.  The key challenge is to discover the conditions that foster progress toward a solution to the dilemma of balancing the desire to agree with the desire to come out favorably.  For a review of the research on turning points see Druckman and Olekalns (2013a).

==Integrative analysis==

Integrative analysis divides the process into successive stages, rather than talking about fixed points. It extends analysis to pre-negotiations stages, in which parties make first contacts. The outcome is explained as the performance of the actors at different stages.
Stages may include pre-negotiations, finding a formula of distribution, crest behavior, settlement

==Bad faith negotiation==
[[Bad faith]] is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.&lt;ref&gt;''"negotiating in bad faith"'', example of use of "bad faith" from definition in Oxford Online Dictionary, [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bad+faith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitas.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/bad-faith-negotiation/ "Bad Faith Negotiation", Union Voice]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inherent bad faith model in international relations and political psychology===
Bad faith in [[political science]] and [[political psychology]] refers to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of [[information processing]].&lt;ref&gt;example of use – ''"the Republicans accused the Democrats of '''negotiating in bad faith'''"'', Oxford Online Dictionary, [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bad+faith]&lt;/ref&gt;  The "[[inherent bad faith model]]" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]’ beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;The “Inherent Bad Faith Model” Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger, Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, Political Psychology, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.&lt;ref&gt;''“…the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one’s opponent..."'', ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1–2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt;  A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored.  They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness.  Examples are [[John Foster Dulles]]’ position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel’s initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;“…the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one’s opponent”, The handbook of social psychology, Volumes 1–2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oil for the Lamps of China''''' is a 1935 drama film starring [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] and [[Josephine Hutchinson]]. It is based on the [[Oil for the Lamps of China|novel of the same name]] by [[Alice Tisdale Hobart]]. A man blindly puts his faith in his employer. The film was loosely remade in 1941 as ''[[Law of the Tropics]]''.

==Plot==
Ambitious, idealistic Stephen Chase (Pat O'Brien) goes to work for the Atlantis Oil Company and is sent to a remote outpost in rural China run by "No. 1 Boss" (Arthur Byron). After a while, he feels secure enough to send for his fiancée and goes to [[Yokohama]] to meet and marry her. However, when he gets there, all that is waiting for him is a telegram, in which she explains she is unwilling to live in such a backward country.

He strikes up a conversation with Hester Adams (Josephine Hutchinson). She had come to see China for the first time with her father, a professor of Oriental studies, only to have him die on the voyage. As they become better acquainted, Stephen comes up with an idea (partly to save himself from losing [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]). He asks Hester to marry him, explaining that it would be a partnership. She is impressed by his dream of modernizing China and accepts. It does not take long however for them to fall in love.

No matter what happens, nothing shakes Stephen's faith in the company. When his friend, No. 1 Boss, is callously transferred to a lesser position, the old man commits suicide rather than accept the insult. The new boss, J.T. McCarger ([[Donald Crisp]]), orders Stephen to man an even more isolated post near Siberia. Stephen is reluctant to go since Hester is pregnant with their first child, but has no choice. Once there, he makes the agonized decision to go deal with a dangerous oil fire rather than stay and help the doctor deliver the baby. When he returns, he learns that the child is dead. This causes a temporary rift between him and his wife.

Things improve. Stephen is promoted and assigned to a large city in the south. The Chases becomes good friends with another couple, Don and Alice Wellman ([[John Eldredge (actor)|John Eldredge]] and [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]]). Don works for Stephen, but he is so contemptuous of the Chinese that two important clients refuse to renew their contracts unless he is fired. Stephen is torn, but does let Don go. Don's replacement is McCarger. Despite a prolonged drought and an outbreak of [[cholera]], Stephen ruthlessly collects payment from his customers, earning the best record of any branch in China.

Then, communists take over the city. An officer ([[Keye Luke]]) shows up at the company's offices and demands the gold stored in the safe. Stephen bargains with him and gets everyone except McCarger and himself evacuated to a ship by promising to give up the gold in a few hours. In the meantime, he sends for Ho ([[Tetsu Komai]]), a very well-connected Chinese customer and good friend, hoping he can use his influence. When Ho bravely shows up however, he is shot down in cold blood by the soldiers. Outraged, Stephen and McCarger take the gold and escape out the back door. McCarger is killed and Stephen wounded, but a passing boat rescues him and the gold.

In the hospital, he is visited by the new man in charge of the Orient for the company. Stephen is delighted to be offered the position of his assistant. However, when his boss outlines his plan to institute modern business practices, Stephen disagrees, explaining that, despite appearances, the "new" China is still run by the old ways. When he recovers, he is humiliated to learn that his job has been given to another man as a result. Further, he is given only menial tasks in an effort to get him to quit (and thus forfeit his pension). Hester gives Stephen's boss a tongue-lashing and reveals that her husband holds the patent for a lamp the company uses to popularize the use of its product. However, it is a call from the president of Atlantis, disturbed by the news that Stephen has been passed over for the job, that changes the man's mind. Stephen's shaken faith in the company is restored.

==Critical response==
Writing for ''The Spectator'' in 1935, [[Graham Greene]] described the conceit of the film as excellent, but lamented that "so interesting a theme should have been passed first through the mind of a good, sincere and sentimental woman and then through the mind of a perhaps less sincere but certainly not less sentimental Hollywood scenario-writer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|authorlink= Graham Greene|date= 15 November 1935|title= Last Love/Moscow Nights/Oil for the Lamps of China|url= |journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book |editor1-last= John Russel|editor1-first= Taylor |date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= |location= |publisher= |page= 36|isbn=0192812866}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Sada Abe was the seventh of eight children of Shigeyoshi and Katsu Abe, an [[upper middle-class]] family of [[tatami|tatami mat]] makers in Tokyo's [[Kanda, Tokyo|Kanda]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; Only four of the Abe children survived to adulthood, and of those, Sada was the youngest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's father, Shigeyoshi Abe, was originally from [[Chiba Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; He had been adopted into the Abe family to help with the business, which he eventually inherited.&lt;ref name="Johnston-20"/&gt; Aged 52 at the time of Sada's birth, Shigeyoshi Abe was described by police as "an honest and upright man" who had neither conspicuous vices nor any brushes with the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=20, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some acquaintances reported him to be somewhat self-centered, with a taste for extravagance. Sada's mother, Katsu Abe, likewise had no known legal or moral blemishes on her record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her brother Shintarō was known as a womanizer, and after his marriage, ran away with his parents' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=21, 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sada's sister Teruko was also known to have had several lovers. Her father sent her to work in a [[brothel]], then not an uncommon way to punish female sexual promiscuity in Japan, although he soon bought her back. Teruko's past was not considered a hindrance to marriage for those of the Abes' class at the time, and she soon married.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"&gt;{{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sada Abe was born in 1905.&lt;ref name="Johnston-25"/&gt; Her mother doted on Sada, who was her youngest surviving child, and allowed her to do as she wished.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; She encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the ''[[shamisen]]'', both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with [[geisha|geishas]] and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geishas were considered glamorous celebrities at the time,&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her musical lessons, and wearing stylish make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; As family problems over her siblings, sister Teruko and brother Shintarō, became more pressing, Abe was often sent out of the house alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, she was raped by one of her acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;Abe, Sada quoted in ''Second Interrogation of Abe Sada'' in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=169}} Chapter "Notes from the Police Interrogation of Abe Sada": ''While we were playing around on the second floor he forced himself into me.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abe, Sada quoted in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=45}}, Chapter 5. "Acquaintance Rape", ''.. in the summer of my fifteenth year because I was raped by a student at a friend's house&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents initially defended and supported her, but she became a difficult teenager.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; As she became more irresponsible and uncontrollable, her parents sold her to a geisha house in [[Yokohama]] in 1922, hoping to find her a place in society with some direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=58}}, {{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toku Abe, Sada's oldest sister, testified that Sada wished to become a geisha. Sada herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe's encounter with the geisha world proved to be a frustrating and disappointing one. To become a true star among geisha required apprenticeship from childhood with years spent training and studying arts and music. Abe never progressed beyond a low rank, at which one of her main duties was to provide sex for clients. She worked for five years in this capacity, and eventually contracted [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Since this meant she would be required to undergo regular physical examinations, as would a legally licensed prostitute, Abe decided to enter that better-paying profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=66-67}}, {{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 1930s==
[[File:TAISHO-ROU 大正楼、阿部定が最後に勤めた遊郭、P9200158.JPG|thumb|alt=|The brothel where Abe was arrested]]
Abe began work as a prostitute in [[Osaka]]'s famous [[Tobita Shinchi|Tobita brothel district]], but soon gained a reputation as a trouble-maker. She stole money from clients, and attempted to leave the brothel several times, but was soon tracked down by the well-organized legal prostitution system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=67-71}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years, she eventually succeeded in escaping the licensed prostitution system, and began working as a waitress. However, not satisfied with the wages, she was soon working as a prostitute again, though now unlicensed, and began working in the unlicensed brothels of Osaka in 1932. Abe's mother died in January 1933, and Abe traveled to Tokyo to visit her father, and her mother's grave. She entered into the prostitution market in Tokyo and while there became a mistress for the first time. When her father became gravely ill in January 1934, Abe nursed him for ten days until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=72–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1934 Abe was arrested in a police raid on the unlicensed brothel at which she was working at the time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long&amp;nbsp;... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;Deposition by Kasahara Kinnosuke in {{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=165-166}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for [[Nagoya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nagoya in 1935, and again intending to leave the sex industry, Abe began working as a maid at a restaurant. She soon became romantically involved with a customer at the restaurant, Gorō Ōmiya, a professor and banker who aspired to become a member of the [[Diet of Japan]] (Japanese parliament). Knowing that the restaurant would not tolerate a maid having sexual relations with clients, and having become bored with Nagoya, she returned to Tokyo in June. Ōmiya met Abe in Tokyo, and, finding that she had in the past contracted syphilis, paid for her stay at a hot springs resort in [[Kusatsu, Gunma|Kusatsu]] from November until January 1936. In January, Ōmiya suggested that Abe could become financially independent by opening a small restaurant, and recommended that she should start working as an apprentice in the restaurant business.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=78–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquaintance with Kichizō Ishida==
Back in Tokyo, Abe began work as an apprentice at the Yoshidaya restaurant on February 1, 1936. The owner of this establishment, Kichizō Ishida, 42 at the time, had worked his way up in business, starting as an apprentice at a restaurant specializing in eel dishes. He had opened the Yoshidaya in Tokyo's [[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]] neighborhood in 1920.&lt;ref name="Johnston-11"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abe joined his restaurant, Ishida had become known as a womanizer who by that time did little in the way of actually running the restaurant, which had become in fact managed primarily by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous advances towards her. Ōmiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, and she gave in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant to the accompaniment of a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936, Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or ''machiai''—the contemporary equivalent of a [[love hotel]]&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in the [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] neighborhood. Planning only for a short "fling", the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of [[Futako Tamagawa]] where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve [[sake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=84–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Ishida, Abe later said, "It is hard to say exactly what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=92, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their two-week encounter ended, Abe became agitated and began drinking excessively. She said that with Ishida she had come to know true love for the first time in her life, and the thought of Ishida being back with his wife made her intensely jealous. Just over a week before Ishida's eventual death, Abe began to contemplate his murder. On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, 1936, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, "I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers. You bastard, I'll kill you for that.' Ishida was startled and drew away a little, but he seemed delighted with it all&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=95–99, 192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Abe Sada Incident"==
[[File:Sada Abe.jpg|thumb|Newspaper photo taken shortly after Abe's arrest, at Takanawa Police Station, Tokyo on May 20, 1936]]
[[File:The scene of the Abe Sada Incident.JPG|thumb|Site of the "Abe Sada Incident"]]
Ishida and Abe returned to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife to the base of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her ''[[Obi (sash)|obi]]'' sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during [[orgasm]], and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a [[sedative]] called [[Bromisoval|Calmotin]] to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you&amp;nbsp;... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=99–102, 164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the morning of May 18, 1936, as Ishida was asleep, Abe wrapped her sash twice around his neck and strangled him to death. She later told police, "After I had killed Ishida I felt totally at ease, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from my shoulders, and I felt a sense of clarity." After lying with Ishida's body for a few hours, she next severed his genitalia with the kitchen knife, wrapped them in a magazine cover, and kept them until her arrest three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=102–103, 200–201, 206, {{harvnb|Honjo}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the blood she wrote {{nihongo||定、石田の吉二人キリ|''Sada, Ishida no Kichi Futari-kiri''|"We, Sada and Kichi(zō) Ishida, are alone"}} on Ishida's left [[thigh]], and on a bed sheet. She then carved {{lang|ja|定}} ("Sada", the [[kanji|character]] for her name) into his left arm. After putting on Ishida's underwear, she left the inn at about 8&amp;nbsp;a.m., telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-186"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After leaving the inn, Abe met her former lover Gorō Ōmiya. She repeatedly apologized to him, but Ōmiya, unaware of the murder, assumed that she was apologizing for having taken another lover. In actuality, Abe's apologies were for the damage to his political career that she knew his association with her was bound to cause. After Ishida's body was discovered, a search was launched for Abe, who had gone missing. On May 19, 1936, the newspapers picked up the story. Ōmiya's career was ruined, and Abe's life was under intense public scrutiny from that point onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abe Sada panic==
The circumstances of the death of Ishida immediately caused a national sensation. The ensuing frenzy over the search for Abe was called "Abe Sada panic".&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Police received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a stampede in the [[Ginza]], resulting in a large traffic jam.&lt;ref name="Johnston-11"/&gt; In a reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo, the [[February 26 Incident|Ni Ni-Roku Incident]] ("2–26" or "February 26"), the crime was satirically dubbed the "Go Ichi-Hachi" Incident ("5–18" or "May 18").&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"/&gt;

On May 19, 1936, Abe went shopping and saw a movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in [[Shinagawa]] on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Ōmiya, a friend, and Ishida.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-186"/&gt; She planned to commit suicide one week after the murder, and practiced [[necrophilia]]. "I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me&amp;nbsp;... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on [[Mount Ikoma]] while holding on to his penis."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:00 in the afternoon, police detectives, suspicious of the alias under which Abe had registered, came to her room. "Don't be so formal", she told them, "You're looking for Sada Abe, right? Well that's me. I am Sada Abe." When the police were not convinced, she displayed Ishida's genitalia as proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe was arrested and interrogated over eight sessions.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-187"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interrogating officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way."&lt;ref name="Johnston-124"/&gt; Her answer was: "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan,{{cn|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;A book, ''19 nin no Abe Sada'' (''19 Abe Sadas''), detailing similar cases, was published in 1981; and Schreiber, "O-Sada Serves a Grateful Nation" mentions at least 53 cases of women severing male genitalia since the Abe case.&lt;/ref&gt; William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred at a time when the Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the [[February 26 Incident|''Ni-Ni-Roku'' incident]] and a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|looming full-scale war in China]]. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-184"/&gt; The incident also struck a chord with the ''[[ero guro|ero-guro-nansensu]]'' ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the details of the crime were made public, rumors began to circulate that Ishida's penis was of extraordinary size; however, the police officer who interrogated Abe after her arrest denied this, saying, "Ishida's was just average. [Abe] told me, 'Size doesn't make a man in bed. Technique and his desire to please me were what I liked about Ishida.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Johnston-124"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her arrest, Ishida's penis and testicles were moved to [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo University]] Medical School's pathology museum. They were put on public display soon after the end of [[World War II]], but have since disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=190}}, {{harvnb|Honjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction and sentencing==
The first day of Abe's trial was November 25, 1936, and by 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. crowds were already gathering to attend.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"/&gt; The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details involved in the case, yet made sure that the trial was held with the utmost seriousness.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; Abe's statement before receiving sentencing began, "The thing I regret most about this incident is that I have come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert&amp;nbsp;... There had never been a man in my life like Ishida. There were men I liked, and with whom I slept without accepting money, but none made me feel the way I did toward him."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 1936, Abe was convicted of murder in the second degree and mutilation of a corpse. Though the prosecution demanded ten years, and Abe claimed that she desired the death penalty, she was in fact sentenced to just six years in prison.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-188"/&gt; She was confined in Tochigi women's penitentiary, where she was prisoner No. 11.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] on November 10, 1940, on the occasion of the 2,600th anniversary celebrations of the mythical founding of Japan, when [[Emperor Jimmu]] came to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released, exactly five years after the murder, on May 17, 1941.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt;

The police record of Abe's interrogation and confession became a national best-seller in 1936. Christine L. Marran puts the national fascination with Abe's story within the context of the {{nihongo|''dokufu''|毒婦}} or "poison woman" stereotype, a transgressive female character type that had first become popular in Japanese serialized novels and stage works in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the popular "poison woman" literature, confessional autobiographies by female criminals had begun appearing in the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1910s, autobiographical writings by criminal women took on an unapologetic tone and sometimes included criticisms of Japan and Japanese society. [[Kanno Suga]], who was hanged in 1911 for conspiring to assassinate [[Emperor Meiji]] in what was known as the [[High Treason Incident]], wrote openly rebellious essays while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fumiko Kaneko]], who was sentenced to death for plotting to bomb the imperial family, used her notoriety to speak against the imperial system and the racism and paternalism that she said it engendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's confession, in the years since its appearance, became the most circulated female criminal narrative in Japan. Marran points out that Abe, unlike previous criminal autobiographers, stressed her sexuality and the love she felt for her victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Upon release from prison, Abe assumed an [[pseudonym|alias]]. &lt;!--what years?--&gt;As the mistress of a "serious man" she referred to in her memoirs as "Y", she moved first to [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] and then to [[Saitama Prefecture]]. When Abe's true identity became known to Y's friends and family, she broke off their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=148-150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[World War II]], wishing to divert public attention from politics and criticism of the occupying authorities, the [[Shigeru Yoshida|Yoshida]] government encouraged a "3-S" policy—"sports, screen, and sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLelland|2012|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-war writings, such as ''The Psychological Diagnosis of Abe Sada'' (1937) depict Abe as an example of the dangers of unbridled female sexuality and as a threat to the patriarchal system. In the postwar era, she was treated as a critic of totalitarianism, and a symbol of freedom from oppressive political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=136, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe became a popular subject in literature of both high and low quality. The ''[[buraiha]]'' writer [[Sakunosuke Oda|Oda Sakunosuke]] wrote two stories based on Abe,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a June 1949 article noted that Abe had recently tried to clear her name after it had been used in a "mountain" of erotic books.&lt;ref name="Marran 2007, p. 140-141"&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 the writer [[Ango Sakaguchi]] interviewed Abe, treating her as an authority on both sexuality and freedom. Sakaguchi called Abe a "tender, warm figure of salvation for future generations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marran|2007|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 Ichiro Kimura's ''The Erotic Confessions of Abe Sada'' became a national best-seller, with over 100,000 copies sold.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt; The book was in the form of an interview with Sada Abe, but was actually based on the police interrogation records. As a response to this book, Abe wrote her own autobiography, ''Memoirs of Abe Sada'', which was published in 1948. In contrast to Kimura's depiction of her as a pervert, she stressed her love for Ishida.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the magazine {{nihongo|''True Story''|実話|Jitsuwa}}, in January 1948, featured previously unpublished photos of the incident with the headline "[[Ero guro|Ero-guro]] of the Century! First Public Release. Pictorial of the Abe Sada Incident." Reflecting the change in tone in writings on Abe, the June 1949 issue of ''Monthly Reader'' calls her a "Heroine of That Time", for following her own desires in a time of "false morality" and oppression.&lt;ref name="Marran 2007, p. 140-141"/&gt;

Abe capitalized on her notoriety by sitting for an interview in a popular magazine,&lt;ref name="Schreiber-189"/&gt; and appearing for several years starting in 1947 in a traveling one-act stage production called ''Shōwa Ichidai Onna'' (''A Woman of the Shōwa Period'') under the direction of dramatist [[Nagata Mikihiko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 she began working at the Hoshikikusui,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2005|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; a working-class pub in Inari-chō in downtown Tokyo. She lived a low-profile life in Tokyo's Shitaya neighborhood for the next 20 years, and her neighborhood restaurant association gave her a "model employee" award.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"&gt;{{harvnb|Schreiber|2001|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than once, during the 1960s, film-critic [[Donald Richie]] visited the Hoshikikusui. In his collection of profiles, ''Japanese Portraits'', he describes Abe making a dramatic entrance into a boisterous group of drinkers. She would slowly descend a long staircase that led into the middle of the crowd, fixing a haughty gaze on individuals in her audience. The men in the pub would respond by putting their hands over their crotches, and shouting out things like, "Hide the knives!" and "I'm afraid to go and pee!" Abe would slap the banister in anger and stare the crowd into an uncomfortable and complete silence, and only then continue her entrance, chatting and pouring drinks from table to table. Richie comments, "...&amp;nbsp;she had actually choked a man to death and then cut off his member. There was a consequent frisson when Sada Abe slapped your back."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richie|1987|pp=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Abe appeared in the "Sada Abe Incident" section of director [[Teruo Ishii]]'s dramatized documentary {{nihongo|''History of Bizarre Crimes by Women in the Meiji Taishō and Shōwa Eras''|明治大正昭和　猟奇女犯罪史|Meiji Taishō Shōwa Ryōki Onna Hanzaishi}},&lt;ref name="Ishii-JMDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1969/cs002880.htm |script-title=ja:明治大正昭和　猟奇女犯罪史 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrEjlO7r?url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1969/cs002880.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last known photograph of Abe was taken in August of that year.&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1969 picture of Abe, age 64, seated next to a tense male dancer can be seen at: {{cite web |url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/%7Emd5s-kzo/abesada.html |title=SADA ABE 阿部定 |accessdate=2007-07-28 |language=Japanese |publisher=asahi-net.or.jp |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrElM1tu?url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/ |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She disappeared from the public eye in 1970.&lt;ref name="cruelest-cut"/&gt; When the film ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' was being planned in the mid-1970s, director [[Nagisa Oshima]] apparently sought out Abe and, after a long search, found her, her hair shorn, in a [[Kansai]] nunnery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richie|1987|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Decades after both the incident and her disappearance, Sada Abe continues to draw public interest. In addition to the documentary in which Abe herself appeared shortly before she disappeared from the public eye, and the 1976 Japanese-language ''In the Realm of the Senses'', at least three successful films have been made based on the story. The 1983 film, ''Sexy Doll: Abe Sada Sansei'', made use of Abe's name in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287688/ |title=Sexy doll: Abe Sada sansei |accessdate=2007-07-28 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrElpv0h?url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287688/ |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a 438-page biography of Abe was published in Japan,&lt;ref name="Schreiber-190"/&gt; and the first full-length book on Abe in English, William Johnston's ''Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan'', was published in 2005.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Japanese [[Noise music]]ian [[Merzbow]] adopted the alias Abe Sada for an early musical project. He released only one record under this name, the 1994 7" ''[[Original Body Kingdom/Gala Abe Sada 1936]]''.&lt;ref name=Discogs-Abe-Sada&gt;{{cite web|title=Abe Sada-Original Body Kingdom / Gala Abe Sada 1936|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/359309|work=Discogs Abe Sada discography|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, a four-bass [[noise rock|noise]] band from [[Perth, Western Australia]], named Abe Sada won a Contemporary Music Grant from the Australian Department of Culture and the Arts to tour Japan in June and July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928100148/http://www.dca.wa.gov.au/ContemporaryMusicGrantResults.asp|archivedate=2007-09-28|url=http://www.dca.wa.gov.au/ContemporaryMusicGrantResults.asp|title=Contemporary Music Grant Results|accessdate=2006-06-02|publisher=Department of Culture and the Arts, Government of Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoine Ashley''' (December 17, 1984{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} – October 1, 2012), better known by the name '''Sahara Davenport''', was an [[United States|American]] [[drag queen]], singer, [[reality television]] personality, and classically trained [[dancer]]. Davenport was best known as a contestant on the [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''.&lt;ref&gt;LOGO On-line. http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_2/series.jhtml#!&lt;/ref&gt;

==''RuPaul's Drag Race''==
Davenport joined the cast of the second season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' in 2010. She was pegged as "The Dancer" when in the first episode she had to "[[lip-sync]] for your life" against her former college classmate, [[Shangela Laquifa Wadley]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Richard. Gawker. http://gawker.com/5462382/rupauls-drag-race-wigs-in-the-wind&lt;/ref&gt; In the second episode, Davenport became a team leader when she and [[Pandora Boxx]] won the mini challenge.

Targeted at "[[middle class|the middle class]]", ''TV Park'' is one of Russia's leading weeklies: as of 2010, it was the 3rd most popular magazine in [[Moscow]], 10th in [[Saint Petersburg]], and nationally in 9th place overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-atlas.ru/items/?id=15184&amp;cat=companynews|script-title=ru:Изменения в журнале «ТВ парк»|publisher=Media Atlas|language=Russian|accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bureau: XCOM Declassified''''' is a science fiction video game in the ''[[X-COM]]'' series, developed by [[2K Marin]] and was released by [[2K Games]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] on August 20, 2013 in North America. It was released for [[Mac OS|Mac]] on November 27, 2013 by Transgaming. The game had been in development under different titles by three different studios since 2006. It was unveiled as a [[first-person shooter]] titled ''XCOM'' in June 2010 and was repeatedly delayed until its release. In April 2013, the game was rebranded as ''The Bureau: XCOM Declassified''. In its final version, it became a third-person [[tactical shooter]] with [[strategy video game]] elements.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Bureau XCOM Declassified screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|The game's Battle Focus Mode]]

''The Bureau'' is a [[third-person shooter]] with an emphasis on squad-based tactics. The player controls the agent William Carter and commands two additional agents in each mission. Carter has several unique abilities, such as healing his entire squad, lifting enemies out of cover, and summoning [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|combat drones]]. The other agents are divided into four classes: Commando, Engineer, Support, and Recon. Each class is proficient in a different set of powers and weapon types. For example, the Commando class is specialized in offensive abilities and [[rifle]]s, while the Engineer class relies on [[land mine]]s, [[Sentry gun|automatic turrets]], and the use of [[shotgun]]s. As Carter and his squad gain more experience points during missions, more abilities become available.

By entering "Battle Focus Mode", which slows time significantly, the player can order their agents to move to tactical positions and activate class-specific abilities. Agents have customizable outfits, weapons, equipment, and abilities. As in ''[[XCOM: Enemy Unknown]]'', if Carter is unable to revive agents who have taken too much damage, they will die (variable difficulty levels also determine whether or not it is possible for downed agents to become battle-ready when revived, or if replacement agents will appear during a mission). The agents who die will be dead for the rest of the game.

Throughout the course of the game, the player can collect backpack schematics and alien weapons, which then become available for the entire squad. Each backpack provides a unique bonus to the agent wearing it. For example, the Sharpshooter Pack provides bonus head-shot damage, and the Guardian Pack reduces damage taken from attacks. These equipments can be altered before a mission, or at Resupply Stations located in each mission.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
The game is set in late 1962, at the height of the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]]. Prior to the events of the game, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] authorized the creation of the Bureau of Strategic Emergency Command, which was intended to coordinate [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military forces]] in the event of a Soviet invasion of the USA. A top-secret underground command bunker was constructed to house the Bureau, and specific military and civilian personnel were secretly contacted and told to report there in the event of an invasion. The Bureau's director, Myron Faulke, had another vision for his organization: a bulwark against attacks from "Outsiders", hostile [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial forces]] whom he believed had been operating on Earth for the past six months and had some connection to the recently discovered "super-element" Elerium. As the game begins, [[CIA]] [[special agent]] William Carter is tasked with delivering an important package to Faulke at the Bureau's research labs at [[Groom Range]].

===Plot===
Waiting in a room at the Groom Range facility for Director Faulke's summons, William Carter meets a military officer who informs him that she is to escort him to Faulke to deliver a briefcase. When a wary Carter refuses, a black fluid discharges from the officer's eyes, revealing her to be "infected"; she then shoots Carter and opens the case. It emits a blinding light which incinerates the officer and stuns Carter. Moments later, Carter awakens to find his gunshot wound inexplicably healed and the case destroyed as the base comes under attack. Carter attempts to rescue Faulke as the attackers, identified as "Outsiders" by Bureau agents whom Carter encounters, easily slaughter the base's garrison. He eventually finds Faulke, but is too late to save the VIP officials [[J. Edgar Hoover]], CIA Director Frost, and General Deems, the latter of whom had become infected (in the same manner as the female officer) and killed the other officials. Carter escapes the Groom Range facility by tram just as Outsider devices cause the mountain to implode, and stalls the Outsider pursuit by detonating a powerful Elerium bomb while he and Faulke flee via Skyranger helicopter.

At the Bureau's command bunker, Faulke announces that communications worldwide have been jammed and other U.S. military bases have been destroyed in similar attacks. With no way to contact the [[White House]] and other American military leaders, Faulke formally activates the Bureau (now renamed XCOM) and assumes control of the country's remaining military forces to counter the Outsider threat, while Bureau operatives planted in major cities downplay the attacks as safety drills to keep the civilian populace from panicking.

Over the following weeks, Carter leads teams of agents across the country to retrieve important personnel, defend strategic sites, and recover what alien technology they can for research. Gradually, the Bureau pieces together the Outsiders' motive: to conquer the Earth and terraform it into a new homeworld, simultaneously enslaving humanity. The interrogation of an Outsider Infiltrator reveals that their species is commanded by an entity known as Origin through a psionic network called Mosaic. Carter's team travels through a "Venn Portal" to their homeworld using the Avenger, a [[flying saucer]] XCOM has developed. There, Carter discovers that Mosaic is powered by an enslaved Ethereal, a being of pure energy with immense psionic power. The Outsiders have been searching for a dormant Ethereal on Earth, which is revealed to have been inside of Carter's briefcase from the game's opening and now inhabits his body. He manages to capture Origin's Ethereal, detonates a bomb at Mosaic's entry point and returns to Earth.

At XCOM's base, the captured Ethereal, Shamash, psionically contacts the Ethereal inside of Carter, Asaru. It becomes apparent that the player has actually been playing as Asaru, who has in turn been psionically controlling William Carter, though its recently awakened state caused it to believe it truly was human. Shamash claims that because both the Outsiders and humans have learned how to capture Ethereal, they must be destroyed so that a force like Mosaic will never be rebuilt. Upon hearing this, Carter manages to temporarily break free of Asaru and kills Shamash. XCOM's base is discovered by the Outsiders, and Carter attempts to defend it, while actively attempting to break free from Asaru's control. Carter manages to plant an explosive device with a thirty-second timer, believing that the Ethereal will never truly allow him to be free.

There are four endings depending on choices made at this point. If Asaru refuses to relinquish control of Carter, the bomb will go off, killing both of them.

Alternatively, Asaru can release Carter, but only to willingly merge with either Dr. Weir, Agent Weaver, or Director Faulke. The new host will knock Carter unconscious and the remaining agents will abandon the base. They discover that Origin still exists within what remains of the Mosaic network, and has transported itself to Earth's orbit in order to command the Outsiders stranded on the planet. The crew of the Avenger mounts their final attack against Origin's ship, with Asaru providing the new host with the powers it had given Carter. During the mission, one of the other two host options must be sacrificed while the other is rescued, and Carter, who believes that Asaru is no different from the Outsiders, must be either executed or incarcerated. Eventually, Asaru's host discovers a secondary entry point for Mosaic and psionically integrates with the network, destroying Origin and its influence over the Outsiders.

The aftermath of the Outsider invasion is revealed in the form of a debriefing of Asaru's host:
*If Weir merges with Asaru, he persuades the Outsiders to cease attacking and help rebuild before departing amiably to continue their search for a homeworld; Outsider technology is carefully disassembled and stored away, sites of Outsider attacks are quietly erased from the National Register or explained away as natural disasters, and surviving Sleepwalkers are cured.
*If Weaver merges, she forces the Outsiders to kill each other; all Outsider technology and evidence of their attacks is destroyed, in some cases with nuclear weapons, and the Sleepwalkers are euthanized.
*If Faulke merges, he commands the Outsiders to stand down and rebuild before being exterminated; some Outsider technology is preserved and provides considerable scientific and military advances, sites of Outsider attacks are erased, and the Sleepwalkers are treated, but unable to be cured.

In any case, the Outsider invasion is successfully covered up, with only the members of XCOM and a handful of top U.S. and other world leaders aware of how close the human race came to extinction.

The debriefing concludes with a description of how Asaru eventually severs contact with its host and departs after the Outsiders are dealt with, and its intentions remain unknown. At this point, the musical score segues into a theme from ''XCOM: Enemy Unknown''.

==Development==
In early 2006, [[Irrational Games]] was purchased by publisher [[Take-Two Interactive]], who had also acquired the ''[[X-COM]]'' [[Intellectual property|IP]] from [[Atari]] the year before. Shortly after, two Irrational studios in [[Boston]] (later renamed [[2K Boston]]) and [[Canberra]] (later renamed [[2K Australia]]) began conceptualization of a new game in the series.&lt;ref name="polygonreport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/19/4614410/xcom-the-bureau-development-2006-2013 |title=The many faces of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified: from 2006 to 2013 |author=Chris Plante |publisher=Polygon |date=August 19, 2013 |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video gaming press picked up multiple hints on the development throughout the period leading up to the official reveal in 2010. In May 2006, Irrational Games announced they were hiring for a work "On the sequel to one of the best loved PC franchises of all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Florian Eckhardt |url=http://kotaku.com/176971/irrational-hiring-for-pretty-please-system-shock-3 |title=Irrational Hiring For (Pretty Please) System Shock 3? |publisher=Kotaku |date=May 30, 2006 |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2007, there were unconfirmed rumors about a new ''X-COM'' game being developed by Irrational Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yurik |first=Poor |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/45797/irrational-games-developing-x-com |title="Irrational Games Developing X-COM Title?" article |publisher=Shacknews |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several concept pitches were created early on in the development. One was of a tactical strategy sequel to the original series that would be built on an upgraded ''[[Freedom Force (2002 video game)|Freedom Force]]'' engine. Another cast the player in the role of a human resistance leader in a post-invasion scenario,&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt; featuring highly stylized, cartoonish character models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benshore.com/Image_XComRebelGirl.htm |title=XCOM Rebel Girl – Ben Shore's Portfolio |publisher=Benshore.com |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One pitch, in which the player would be based on a hijacked alien craft, was even made into a full demo that was supposed to be shown at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], but never was. However, much of the studios' resources were focused on the development of ''[[BioShock]]'' and on supporting [[BioShock 2|the sequel's]] development, which was handled by an ex-Irrational studio [[2K Marin]] in [[California]], so the pre-production progressed very slowly.&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt; The aforementioned concepts involving a post-invasion scenario and hijacked alien craft would eventually see implementation into ''[[XCOM 2]]'', developed by Firaxis Games as a sequel to ''XCOM: Enemy Unknown''.

Upon the completion of ''[[BioShock 2]]'' in early 2010, the Canberra studio pitched a concept of the ''X-COM'' game as "the [[UFO: Enemy Unknown|original ''X-COM'']] meets ''[[The X-Files]]'', set in the 1950s to 1960s."&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt; The game was decided to be to a [[first-person shooter]] set in the 1950s and combining missions on the field with  base management; an important part of the game would be taking photographs on the field for research. This green-lighted pitch was originally titled ''X-COM: Enemy Unknown'' (not to be confused with [[UFO: Enemy Unknown|the original ''X-COM'' game]] as well as [[XCOM: Enemy Unknown|the later game of the same name]]) and featured mysterious aliens taking abstract forms such as globs of black goo and levitating geometrical shapes, in addition to masquerading as humans in a manner reminiscent of the 1956 film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''. A [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode was also in development, described as similar in concept to the ''[[Aliens versus Predator (video game)|Aliens vs. Predator]]'' game series, but it was later scrapped altogether.&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt;

The game was officially announced on April 14, 2010, titled simply ''XCOM''. In development for the Xbox 360 and PC, it was described as a "re-imagining of one of gaming's most storied and beloved franchises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.take2games.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86428&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1412708&amp;highlight= |title=2K Games Announces XCOM(R) - Suspense and Mystery-Filled First-Person Shooter from Creators of BioShock(R) 2 |author= |publisher=2K Games |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-game footage was first shown at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010|E3 2010]] in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/109/1096051p1.html |title=E3 2010: XCOM Preview – PC Preview at IGN |publisher=Uk.pc.ign.com |date=June 10, 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later retrospectively described as a [[survival horror]] title, "like a ''[[Silent Hill]]'' sort of game, where it's sort of the cerebral horror versus the run and gun horror game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/videos/2013/05/10/the-evolution-of-the-bureau-xcom-declassified |title=The Evolution of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified – Road to E3 Inside Look – IGN Video |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=May 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding a move away from the strategy genre, 2K Games president Christoph Hartmann said at the time "[[strategy game]]s are just not contemporary,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dring |first=Christopher |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/interview-christophhartmann-2kgames/082216 |title=INTERVIEW: Christoph Hartmann, 2K Games &amp;#124; Games industry news &amp;#124; MCV |publisher=Mcvuk.com |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the developers later assured they would keep elements from the original game, such as squad and base management, free-form non-linear mission progression, and squad-based tactical combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/5987/putting_the_xcom_in_xcom.php |title=Features – Putting the XCOM in XCOM |publisher=Gamasutra |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''XCOM'' was originally announced to arrive in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramirez |first=Noe |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/01/09/first-screens-and-details-of-xcom-enemy-unknown.aspx |title=First Screens And Details Of XCOM: Enemy Unknown – Features |publisher=GameInformer.com |date=January 9, 2012 |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then got repeatedly delayed.

Already prior to the game's E3 2010 debut, the developers began experiencing various difficulties both creatively and technically.&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt; Earlier in the year, 2K publishing had assigned a large portion of 2K Marin to assist 2K Australia in developing the game, and soon the two studios were merged under the name "2K Marin". The Australian branch worked on the single-player component while the California branch was assigned the multiplayer mode (described as resembling ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' and ultimately scrapped). However, the two "2K Marin" studios in California and Australia were slowed down by communication issues, and they found it difficult to implement the [[stealth game]]play and the themes of mystery and field research.&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt; The Australian studio also lost several key members, with the game's original lead designer Ed Orman and art director Andrew James leaving 2K Marin to form Uppercut Games in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=July 11, 11 |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/16852-xcom-lead-designer-art-director-leave-2k-marin/ |title=XCOM lead designer &amp; art director leave 2K Marin |publisher=Neoseeker |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McElroy |first=Justin |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/07/11/former-xcom-leads-form-uppercut-games-unveil-epoch/ |title=Former XCOM leads form Uppercut Games, unveil Epoch |publisher=Joystiq |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American branch gradually took upon a leading role, having been forced to abandon development of their own new IP and to finish up what was supposed to be a quick release of ''X-COM''.&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt;

{{quote box|quote=Candidly, it just wasn't ''[[X-COM]]'' enough for the hardcore fans of the original games at [[2K Marin]], who serve as our creative conscience.

Following widespread criticism of the original project from ''X-COM'' fan community and parts of the media, as well as the problems with developing the game, ''XCOM'' got thoroughly revamped by 2011, evolving into a linear [[tactical shooter]] (with no randomized missions and no stealth and detective gameplay elements, but with more control over other agents) seen from a third-person view (the [[E3 2011]] demo version showed a first-person shooter gameplay nevertheless).&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt; The setting was also changed, including an introduction of humanoid enemies and the timeline being pushed forward from the 1950s to 1962 in order to explore cultural tensions of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gaygamer.net/2011/06/e3_11_interview_jordan_thomas.html |title=E3 '11: Interview: Jordan Thomas On XCOM And Homosexuality |publisher=GayGamer.net |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028095115/http://gaygamer.net/2011/06/e3_11_interview_jordan_thomas.html |archivedate=October 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5812460/the-struggles-of-a-gay-xcom-scientist |title=The Struggles of a Gay XCOM Scientist |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=June 16, 2011 |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player could now enter a tactical-view mode, during which the game paused for a while, to "use [[time units]] to order the two agents traveling with him on the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/06/24/why-did-2k-games-turn-xcom-into-a-fps-tactical-game-hybrid/ |title=Why Did 2K Games Turn XCOM Into A FPS-Tactical Game Hybrid? |publisher=Siliconera |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[GameSpy]], "the core aspects of the game are about working with a team of agents who have a variety of classes that you can customize, to have certain abilities that assist you on missions (think [[Party (role playing games)|RPG party]] building)," using "[[experience point]]s where you can level them up or upgrade them along different paths." The player was also offered to choose the missions from a variety of choices, "each offering different strategic options."&lt;ref name=1up&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Mike |url=http://www.1up.com/previews/e3-xcom-preview |title=XCOM Preview for PC, 360 from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711084048/http://www.1up.com/previews/e3-xcom-preview |archivedate=July 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the game's narrative Jordan Thomas left the ''XCOM'' team, asked by [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] to help 2K Boston finish ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', while 2K Australia has regained its name and was also reassigned to a support work on ''Infinite''. Zak McClendon, the lead designer of ''BioShock 2'', became the lead designer for the struggling ''XCOM'' project.&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt; Following the success of ''XCOM: Enemy Unknown'', developed by [[Firaxis Games]] and released by 2K Games in October 2012, 2K Games decided to have both of the ''XCOM'' games related more closely to each other, including sharing some of the alien species such as the series' iconic Sectoids.&lt;ref name="polygonreport"/&gt; Meanwhile, no new materials related to the game were officially released since the showing at E3 2011. In late 2012, the game was rumored by [[Kotaku]] to be "coming back as a [[third-person shooter]]. While the 1960s setting and general ''XCOM'' prequel vibe remains, it's now apparently being pitched as a squad-based game similar to ''[[SOCOM (series)|SOCOM]]'' or ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando|Republic Commando]]''" and "is being developed by the same people who created ''BioShock 2''." According to the rumor, which was accompanied by several leaked screenshots and repeated by many other publications, the game would be released only for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and possibly as a $30 downloadable title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5947737/the-other-xcom-game-might-now-be-a-third+person-shooter |title=The Other XCOM Game Might Now Be a Third-Person Shooter |publisher=Kotaku |date=September 30, 2012 |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clear}}

In April 2013, the game's official website xcom.com/xcom was deleted without any official explanation, while all videos relating to it suddenly disappeared from 2K Games' official [[YouTube]] channel as well. One month earlier, 2K Games had registered the Internet domains thebureau-game.com, thebureau-game.net, whathappenedin62.com, and whathappenedin62.net, indicating that the game might return with a new title, possibly as ''The Bureau''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Adam |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xcom-shooter-website-official-trailers-disappear-but-what-does-it-all-mean/ |title=Something is going on with the XCOM shooter... |publisher=Digital Trends |date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/52330/has-the-xcom-fps-become-the-bureau/ |title=Xbox 360 News: Has the XCOM FPS become 'The Bureau'? – Xbox 360 – The Official Magazine |publisher=Oxm.co.uk |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; VideoGamer.com received a package containing a dossier labeled "Burn After Opening", containing materials confirming a link between ''XCOM'' and the name "The Bureau".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/news/is_2k_about_to_re-announce_xcom.html |title=Is 2K about to re-announce XCOM? – XCOM for Xbox 360 News |publisher=VideoGamer.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameZone's analysis of a viral teaser video "What Happened in 62" predicted that the redesigned ''XCOM'' would reappear on April 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liebl |first=Matt |url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/2013/04/23/teaser-suggests-a-reveal-for-2k-s-xcom-shooter-possibly-the-bureau-could-come-this-week |title=Teaser suggests a reveal for 2K's XCOM shooter,... |publisher=GameZone |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 24, 2013, 2K posted an announcement titled "2K Marin's [redacted] is coming soon":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2kgames.com/blog/2k-marin-s-redacted-is-coming-soon |title=BLOG – 2K MARIN'S IS COMING SOON |publisher=2K Games |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''XCOM'' universe is expanding. In the coming days the world will get a fresh look at the long-awaited squad-based tactical shooter in development at 2K Marin. Announced back in 2010, the game has undergone an evolution since we last showed it to you at E3 2011. Firaxis' critically acclaimed turn-based strategy title, ''XCOM: Enemy Unknown'', has reignited the classic franchise and we feel that the time is right to deliver a new experience within the world of ''XCOM''. The creative development of this game has been a collaborative process of discovery and iteration. 2K's culture allows our studios the freedom to refine their visions, to explore new ideas, and to deliver the best possible experiences for players. Through this exploration, 2K Marin has refined their vision, and as a result the game has evolved into a high-stakes narrative experience imbued with core ''XCOM'' concepts. The wait is nearly over and we can't wait to share more details with you about the game in only a matter of days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Bureau: XCOM Declassified'' was officially unveiled as a full-priced title along with a live-action trailer on April 26, with a planned release date of August 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/04/26/the-bureau-xcom-declassified-detailed-and-described.aspx |title=The Bureau: XCOM Declassified Detailed And Described – News |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=July 30, 2013 |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/the-bureau-xcom-declassified-arrives-in-august-6407573 |title=The Bureau: XCOM Declassified arrives in August |publisher=GameSpot.com |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/xcom-shooter-re-emerges-as-the-bureau-xcom-declassified-252387.phtml |title=XCOM shooter re-emerges as The Bureau: XCOM Declassified |publisher=Destructoid |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Adam |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xcom-shooter-returns-as-the-bureau-xcom-declassified-on-august-20/ |title='The Bureau: XCOM Declassified' proves that even the aliens were cooler in the 60s |publisher=Digital Trends |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first actual gameplay footage trailer for ''The Bureau'', with developer commentary, was released on May 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamerant.com/the-bureau-xcom-declassified-gameplay-screenshots/ 2K Debuts First Gameplay Footage, New Screens for &amp;#039;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&amp;#039;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactions improved when ''XCOM'' was re-designed with third-person viewpoints and a tactical pause mode. [[1UP.com]] called the revised version "the [[dark horse]]" of [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011|E3 2011]].&lt;ref name=1up/&gt; According to [[IGN]], "''XCOM'' the FPS was announced before [[XCOM: Enemy Unknown|the strategy remake]], so fans cried foul at defiling such a sacred series. But with top-notch style and a focus on team-based combat, the new take on ''XCOM'' might turn fans into believers when it finally releases in 2013."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.games.ign.com/articles/121/1218958p1.html |title=10 Series That Changed Beyond Recognition – Games Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.games.ign.com |date=February 17, 2012 |accessdate=November 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221023204/http://uk.games.ign.com/articles/121/1218958p1.html |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bureau: XCOM Declassified'' received generally mixed or average reviews. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave the Xbox 360 version 69.96% and 68/100,&lt;ref name="GRX360" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCX360" /&gt; the PlayStation 3 version 65.56% and 69/100&lt;ref name="GRPS3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS3" /&gt; and the PC version 61.91% and 66/100.&lt;ref name="GRPC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt; Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]] gave the game a score of 7/10, arguing that while the game was not necessary in the wake of ''Enemy Unknown'', it can still be enjoyed as a tactical shooter.&lt;ref name="EuroG" /&gt; [[Joystiq]]'s Ludwig Kietzmann praised the game's open-ended environments and gave the game four stars out of five.&lt;ref name="Joystiq" /&gt; [[Destructoid]]'s Jim Sterling, however, opined that the game "wants to be ''XCOM'' without being ''XCOM''. As such, it is nothing," criticising the strategy elements and ultimately giving the game a rating of 4.5 out of 10.&lt;ref name="Destructoid" /&gt;

Its construction began in 1962, on a 1-inch to 1 foot scale.&lt;ref name="AmPro"/&gt;  It was created in painstaking detail, and features miniature replications of almost all the rooms in the [[White House]], including the [[East Wing]], [[West Wing]] and the [[Oval Office]]. It has toured every U.S. state&lt;ref name="AmPro"/&gt; as well as several foreign countries while on tour in the 1970s and early 1980s. While touring in the [[Netherlands]], the replica was attacked by a group of anti-American vandals, who significantly damaged most of the model, but all was eventually repaired. Portions of the replica can be seen at the Presidents Hall of Fame museum [http://www.presidentshalloffame.com/] in [[Clermont, Florida]], while the replica itself is featured on tour (usually displayed in [[presidential libraries]]) from time to time.

A detailed, illustrated book by Gail Buckland, '''''The White House in Miniature''''', was published in 1994 and features an extensive history of the replica, its creators and features a photographic tour of all the miniature rooms. A [[VHS]]/[[DVD]] tour of the replica has also been made available.

The replica's permanent location is at the Zweifel's ''Presidents Hall of Fame'' in [[Clermont, Florida]].&lt;ref name="AmPro"/&gt;

'''Thundersticks''', sometimes known as '''cheerstix''',  '''bangers''' or '''bambams''', are long, narrow plastic [[balloon]]s that are used as promotional noise makers. The noise is created when two thundersticks are struck together. They are most often used at sporting events, political rallies and concerts.

== Origin and popularity ==
Thundersticks, known as ''makdae pungseon'' in Korea, were created by BalloonStix Korea and first used in 1994 at an [[LG Twins]] baseball game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=막대풍선이란?|url=http://www.balloonstix.com/sub/sub02_01.php|website=벌룬스틱스 코리아 주식회사|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=전태수 사장이 밝히는 막대풍선의 역사|url=http://news.donga.com/3//20081027/8649242/1|website=동아닷컴|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=ko|date=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mercer|first1=Bobby|title=ManVentions: From Cruise Control to Cordless Drills - Inventions Men Can't Live Without|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781440510748|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehjrDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later gained popularity in [[North America]] when used by fans of the [[Los Angeles Angels|Anaheim Angels]] during the [[2002 World Series]]. Today thundersticks are used by fans of many sports teams in order to show their support, serving a similar purpose as the [[Homer Hanky]] associated with the [[Minnesota Twins]] and the [[Terrible Towel]] associated with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

Thundersticks have appeared around the world at many sporting events. They are regularly seen in baseball games in [[Taiwan]],basketball games in [[The Philippines]], and [[association football|football]] matches throughout Europe, but sometimes under different names such as "cheersticks" or "bangers".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Engber.

Walker and Son (chartered surveyors) (1945–80), he was the vice president of the Huddersfield Building Society (1958–80).&lt;ref&gt;The Estates Gazette. (1971). Volume 220. p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a deep interest in [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] and mystery. Hall was a student in [[Parapsychology|psychical research]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1954–56). His knowledge of conjuring and magic helped him discover the tricks of [[mediumship|mediums]], many of whom had been caught in fraud. Hall was an ex-member and critic of the Society for Psychical Research and published a series of sceptical books on the paranormal and psychical research.&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, Roger. (2002). ''The Invention of Telepathy: 1870-1901''. Oxford University Press. p. 2. {{ISBN|0-19-924962-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a collector of magic books and was a member of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]]. He also wrote three books on the higher criticism of [[Sherlock Holmes]].

==Research==

===Florence Cook===

In his controversial book ''The Spiritualists'' (1962), Hall stated that the famous medium [[Florence Cook]] was a fraud who had an affair with the chemist and psychical researcher [[William Crookes]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Daniel. (1971). ''Masters of the Occult''. Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. p. 111. {{ISBN|978-0396064077}} "In 1962 Trevor H. Hall, a British jurist and psychical researcher, re-examined the Crooke's-Cook case and came to the sensational conclusion not that Crookes had been fooled (as many had believed) but that he was an active participant in the hoax, and that he had a sexual involvement with the attractive medium. Though all the figures in this case were long dead the charge stirred up furor in the very tradition-minded psychical research circles in England. The controversy reverberates to this day."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Routledge. p. 67. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall drew upon Francis G. H. Anderson's statements to the Society for Psychical Research in 1922 and 1941. Anderson claimed to have had an affair with Cook himself, he also stated that she was a sexual maniac who confessed to having an affair with Crookes.&lt;ref&gt;Tromp, Marlene. (2006). ''Altered States: Sex, Nation, Drugs, and Self-Transformation in Victorian Spiritualism.'' State University of New York Press. pp. 43-44. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-6739-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, psychical researchers R. G. Medhurst and [[K. M. Goldney]] cast considerable doubt on the reliability of Anderson's testimony and dismissed Hall's allegations. Biographer [[William Hodson Brock]] who has praised Hall's book also doubted the claims of an affair.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hodson Brock|Brock, William Hodson]]. (2008).  ''William Crookes (1832-1919) and the Commercialization of Science''. Ashgate Publishing. pp. 184-185. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6322-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Hall's research that Cook had an affair with Crookes, historian [[Asa Briggs]] in a review commented that "the verdict does not seem to be fully proven, although the evidence is striking".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa. (1965). ''Reviewed Works: The Spiritualists: The Story of Florence Cook and William Crookes by Trevor H. Hall; The First Five Lives of Annie Besant by Arthur H. Nethercot; The Last Four Lives of Annie Besant by Arthur H. Nethercot''. ''[[Victorian Studies]]''. Vol. 8, No. 4, pp. 361-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Ray Hyman]] has noted that despite how one may consider the allegations, "there is no question that Hall has unearthed much material that throws strong suspicions on Crookes's handling of this investigation."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Ray. (1989). ''The Elusive Quarry: A Scientific Appraisal of Psychical Research''. Prometheus Books. p. 209. {{ISBN|0-87975-504-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers such as [[Ruth Brandon]] and [[Eric Dingwall]] have supported Hall's arguments against Cook and Crookes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Brandon|Brandon, Ruth]]. (1983). ''The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries''. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. pp. 122-124. {{ISBN|978-0297782490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Ruth. (1985). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6DGWU27baYC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Unsavoury+Spirits%22+New+Scientist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=au95VIfmMo24afCbgvgK&amp;ved=0CCsQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Unsavoury%20Spirits%22%20New%20Scientist&amp;f=false ''Unsavoury Spirits'']. New Scientist 18 July. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansel, C. E. M. (1989). ''The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited''. Prometheus Books. p. 287. {{ISBN|0-87975-516-4}} "In his ''Critics Dilemma'' (1966) he revealed that in 1922 he had himself met the man to whom Florence Cook had given details of her affair with Crookes, her trips to Paris, and the assistance that Crookes had provided in order to fake the spirit Katie King. Dingwall supported Hall's conclusions and after considering attempts to explain away the evidence writes "If we are being asked to think that Crookes really believed in all of this, it appears his modern defenders are reducing him almost to the level of an imbecile and denigrating him to a far greater degree than Mr. Hall has done."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edmund Gurney===
In his book ''The Strange Case of Edmund Gurney'' (1964), Hall made the claim that [[Edmund Gurney]] committed suicide after discovering the frauds of [[Douglas Blackburn]] and [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]]. This has been strongly contested by biographer Trevor Hamilton and the psychical researcher [[Alan Gauld]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Rhodri. (2007). ''Resisting History: Religious Transcendence and the Invention of the Unconscious''. Manchester University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-7414-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Trevor. (2009). ''Immortal Longings: F.W.H. Myers and the Victorian Search for Life After Death''. Imprint Academic. pp. 164-169. {{ISBN|978-1-8454-0248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parapsychologist Fraser Nicol published an extremely negative review of Hall's book on Gurney, this caused a threat of a libel action from Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Barry H. (2012). ''The Thought Reader Craze: Victorian Science at the Enchanted Boundary''. McFarland. p. 224. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-6470-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Trevor. (2013). ''F. W. H. Myers, William James, and Spiritualism''. In Christopher M. Moreman. ''The Spiritualist Movement: Speaking with the Dead in America and Around the World''. ''Volume 1: American Origins and Global Proliferation''. [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger]]. pp. 97-114. {{ISBN|978-0-313-39947-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daniel Dunglas Home===

In his book ''The Enigma of Daniel Home: Medium or Fraud?'' (1984), Hall asserted that the medium [[Daniel Dunglas Home]] had invented his aristocratic background.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1993). ''The Sorcerer of Kings: The Case of Daniel Dunglas Home and William Crookes''. Prometheus Books. p. 71. {{ISBN|0-87975-863-5}} "It remained for Trevor Hall to show that Home's middle name, "Dunglas," which represents one of the noble Scottish families, was really just an affectation. In other words, although he often claimed the descent of his father as a natural [i.e., illegitimate] son of Alexander, tenth Earl of Home," was actually not related to that family, and therefore not a Dunglas. In addition, his birth certificate does not have "Dunglas" on it; it's simply Daniel Home."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall's research led him to conclude that the alleged [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] of Home at Ashley House never happened as the eyewitness reports contradicted each other and all Home did was step across a gap of four feet between two iron balconies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, F. B. (1986). ''Reviewed Works: The Enigma of Daniel Home: Medium or Fraud? by Trevor H. Hall; The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries by Ruth Brandon; The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914 by Janet Oppenheim''. ''[[Victorian Studies]]''. Vol. 29, No. 4, pp. 613-614.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Researcher [[Georgess McHargue]] noted that Hall was "one of the most astute of modern investigators, combining twentieth-century scientific techniques with a cheerful and readable writing style in his many books."&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgess McHargue|McHargue, Georgess]].  (1972). ''Facts, Frauds, and Phantasms: A Survey of the Spiritualist Movement''. Doubleday. p. 100. {{ISBN|978-0385053051}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Roger Luckhurst]] has written that Halls "books proceed with a combination of careful archival work and abusive character assassinations."&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, Roger. (2002). ''The Invention of Telepathy, 1870-1901''. Oxford University Press. pp. 74-75. {{ISBN|0-19-924962-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology'' (1985), authors Gerd H. Hövelmann, [[Marcello Truzzi]] and [[Piet Hein Hoebens]] noted that "[al]though Hall's historical detective work is often impressive, his conclusions sometimes go beyond his data. Despite the flaws in some of Hall's efforts, his writings should be required reading for everyone interested in early psychical research."&lt;ref name="Kurtz 1985"/&gt;

'''Valley girl''' is a [[socio-economic]] [[stereotype]] depicting a class of women characterized by the colloquial [[California English]] dialect ''[[Valleyspeak]]'' and [[Economic materialism|materialism]].

Originally referring to upper-middle class girls from the [[Los Angeles]] commuter communities of the [[San Fernando Valley]] during the 1980s, the term in later years became more broadly applied to any female in the [[United States]] who engendered the associated affects of [[wikt:ditz|ditziness]], [[wikt:airhead|airheadedness]], and/or greater interest in [[conspicuous consumption]] than intellectual or personal accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest, Michael; Stanley, Alessandra (September 27, 1982). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925750,00.html "Living: How Toe-dully Max Is Their Valley:]. ''Time'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 1982, composer [[Frank Zappa]] released the single "[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]", with his 14-year-old daughter [[Moon Unit Zappa|Moon Unit]] speaking typical "Valley Girl" phrases. Zappa intended to lampoon the image, but after the song's release there was a significant increase in the "Valspeak" slang usage, whether ironically spoken or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play| first1 = Ben| last1 = Watson| publisher = Quartet Books| year = 1994| page=396|isbn=978-0-7033-7066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1983 film ''[[Valley Girl (film)|Valley Girl]]'' starring [[Nicolas Cage]] centered on a group of "Valley Girl" characters and featured several characterizations associated with their lifestyle (such as going shopping at the mall or "[[Sherman Oaks Galleria|Galleria]]," suntanning at the beach, and going to parties).

The protagonist of the 1995 film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' has been described as a caricature of 1990s Valley Girls, though she is actually from nearby [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amy Irving|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/72012243/|accessdate=8 April 2015|agency=The Index-Journal|date=April 22, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1990s&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alan Schwartz|first1=Richard|title=The 1990s|date=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMLGas7fOyYC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=Clueless+%221990s+valley+girl%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-VKM_jKJLf&amp;sig=Xz31szoJTKQYJBXhXfjh6n_EANo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UnclVZszhrCwBI3egfgJ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Clueless%20%221990s%20valley%20girl%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothman|first1=Lily|title=No Rebuttals: The Top 10 Movie Debate Scenes|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/22/no-rebuttals-the-top-10-movie-debate-scenes/slide/clueless/|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate=8 April 2015|date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=Jan|title=Overturning the Myth of Valley Girl Speak|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/overturning-the-myth-of-valley-girl-speak/?_r=0|website=NYTimes.com|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=8 April 2015|date=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2015 memoir entitled ''Wildflower'', actress [[Drew Barrymore]] says she talks "like a valley girl" because she lived in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]] from the age of 7 to 14.&lt;ref name="wildflower7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrymore|first1=Drew|title=Wildflower|date=2015|publisher=Dutton|location=New York|isbn=9781101983799|oclc=904421431|pages=2; 7|quote=As if I had been lobotomized, we packed our things and moved into our new home, indeed in Sherman Oaks, in 1983. It's why I still talk like a valley girl. That cadence snuck into my life at that spongelike age of eight and never left.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
