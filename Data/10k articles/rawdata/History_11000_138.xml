'''Saint Acacius of Amida''' (died 425) was [[Bishop]] of [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]], [[Mesopotamia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]) from 400 to 425, during the reign of the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius II]].

==Life==
At that time, there were seven thousand [[Persian people|Persian]] prisoners who were captured by the Romans and held in Amida. Filled with the compassion at the sight of these men perishing from hunger and misery, St. Acacius resolved to help them. He assembled his clergy and addressed them in this manner:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our God, my brethren, needs neither dishes nor cups; for He neither eats nor drinks, nor is in want of anything. Since then, by the liberality of its faithful members the Church possesses many vessels both of gold and silver, it behooves us to sell them, that by the money thus raised, we may be able to redeem the prisoners and also supply them with food.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26017.htm ''Socrates Scholasticus' "Church History" (Book VII) Chapter 21 - Kind Treatment of the Persian Captives by Acacius Bishop of Amida'']&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bishop Acacius sold all the precious golden and silver sacred vessels of his church and ransomed, clothed and fed the seven thousand. He even supported them for a while and furnished them with all that they needed to return to Persia.&lt;ref&gt;"Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year" edited by Rev. Hugo Hoever, S.O.Cist., Ph.D., New York: Catholic Book Publishing Co., 1955 pp.145-146&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ransomed captives returned home to [[Persia]], they told their ruler of the great deeds performed by Bishop Acacius. His actions so impressed the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Emperor]] [[Bahram V]] that he is reported to have ordered an end to the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution of the Christians]].

Persian Emperor [[Bahram V]] also desired to see St. Acacius face-to-face. Permission to do just that was given to Acacius by Emperor [[Theodosius II]].&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; St. Acacius' kindness and charity led to the termination of hostilities between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]], and Christianity was able to flourish for a while in the areas then controlled by the [[Sassanid]] Persians.

Saint Acacius' [[feast day]] is celebrated on April 9 ([[Roman Martyrology]]).

'''Asser''' (died [[circa|c.]] 909) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[monk]] from [[St David's]], [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]], who became [[Bishop of Sherborne (ancient)|Bishop of Sherborne]] in the 890s. About 885 he was asked by [[Alfred the Great]] to leave St David's and join the circle of learned men whom Alfred was recruiting for his court. After spending a year at [[Caerwent]] because of illness, Asser accepted.

In 893 Asser wrote a biography of Alfred, called the ''Life of King Alfred''. The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, which was part of the [[Cotton library]]. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been made earlier, together with material from Asser's work which was included by other early writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'', and possibly with other works.

Asser is sometimes cited as a source for the legend about Alfred's having founded the [[University of Oxford]], which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by [[William Camden]] into his 1603 edition of Asser's ''Life''. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire ''Life'' is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.

==Name and early life==
[[Image:Asser map.png|thumb|400px|A map of southern Great Britain showing places Asser is known to have visited. The monasteries he was given by Alfred are also shown. The exact location of Ashdown is uncertain, though it is known to be on the Berkshire Downs.]]

Asser (also known as John Asser or Asserius Menevensis)&lt;ref name=CE_Asser&gt;{{Cite CE1913
| wstitle =John Asser
| first = John Joseph
| last = A'Becket
| volume = 1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Welsh [[monk]] who lived from at least AD 885 until about 909. Almost nothing is known of Asser's early life. The name Asser is likely to have been taken from Aser, or [[Asher]], the eighth son of [[Jacob]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. Old Testament names were common in Wales at the time, but it has been suggested that this name may have been adopted at the time Asser entered the church. Asser may have been familiar with a work by [[Jerome|St Jerome]] on the meaning of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names (Jerome's given meaning for "Asser" was "blessed"), so it is possible that Asser's birth name was "Gwyn" (or "Guinn"), which is Welsh for "blessed" (or "blessedness").&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

According to his ''Life of King Alfred'', Asser was a monk at [[St David's Cathedral|St David's]] in what was then the kingdom of [[Dyfed]], in south-west Wales. Asser makes it clear that he was brought up in the area, and was [[tonsure]]d, trained and ordained there. He also mentions [[Nobis (bishop)|Nobis]], a bishop of St David's who died in 873 or 874, as being a kinsman of his.&lt;ref name="KL"&gt;[[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]], ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 48–58, 93–96, and 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment by Alfred and time at court==
Much of what is known about Asser comes from his biography of [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]], in particular a short section in which Asser recounts how Alfred recruited him as a scholar for his court. Alfred held a high opinion of the value of learning and recruited men from around Britain and from continental Europe to establish a scholarly centre at his court. It is not known how Alfred heard of Asser, but one possibility relates to Alfred's overlordship of south Wales. Several kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of [[Glywysing]] and Hyfaidd of [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]] (where Asser's monastery was), had submitted to Alfred's overlordship in 885. Asser gives a fairly detailed account of the events. There is a charter of Hywel's which has been dated to c. 885; amongst the witnesses is one "Asser", which may be the same person. Hence it is possible that Alfred's relationship with the southern Welsh kings led him to hear of Asser.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

Asser recounts meeting Alfred first at the royal estate at Dean, Sussex (now [[East Dean, West Sussex|East]] and [[West Dean, West Sussex]]).&lt;ref name="brandon71"&gt;John McNeil Dodgson. Place-Names in Sussex ''in'' Brandons. South Saxons. Ch. IV. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Asser provides only one datable event in his history: on [[St Martin's Day]], 11 November 887, Alfred decided to learn to read Latin. Working backwards from this, it appears most likely that Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

Asser's response to Alfred's request was to ask for time to consider the offer, as he felt it would be unfair to abandon his current position in favour of worldly recognition. Alfred agreed but also suggested that he should spend half his time at St David's and half with Alfred. Asser again asked for time to consider, but ultimately agreed to return to Alfred with an answer in six months. On his return to Wales, however, Asser fell ill with a fever and was confined to the monastery of [[Caerwent]] for twelve months and a week. Alfred wrote to find out the cause of the delay, and Asser responded that he would keep his promise when he recovered. When he did recover, in 886, he agreed to divide his time between Wales and Alfred's court, as Alfred had suggested. Others at St David's supported this, since they hoped Asser's influence with Alfred would avoid "damaging afflictions and injuries at the hands of King Hyfaidd (who often assaulted that monastery and the jurisdiction of St David)".&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;&lt;ref name=KL93&gt;Asser tells the story of his recruitment in chapter 79 of his ''Life of King Alfred'' (Keynes &amp; Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 93–94).&lt;/ref&gt;

Asser joined several other noted scholars at Alfred's court, including [[Grimbald]], and [[John the Old Saxon]]; all three probably reached Alfred's court within a year of each other.&lt;ref name=KL2&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; His first extended stay with Alfred was at the royal estate at Leonaford, probably from about April through December 886. It is not known where Leonaford was; a case has been made for [[Landford]], in [[Wiltshire]]. Asser records that he read aloud to the king from the books at hand. On Christmas Eve, 886, after Asser had for some time failed to obtain permission to return to Wales, Alfred gave Asser the monasteries of [[Congresbury]] and [[Banwell]], along with a silk cloak and a quantity of [[incense]] "weighing as much as a stout man." He allowed Asser to visit his new possessions and thence to return to St David's.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;&lt;ref name=KL96&gt;The story of Asser's first visit to Alfred's court is taken from chapter 81 of his ''Life'' (Keynes &amp; Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 96).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter Asser seems to have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no information about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the [[Battle of Ashdown|battlefield at Ashdown]], Cynuit ([[Countisbury]]), and [[Athelney]]. It is evident from Asser's account that he spent a good deal of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same [[Eadburh]] who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

==Bishop of Sherborne==
Sometime between 887 and 892, Alfred gave Asser the monastery of Exeter. Asser subsequently became Bishop of Sherborne,&lt;ref name=Handbook222&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'', p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; though the year of succession is unknown. Asser's predecessor as Bishop of Sherborne, [[Wulfsige of Sherborne|Wulfsige]], attested a charter in 892. Asser's first appearance in the position is in 900, when he appears as a witness to a charter; hence the succession can only be dated to the years 892 to 900.&lt;ref&gt; Keynes &amp; Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 49, 181&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, Asser had already been a bishop prior to his appointment to the see of Sherborne, since Wulfsige is known to have received a copy of Alfred's ''Pastoral Care'' in which Asser is described as a bishop.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

It is possible that Asser was a [[suffragan bishop]] within the see of Sherborne, but he may instead have been a bishop of St David's. He is listed as such in [[Giraldus Cambrensis]]'s ''Itinerarium Cambriae'', although this may be unreliable as it was written three centuries later, in 1191. A contemporary clue is found in Asser's own writing: he mentions that bishops of St David's were sometimes expelled by King Hyfaidd and adds that "he even expelled me on occasion." This also implies that Asser was himself a bishop of St David's.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

==''The Life of King Alfred''==
In 893, Asser wrote a biography of Alfred entitled ''The Life of King Alfred''; in the original Latin, the title is ''Vita Ælfredi regis Angul Saxonum''. The date is known from Asser's mention of the king's age in the text. The work, which is less than twenty thousand words long, is one of the most important sources of information on Alfred the Great.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

Asser drew on a variety of texts to write his ''Life''. The style is similar to that of two biographies of [[Louis the Pious]]: ''[[Vita Hludovici Imperatoris]]'', written c. 840 by an unknown author usually called "the Astronomer", and ''Vita Hludowici Imperatoris'' by [[Thegan of Trier]]. It is possible that Asser may have known these works. He also knew [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''; the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', a Welsh source; the ''Life of [[Alcuin]]''; and the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. It is also clear from the text that Asser was familiar with [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Caelius Sedulius]]'s ''Carmen Paschale'', [[Aldhelm]]'s ''De Virginitate'', and [[Einhard]]'s ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'' ("Life of Charlemagne"). He quotes from [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Regula Pastoralis]]'', a work he and Alfred subsequently collaborated in translating, and from [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[Enchiridion of Augustine|Enchiridion]]''. About half of the ''Life'' is little more than a translation of part of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for the years 851–887, though Asser adds personal opinions and interpolates information about Alfred's life. Asser also adds material relating to the years after 887 and general opinions about Alfred's character and reign.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;&lt;ref name=Abels13&gt;Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asser's prose style has been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His frequent use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but it is also possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

The ''Life'' ends abruptly with no concluding remarks and it is considered likely that the manuscript is an incomplete draft. Asser lived a further fifteen or sixteen years and Alfred a further six, but no events after 893 are recorded.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

It is possible that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pains to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience not familiar with the areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the Welsh equivalent, even in the case of [[Nottingham]], which seems unlikely to have had a native Welsh name. As a result, and given that Alfred's overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred's personal qualities and reconcile them to his rule.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt; However, it is also possible that Asser's inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred's programme of fortification that give the impression of the book's being aimed at an English audience.&lt;ref name=CampbellTASS142&gt;Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxon State'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asser's ''Life'' omits any mention of internal strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands to fortify the realm, he makes it clear that Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_139&gt;{{Cite book|last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|page=139|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CampbellTASS145&gt;Asser's biases and how to interpret them are discussed in detail in Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxon State'', pp. 145–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being the primary source for Alfred's life, Asser's work is also a source for other historical periods, where he adds material to his translation of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. For example, he tells a story about [[Eadburh]], the daughter of [[Offa]]. Eadburh married [[Beorhtric]], king of the West Saxons. Asser describes her as behaving "like a tyrant" and ultimately accidentally poisoning Beorhtric in an attempt to murder someone else. He finishes by describing her death as a beggar in [[Pavia]].&lt;ref name=Campbell111&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Campbell|first1= John|last2=John |first2=Eric |last3=Wormald |first3=Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|page=111|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KL5&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; This Eadburh is not the same as Alfred's mother-in-law, also named Eadburh, whom Asser mentions elsewhere.

==Manuscripts of ''The Life of King Alfred''==
[[Image:asser facsimile.png|thumb|300px|A facsimile of the first page of the Cotton ms. of Asser's "Life of King Alfred". This copy was made in 1722 by James Hill, an antiquary who had been employed by Francis Wise to examine the manuscript.&lt;ref name=Abels319&gt;Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The early manuscript of the ''Life'' does not appear to have been widely known in medieval times. Only one copy is known to have survived into modern times. It is known as Cotton MS Otho A xii, and was part of the [[Cotton library]]. It was written about 1000 and was destroyed in a fire in 1731. The lack of distribution may be because Asser had not finished the manuscript and so did not have it copied. However, the material in the ''Life'' is recognizable in other works. There is some evidence from early writers of access to versions of Asser's work, as follows:&lt;ref name=KL3&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 223–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Byrhtferth]] of [[Ramsey Abbey|Ramsey]] included large sections of it into ''[[Historia Regum]]'', a historical work he wrote in the late tenth or early 11th century. He may have used the Cotton manuscript. (The ''Historia Regum'' was until recently attributed to [[Symeon of Durham]].)
*The anonymous author of the ''[[Encomium Emmae]]'' (written in the early 1040s) was apparently acquainted with the ''Life'', though it is not known how he knew of it. The author was a monk of [[Saint Bertin|St Bertin's]] in [[Flanders]], but may have learned of the work in England.
*The chronicler known as [[Florence of Worcester]] incorporated parts of Asser's ''Life'' into his chronicle, in the early 12th century; again, he may have also used the Cotton manuscript.
*An anonymous chronicler at [[Bury St Edmunds]], working in the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as ''The [[Annals of St Neots]]''. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript and in some places appears to be more accurate, so it is possible that the copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.
*[[Giraldus Cambrensis]] wrote a ''Life of St Æthelberht'', probably at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser that occurred during the reign of [[Offa]] of [[Mercia]], who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.

The history of the Cotton manuscript itself is quite complex. The list of early writers above mentions that it may have been in the possession of at least two of them. It was owned by [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], the antiquary, in the 1540s. It probably became available after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]], in which the property of many religious houses was confiscated and sold. Leland died in 1552 and it is known to have been in the possession of [[Matthew Parker]] from some time after that until his own death in 1575. Although Parker bequeathed most of his library to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], the Cotton manuscript was not included. By 1600, it was in the library of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|Lord Lumley]] and by 1621 the manuscript was in the possession of [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]]. The Cotton library was moved in 1712 from Cotton House in [[Westminster]] to Essex House in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and then moved again in 1730 to [[Ashburnham House]] in Westminster. On the morning of Saturday, 23 October 1731, a fire broke out and the Cotton manuscript was destroyed.&lt;ref name=KL3 /&gt;

As a result, the text of Asser's ''Life'' is known from a multitude of different sources. Various transcripts had been made of the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the first page of the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if they were part of the text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of ''The Life'' published, both in Latin and in translation.&lt;ref name=KL3 /&gt; The 1904 critical edition (with 130 pages of introduction) by [[W. H. Stevenson]], ''Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser'', still provides the standard Latin text:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stevenson |first=William Henry |author-link=W.

Stevenson |title=Asser's Life of King Alfred: together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser |language=Latin with English introduction |place=Oxford |publisher=The Clarendon Press |year=1904 |url=https://archive.org/details/asserslifekinga00stevgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was translated into English in 1905 by Albert S. Cook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Albert S. |title=Asser's Life of King Alfred, translated from the text of Stevenson's edition |place=Boston |publisher=Ginn and Company |year=1905 |page=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/asserslifeofking00asseiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abels328A&gt;Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources'' by [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]].&lt;ref name=Abels328B&gt;Richard Abels (''Alfred the Great'', p. 328) describes Keynes and Lapidge's book as "The best collection of primary sources in translation", and "an indispensable guide to the scholarly problems and issues surrounding these works".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend of founding of Oxford==
In 1603 the antiquarian [[William Camden]] published an edition of Asser's ''Life'' in which there appears a story of a community of scholars at Oxford, who were visited by Grimbald:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the year of our Lord 886, the second year of the arrival of St Grimbald in England, the University of Oxford was begun ... John, monk of the church of St David, giving lectures in logic, music and arithmetic; and John, the monk, colleague of St Grimbald, a man of great parts and a universal scholar, teaching geometry and astronomy before the most glorious and invincible King Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-figures/ch1-1 |title=Oxford Figures – About: The Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford |accessdate=31 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609180358/http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-figures/ch1-1 |archivedate=9 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no support for this in any source known. Camden based his edition on Parker's manuscript, other transcripts of which do not include any such material. It is now acknowledged that this is an interpolation of Camden's, though the legend itself first surfaced in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=CE_Asser /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907–21): Volume I. From the Beginnings to the Cycles of Romance.'' Chapter VI: Alfred and the Old English Prose of his Reign, § 1: Asser's Life of Alfred is online at {{Cite web| url = http://www.bartleby.com/211/0601.html | title = §1. Asser's "Life of Alfred". VI.

==Claims of forgery==
{{anchor|forgery}}
During the 19th and 20th centuries, several scholars asserted that Asser's biography of King Alfred was not authentic, but a forgery. A prominent claim was made in 1964 by the respected historian [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|V.H. Galbraith]] in his essay "Who Wrote Asser's Life of Alfred?" Galbraith argued that there were anachronisms in the text that meant it could not have been written during Asser's lifetime. For example, Asser uses "rex Angul Saxonum" ("king of the Anglo-Saxons") to refer to Alfred. Galbraith asserted that this usage does not appear until the late 10th century. Galbraith also identified the use of "parochia" to refer to Exeter as an anachronism, arguing that it should be translated as "diocese" and hence that it referred to the [[bishopric of Exeter]], which was not created until 1050. Galbraith identified the true author as [[Leofric, Bishop of Exeter|Leofric]], who became Bishop of [[United sees of Devon and Cornwall|Devon and Cornwall]] in 1046. Leofric's motive, according to Galbraith, was to justify the re-establishment of his see at Exeter by demonstrating a precedent for the arrangement.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abels321-324"&gt;See "On the Authenticity of ''Asser's Life of King Alfred''" in Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 321–324. Pages 319–321 review Galbraith's argument, and the academic response; 321–324 cover Smyth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title "king of the Anglo-Saxons" does, however, in fact occur in royal charters that date to before 892 and "parochia" does not necessarily mean "diocese", but can sometimes refer just to the jurisdiction of a church or monastery. In addition, there are other arguments against Leofric's having been the forger. Aside from the fact that Leofric would have known little about Asser and so would have been unlikely to construct a plausible forgery, there is strong evidence dating the Cotton manuscript to about 1000. The apparent use of Asser's material in other early works that predate Leofric also argues against Galbraith's theory. Galbraith's arguments were refuted to the satisfaction of most historians by [[Dorothy Whitelock]] in ''Genuine Asser'', in the Stenton Lecture of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Whitelock |first=Dorothy |title=Genuine Asser |publisher=University of Reading |year=1968 |url=http://whitlockfamilyassociation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sources/references/R2413.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abels321-324" /&gt;

More recently, in 2002, [[Alfred P. Smyth|Alfred Smyth]] has argued that the ''Life'' is a forgery by [[Byrhtferth]], basing his case primarily on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about the authenticity of the work.&lt;ref name="KL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abels321-324" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smyth"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Smyth|first= Alfred P.|title= The Medieval Life of King Alfred the Great|year= 2002|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0-333-69917-3 }} Smyth's book is also [http://www.palgrave.com/pdfs/0333699173.pdf available online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works and date of death==
In addition to the ''Life of King Alfred'', Asser is credited by Alfred as one of several scholars who assisted with Alfred's translation of Gregory's ''Regula Pastoralis'' (''Pastoral Care''). The historian [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in the 12th century, believed that Asser also assisted Alfred with his translation of [[Boethius]].&lt;ref name=Abels11&gt;Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Annales Cambriae]],'' a set of Welsh annals that were probably kept at St David's, records Asser's death in the year 908. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' records the following entry as part of the entry for 909 or 910 (in different versions of the chronicle): "Here Frithustan succeeded to the bishopric in [[Winchester]], and after that Asser, who was bishop at Sherborne, departed."&lt;ref name=Swanton&gt;{{Cite book|last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=94–95|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year given by the chronicle was uncertain, because different chroniclers started the new year at different calendar dates, and Asser's date of death is generally given as 908/909.&lt;ref name=KL /&gt;

The '''Bar massacre''' ({{lang-sq|Masakra e Tivarit}}) was the killing of an unclear number of mostly [[Albanians|ethnic Albanian]] recruits from [[Kosovo]] by [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in late March or early April 1945 in [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], a municipality in Montenegro , at the end of [[World War II]].

== Massacre ==
By 1942, the city of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] became a home of many Serbians and other refugees who were forced to flee from Kosovo and to escape the violence done by Albanian units. Many of these joined the Partisan forces and participated in their activities at Bar.&lt;ref name="ZM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/dokumenti/pristan5_grupa_autora.htm |title= Željko Milović-DRUGI SVJETSKI RAT|publisher=Montenengrina Digitalna Biblioteka }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victims were [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanian recruits from Kosovo]], who had been pressed by the Yugoslav Partisans into service. These men were then assembled in Prizren and marched on foot in three columns to Bar where they were supposed to receive short training and then sent off to the front.&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; The march took the rugged mountain ranges of Kosovo and Montenegro to reach its destination. Upon arrival locals reported that these men, who had marched a considerable distance, were "exhausted" and "distressed". The column of men which stretched a few kilometres were then gathered on the Barkso Polje. At one point, in Polje, one of the Albanians from the column attacked and killed one of the Yugoslav officers, Boža Dabanovića.&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; Very soon after that somebody from the column threw a smuggled bomb at the commander of the brigade.&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; This created a panic among the Partisans. The guards watching over the recruits then fired into the crowd killing many and prompting the survivors to flee into the surrounding mountains.&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; In another case, several hundred Albanians were herded into a tunnel, near Bar, which was subsequently sealed off so that all of those trapped within the tunnel were [[Asphyxia|asphyxiated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Vickers|title=The Albanians: A Modern History|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vtQABAAAQBAJ&amp;q=tivar#v=snippet&amp;q=tivar&amp;f=false|publisher=I.B.Tauris}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yugoslav sources put the number of victims at 400&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; while Albanian sources put the figure at 2,000 killed in Bar alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/ata/1996/96-09-19.ata.html#03 |title=Massive Grave of Albanian Victims of Tivari Massacre uncovered |date=19 September 1996|publisher=Albanian Telegraphic Agency |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Croatian historian [[Ljubica Štefan]], the Partisans killed 1,600 Albanians in Bar on 1 April after an incident at a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ljubica Štefan|title=Mitovi i zatajena povijest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPqfAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=K.

'''Caroline Dale Snedeker''' née Parke (March 3, 1871 – January 22, 1956) was an American writer, primarily of children's historical novels. Two of her books, ''[[Downright Dencey]]'' and ''[[The Forgotten Daughter]]'', were runners-up for the [[Newbery Medal]]. On occasion she used the pen name '''Caroline Dale Owen'''.

==Personal life==
'''Caroline Dale Parke''' was born on March 23, 1871, in [[New Harmony, Indiana]], to Nina Dale (Owen) and Charles Augustus Parke, a banker.&lt;ref name=Estabrook91&gt;{{cite journal| author=Arthur H.

Parke grew up near [[Mount Vernon, Indiana]], in a family with three sisters (Ada Owen, Anna Crawford, and Nina Dale) and a brother (Julius Leonard).&lt;ref name=Estabrook91/&gt; The family later moved to [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], where she attended the [[College-Conservatory of Music#History|College of Music]]. Parke and her sisters performed instrumental concerts to support the family after the death of their father 1902. Parke, the pianist in the group, later became a music instructor. She married Charles Henry Snedeker (1856–1927) in 1903, and moved to [[Hempstead, New York]]. Eventually, she moved to [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], and died on January 22, 1956, at the age of 84. Her remains are interred at Live Oak Cemetery in [[Harrison County, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=Estabrook91/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7907566 |title=Caroline Dale Snedeker |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Snedeker's writings consist of 12 or 13 novels for older children or teens  and two or three books for adults, along with a handful of other articles, stories and poems. The majority of her novels were inspired by her love for the ancient world and are set in Greece or the Roman Empire.{{efn|name=ancient}} She also based a series on American history.{{efn|name=america}} The morals of her time can be found throughout her novels, especially in the texts aimed at young adults.&lt;ref name="jiffynotes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiffynotes.com/a_study_guides/book_notes/aww_04/aww_04_01135.html |title=Novel Resource Guide and Literary Analysis |publisher=Jiffynotes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405212946/http://www.jiffynotes.com/a_study_guides/book_notes/aww_04/aww_04_01135.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snedeker's first book,''The Coward of Thermopylae'', appeared for adults in 1911. It gained popularity in 1912 when it was reissued for young adults{{clarify|date=April 2015|reason=adults, young adults, children's version: what does it mean in this context?}} and re-titled ''The Spartan''.&lt;ref name="jiffynotes.com"/&gt; The novel is about an Athenian soldier named Aristodemos, who travels to [[Sparta]] and trains to fight in [[Thermopylae]]. At first considered a coward, he acquits himself with a noble death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Spartan-Caroline-Dale-Snedeker/dp/0966706781 |title=The Spartan: Caroline Dale Snedeker |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}} Product page for 2005 paperback edition, American Home School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The great response to these novels sparked requests for a children's version. In 1924 Snedeker published ''Theras and His Town'' (1924). Theras is an eleven-year-old boy who moved from Athens to Sparta where he experiences a brutal life under Spartan control and attempts to escape back to Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homeschoolblogger.com/homeschoolbookreview/786005/ |title=Theras and His Town |publisher=Homeschoolblogger.com |date=December 10, 2010 |work=Home School Book Review ''(blog)'' |accessdate=2015-04-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616153828/http://homeschoolblogger.com/homeschoolbookreview/786005/ |archivedate=2012-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Forgotten Daughter'' (1933) is also set in Ancient Rome, and is a Newbery Honor Book.&lt;ref name=Newbery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal |title=Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922–Present |publisher=Association for Library Service to Children, American Library Association (ALA.org/alsc) |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snedeker also wrote novels based on American history.{{efn|name=america}} The best known is ''Downright Dencey'', a 1928 Newbery Honor Book,&lt;ref name=Newbery/&gt; which tells of a friendship between a [[Quaker]] girl and a waif in [[Nantucket]] at the early 19th century. In the sequel, ''The Beckoning Road'' (1929), Dencey's family moves to New Harmony.

Snedeker also wrote and published several successful romance novels.&lt;ref name="jiffynotes.com"/&gt;{{which|date=April 2015}} As a result of her popularity, some of her novels were translated into other languages, including [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="librarything.com"/&gt;

==Influences==

Snedeker's mother and grandmother were influences on her career. She grew up listening to her mother's singing and to her grandmother's stories of New Harmony. This sparked Snedeker's interest in history, writing and music at an early age. Having a close relationship with her mother and grandmother led Snedeker to write ''Town of the Fearless'' (1931), about the history of her family and their relation with New Harmony.

==Cultural impact==

Ongoing themes in Snedeker's novels include nobility and "good, old-fashioned values." Caroline Snedeker was exceptionally interested in history, literature and classical music, which is shown throughout her works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6527">'''Christine Niederberger Betton''', born in [[Bordeaux]] and died in 2001 in [[Mexico City]], was a [[France|French]] [[archaeologist]].  She is mainly noted for her contributions to the field of [[pre-Columbian]] [[archaeology of the Americas|American archaeology]], in particular for her work on [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures in central Mexico.

==Early life==
Christine Niederberger was born in Bordeaux, France, the daughter of Roger Betton and Linka Lowczynski. She began her higher education at the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|l'École supérieures nationales des langues orientales]]. From 1965 to 1968, she continued a training in archaeology at the National School of History and Anthropology (ENAH) in [[Mexico]]. Its beginnings works of archaeologists will take place with [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], precisely on the site of [[Zohapilco]]. The results of this excavation lead it to present her thesis in 1974 entitled: ''Zohapilco. Cinco milenios of ocupación humana en un sitio lacustre de la Cuenca de México''. A few years later, in 1981, Christine Niederberger obtains a doctorate of State at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales|School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]], in [[Paris]]. The subject of her doctorate, under the direction of Jean Guilaine, is entitled ''Paléopaysages and pre-urban archaeology of the basin of Mexico''. This thesis became a reference and will be published by the Center of Mexican Studies and Centraméricaines (CEMCA) in 1987.

She was married to Jean-Marie Niederberger.

==Archaeology==
Its search and its excavations, as archaeologist, were particularly innovative and founder of a new school of thought.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On the one hand, she called into question a chronology proposed for the site of Zohapilco, on the level of the occupations in connection with [[Olmec]] style. In addition, she strongly contributed to change the generally accepted ideas, about olmec culture which is not limited to the Zona Metropolitana Olmeca (ZMO), in English, refer to as the Olmec heartland. At the contrary the Olmec culture was a multi-ethnic unit and pluri-linguistic culture covering a vast part of the Mesoamerica, in the period from 1200 BC to about 500 BC. The model of Christine Niederberger thus shows the unit of Middle America from 1200 BC through the olmec style identified by a particular appearance: pan-Mesoamerica.

She was a great professionalist and an extremely meticulous persons on the excavations. Christine Niederberger has always chose with many precautions the places to excavate. Of a great patience, she analyzed, gathered and recorded all the evidence. But the results of these studies which force admiration as well on the form as on the bottom. Its archaeological analyses were always supported by the results of various specialists, thus supporting her reputation of intellectual honesty.

==Published works==
She was the author of many articles and several works in particular "Zohapilco. Cinco milenios de ocupación humana en un sitio lacustre de la Cuenca de México" (1976) and "Paléo-paysages et archéologie pré-urbaine du Bassin de Mexico" (1987). She wrote an important
article in [[Science (journal)|Science]] : ''Early Sedentary Economy in the Basin of Mexico City'' (1979) like several standard commodities in the French Encyclopædia Universalis like ''La civilisation olmèque ou la naissance de la Mésoamérique'' (1985).

'''Esther Gitman''' (born September 20, 1939) is a Jewish American historian who is an expert on the [[Holocaust]] in [[Yugoslavia]] specifically focusing on the [[Independent State of Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/fellowship/fellows/fellow_detail.php?projectyear=2007&amp;fellow=gitman The Centre for Advanced Holocaust Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730005247/http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/fellowship/fellows/fellow_detail.php?projectyear=2007&amp;fellow=gitman|date=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1941 Gitman escaped Sarajevo to the Italian zone of occupation on the Adriatic, both managed to survive the Holocaust through the help of [[Righteous Gentiles]]. She has lived in the United States since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkr.hr/?sec=3&amp;tid=1&amp;cid=23528|title=International symposium on blessed Aloysius Stepinac|publisher=Hkr.hr|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before that her family lived in Israel for 19 years, then she moved to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada with her husband Israel and only child, her daughter Michal. That is where her husband Israel, earned his PhD and finally in 1978 they moved to [[New York City]]. She earned a bachelor's degree in history and sociology from [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and a graduate degree in criminal justice from [[Long Island University]]. She earned a PhD from [[Graduate Center of the City University of New York|City University]] in New York in [[Jewish history]]. She began her research into the Croatian-Jewish history in 1999 with her dissertation, entitled ''Rescue of Jews in the Independent State of Croatia, 1941–1945''. In 2002, she received a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholarship]] to travel to [[Croatia]] to continue her research. In the 2006–07 academic year Gitman was awarded, by the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] and the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, a Barbara and Richard Rosenberg Fellowship for her research.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2007 Gitman received a post-doctoral grant from the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2008/08-060.html Holocaust Historian to Discuss Fate of Croatian Jewry], loc.gov; accessed November 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, she participated in a conference on [[Aloysius Cardinal Stepinac]], the senior member of the Catholic Church among the Croats in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vecernji.hr/newsroom/news/croatia/3164173/index.do "American Jew in defense of blessed Stepinac"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916062314/http://www.vecernji.hr/newsroom/news/croatia/3164173/index.do|date=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gitman has compiled databases on Jews from Sarajevo and Zagreb who survived the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0142_Sarajevo_survivors.html|title=Sarajevo Survivors Who Went to Palestine, December 1948|publisher=Jewishgen.org|date=July 31, 2012|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/Holocaust/0153_Zagreb_survivors.html|title=Zagreb Survivor Lists|publisher=Jewishgen.org|date=April 27, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expressionist architecture''' is an architectural movement in Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] visual and performing arts that especially developed and dominated in [[Germany]]. [[Brick Expressionism]] is a special variant of this movement in western and northern Germany and in [[The Netherlands]] ([[Amsterdam School]]). Expressionist architecture is one of the three dominant styles of [[Modern architecture]] ([[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], Expressionist- and [[Constructivist architecture]]).

==In the 1920s==

The term "Expressionist architecture" initially described the activity of the German, Dutch, Austrian, Czech and Danish avant garde from 1910 until 1930. Subsequent redefinitions extended the term backwards to 1905 and also widened it to encompass the rest of Europe. Today the meaning has broadened even further to refer to architecture of any date or location that exhibits some of the qualities of the original movement such as; distortion, fragmentation or the communication of violent or overstressed emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stallybrass and Bullock, p.301–392 – entry by John Willett&lt;/ref&gt;

The style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"&gt;Pehnt, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economicate.

Important events in expressionist architecture include; the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)]] in [[Cologne]], the completion and theatrical running of the [[Grosses Schauspielhaus]], Berlin in 1919, the [[Glass Chain]] letters, and the activities of the [[Amsterdam School]]. The major permanent extant landmark of Expressionism is [[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s [[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]]. By 1925 most of the leading architects of Expressionism such as; Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn, [[Walter Gropius]], [[Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], along with other Expressionists in the visual arts, had turned toward the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' ([[New Objectivity (architecture)|New Objectivity]]) movement, a more practical and matter-of-fact approach which rejected the emotional agitation of expressionism. A few, notably [[Hans Scharoun]], continued to work in an expressionist idiom.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.203"&gt;Pehnt, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, after the [[Nazi]] seizure of power in Germany, expressionist art was outlawed as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]].&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.203"/&gt; Until the 1970s scholars&lt;ref&gt;Most notably [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly played down the influence of the expressionists on the later [[International style (architecture)|International style]], but this has been re-evaluated in recent years.

==Characteristics==

Expressionist architecture was individualistic and in many ways eschewed aesthetic dogma,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp p.166&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still useful to develop some criteria which defines it. Though containing a great variety and differentiation, many points can be found as recurring in works of Expressionist architecture, and are evident in some degree in each of its works.

#Distortion of form for an emotional effect.&lt;ref&gt;Taut, Die Stadtkrone 1919 p.87, quote ''"Architecture is art and ought to be the highest of the arts. It consists exclusively of powerful emotion and addresses itself exclusively to the emotions."''&lt;/ref&gt;
#Subordination of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to symbolic or stylistic expression of inner experience.
#An underlying effort at achieving the new, original, and visionary.
#Profusion of works on paper, and models, with discovery and representations of [[concept]]s more important than pragmatic finished products.
#Often hybrid solutions, irreducible to a single concept.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.20"&gt;Pehnt, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
#Themes of natural romantic phenomena, such as caves, mountains, lightning, crystal and rock formations.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.19, Taut's mention of ''"earth-crust architecture"'' and what Poelzig deemed, ''"Important to remodel the earth's surface sculpturally."''&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is more mineral and elemental than florid and organic which characterized its close contemporary [[art nouveau]].
#Uses creative potential of [[artisan]] [[Artisan|craftsmanship]].
#Tendency more towards the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] than the [[Classical architecture|classical]]. Expressionist architecture also tends more towards the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] and the [[rococo]] than the classical.
#Though a movement in Europe, expressionism is as [[Eastern world|eastern]] as [[western world|western]]. It draws as much from [[Moorish]], [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], and [[Indian architecture|Indian]] art and architecture as from [[Roman architecture|Roman]] or [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharp p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
#Conception of architecture as a work of art.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.20"/&gt;

==Context==

[[File:Wroclaw - Hala Stulecia z fontanna.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Centennial Hall]] in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]], 1911–13 ([[Max Berg]]). -  Early landmark of Expressionist architecture and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visitwroclaw.eu/en/place/centennial-hall|title=Centennial Hall - visitWroclaw.eu|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Taut Glass Pavilion exterior 1914.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Glass Pavilion]] at the [[Cologne]] [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Deutscher Werkbund Exhibition]], 1914 ([[Bruno Taut]])]]

Political, economic and artistic shifts provided a context for the early manifestations of expressionist architecture; particularly in Germany, where the utopian qualities of expressionism found strong resonances with a leftist artistic community keen to provide answers to a society in turmoil during and after the events of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the war, the subsequent removal of [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the depravations and the rise of social democracy and the optimism of the [[Weimar republic]] created a reluctance amongst architects to pursue projects initiated before the war and provided the impetus to seek new solutions. An influential body of the artistic community, including architects, sought a similar [[October Revolution|revolution]] as had occurred in Russia. The costly and grandiose remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus, was more reminiscent of the imperial past, than wartime budgeting and post-war depression.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"&gt;Pehnt, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic movements that preceded expressionist architecture and continued with some overlap were the [[arts and crafts movement]] and [[art nouveau]] or in Germany, [[jugendstil]]. Unity of designers with artisans, was a major preoccupation of the Arts and Crafts movement which extended into expressionist architecture. The frequent topic of naturalism in art nouveau, which was also prevalent in [[romanticism]], continued as well, but took a turn for the more earthen than floral. The naturalist, [[Ernst Haeckel]] was known by Finsterlin&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; and shared his source of inspiration in natural forms.

The [[Futurist architecture|Futurist]] and [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] architectural movements, and the [[dada]] anti-art movement were occurring concurrently to expressionism and often contained similar features. Bruno Taut's magazine, ''Frülicht'' included constructivist projects, including [[Vladimir Tatlin]]s ''Monument to the Third International''.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.95"&gt;Sharp, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; However, futurism and constructivism emphasized mechination,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; and urbanism&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; tendencies which were not to take hold in Germany until the Neue Sachlichkeit. Mendelsohn is an exception whose work bordered on futurism and constructivism. A quality of dynamic energy and exuberance exists in both the sketches of Erich Mendelsohn and futurist [[Antonio Sant'Elia]].&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.119"&gt;Pehnt, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Merzbau'' by Dada artist [[Kurt Schwitters]], with its angular, abstract form, held many expressionist characteristics.

Influence of individualists such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] also provided the surrounding context for expressionist architecture. Portfolios of Wright were included in the lectures of Erich Mendelsohn and were well known to those in his circle.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudí was also both influenced and influencing what was happening in Berlin. In Barcelona, there was no abrupt break between the architecture of art nouveau and that of the early 20th century, where Jugendstil was opposed after 1900, and his work contains more of art nouveau than that of say Bruno Taut. The circle of der Ring, did know about Gaudí, as he was published in Germany, and Finsterlin was in correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] should also be mentioned in the larger context surrounding expressionist architecture. Hard to classify as strictly arts and crafts or art nouveau, buildings such as the [[Hill House, Helensburgh|Hill House]] and his Ingram chairs have an expressionist tinge. His work was known on the continent, as it was exhibited at the [[Vienna Secession]] exhibition in 1900.

==Underlying ideas==

Many writers contributed to the ideology of expressionist architecture. Sources of [[philosophy]] important to expressionist architects were works by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]],&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Taut's sketches were frequently noted with quotations from Nietzsche,&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.41"&gt;Pehnt, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; particularly ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', whose protagonist embodied freedoms dear to the expressionists; freedom to reject the bourgeois world, freedom from history, and strength of spirit in individualist isolation.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.41"/&gt; Zarathustra's mountain retreat was an inspiration to Taut's ''Alpine Architecture''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Van de Velde drew a title page illustration for Nietzsche's ''[[Ecce Homo (Nietzsche)|Ecce Homo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Franz Kafka]] in his ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', with its shape shifting matched the material instability of expressionist architecture&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists such as [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Ernst Haeckel]] contributed an ideology for the biomorphic form of architects such as Herman Finsterlin. Poet [[Paul Scheerbart]] worked directly with Bruno Taut and his circle, and contributed ideas based on his poetry of glass architecture.

Emergent [[psychology]] from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] was important to expressionism. The exploration of psychological effects of form and space&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"&gt;Pehnt, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; was undertaken by architects in their buildings, projects and films. Bruno Taut noted the psychological possibilities of scenographic design that, "Objects serve psychologically to mirror the actors' emotions and gestures."&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"/&gt; The exploration of dreams and the unconscious, provided material for the formal investigations of Hermann Finsterlin.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries philosophies of [[aesthetics]] had been developing, particularly through the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Schopenhauer]] and notions of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The experience of the sublime was supposed to involve a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might. At the end of the nineteenth century the German Kunstwissenschaft, or the "science of art", arose, which was a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience. At the beginning of the twentieth century Neo-Kantian German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics [[Max Dessoir]] founded the Zeitschift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft, which he edited for many years, and published the work Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic. Iain Boyd Whyte writes that whilst "the Expressionist visionaries did not keep copies of Kant under their drawing boards. There was, however, in the first decades of this century [20th] a climate of ideas that was sympathetic to the aesthetic concerns and artistic production of [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Benson, p118&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic theories of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], such as ''[[Concerning the Spiritual in Art]]'', and ''Point and Line to Plane'' were centerpieces of expressionist thinking.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.18"&gt;Sharp, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==

A recurring concern of expressionist architects was the use of materials and how they might be poetically expressed. Often, the intention was to unify the materials in a building so as to make it [[monolith]]ic. The collaboration of Bruno Taut and the utopian poet Paul Scheerbart attempted to address the problems of German society by a doctrine of glass architecture. Such utopianism can be seen in the context of a revolutionary Germany where the tussle between nationalism and socialism had yet to resolve itself. Taut and Scheerbart imagined a society that had freed itself by breaking from past forms and traditions, impelled by an architecture that flooded every building with multicolored light and represented a more promising future.&lt;ref&gt;Benson p.100&lt;/ref&gt; They published texts on this subject and built the Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. Inscribed around the base of the dome were aphoristic sayings about the material, penned by Scheerbart.
:''"Coloured glass destroys hatred","Without a glass palace life is a burden","Glass brings us a new era, building in brick only does us harm"'' – Paul Scheerbart, inscriptions on the 1914 Werkbund Glass Pavilion.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.95"/&gt;
Another example of expressionist use of monolithic materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not to be missed was a pun on the towers namesake, ''Einstein'', and an attempt to make the building out of one stone, ''Ein stein''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of a 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.

Brick was used in a similar fashion to express the inherent nature of the material. [[Josef Franke]] produced some characteristic expressionist churches in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] in the 1920s. Bruno Taut used brick as a way to show mass and repetition in his Berlin Housing Estate "Legien-Stadt". In the same way as their Arts and Crafts movement predecessors, to expressionist architects, populism, naturalism, and according to Pehnt ''"Moral and sometimes even irrational arguments were adduced in favor of building in brick"''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; With its color and pointillist like visual increment, brick became to expressionism what stucco later became to the international style.

==Theatres, films, paintings and magazines==

[[File:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An example of expressionist architecture in the film set for ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''.]]

Europe witnessed a boom in [[Theatre|theatrical]] production in the early twentieth century. In 1896 there were 302 permanent theatres in Europe, by 1926 there were 2,499.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"/&gt; [[Film|Cinema]] witnessed a comparable increase in its use and popularity and a resulting increase in the number of picture houses. It was also able to provide a temporary reality for innovative architectural ideas.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"/&gt;

Many architects designed theatres for performances on the stage and film sets for [[German Expressionism|expressionist films]]. These were defining moments for the movement, and with its interest in theatres and films, the [[performing arts]] held a significant place in expressionist architecture. Like film, and theatre, expressionist architecture created an unusual and exotic environment to surround the visitor.

Built examples of expressionist theatres include [[Henry van de Velde]]'s construction of the model theatre for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition, and [[Hans Poelzig]]'s grand remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus. The enormous capacity of the Grosses Schauspielhaus enabled low ticket prices, and the creation of a "people's theatre".&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"/&gt; Not only were expressionist architects building stages, Bruno Taut wrote a play intended for the theatre, ''Weltbaumeister''.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt;

Expressionist architects were both involved in film and inspired by it. Hans Poelzig strove to make films based on [[legend]]s or [[fairy tale]]s.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.164"&gt;Pehnt, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Poelzig designed scenographic sets for [[Paul Wegener]]'s 1920 film ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World|Der Golem]]''. Space in ''Der Golem'' was a three-dimensional village, a lifelike rendering of the Jewish ghetto of Prague. This contrasts with the setting of the ''Cabinet of Doctor Caligari'', which was painted on canvas backdrops.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the latter was able to achieve more stylistic freedom, but Poelzig in ''Der Golem'' was able to create a whole village that "spoke with a Jewish accent."&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.164"/&gt;

Herman Finsterlin approached [[Fritz Lang]] with an idea for a film.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt; Fritz Lang's film [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]] demonstrates a visually progressive 'Futurist' society dealing with relevant issues of 1920s Germany in relation to labour and society. Bruno Taut designed an unbuilt theatre for reclining cinema-goers.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Taut also proposed a film as an anthology for the Glass Chain, entitled ''Die Galoschen des Glücks''(The Galoshes of Fortune) with a name borrowed from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. On the film, Taut noted, "an expressionism of the most subtle kind will bring surroundings, props and action into harmony with one another".&lt;ref&gt;Taut, ''Die Gläserne Kette'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt; It featured architectural fantasias suited to each member of the Chain.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt; Ultimately unproduced, it reveals the aspiration that the new medium, film, invoked.

==Abstraction==

The tendency towards abstraction in art corresponded with abstraction in architecture. Publication of ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art'' in 1912 by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], his first advocacy of abstraction while still involved in [[Der Blaue Reiter]] phaze, marks a beginning of abstraction in expressionism and abstraction in expressionist architecture.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.18"/&gt; The conception of the Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelson was not far behind Kandinsky, in advancing abstraction in architecture. By the publication of Kandinsky's ''Point and Line to Plane'' in 1926 a rigorous and more geometric form of abstraction emerged, and Kandinsky's work took on clearer and drafted lines. The trends in architecture are not dissimilar, as the Bauhaus was gaining attention and expressionist architecture was giving way to the geometric abstractions of modern architecture.

==Brick Expressionism==
{{main|Brick Expressionism}}
[[File:Chilehaus - Hamburg.jpg|thumb|235px|[[Chilehaus]] in [[Hamburg]], 1923 ([[Fritz Höger]]) ]]
The term '''Brick Expressionism''' ({{lang-de|Backsteinexpressionismus}}) describes a specific variant of expressionism that uses [[brick]]s, [[tile]]s or [[clinker brick]]s as the main visible building material. Buildings in the style were erected mostly in the 1920s. The style's regional centres were the larger cities of [[Northern Germany]] and the [[Ruhr area]], but the [[Amsterdam School]] belongs to the same category.

Amsterdam's 1912 cooperative-commercial [[Scheepvaarthuis]] (Shipping House) is considered the starting point and prototype for Amsterdam School work: brick construction with complicated masonry, traditional massing, and the integration of an elaborate scheme of building elements (decorative masonry, art glass, wrought-iron work, and exterior figurative sculpture) that embodies and expresses the identity of the building. The School flourished until about 1925.

The great international fame of German Expressionism is not related to the German Brick Expressionist architects, but to the German Expressionist painters of the two groups "[[Die Brücke]]" in [[Dresden]] since 1905 ([[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff|Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Erich Heckel|Heckel]], [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]],...) and "[[Der Blaue Reiter]]" in [[Munich]] since 1912 ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc|Marc]], [[August Macke|Macke]], [[Gabriele Münter|Münter]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky|Jawlensky]],...).

==Legacy==

The legacy of expressionist architecture extended to later movements in the twentieth century. It had an influence on its immediate successor, modern architecture, as well as Art Deco. The [[New Objectivity|new objectivity]] (''Neue Sachlichkeit'') art movement arose in direct opposition to expressionism. Expressionistic architecture today is an evident influence in [[deconstructivism]], the work of [[Santiago Calatrava]], and the organic movement of [[blobitecture]].

Another movement that grew out of expressionism to become a school in its own right is [[Metaphoric architecture]] which includes elements of [[biomorphism]] and [[Zoomorphic architecture]].  The style is very much influenced by the form and geometry of the natural world and is characterised by the use of analogy and metaphor as the primary inspiration and directive for design.&lt;ref name=metaphor&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the founders and significant players in expressionist architecture were also important in modern architecture. Examples are Bruno Taut, Hans Scharoun, Walter Gropius, and Mies Van der Rohe. By 1927 Gropius, Taut, Scharoun and Mies were all building in the [[International style (architecture)|international style]] and participated in the Weissenhof Estate. Gropius and Mies are better known for their modernist work, but Gropius' Monument to the March Dead, and Mies' Friedrichstrasse office building projects are basic works of expressionist architecture. Le Corbusier started his career in modern architecture but took a turn for a more expressionist manner later in life.

===Art Deco===
{{Main|Art Deco}}
First identified at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] in 1925, [[art deco]] shares some characteristics of expressionism and is likely to have been influenced directly by the Expressionist movement – particularly the activities of the Weimar Bauhaus – and more generally with the factors and politics that influenced both movements at the time, such as socialism and mechanisation. In common with [[art nouveau]] and expressionism they are interested in decorative effects that break with the past and reflect a new modernity. The bold use of zigzag and stepped forms, and sweeping curves and chevron patterns. New materials are employed in new ways such as glass, aluminum, and stainless steel. Later examples of Art Deco, particularly in [[New York City]] can be seen as a Transatlantic equivalent of European expressionism.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Expressionism since the 1950s===
The influential architectural critic and historian, [[Sigfried Giedion]] in his book ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (1941) dismissed Expressionist architecture as a side show in the development of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. In the middle of the twentieth century, in the 50s and 60s, many architects began designing in a manner reminiscent of expressionist architecture. In this post war period, a variant of expressionism [[brutalist architecture|brutalism]] had an honest approach to materials, that in its unadorned use of concrete, was similar to the use of brick by the Amsterdam School. The designs of [[Le Corbusier]] took a turn for the expressionist in his brutalist phase, but more so in his [[Notre Dame du Haut]]. In Mexico, in 1953, German émigré [[Mathias Goeritz]], published the "Arquitectura Emocional" (Emotional architecture) manifesto where he declared that "architecture's principal function is emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Mathias Goeritz, "El manifiesto de arquitectura emocional", in Lily Kassner, Mathias Goeritz, UNAM, 2007, p. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Mexican architect [[Luis Barragán]] adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project [[Torres de Satélite]] (1957–58) guided by Goeritz's principles of Arquitectura Emocional. Another mid-century modern architect to evoke expressionism was [[Eero Saarinen]]. A similar aesthetic can be found in later buildings such as [[Eero Saarinen]]'s 1962 [[TWA Flight Center|TWA Terminal]] at [[JFK International Airport]]. His TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport has an organic form, as close to Herman Finsterlin's ''Formspiels'' as any other, save [[Jørn Utzon]]'s [[Sydney Opera House]]. It was only in the 1970s that expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated in a more positive light. More recently{{when|date=January 2011}} still, the aesthetics and tactility of expressionist architecture have found echo in the works of [[Enric Miralles]], most notability his [[Scottish Parliament building]], [[deconstructivist]] architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]], as well as [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Aboriginal]] architect [[Douglas Cardinal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001394|title=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggavma/xh127240204281875000.htm?subsiteurl=%2Fcanadacouncil%2Farchives%2Fprizes%2Fggvma%2F2001%2F2001-01-e.asp|title=The Canada Council for the Arts|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203103759/http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggavma/xh127240204281875000.htm?subsiteurl=%2Fcanadacouncil%2Farchives%2Fprizes%2Fggvma%2F2001%2F2001-01-e.asp|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Vorgeschichte feininger.jpg|thumb|Woodblock 'Cathedral by [[Lyonel Feininger]], used as front cover for the 1919 [[Bauhaus]] manifesto]] --&gt;
*Spring manifesto of [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] is published. Art for the masses. Alliance of the arts under the wing of architecture. 50 artists, architects and patrons join led by [[Bruno Taut]], [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Adolf Behne]].
*April – [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Hannes Meyer]], [[Bernard Hoetger]], [[Max Taut]] and [[Otto Bartning]] stage exhibition called 'An Exhibition of Unknown Architects'. [[Walter Gropius]] writes the introduction, now considered to be a first draft for the [[Bauhaus]] programme published later in the month. Called for a ‘Cathedral of the Future’, to unify the creative energy of society as in the Middle Ages.
*[[Bauhaus]] established and begins expressionist phase, to last until 1923.
*[[Adolf Behne]] publishes ''Ja! Stimmen des Arbeitsrates für Kunst in Berlin'' (''Yes! Voices from the art Soviet in Berlin'').
*[[Spartacist revolt]] ends the overt activities of [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]]. The group starts the first [[Utopian]] letter of the [[Glass Chain]] by Bruno Taut. They are joined by previously peripheral architects; [[Hans Luckhardt]], [[Wassili Luckhardt]] and [[Hans Scharoun]]. The letters demand; 1. Return to medieval integration of the building team. 2. Irregular form. 3. Facetted form. 4. Glass monuments.
*Opening of the [[Grosses Schauspielhaus]] by Hans Poelzig in Berlin. Hanging pendentive forms create a ‘luminous dissolution of form and space’.
*[[Bruno Taut]] launches the magazine [[Frühlicht]] (Early Light).
*[[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Scharoun]] stress the creative importance of the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].
*[[Hans Poelzig]] is made chairman of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]].
*Design work starts on [[Piet Kramer]]s [[De Dageraad]]. Construction is completed in 1923. Mendelsohn see it as more structural than the work of [[Hendrikus Theodorus Wijdeveld|Hendrikus Wijdeveld]].

===[[1920 in architecture|1920]]===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Friedrichstrasse Mies.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]'s Friedrichstraße Skyscraper Project, Berlin-Mitte, 1921]] --&gt;
*February 26, the film [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]] premiered at the [[Marmorhaus]] in Berlin.
*[[Hans Poelzig]] declares affinity with the Glass Chain. He designs sets for [[The Golem: How He Came Into the World|The Golem]].
*Solidarity of the Glass Chain is broken. Final letter written by [[Hermann Finsterlin]]. Hans Luckhardt recognises the incompatibility of free unconscious form and rationalist prefabrication and moves to [[Rationalism]].
*Taut maintains his Scheerbartian views. He publishes ‘Die Auflösung der Städt' (The dissolution of the city) in line with [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]]ian anarchist socialist tendencies. In common with the [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]s, it recommends the breakup of cities and a return to the land. He models agrarian communities and temples in the Alps. There would be 3 separate residential communities. 1. The enlightened. 2. Artists. 3. Children. This authoritarianism is noted in Frampton as although socialist in intent, paradoxically containing the seeds of the later fascism.

[[File:Amsterdam PL Tak Complex.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Amsterdam]], [[Plan Zuid]], PL-Takstraat, 1923. "Amsterdam, Mecca of Social Housing" ]]
*Taut is made city architect of [[Magdeburg]] and fails to realise a municipal exhibition hall as the harsh economic realities of the [[Weimar republic]] become apparent and prospects of building a ‘glass paradise’ dwindle.
*[[Walter Gropius]] designs the ''Monument to the March Dead''[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/1526381043320796;jsessionid=n_5xJRMLsgMegIOfxT] in [[Weimar]]. It is completed in 1922 and inspires the workers' gong in the 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' by [[Fritz Lang]].
*[[Frülicht]] loses its impetus.
*[[Erich Mendelsohn]] visits works of the Dutch [[Wendingen]] group and tours the Netherlands. He meets the rationalists [[Jacobus Johannes Pieter Oud|JJP Oud]] and [[W M Dudek]]. He recognises the conflict of visionary and objective approaches to design.
*[[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s [[Mossehaus]] opens. Construction is complete on the [[Einstein Tower]]. It combines the sculptural forms of Van de Weldes Werkbund Exhibition theatre with the profile of Taut's Glashaus and the formal affinity to vernacular Dutch architecture of [[Eibink]] and [[Jan Snellebrand|Snellebrand]] and [[Hendrikus Theodorus Wijdeveld|Hendrikus Wijdeveld]]. Einstein himself visits and declares it ‘organic’.
*Mendelsohn designs a hat factory in [[Luckenwalde]]. It shows influences of the Dutch expressionist [[De Klerk]], setting dramatic tall pitched industrial forms against horizontal administrative elements. This approach is echoed in his [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] textile mill of 1925 and anticipates the banding in his department stores in [[Breslau]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Chemnitz]] and Berlin from 1927 and 1931.
*[[Hugo Häring]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] submit a competition entry for a Friedrichstrasse office building. It reveals an organic approach to structure and is fully made of glass.

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1922 in architecture|1922]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
*[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] publishes a glass skyscraper project in the last issue of [[Frülicht]].
*[[Toompea Castle]] is rebuilt for the [[Riigikogu]] in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], as the only expressionist style parliamentary building in the world.
*The film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' by [[F.W. Murnau]] is released.

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1923 in architecture|1923]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
*[[Bauhaus]] expressionist phase ends. Standard arguments for the reasons for this are 1. Expressionism was difficult to build. 2. Rampant inflation in Germany changed the climate of opinion to a more sober one. Jencks postulates that the standard arguments are too simplistic and instead argues that 1. Expressionism had become associated with extreme utopianism which in turn had been discredited by violence and bloodshed. Or 2. Architects had become convinced that the new (rationalist) style was equally expressive and more adequately captured the [[Zeitgeist]]. There is no large disagreements or public pronouncements to precipitate this change in direction. The only outwardly visible reaction was the forced resignation of the head of the basic Bauhaus course, [[Johannes Itten]], to be replaced with the, then constructivist, [[László Moholy-Nagy]].
*[[Chilehaus]] in Hamburg by [[Fritz Höger]].
*[[Walter Gropius]] abandons expressionism and moves to rationalism.
*Bruno and Max Taut begin work on government funded low cost housing projects.
*[[Berlin secession exhibition]]. Mies van der Rohe and Hans and Wassili Luckhardt demonstrate a more functional and objective approach.
*[[Rudolf Steiner]] designs second [[Goetheanum]] after first was destroyed by fire in 1922. Work commences 1924 and is completed in 1928.
*[[Michel de Klerk]] dies.

[[File:Den Haag De Bijenkorf 001.JPG|thumb|right|160px|[[De Bijenkorf]] in [[The Hague]], 1926 ([[Piet Kramer]]) ]]
*Germany adopts the [[Dawes plan]]. Architects more inclined to produce low-cost housing than pursue utopian ideas about glass.
*[[Hugo Häring]] designs a farm complex. It uses expressive pitched roofs contrasted with bulky tectonic elements and rounded corners.
*[[Hugo Häring]] designs [[Prinz Albrecht Garten]], residential project. Whilst demonstrating overt expressionism he is preoccupied with deeper inquiries into the inner source of form.
*Foundation of [[Zehnerring]] group.
*June 3, Death of Franz Kafka.
*Hermann Finsterlin initiates a series of correspondence with [[Antoni Gaudí]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.archinform.net/arch/2543.htm|title=Hermann Finsterlin|first=archINFORM – Sascha|last=Hendel|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Zehnerring]] group becomes [[Der Ring]]. [[Hugo Häring]] is appointed secretary.
* [[Max Brod]] publishes Franz Kafka's ''[[The Trial]]''
* Eugen Schmohl completes the Borsig-Tower in Berlin-Tegel

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1926 in architecture|1926]]&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1928 in architecture|1928]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
*[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) convenes in Switzerland. [[Hugo Häring]] fails to move consensus away from [[Le Corbusier]]'s call for rationalism towards an organic approach. Finally the Scheerbartian vision is eclipsed as the non-normative ‘place’ orientated approach is cast aside.
*The [[Großmarkthalle]] at [[Frankfurt]] (by [[Martin Elsaesser]]) is completed.
*Chapel of the Cemetery of [[Glienicke/Nordbahn]] (Germany) is completed. Architect: Paul Poser

He also constructs the [[Unité d'Habitation]], which emphasizes the architectural expression of materials. The [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] use of [[béton brut]] (reinforced concrete) recalls the expressionist use of glass, [[brick]], and [[steel]].

==Symbolism==
The main characteristic of the flag is the blazing golden sun emblem (''Roj'' in Kurdish) at its center. The emblem's sun disk has 21 rays, equal in size and shape, with the single odd ray at top and the two even rays on the bottom. Number 21 is a venerated number, standing for rebirth/renaissance in the ancient and native Kurdish religion of [[Yazdânism|Yazdanism]] and its modern offshoots.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kurdistanica.com/english/culture/ncharacters/flag/kurdish_flag.html | title=The National Flag of Kurdistan | author=Dr. M.

==History==
The flag first appeared during the movement for [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and resembles an earlier version created by the [[Xoybûn]] (Khoyboon) organization, active in the [[Ararat rebellion]] of 1930,&lt;ref name="institutkurde.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutkurde.org/en/kurdorama/the_national_flag_of_kurdistan.php|title=The National Flag of Kurdistan}}, Kurdish Institute of Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and flown by the break-away [[Republic of Ararat]] during the period 1927–1931. The flag appeared then again in 1932 and in the media where one of its creators described it as red, white and green with a sun in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ala û sirûda netewiya Kurdistanê|url=http://cabinet.gov.krd/p/print.aspx?l=16&amp;smap=010000&amp;p=282|website=Kurdistan Regional Government|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar flag was later used by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed [[Republic of Kurdistan|Kurdish Republic]] known as the [[Republic of Mahabad]] in 1946.

==Modern adaptation to international flag standards==
The flag appeared in Kurdish media throughout the 90's with [[MED TV]], [[Kurdsat]], [[Kurdistan TV]] and their affiliates broadcasting with the flag appearing frequently in their programming allowing it to become a symbol of Kurdish statehood.&lt;ref name="Basic Books"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haiderali|first1=Karim|title=The Media of Diaspora|date=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415279307|pages=82–83|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=WWlMnPIeGIQC|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kontra|first1=Miklós|title=Language, a Right and a Resource: Approaching Linguistic Human Rights|date=1999|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9789639116641|pages=228|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=-m3HfFHv1dUC|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A document dealing with the adaptation to international flag standards of the National Flag of Kurdistan was prepared by [[Mehrdad Izady]] and Bijhan Eliasi in 1998.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It was instantly adopted by the international [[Flag Institute]]. In 1999, the Parliament of the [[Kurdish Regional Government]] adopted the standardized flag to be the official and standard presentation of the Kurdish National Flag in all its aspects.

'''Friedrich Georg von Bunge''' (13 March 1802, [[Kiev]] &amp;ndash; 9 April 1897, [[Wiesbaden]]) was a German [[legal historian]]. He was the older brother of [[botanist]] [[Alexander Bunge]] (1803-1890).

From 1819 he studied [[jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Dorpat]], where he attained his habilitation as a lecturer in 1823. In 1831 he became an associate professor of jurisprudence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9793">'''George Sphrantzes''', also '''Phrantzes''' or '''Phrantza''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Σφραντζής}} or Φραντζής; 1401 – c. 1478), was a late [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] historian and Imperial courtier. He was an attendant to Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], ''[[protovestiarites]]'' ("Lord of the Imperial Wardrobe") under [[John VIII Palaiologos]], and a close confidant to [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]]. He was an eyewitness of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, made a slave by the victorious Turks, but ransomed shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Nevra Necipoğlu, ''Byzantium Between the Ottomans and the Latins'' (2009), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Sphrantzes served the surviving members of the Palaiologian family for the next several years until taking monastic vows in 1472. It was while a monk he wrote his history, which ends with the notice of Sultan [[Mehmed II]]'s attempt to capture [[Naupaktos]], which he dates to the summer of 1477; Sphrantzes is assumed to have died not long after that event.

== Life ==
He was born in [[Constantinople]], during the Turkish blockade of that city; his godmother was the nun Thomais.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the ''Chronicle''; translated by Marios Philippides, ''The Fall of the Byzantine Empire: A Chronicle by George Sphrantzes, 1401-1477'' (Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1980), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In 1418 he was appointed attendant to Emperor Manuel.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 6.1; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt; During his service to the Emperor Manuel, Sphrantzes did many favors for Constantine, developing a strong rapport with the future Emperor for, as he writes, "my uncle had been his tutor and my cousins and I were his companions, friends, and attendants."&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 15.5; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Manuel, he became the servant of Constantine and left with him 26 December 1427 when Constantine was appointed [[Despotate of the Morea|Despot of the Morea]]. 

When they arrived in the Morea, Constantine made him governor of [[Glarentza]], and Sphrantzes assisted Constantine in the latter's efforts to conquer the remainder of the Morea, but was captured 26 March 1429 in a skirmish outside of [[Patras]] and held prisoner until his relationship to Constantine was recognized, and he was paroled back to the Byzantine side to negotiate surrender of the citadel.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 17.8-10, 19.1-3; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', pp. 36f, 40&lt;/ref&gt; While traveling to Epirus as an ambassador, to help arbitrate a peace between [[Carlo II Tocco]] and his uncle's illegitimate sons over the succession to rule over Epirus, he was kidnapped by Catalan pirates, along with his retinue, and held at [[Cephalonia]] until the pirates took the group back to Glarentza where they were ransomed.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 21.1; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Constantinople, he was made ''[[protovestiarites]]'' and appointed ambassador by the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 21.10; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

After this point, Sphrantzes was a key supporter of Constantine. He attempted to secure [[Athens]] for his master in 1435;&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 22.1-4; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; he negotiated Constantine's second marriage with [[Caterina Gattilusio]] in 1440;&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 24.7; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed prefect of [[Mistras]] in 1446;&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 27.1; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; and most importantly he was sent on an embassy to [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in search of a third wife for Emperor Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', chapters 28-30; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', pp. 56-60&lt;/ref&gt; During these duties he married Helena, the daughter of the imperial secretary Alexios Palaiologos Tzamplakon, and the Emperor Constantine was his best man.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 24.1-2; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He was preparing to take his son John (and the larger part of his portable wealth) to the Morea, then to Cyprus, traveling by land "so that my son could visit the places and learn all those things which would be of use in his life" when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Mehmed II]] began his siege of Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 34.7-35.2; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', pp. 67-69&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being involved in the defense of the city, George Sphrantzes' account of the siege and capture of Constantinople in 1453 lacks much detail. About the death of Emperor Constantine, he writes simply, "in this capture my late master and emperor, Lord Constantine, was killed. I was not at his side at that hour but had been inspecting another part of the City, according to his orders."&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 35.9; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Sphrantzes was captured and made a slave, but was ransomed 1 September 1453 then made his way to Mistras.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 35.11; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; There he obtained protection at the court of [[Thomas Palaiologos]], Despot of the Morea. He managed to go to [[Adrianople]] in 1454, ransom his wife, and return to the Morea, while evading the Sultan Mehmed.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 37.4-6; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', pp. 74f&lt;/ref&gt; He served as an ambassador to Venice on behalf of Thomas Palaiologos in 1455.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 37.10; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; After the downfall of the Peloponnesian Despotate (1460) Sphrantzes retired to the monastery of Tarchaneiotes in [[Corfu]].

== Family ==
By Helena, he had five children, of whom two sons died in infancy, a third son Alexios died at the age of 5, while John and his only daughter Thamar lived to adulthood; the Emperor Constantine was godfather to both John and Thamar.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', chapter 24; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt; Following the capture of Constantinople both children had become slaves of some elderly Turks, along with his wife Helena, who treated them well, and then were sold to the Sultan's Mir Ahor, or Master of Horse. However, before Sphrantzes could ransom them from the Mir Ahor, the Sultan learned of them and bought them. "Thus there wretched mother was left all alone in the company of a single nurse," Sphrantzes writes.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 35.11-12; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', pp. 70f&lt;/ref&gt; Sphrantzes records he learned of his son's death, at the age of 14 years and a day short of eight months, December 1453.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 37.3; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Much later did Sphrantzes learn of his daughter Thamar's death in the [[Imperial Harem]] September 1455, aged 14 years and five months.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 37.9; translated by Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
At the monastery he wrote his ''Chronicle'' (Χρονικόν), which, like most Byzantine chronicles, begins with the creation of the world but is more detailed when talking of the history of the [[Palaiologos|House of the Palaiologoi]] from 1258 to 1476. It is a very valuable authority for the events of his own times. The distinctive traits of his work are loyalty to the Palaiologoi -- Sphrantzes often exaggerated their merits and suppressed their defects -- hatred of the [[Turkish people|Turks]], and devotion to [[Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vasilʹev, ''History of the Byzantine Empire: 324-1453'' (1958), p. 692&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Runciman]] described his work as "honest, vivid and convincing" and that Sphrantzes "wrote good Greek in an easy unpretentious style."&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, ''The Fall of Constantinople'' (London: Cambridge, 1969), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

There are editions by [[August Immanuel Bekker|I. Bekker]] (1838) in the ''Corpus scriptorum hist. byz.'', and in [[Jacques Paul Migne|J. P. Migne]], ''[[Patrologia graeca]], civi''. The most recent critical edition of Sphrantzes is by [[Vasile Grecu]] (Bucharest, 1966), which appeared with a Romanian translation. Sphrantzes was also translated into German in 1954, and into English by Marios Philippides (Amherst, 1980). There is an edition with Italian translation by R. Maisano, Rome 1990 (CFHB 29).

For centuries it was believed that Sphrantzes wrote two works, one the ''Minor Chronicle'' and the other the ''Major Chronicle''. The ''Major Chronicle'' is more detailed particularly about the siege of Constantinople. But, beginning in 1934, the research of such scholars as J.B. Falier-Papadopoulos, [[Franz Dölger]], and [[Raymond-Joseph Loenertz]] demonstrated that the ''Major Chronicle'' was written decades later by [[Makarios Melissenos]] ("Pseudo-Sphrantzes"), a priest who fled to [[Naples]] from a Greek-Venetian island conquered by the Ottomans. Why Melissenos selected Sphrantzes to elaborate and expand upon is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Philippides, ''The Fall'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4818">'''Gilla Críst Ua Máel Eóin''' (anglicised as '''Christian Malone''') (died 1127) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[historian]] and [[Abbot of Clonmacnoise]].

==Family background==

Ó Maoil Eoin (now anglicised as [[Malone]]), denotes descent from a grandson of a person baptised in honour of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]].

This assumption was introduced long after Maol Eoin had lived. It was contrived to demonstrate a long standing association with the Church. As such "maol" is often described as meaning bald and then quickly followed by the idea of a monks shaved head. While "maol" does mean bald it also can mean thin. However, in both cases it is used in reference with the landscape; bald might mean lacking in trees, and thin might mean a peninsula or island. It defines a feature of the landscape that is associated with the family. The use of maol, in a family name, is found recorded some 200 years before Maol Eoin was born. Maolrunaigh (Mulrooney)was a past family name that was passed down, mostly in part, through the generations. This was a common way to include the name of the bride's father, as a mark of respect. If Maol Eoin means devotee of St John, then it would stand to reason that Maolrunaigh must be a devotee of St. Rooney. However, a St. Rooney does nor exist.

The Ó Maoil Eoin were wrongly accorded kinship with the [[Uí Briúin]], based on the statement that ''"Maoliosa {son of [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]]}, [[Bishop]] of [[Roscommon]], who had a son named Maol Eoin ... a quo O'Maoil Eoin, anglicised Malone."'' However, the family were already in existence before Tairrdelbach was born, so the kinship is mistaken, or possibly a forgery, though at least one very old family tradition&lt;ref&gt;Pádraig Malone&lt;/ref&gt; holds the name was intended to signify a friendship or political alliance at the time of baptism.

They seemed to have been an ecclesiastical or [[Erenagh]] family native to the area, with no links to any great royal houses.

==Abbot Gilla Críst==

Gilla Críst is the earliest known member of the family associated with [[Clonmacnoise]], and perhaps the ancestor of all subsequent Ó Maoil Eoin's associated with it.

He was associated with [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]], as attested in an entry in [[Chronicon Scotorum]] ''sub anno'' 1124 - ''"The great bell-tower of Cluaín moccu Nóis was completed by Gilla Críst ua Maíleoin and Tairdelbach ua Conchobuir."''

Two years later the same text records that ''"Gilla Críst ua Maíleoin, abbot of Cluaín moccu Nóis, the fount of wisdom and charity, the head of wealth and riches of Ireland, rested."''

==Chronicon Scotorum==

''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'' is an account of Irish affairs that ends in an unfinished manner in the entry dated 1150. Gilla Crist has been associated with the text as its compiler,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Thomas Stokes|Stokes, George Thomas]]: ''Ireland and the Anglo-Norman Church.  A History of Ireland and Irish Christianity from the Anglo-Norman Conquest to the Dawn of the Protestant Reformation'' (1889), p 360: "...The ''Chronicon Scotorum'' was originally compiled about the year 1150 by Christian Malone, Abbot of Clonmacnis,..."&lt;/ref&gt; but if so, it was continued at some point after his death. His actual role in relation to the Chronicon is uncertain.

==Later Ó Máel Eóin's and Malone's==

Subsequent abbots included

* Áed Ua Máel Eóin (died 1153)
* Tigernach Ua Máel Eóin (died 1172).

Later [[Bishop of Clonmacnoise]] included:

* Cathal Ua Máel Eóin (fl. 1187–1207)
* Áed Ó Máel Eóin (I) (1214–1220)
* Áed Ó Máel Eóin (II) (1227–1236)
* ''1461. The Dean O'Malone, the most learned man in all Ireland, died at Cluain-muc-Nois-mic-Fidhaigh.''

Ruaidhrí Ó Máel Eóin, [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Tuam]] and [[Clonmacnoise]], administered the Clonmacnoise [[diocese]] from about 1520 to 1540. He was elected [[Bishop of Ardagh]] in 1517 and died in 1540.

Richard Ó Malone of Donore, [[County Westmeath]], "enjoyed the distinction of the being the first musician pardoned by Queen Elizabeth, the date being 1565." [http://billhaneman.ie/IMM/IMM-II.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12139">[[File:Metternich (c. 1835-40).jpg|thumb|right|Metternich in the 1840s]]
Prince [[Klemens von Metternich]] was a German-born Austrian [[politician]] and statesman and one of the most important [[diplomat]]s of his era, serving as the Foreign Minister of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its successor state, the [[Austrian Empire]], from 1809 until the liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] forced his resignation. His influence on historical developments on Europe has been the subject a numerous assessments. Some of the subjects that has been assessed are Metternich's over-all diplomatic skills and actual degree of influence, his role in shaping the [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] in Europe, and his opposition to nationalist and liberal movements.  Historians agree on Metternich's skill as a diplomat and his dedication to conservatism. According to Arthur May, he believed that:
: the mass of Europeans yearned for security, quiet, and peace, and regarded liberal abstractions as repugnant or were utterly indifferent to them. The best of all patterns of government, he insisted, was autocratic absolutism, upheld by a loyal army, by a submissive, decently efficient bureaucracy and police machine, and by trustworthy churchmen. &lt;ref&gt; Arthur J. May, ''The Age of Metternich: 1814-1848 '' (2nd ed 1963), pp 3-4. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
For over two centuries, historians have disagreed on Metternich. Professor Enno Kraehe assembled excerpts from 17 experts, and tagged each one:&lt;ref&gt;Enno Kraehe, ed., ''The Metternich Controversy'' (1971), p. iii.[https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11167766?q&amp;versionId=26170472 online]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Traitor to France"
* "Wise Appeaser of France"
* "Unwise Appeaser of France"
* "Statesman of Philosophical Principles"
* "Vain Neurotic"
* "Responsible Statesman of International Order"
* "Short-range Opportunist"
* "Reactionary Exploiter of Germany"
* "Honest Leader Against Revolution"
* "Bulwark against Potential Fascism
* "Winner in the Diplomatic Contest for Germany"
* "Perceptive But Superficial Tinkerer"
* "Enlightened But Thwarted Reformer"
* "The Destructive Demon of Austria"
* "Statesman in Tragic Impasse"
* "Metternich Guilty"
* "Metternich Not Guilty"

==Criticism==
Particularly in the 19th century, Metternich was heavily criticised as the man who prevented Austria and the rest of central Europe from "developing along 'normal' liberal and constitutional lines".&lt;ref name="sked43" /&gt; If Metternich had not stood in the way of (in their view) progress, Austria might have reformed, dealt with the problems of nationality better, and the [[First World War]] may never have happened.&lt;ref name="sked43" /&gt; Instead, Metternich fought bitterly against the forces of liberalism and nationalism, but achieved only a temporary reprieve.&lt;ref name="okey98"&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Robin Okey, a critic of Metternich, suggests that the social conservatism Metternich advocated may have actually been counter-productive when it came to keeping a lid on nationalist sentiment &lt;ref name="okey98"/&gt; Moreover, in pursuit of this unachievable goal, Metternich was happy to sacrifice [[freedom of speech]]: heavy censorship was just one of many [[Political repression|repressive]] instruments of state available to him that also including a large spy network. Though he did not introduce the bodies, he gave them their "demoralising aspect of permanence" during his long tenure as chancellor.&lt;ref name="palmer225"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed electoral reform, heavily criticising the British [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] introduced in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bertier de Sauvigny|1962|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more enlightened chancellor would have realised he was involved in a battle with "the prevailing mood of his age".&lt;ref name="palmer1"/&gt; Instead of his zero tolerance approach, critics maintain that would have done better to have turned the current in a favourable direction; for example, the Austrian historian [[Viktor Bibl]] described Metternich as "the demon of Austria" for letting Prussia and not Austria unify Germany through his determination that Germany should not unify at all.&lt;ref name="sked43"&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1983|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Metternich has been accused of excessive vanity to the point of complacency, and therefore someone ill-suited to the evolution of constitutional principles.&lt;ref name="okey75"/&gt;

This view presupposes that Metternich had the ability to favourably shape Europe, but chose not to. More modern critiques, such as that included in the work of [[A. J. P. Taylor]], have questioned just how much influence Metternich really had.&lt;ref name="sked43"/&gt; Okey noted that even in the realm of foreign affairs Metternich "had only his own persuasiveness to rely on", and this degraded over time.&lt;ref name="okey75"/&gt; On this reading, he stuck doggedly to a set of "cumbersome" conservative principles that he was forced to articulate in long and detailed memoranda:&lt;ref name="palmer1"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "smokescreen" that hid Austria's true weakness.&lt;ref name="sked44"&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1983|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to choosing a set of sound principles, wrote Taylor, "most men could do better while shaving".&lt;ref name="sked44"/&gt; The result was that Metternich was no captivating diplomatic force: Taylor described him as "the most boring man in European history"; Metternich himself boasted he could "bore men to death".&lt;ref name="sked43"/&gt; This view also highlights Metternich's abject failure to live up to his hype as the "coachman of Europe": Austria did not defeat Napoleon; Austria did not dictate the peace of Vienna; Austria could not stop France invading Spain, Britain settling the borders of Belgium or Russia deciding the fate of Turkey in 1833.&lt;ref name="sked44"/&gt; Not only were his failures limited to foreign affairs, critics argue: at home he was equally powerless, failing to push through even his own proposals for administrative reform.&lt;ref name="okey75"/&gt; On this basis it is argued that Metternich was essentially irrelevant both home and abroad.&lt;ref name="sked45"&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1983|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
On the other hand, Metternich's credentials as a diplomat and statesman were the focus of praise in the twentieth century from more favourable historians, particularly biographer [[Heinrich von Srbik]].&lt;ref name="okey75"&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, particularly after the Second World War, historians were more likely to defend Metternich's policies as reasonable attempts to achieve his own goals i.e. the defence of the balance of power in Europe and the preservation of the ''status quo'' in the face of the revolutionary challenge. Even if the sort of international conspiracy Metternich imagined never existed, the Napoleonic era was a time of change which left a conservative like Metternich with few options.&lt;ref name="sked45"/&gt; More sympathetic historians highlight that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe, succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later. If there was a partition in Europe between conservatives and liberals, they contend that some blame must lie with the liberals such as [[George Canning|Canning]] and [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] for their failure to compromise as [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]] had in 1815.&lt;ref name="sked45"/&gt; As argued by Srbik, Metternich himself pursued legality, cooperation and dialogue, and therefore helped ensure 30 years of peace, the "[[Age of Metternich]]". In the works of authors such as [[Peter Viereck]] and [[Ernst B. Haas]], Metternich also gains credit for many of his more liberal ideals, even if they did not come to much; indeed, Metternich's lack of influence at court is now used to shield him from the harshest criticisms of inactivity. They argue that Metternich commendably pushed for an embryonic parliament and equal rights for the constituent states of the Empire at home, and abroad argued for equality before the law, modern bureaucracies, and fair levels of taxation. In 1847, Metternich himself denied that the Austrian Empire was anything but liberal.&lt;ref name="sked46"&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1983|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this light, Metternich's methods have been seen as paternalistic, protecting Austrians from real dangers outside their borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who have attempted to rehabilitate Metternich likewise contend that, along with contemporaries [[Viscount Castlereagh]] and [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Metternich "unquestionably [a] master of diplomacy",&lt;ref name="Ford1971"&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1971|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; someone who "perfected" and indeed shaped the nature of diplomacy in his era.&lt;ref name="palmer1"/&gt; For them, Metternich was "handsome, witty... [and] tenacious", by his own admission "bad at skirmishes... but good at campaigns".&lt;ref name="Ford1971"/&gt; Likewise, [[Henry Kissinger]]'s PhD dissertation about Metternich, later published in 1957, praised Metternich's role in holding together the crumbling [[Austrian Empire]], though Kissinger's work has generated controversy in academic circles among such historians as [[Paul W. Schroeder]], ''inter alia'' attracting criticism for the absence of footnotes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Certainly, if he was a good diplomat he certainly attracted a great deal of contemporary criticism for lying; fellow diplomats Canning and Talleyrand both commented on it, whilst the poet [[Franz Grillparzer]] suggested that Metternich came to believe his own lies.&lt;ref name="sked46"/&gt; Even so, as critical historian [[Alan Sked]] argues, Metternich's "smokescreen" served a purpose in furthering a relative coherent set of principles, though it came at the expense of being in control of individual events.&lt;ref name="sked46"/&gt; However, Sked is quick to also point out that Metternich's apparent liberalism, as put forward by Viereck and Haas, did not amount to wanting decentralisation, and as such the old concerns that Metternich pushed for a (now outmoded) heavily centralised autocratic system cannot be dismissed.&lt;ref name="sked46"/&gt; Sked does, however, warn against the use of hindsight, arguing that Metternich's actions were, at the time, entirely in keeping with Austrian politics, and that the events of 1848 were a mere blip when Austria lost its nerve.&lt;ref name="sked46"/&gt;

[[Julius Evola]], described as "one of the most influential fascist racists in Italian history, author of ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'', saw [[Metternich]] as a conservative ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2002|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr''' '''Ian Adamson''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 28 June 1944) is a former [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]]. He is a former member of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and is a retired [[paediatrics|paediatrician]].

==Biography==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2017}}
Dr Adamson was born in 1944 in Bangor, County Down and reared in the nearby village of Conlig. He was an Ulster Unionist member of Belfast City Council from 1989, becoming that Party's first Honorary Historian, until his retirement from active politics in 2011.

He had served as Deputy Lord Mayor in 1994-95 and then Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1996-97 and was awarded the Order of the British Empire by Her Majesty The Queen in 1998 for services to local government. He was an MLA for Belfast East from 1998 until 2003. He was the personal physician and advisor on history and culture to Ian Paisley (First Minister of Northern Ireland 2007–08)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Northern Ireland: Our Lesser Known History|last=Forde|first=Hugh|publisher=Bannside Library Ltd|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9934157-0-8|location=|pages=Tribute}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2004 until the latter's death in 2014.

He is the maître-à-penser of a version of the Prehistory of Ireland based on the theory of the Cruthin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=espaces de l'imaginaire unioniste nord-irlandais|last=Hutchinson|first=Wesley|publisher=Presses Universitaires de Caen|year=1999|isbn=2-84133-100-8|location=France|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 1978 he was accepted as a Member of the International Medical Association of Lourdes for services to the disabled children and young people of the Falls Parish in Belfast. He has a special interest in the long-term unemployed and became the founder secretary of Farset Youth and Community Development in 1981.

In 1989, he became founder Chairman of the Somme Association based at Craigavon House, Circular Road, Belfast, under the auspices of Her Royal Highness [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]] and established the Somme Heritage Centre, now Museum, at [[Conlig]], in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1990|title=Battlelines|url=|journal=Journal of the Somme Association|volume= 1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded the Ullans Academy, of which he is now President, followed by the Ulster-Scots Language Society in 1992 and became the first Rector and founder Chairman of the Ulster Scots Academy in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Issues: Ireland, France,Spain|last=Hutchinson &amp; Ni Riordain|first=|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=978-90-5201-649-8|location=Brussels|pages=33–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founder member of the Cultural Traditions Group, the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council and the Ultach Trust, and served as a member of the Ulster-Scots Agency, 2003-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institute of Ulster-Scots Studies, Working Papers Volume 1|last=Hay|first=Martin|publisher=University of Ulster|year=2009|isbn=978-1-85923-232-3|location=Belfast|pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is presently President of the Belfast Civic Trust.

Adamson is a Specialist in Community Child Health (Community Paediatrics) being a member of the Faculty of Community Health and was awarded the fellowship of the Royal Institute of Public Health for his services to the health of young people in 1998. He was awarded a special commendation by His Royal Highness Prince Charles Prince of Wales. He was an Executive Board Member of the London-based Association of Port Health Authorities, 2005–11 (Chairman of the Border Inspection Post Committee, 2005–06 and Imported Food Committee, 2006–11). Vice-President of The Somme Association, Adamson is a former member of the boards of many other local public sector and voluntary civic organisations.

{{War}}

'''Information warfare''' ('''IW''') is a concept involving the [[battlespace]] use and management of [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent. Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target's awareness, so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare. As a result, it is not clear when information warfare begins, ends, and how strong or destructive it is.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn. Jerome. Chapter 9 Defense, Future Mind, Acropolis Books, Washington, DC 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Information warfare may involve [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|collection]] of tactical information, [[information assurance|assurance(s)]] that one's own information is valid, spreading of [[propaganda]] or [[disinformation]] to [[demoralization (warfare)|demoralize]] or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of opposing force information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces. Information warfare is closely linked to [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=riH5CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=he+enemy+and+the+public,+undermining+the+quality+of+opposing+force+information+and+denial+of+information-collection+opportunities+to+opposing+forces.+Information+warfare+is+closely+linked+to+psychological+warfare#v=onepage&amp;q=he+enemy+and+the+public,+undermining+the+quality+of+opposing+force+information+and+denial+of+information-collection+opportunities+to+opposing+forces.+Information+warfare+is+closely+linked+to+psychological+warfare&amp;f=false|title=CYBERWARFARE SOURCEBOOK|first1=A.|last1=Kiyuna|first2=L.|last2=Conyers|date=14 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com|via=Google Books|isbn=9781329063945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States military focus tends to favor technology, and hence tends to extend into the realms of [[electronic warfare]], [[cyberwarfare]], information assurance and [[computer network operations]], attack and defense.

Most of the rest of the world use the much broader term of "Information Operations" which, although making use of technology, focuses on the more human-related aspects of information use, including (amongst many others) [[social network]] [[social network analysis|analysis]], [[decision analysis]] and the human aspects of [[command and control]].

==Overview==
Information warfare can take many forms:
* [[Television]], [[internet]] and [[radio]] transmission(s) can be [[Radio jamming|jammed]].
* Television, [[internet]] and radio transmission(s) can be [[Broadcast signal intrusion|hijacked]] for a [[disinformation]] [[Advertising campaign|campaign]].
* [[Logistics network]]s can be disabled.
* Enemy [[communications network]]s can be disabled or spoofed, especially online social community in modern days.
* [[Stock exchange]] transactions can be [[sabotage]]d, either with electronic intervention, by leaking sensitive information or by placing disinformation.
* The use of [[UAV|drone]]s and other surveillance robots or webcams.
* [[Communication management]]

The [[U.S. Air Force]] has had Information Warfare Squadrons since the 1980s. In fact, the official mission of the U.S. Air Force is now "To fly, fight and win...in air, space and cyberspace",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.com/learn-about/our-mission/|title=About the Air Force: Our Mission - airforce.com|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter referring to its information warfare role.

As the U.S. Air Force often risks aircraft and aircrews to attack strategic enemy communications targets, remotely disabling such targets using software and other means can provide a safer alternative. In addition, disabling such networks electronically (instead of explosively) also allows them to be quickly re-enabled after the enemy territory is occupied. Similarly, counter-information warfare units are employed to deny such capability to the enemy. The first application of these techniques was used against Iraqi communications networks in the [[Gulf War]].

Also during the Gulf War, Dutch [[Security cracking|hackers]] allegedly stole information about U.S. troop movements from [[U.S. Defense Department]] computers and tried to sell it to the Iraqis, who thought it was a hoax and turned it down. In January 1999, U.S. Air Intelligence computers were hit by a co-ordinated attack ([[Moonlight Maze]]), part of which came from a Russian mainframe.  This could not be confirmed as a Russian cyber attack due to non-attribution – the principle that online identity may not serve as proof of real world identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-513930.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525045415/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-513930.html |archivedate=2007-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cyberwar/warnings/|title=The Warnings? - Cyber War! - FRONTLINE - PBS|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mariarosariataddeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/TADIWA|title=Mariarosaria Taddeo, Information Warfare: A Philosophical Perspective - PhilPapers|author=Mariarosaria Taddeo|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information warfare is fundamentally not about information technologies (IT). It is about people, both those in military and civil society, both the supporters and opponents.&lt;ref name="innavasilyeva"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igi-global.com/article/the-value-of-interaction-for-russia-the-usa-and-china-facing-the-information-warfare/105187|title=Inna Vasilyeva, The Value of Interaction for Russia, the USA and China Facing the Information Warfare|author=Inna Vasilyeva|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New battlefield==
The innovation of more advanced and autonomous ICTs has engendered a new revolution in military affairs, which encompasses nations' use of ICTs in both [[cyberspace]] and the physical [[battle]]field to wage war against their adversaries. The three most prevalent revolutions in military affairs come in the form of [[cyberattack]]s, [[autonomous robot]]s  and [[communication management]].

Within the realm of cyberspace, there are two primary weapons: network-centric warfare and [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]], which denotes integrated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Furthermore, cyberspace attacks initiated by one nation against another nation have an underlying goal of gaining [[information superiority]] over the attacked party, which includes disrupting or denying the victimized party’s ability to gather and distribute information. A real-world occurrence that illustrated the dangerous potential of cyberattacks transpired in 2007, when [[Operation Orchard|a strike from Israeli forces demolished an alleged nuclear reactor in Syria]] that was being constructed via a collaborative effort between Syria and North Korea. Accompanied with the strike was a cyberattack on Syria's air defenses, which left them blind to the attack on the nuclear reactor and, ultimately allowed for the attack to occur (New York Times 2014). An example of a more basic attack on a nation within cyberspace is a [[Distributed Denial of Service]] (DDOS) attack, which is utilized to hinder networks or websites until they lose their primary functionality. As implied, cyberattacks do not just affect the military party being attacked, but rather the whole population of the victimized nation. Since more aspects of daily life are being integrated into networks in cyberspace, civilian populations can potentially be negatively affected during wartime. For example, if a nation chose to attack another nation’s [[power grid]] servers in a specific area to disrupt communications, civilians and businesses in that area would also have to deal with [[power outage]]s, which could potentially lead to economic disruptions as well.

Moreover, physical ICTs have also been implemented into the latest revolution in military affairs by deploying new, more autonomous robots (i.e. – [[unmanned drone]]s) into the battlefield to carry out duties such as patrolling borders and attacking ground targets. Humans from remote locations pilot many of the unmanned drones, however, some of the more advanced robots, such as the [[Northrop Grumman X-47B]], are capable of autonomous decisions.  Despite piloting the drones from remote locations, a proportion of drone pilots still suffer from stress factors of more traditional warfare. According to NPR, a study performed by the Pentagon in 2011 found that 29% of drone pilots are “burned out” and undergo high levels of stress. Furthermore, approximately 17% of the drone pilots surveyed as the study were labeled “clinically distressed” with some of those pilots also showing signs of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/19/143926857/report-high-levels-of-burnout-in-u-s-drone-pilots|title=Report: High Levels Of 'Burnout' In U.S. Drone Pilots|date=18 December 2011|work=NPR.org|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ICTs have also brought advancements to communications management among military forces. Communication is a vital aspect of war for any involved party and, through the implementation of new ICTs such as data-enabled devices, military forces are now able to [[information dissemination|disseminate information]] faster than ever before. For example, some militaries are now employing the use of [[iPhone]]s to upload data and information gathered by drones in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-011-0040-9#page-1|title=Information Warfare: A Philosophical Perspective|accessdate=18 February 2015|doi=10.1007/s13347-011-0040-9|volume=25|journal=Philosophy &amp; Technology|pages=105–120|author=Taddeo Mariarosaria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/world/middleeast/obama-worried-about-effects-of-waging-cyberwar-in-syria.html|title=Syria War Stirs New U.S. Debate on Cyberattacks|author= DAVID E. SANGER |work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and ethical concerns==

While information warfare has yielded many advances in the types of attack that a government can make, it has also raised concerns about the moral and legal ambiguities surrounding this particularly new form of war.  Traditionally, wars have been analyzed by moral scholars according to [[Just War Theory]].  However, with Information Warfare, Just War Theory fails because the theory is based on the traditional conception of war.  Information Warfare has three main issues surrounding it compared to traditional warfare:

#The risk for the party or nation initiating the cyberattack is substantially lower than the risk for a party or nation initiating a traditional attack.  This makes it easier for governments, as well as potential terrorist or [[criminal organization]]s, to make these attacks more frequently than they could with traditional war.
#Information communication technologies (ICT) are so immersed in the modern world that a very wide range of technologies are at risk of a cyberattack.  Specifically, civilian technologies can be targeted for cyberattacks and attacks can even potentially be launched through civilian computers or websites.  As such, it is harder to enforce control of civilian infrastructures than a physical space.   Attempting to do so would also raise many ethical concerns about the right to privacy, making defending against such attacks even tougher.
#The mass-integration of ICT into our system of war makes it much harder to assess accountability for situations that may arise when using robotic and/or cyber attacks.  For robotic weapons and automated systems, it’s becoming increasingly hard to determine who is responsible for any particular event that happens.  This issue is exacerbated in the case of cyberattacks, as sometimes it is virtually impossible to trace who initiated the attack in the first place.&lt;ref name="mariarosariataddeo"/&gt;

Recently, legal concerns have arisen centered on these issues, specifically the issue of the [[right to privacy]] in the United States of America.  Lt. General [[Keith B. Alexander]], who served as the head of Cyber Command under President [[Barack Obama]], noted that there was a “mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies” when writing to the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]].  A key point of concern was the targeting of civilian institutions for cyberattacks, to which the general promised to try to maintain a mindset similar to that of traditional war, in which they will seek to limit the impact on civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/world/15military.html|title=Cyberwar Nominee Sees Gaps in Law|date=15 April 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Cawte Beaglehole''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OM|CMG|size=85%}} (13 June 1901 – 10 October 1971) was a New Zealand historian whose greatest scholastic achievement was the editing of [[James Cook]]'s three journals of exploration, together with the writing of an acclaimed biography of Cook, published posthumously. He had a lifelong association with [[Victoria University College]], which became Victoria University of Wellington, and after his death it named the archival collections after him.

==Early life and career==
Beaglehole was born and grew up in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, the second of the four sons of David Ernest Beaglehole, a clerk, and his wife, Jane Butler. His younger brother was [[Ernest Beaglehole]], who became a psychologist and ethnologist. John was educated at Mount Cook School and [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]] before being enrolled at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University College, Wellington]] of the [[University of New Zealand]], which later became an independent university, and where he subsequently spent most of his academic career. After his graduation, he was awarded a scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and left for England in 1926.

After three years of post-graduate study Beaglehole obtained his PhD with a thesis on British colonial history. At this time he was much influenced by left-wing teachers, especially [[R. H. Tawney]] and [[Harold Laski]], and on returning to New Zealand he found it difficult to obtain an academic post owing to his radical views. For a time he had various jobs including a spell as a [[Workers Educational Association]] lecturer, and had time to develop other enthusiasms including civil rights issues, writing poetry, and music, an interest inherited from his mother. In 1932 he took a temporary position as a lecturer in history at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University College]], but within months the position was abolished in a retrenchment by the college council. Many believed the decision was due more to the college's reaction to Beaglehole's reputation (albeit exaggerated) for radicalism.&lt;ref name="DNZB John Beaglehole"&gt;{{DNZB|Beaglehole |Tim |5b16|Beaglehole, John Cawte |28 April 2012||Tim Beaglehole}}&lt;/ref&gt; His academic career finally took off in 1934 after the publication of his first major book, ''The Exploration of the Pacific'', after which he developed his specialist interest in James Cook. He became lecturer, later professor, at the Victoria University College.

He married Elsie Mary Holmes in 1930, and they had three sons.

==Editing Cook's journals==

Beaglehole became known internationally for his work on Cook's journals which brought out his great gifts as historian and editor. It was not all desk work among the archives – he also travelled widely in Cook's wake, from [[Whitby]] to [[Tahiti]], to [[Tonga]] and to the [[New Hebrides]]. The four volumes of the journals that emerged between 1955 and 1967 were subsidised by the New Zealand government which also set up a special research post for their author. The sheer size of these tomes, each of them approaching 1,000 pages, may seem disconcerting at first sight, but they are enlivened by Beaglehole's stylish and often witty introductions, intended to set the journals in their contexts. As well as Cook's own journals Beaglehole also printed, either entire or in lengthy extracts, the journals of several of Cook's colleagues on the voyages. The introductions themselves, together with copious footnotes, reveal the breadth of his erudition. They cover many topics, ranging from the structure of Polynesian society to oceanography, navigation, cartography, and much else.

Much of the zoological and botanical notes for Beaglehole's work on James Cook's three voyages were provided by Dr [[Averil Margaret Lysaght]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Lysaght, Averil Margaret (Dr)|editor1-last=Clement|editor1-first=Christine|editor2-last=Johnston|editor2-first=Judith|title=Women of South Taranaki, their stories = Nga wahine toa o Taranaki tonga, o ratou korero|date=1993|publisher=Hawera Suffrage Centennial Local History Group|location=Hawera|isbn=047302046-7|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook's journals themselves had never before been comprehensively and accurately presented to the public, and to do so required enormous research since copies and fragments of the journals and related material were scattered in various archives in London, Australia and New Zealand. For his edition, Beaglehole sought out the various surviving holographs in Cook's own hand in preference to copies by his clerks on board ship, and others. For the first voyage, the voyage of the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', he used mainly the manuscript journal&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms1 Cook, James, 1728–1779. Journal of the H.M.S. Endeavour, 1768–1771 manuscript.]&lt;/ref&gt; held in the [[National Library of Australia]] at Canberra. This only came to light in 1923, when the heirs of a Teesside ironmaster, Henry Bolckow, put it up for sale. Bolckow had purchased this manuscript at an earlier auction, in 1868, but had not made his ownership widely known, and consequently it was assumed for many years that no such holograph existed. For the second voyage Beaglehole used two other partial journals in Cook's hand, both of which had the same early history as the ''Endeavour'' journal. All three had probably once been owned by Cook's widow, and sold by a relation of hers at the 1868 auction. The difference was that the two partial journals from the second voyage were then purchased by the [[British Museum]] and not by Bolckow, and hence had long been available for public consultation. And for the third voyage Beaglehole's main source was a journal written, and much revised, by Cook up to early January 1779, a month before he died. What happened to the final month's entries, which must certainly have been made, is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Glyn Williams: ''The Death of Captain Cook'', Profile Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This, too, is today in the [[British Library]], the successor to the British Museum as a manuscript repository.

All students of Cook owe an enormous debt to Beaglehole for his all-encompassing editorship. So much so, in fact, that today it is difficult to view the subject of Cook except through Beaglehole's perspective. Some recent biographies of Cook have tended to be little else than abbreviated versions of Beaglehole.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of some recent books on Cook see Glyndwr Williams, 'Reassessing Cook' in ''Captain Cook: Explorations and Reassessments'', ed. G. Williams, London, The Boydell Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is also clear that Beaglehole’s work is, by and large, a continuation of the long tradition of Cook idealisation, a tradition from which post-Beaglehole scholarship has started to diverge.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Thomas: page xxxvi. ''Discoveries: The Voyages of Captain Cook'', London, Allen Lane, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  For Beaglehole, Cook was a heroic figure who could do practically no wrong, and he is scathing about those contemporaries of Cook who ever ventured to criticise his hero, such as [[Alexander Dalrymple]], the geographer, and [[Johann Reinhold Forster]], who accompanied Cook on the second voyage. Recent research has to some extent rehabilitated both Dalrymple and Forster.&lt;ref&gt;For the rehabilitation see Andrew Cook's introduction to the reissue of Dalrymple's ''An Account of the Discoveries made in the South Pacific Ocean'', Sydney, 1996; also, Michael E. Hoare (ed.), ''The Tactless Philosopher: Johann Reinhold Forster [1729–98]'', Wellington NZ, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
During his last decade Beaglehole was showered with honorary degrees from universities at home and abroad and other distinctions. Perhaps the most prestigious was the award in 1970 of the British [[Order of Merit]]. He was only the second New Zealander ever to receive this award, the first being the nuclear physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]]. Just before he died in 1971 Beaglehole was in the process of revising his detailed and authoritative biography of Cook, which was subsequently prepared for publication by his son [[Tim Beaglehole|Tim]], who was Chancellor and Emeritus Professor at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victoria.ac.nz/home/about/council/membersprofiles.aspx#chancellor Chancellor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304201523/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/home/about/council/membersprofiles.aspx |date= 4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archival collections at Victoria University==

Beaglehole's ''alma mater'', the [[Victoria University of Wellington]], named its archival collections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.victoria.ac.nz/library/collections/jcbr/index.html |title=J.C.

'''Jovan I. Deretić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Деретић}}; born 18 January 1939), is a Serbian [[pseudohistorian]]. Deretić is an engineer by training, but is mainly noted for his historical theories.&lt;ref name=Zivkovic&gt;Zivkovic, Marko (2001), ''Serbian stories of identity and destiny in the 1980s and 1990s,'' Chicago, University of Chicago, Department of Anthropology,p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the proponent of an alternative history of the [[Serbs]] that asserts a larger role in history than described by historians. He is sometimes confused with distinguished literary historian [[Jovan Deretić]].&lt;ref name="Gordy2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Gordy|title=Guilt, Responsibility, and Denial: The Past at Stake in Post-Milosevic Serbia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObrfAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|date=23 August 2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0860-3|pages=194–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
According to Deretić, prior to the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], there lived an even more-accomplished conqueror named Serbon Makeridov, who was "father of all nations" and that "all of his descendants, or rather all known peoples, have Serbian origin".&lt;ref name=Gordy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordy|first1=Eric|title=Accounting for a Violent Past by Other than Legal Means|journal=Southeast European and Black Sea Studies|date=2003|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/713999334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient peoples such as [[List of ancient Greek tribes|ancient Greeks]] and [[Celts]] are therefore claimed to be Serbian.  Deretić asserts that existing historical research is evidence for these theories but his interpretations have been criticized by other historians.&lt;ref name=Zivkovic/&gt;

Deretić organized a petition drive of [[Kosovo Serbs]] requesting Russian citizenship: "Ethnic Serbs in Kosovo would feel more protected, if Russia granted them citizenship."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;BBC Monitoring Former Soviet Union,''Programme summary of Russian Ren TV "What's going on" 2030 gmt 27 Nov 11'', BBC Worldwide Limited, London, 29 Nov 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Deretić, Kosovo Serbs felt abandoned by the Serbian government after the [[Kumanovo Treaty]] ended the [[Kosovo War]] and they were attacked by the [[Kosovo Force]]: "NATO peacekeepers attacked unarmed Serbs in Kosovska Mitrovica, and ethnic cleansing is taking place in Kosovo where many Serbs were killed, disappeared or exiled."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  Deretić said he gathered 72,500 signatures from Kosovo Serbs who wanted to adopt Russia as "a second Serbia" that would protect them against anti-Serb violence.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

'''Knut Borchardt''' (born 2 June 1929 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]) is a German researcher, [[historian]] and former professor for history and economics at both the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and the [[University of Mannheim]] from 1962 to 1969. Moreover, he served as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at the [[University of Mannheim]] between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econhist.vwl.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/borchardt/index.html|title= Knut Borchardt: Curriculum Vitae|work=Symposion.de|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Borchardt studied from 1949 to 1954 [[economics]], [[business administration]], [[history]] and [[german studies]] at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] where he obtained his ''Diplom'' (former German master's equivalent) in 1954. Afterwards, he obtained his doctorate in economics and his [[habilitation]] in 1961 at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].

==Academics==
Borchardt worked from 1961 to 1962 as assistant professor at the [[University of Tübingen]]. After a proposal in 1962, he became professor for economics and history at the [[University of Mannheim]]. In 1967, Gaugler became rector (president) of the university and remained in this position until 1969. He was succeeded by [[Hans-Martin Pawlowski]] in his role as rector of the UMA. He left the university in 1969 and remained until his retirement in 1991 at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. 
Borchardt was author of the well-known "Borchardt-Hypothesis", which claims that stabilisation policy in Germany during the Great Depression was credit constrained and that lack of budgetary discipline during the preceding years was instrumental in creating this constraint. In 1987 he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] and in 1999 the [[Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badw.de/mitglieder/o_mit/Borchardt.pdf|title= Knut Borchardt|work=Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften|accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chieftain|Chief]] '''Kofoworola Abeni Pratt''' [[Fellow of the Royal College of Nursing|Hon.

She was appointed [[Matron]] of the [[University College Hospital, Ibadan|University College Hospital]] in Ibadan within ten years, being the first Nigerian to hold that position.&lt;ref name="Matera" /&gt; She was [[Commissioner of Health]] for [[Lagos]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Litcaf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litcaf.com/kofoworola-abeni-pratt/|title=Kofoworola Abeni Pratt|work=[[Litcaf]]|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Leuchter and Rudolf have published pseudoscientific reports purporting to show that chemical residues present in the gas chambers of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] are incompatible with homicidal gassings." [[Richard J. Green|Green, Richard J.]] ''[http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/blue/ "Leuchter, Rudolf, and the Iron Blues"]''. Retrieved on 2008-09-11.
*"The Leuchter Report, a document which allegedly proves that Zyklon B was not used to exterminate human beings, was translated into Arabic and sold at the International Book Fair in Cairo in January 2001." Roth, Stephen. Stephen Roth Institute. ''Antisemitism Worldwide, 2000/1'', University of Nebraska Press, 2002, p. 228.
*"The turning point came in 1989, when Irving launched Fred Leuchter's pseudo-scientific Leuchter Report, which made the spurious claim that the absence of cyanide residues in the walls of the gas chambers at Auschwitz and other camps proved that they could not have functioned as mass extermination centres." Brinks, Jan Herman. Timms, Edward. Rock, Stella. ''Nationalist Myths and Modern Media'', [[I.B. Tauris]], 2006, p. 72.
*"The Leuchter report, was, indeed, an amateurish report produced by a man with no expertise, either historical or forensic." Hirsh, David. ''Law Against Genocide''. Routledge Cavendish, 2003, p. 134.
*"Another common tactic of the deniers is to engage in historical inquiries that on the surface appear legitimate but upon close examination prove to be based on pseudo-science. One prominent example was the investigation of the Auschwitz gas chambers by [[Fred Leuchter]] [...]. Detailed study of the "Leuchter Report" revealed that it was based on erroneous assumptions (cyanide does not penetrate deeply into concrete). It also emerged that Leuchter had falsified his credentials and overstated his expertise. Despite this, his report is still cited by deniers." Cull, Nicholas John. Culbert, David Holbrook. Welch, David. ''Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present'', ABC-CLIO, 2003, p. 168.
*"...the institute relied primary on the talents of a California-based publicist named Bradley Smith who packaged and promoted Leuchter's discredited material as if it were the very essence of "scientific research" or at least a tenable "point of view," intrinsically worthy of inclusion in the academic agenda..." Churchill, Ward. ''A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas, 1492 to the Present''. City Lights Books, 1997, p. 24.
*"After the trial, both Irving and Zündel published the results of Leuchter's trial research as ''The Leuchter Report: The End of a Myth,'' despite the fact that the court rejected both the report and Leuchter's testimony. [...] The discredited report is popular in the Holocaust denial movement, and one edition features a foreword by Irving." Gerstenfeld, Phyllis B. Grant, Diana R. ''Crimes of Hate: Selected Readings'', SAGE Publications, 2003, p. 201.
*"Leuchter's report contained a considerable amount of scientific, or, as it turned out, pseudo-scientific analysis of chemical residues on the gas chamber walls, and similar matters. It was quickly discredited, not least on the basis of Leuchter's failure adequately to defend his findings on the witness stand." Evans, Richard J. ''David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition'', Section 3.3c, [http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/defense/evans/330c.html The 1991 Edition of ''Hitler's War''], Paragraph 13. Retrieved on 2008-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt; document authored by American [[Capital punishment|execution]] technician [[Fred A. Leuchter]], who was commissioned by [[Ernst Zündel]] to defend him at his trial in Canada for distributing [[Holocaust denial]] material. Leuchter compiled the report in 1988 with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal [[gas chamber|gassings]] at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, specifically at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He travelled to the camp, collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers (without the camp's permission), brought them back to the United States, and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial, Leuchter was called upon to defend the report in the capacity of an expert witness; however during the trial, the court ruled that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such.

Leuchter cited the absence of [[Prussian blue]] in the homicidal gas chambers to support his view that they could not have been used to gas people. However, residual iron-based [[cyanide]] compounds are not a categorical consequence of cyanide exposure. By not discriminating against that, Leuchter introduced an unreliable factor into his experiment, and his findings were seriously flawed as a result. In contrast, tests conducted by Polish forensic scientists (who discriminated against iron-based compounds) confirmed the presence of cyanide in the locations, in accordance with where and how it was used in [[the Holocaust]]. In addition, the report was criticized as Leuchter had overlooked critical evidence, such as documents in the SS architectural office which recorded the mechanical operation of the gas chambers and others which verified the rate at which the Nazis could burn the bodies of those gassed.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Background==
In 1985, [[Ernst Zündel]], a German pamphleteer and publisher living in Canada, was put on trial for publishing [[Richard Verrall (political writer)|Richard Verrall]]'s Holocaust denial pamphlet ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'', which was deemed to violate Canadian laws against distributing false news. Zündel was found guilty, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. This led to a second prosecution.

Zündel and his lawyers were joined by [[Robert Faurisson]], a French academic of literature and Holocaust denier, who came to Toronto to advise the defence,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt&gt;[[Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt, Deborah]]. ''Denying the Holocaust&amp;mdash;The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory''. Free Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-02-919235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160}} having previously testified as expert witness at the first trial.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|161}} He was joined by [[David Irving]], an English writer and Holocaust denier, who was to assist the defence and testify on Zündel's behalf.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|161}} Faurisson claimed that it was technically and physically impossible for the gas chambers at Auschwitz to have functioned as extermination facilities, based on comparisons with American execution gas chambers; he therefore suggested getting an American prison warden who had participated in executions by gas to testify.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} Irving and Faurisson therefore invited Bill Armontrout, warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} who agreed to testify and suggested they contact Fred A. Leuchter, a Bostonian execution equipment designer. Faurisson reported that Leuchter initially accepted the mainstream account of the Holocaust, but after two days of discussion with him, he stated that Leuchter was convinced that homicidal gassings never occurred. After having met Zündel in Toronto and agreeing to serve as an expert witness for his defence, Leuchter travelled with them to spend a week in Poland.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} He was accompanied by his draftsman, a cinematographer supplied by Zündel, a translator fluent in German and Polish, and his wife. Although Zündel and Faurisson did not accompany them, Leuchter said that they were with them "every step of the way" in spirit.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}}

After arriving in Poland the group spent three days at the former [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp site, and another at the former [[Majdanek]] concentration camp. At these, they filmed Leuchter illicitly collecting what he regarded to be forensic quality samples of materials&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}}from the wreckage of the former gas extermination facilities,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} while his wife and the translator acted as lookouts.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html| title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=| year=2006 | first=Errol | last=Morris | accessdate = 2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings of where the samples were taken from, the film footage of their physical collection and Leuchter's notebook detailing the work were surrendered to the trial court as evidence.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; Leuchter claimed that his conclusions were based on his expert knowledge of gas chamber operation, his visual inspection of what remained of the structures at Auschwitz, and original drawings and blueprints of some of the facilities.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}} He said that the blueprints had been given to him by Auschwitz Museum officials.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}}

==Report==
The compiled report was published in Canada as ''The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland'', by Zündel's Samisdat Publications, and in England as ''Auschwitz: The End of the Line. The Leuchter Report: The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz'' by Focal Point Publications, David Irving's publishing house.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}} However, the court accepted the report only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence; Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and testify to its veracity in the trial.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

Before Leuchter could do this, he was examined by the court. He admitted that he was not a toxicologist and dismissed the need for having a degree in engineering:

{{Quote|text=THE COURT: How do you function as an engineer if you don't have an engineering degree?

THE WITNESS: Well, I would question, Your Honour, what an engineering degree is. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and I have the required background training both on the college level and in the field to perform my function as an engineer.

THE COURT: Who determines that? You?

|sign=Exchange between Leuchter and Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Zündel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 8973.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|164}}}}

Leuchter admitted under oath that he only had a bachelor of arts degree and implicitly suggested that an engineering degree was unavailable to him by saying that his college did not offer an engineering degree during his studies. [[Boston University]] actually offered three different kinds of such qualification when he was a student there.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}} When asked by the court if the B.A. he obtained was in a field that entitled him to operate as an engineer, he confirmed that this was so, even though his degree was in history.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}} Similarly, Leuchter claimed that he obtained most of his research material on the camps (including original crematoria blueprints) from the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps' archives, and testified that these documents had a far more important role in shaping his conclusions than the physical samples he collected, yet after the trial the director of the Auschwitz museum denied that Leuchter had received any plans or blueprints from them.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Judge Ronald Thomas began to label Leuchter's methodology as "ridiculous" and "preposterous", dismissing many of the report's conclusions on the basis that they were based on "second-hand information", and refused to allow him to testify on the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on humans because he had never worked with the substance, and was neither a toxicologist nor a chemist.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}} Judge Thomas dismissed Leuchter's opinion because it was of "no greater value than that of an ordinary tourist", and in regards to Leuchter's opinion said:

{{Quote|text=His opinion on this report is that there were never any gassings or there was never any exterminations carried on in this facility. As far as I am concerned, from what I've heard, he is not capable of giving that opinion....He is not in a position to say, as he said so sweepingly in this report, what could not have been carried on in these facilities.|sign=Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Zündel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 9049-9050.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}}}}

When questioned on the functioning of the crematoria, the judge also prevented Leuchter from testifying because "he hasn't any expertise".&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}} Leuchter also claimed that consultation relating to [[sodium cyanide]] and [[hydrogen cyanide]] with [[DuPont]] was "an on-going thing". DuPont, the largest American manufacturer of hydrogen cyanide, stated that it had "never provided any information on cyanides to persons representing themselves as Holocaust deniers, including Fred Leuchter", and had "never provided any information regarding the use of cyanide at Auschwitz, Birkenau or Majdanek."&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}}

==Claims and criticism==
The contents of the report, in particular Leuchter's methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

===Prussian blue===
Leuchter's opposition to the possibility of homicidal gassings at Auschwitz relies on residual cyanide remains found in the homicidal gas chambers and delousing chambers at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|167}} While both facilities were exposed to the same substance ([[Zyklon B]]), many of the delousing chambers are stained with an iron based compound known as Prussian blue, which is not apparent in the homicidal gas chambers.&lt;ref name="ironblues"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/blue/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Leuchter, Rudolf, and the Iron Blues|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only this disparity that Leuchter cites, but accordingly from his samples (which included measurements of it) that he claims he measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the gas chambers, which he argues is inconsistent between the amounts necessary to kill human beings and lice.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|167}} This argument is often cited by Holocaust deniers, and similar claims are also made by [[Germar Rudolf]].

According to [[Richard J. Green]]:

{{Quote|text=In order for Leuchter or Rudolf to demonstrate the significance of their findings, it is necessary for them to prove the necessity of Prussian blue formation under the conditions that the homicidal gas chambers were operated. Showing that the delousing chambers have Prussian blue and that the homicidal gas chambers do not, proves nothing, if it cannot be shown that conditions in the gas chambers were such as to produce Prussian blue.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt;}}

In other words, Green states that Leuchter failed to show that Prussian Blue would have been produced in the homicidal gas chambers in the first place—meaning its absence is not in itself proof that no homicidal gassings took place.&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=The Chemistry of Auschwitz|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Majdanek Komora Gazowa.JPG|thumbnail|Gas chamber in [[Majdanek concentration camp]] with blue residue]]
The problem with Prussian blue is that it is by no means a categorical sign of cyanide exposure.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; One factor necessary in its formation is a very high concentration of cyanide.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; In terms of the difference between amounts measured in the delousing chambers and homicidal gas chambers, critics explain that the exact opposite of what deniers claim is true. Insects have a far higher resistance to cyanide than humans, with concentration levels up to 16,000ppm (parts per million) and an exposure time of more than 20 hours&lt;ref name="chemistry"/&gt; (sometimes as long as 72 hours) being necessary for them to succumb. In contrast, a cyanide concentration of only 300ppm is fatal to humans in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Chemistry is Not the Science: Rudolf, Rhetoric, and Reduction|accessdate=2008-05-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604152626/http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|archivedate=2008-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is one of the reasons behind the concentration disparity. Another exceedingly sensitive factor by which very small deviances could determine whether Prussian blue may form is [[pH]]. pH could be affected by the presence of human beings.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; Also, while the delousing chambers were left intact, the ruins of the crematoria at Birkenau had been exposed to the elements for over forty years by the time Leuchter collected his samples. This would have severely affected his results, because unlike Prussian blue and other iron based cyanides, cyanide salts are highly soluble in water.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt;

Since the formation of Prussian blue is not an unconditional outcome of exposure to cyanide, it is not a reliable indicator. Leuchter and Rudolf claim to have measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the homicidal gas chambers, but since they did not discriminate against an unreliable factor, Green maintains that instant bias is introduced into their experiments.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; Similarly, Rudolf acknowledges that Prussian blue does not always form upon exposure to cyanide and is thus not a reliable marker, yet continues to include the iron compounds in his analysis. Green describe this as "disingenuous".&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; Since a building that contains Prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels of detectable cyanides than one without any, Green writes that Leuchter's and Rudolf's measurements reveal nothing more than what is already visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt;

====Polish follow-up investigation====
In February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, director of The Institute for Forensic Research (IFRC) in Kraków conducted a fair experiment where iron compounds were excluded.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; Given that the ruins of the gas chambers at Birkenau have been washed by a column of water at least 35m in height based on climatological records since 1945,&lt;ref name="IFRC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/introduction.html|title=Cracow (Post-Leuchter) Report|last=Markiewicz|first=Jan|date=|work=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz &amp; Birkenau Concentration Camps|publisher=Institute of Forensic Research|location=Cracow|access-date=|via=|author2=Gubala, Wojciech|author3=Labedz, Jerzy|accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Introduction}} Markiewicz and his team were not optimistic at being able to detect cyanides so many years later; nevertheless, having the legal permission to obtain samples, they collected some from areas as sheltered from the elements as possible.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt;

Leuchter's report stated that the small amounts of cyanide he detected in the ruins of the crematoria are merely the result of [[fumigation]]. However the IFRC points out that the control samples they took from living areas which may have been fumigated only once as part of the 1942 typhus epidemic tested negative for cyanide, and that the typhus epidemic occurred before the crematoria at Birkenau even existed.&lt;ref name=IFRC/&gt;{{rp|Final Remarks}}

[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]
Accordingly, the IFRC demonstrated that cyanides were present in all of the facilities where it is claimed that they were exposed, i.e. all five crematoria, the cellars of [[Block 11]] and the delousing facilities.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt; Critics state that any attempt to demonstrate that the crematoria could not have functioned as homicidal gas chambers on the basis that they were not exposed to cyanide is unsuccessful, given that its presence in what remains of these facilities is incontrovertible,&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt; and write that all of the gas chambers were exposed to cyanide at levels higher than background levels elsewhere in the camp, such as living areas, where no cyanides at all were detected.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt; In addition, tests conducted at Auschwitz in 1945 revealed the presence of cyanides on ventilation grilles found in the ruins of Crematorium II (thus also demonstrating that the Leuchter report was not the first forensic examination of the camp as purported in the title of the London edition).&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt; The historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argued that due to Leuchter's ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice, instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers, the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it.&lt;ref name=confirm&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''Telling Lies about Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial''. Verso, 2002, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
By order of Heinrich Himmler, the crematoria and gas chambers at Birkenau were destroyed by the SS in order to hide evidence of genocide.&lt;ref name=Anatomy563&gt;Karny, Miroslav "The Vrba and Wetzler Report" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', [[Indiana University Press]], 1994; this edition 1998, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing more than the bases of Crematoria IV and V can be seen: the floor plans of both facilities are indicated by bricks laid out across the concrete foundations,&lt;ref name=tests&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdot.org/learning/myth-fact/leuchter//body/1037|title=HDOT: Learning Tools : Myth/Fact Sheets : Scientific tests prove the "Gas Chambers" never existed|publisher=HDOT.org|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Crematoria II and III are in ruins. Professor [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] labels Leuchter's comment that the facilities have not changed at all since 1942 or 1941 as "nonsense".&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;

====Zyklon B====
Because hydrogen cyanide is explosive, Leuchter maintained that the gas chambers could never have been operated due to their proximity to the ovens of the crematoria.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|168}} It is correct that hydrogen cyanide is explosive, but only at concentrations of 56,000 ppm and above&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/74908.html|title=Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLHs) - 74908|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; over 186 times more than the lethal dose of 300 ppm. Critics estimate conservatively that within 5 to 15 minutes, gas chamber victims were exposed to 450 &amp;ndash; 1810 ppmv&lt;ref name=science/&gt; &amp;ndash; again considerably lower than the [[Flammability limit|lower explosion limit]].

====Gas chamber ventilation====
{{quote|If Leuchter had gone to the archives, if he had spent time in the archives, he would've found evidence about ventilation systems, evidence about ways to introduce Zyklon B into these buildings, evidence of gas chambers, undressing rooms.|Robert Jan van Pelt|''The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter''&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;}}
[[File:Auschwitz - Crematorium II gas chamber cross-section.jpg|thumb|right|Nazi blueprints of the Crematorium II gas chamber, labeled, ''Leichenkeller'' or "[[Mortuary|corpse cellar]]". A cross section view of the width of the room shows the ventilation channels that straddle the building along its longitudinal axis, marked ''Belüftung'' (aeration) and ''Entlüftungskanal'' (de-aeration channel).]]
Leuchter incorrectly assumed that the gas chambers were not ventilated.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix&gt;[http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/van/ix HDOT: Irving v. Lipstadt : Defense Documents : [The Van Pelt Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302004021/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/van/ix |date=2009-03-02 }}: Electronic Edition - IX The Leuchter Report&lt;/ref&gt; The basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were mechanically ventilated via motors in the roof space of the main crematorium structure&lt;ref name=Anatomy166&gt;Piper, Franciszek, "Gas Chambers and Crematoria" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; capable of extracting the remaining gas and renewing the air every three to four minutes.&lt;ref name=Anatomy232&gt;Pressac, Jean-Claude and Van Pelt, Robert-Jan "The Machinery of Mass Murder at Auschwitz" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ventilation was not used such as in Crematoria IV and V (although a ventilation system was later installed in Crematorium V in May 1944&lt;ref name=Anatomy238&gt;Pressac, Jean-Claude and Van Pelt, Robert-Jan "The Machinery of Mass Murder at Auschwitz" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Sonderkommando]] prisoners wore gas masks when removing the bodies.&lt;ref name=tests/&gt; When presented in court with a document by the chief Auschwitz architect SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Karl Bischoff]], Leuchter misconstrued aeration (''Belüftung'') and ventilation (''Entlüftung'') as part of the furnace blower systems, when they were actually in reference to the ventilation channels in the walls that straddle the gas chambers.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; These are visible on blueprints, and can still partly be seen in the ruined east wall of the Crematorium III gas chamber.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt;

Leuchter was also prepared to act as expert witness regarding crematoria ovens despite admitting during cross examination that he had no expert knowledge.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; Leuchter presented his own estimate of 156 corpses as the total daily incineration capacity of the installations at Auschwitz. During cross-examination, he was presented with a letter written by the Auschwitz Central Construction Office (''Auschwitz Zentralbauleitung'') of June 28, 1943, from SS-''Sturmbannführer'' Jahrling to SS-''[[Brigadeführer]]'' [[Hans Kammler]] stating that the five crematoria installations had a collective daily capacity of 4,756 corpses. Leuchter conceded that this was quite different from his own figure, and that he had never seen the document in question before.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt;

A patent application by the makers of the ovens, (both of which were made during the war) and two independent testimonies confirmed the capacity of the crematoria.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; Because the 4,756 figure is evidence of the Nazis equipping a camp of a maximum of 125,000 prisoners with the facility to cremate 140,000 of them per month, critics of Leuchter explain that this reveals the true exterminationist purpose of Auschwitz: a camp with the capacity to reduce its entire population to ash on a monthly basis was not merely a benign internment camp.&lt;ref name="nizqor1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar01.html|title=66 Questions and Answers about the Holocaust|publisher=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times (such as in the summer of 1944 when the crematoria couldn't keep up with the extermination rate), bodies were burnt in open-air pits. Accordingly, the capacity of the crematoria was never a limiting factor, and the pits yielded practically no limit to the number of corpses that could be burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=van Pelt|first=Robert Jan|title=The case for Auschwitz|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=252–253|year=2002|isbn=0-253-34016-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malcolm Margolin''' is an author, publisher, and former executive director of [[Heyday Books|Heyday]], an independent nonprofit publisher and cultural institution in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeleyside.com/2012/01/11/snapshot-malcolm-margolin-founder-heyday-books/ "Snapshot: Malcolm Margolin, Founder, Heyday Books", ''Berkeleyside'', Jan. 11, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; From his founding of Heyday in 1974 until his retirement at the end of 2015, he oversaw the publication of several hundred books and the creation of two quarterly magazines: ''News from Native California,'' devoted to the history and ongoing cultural concerns of California Indians, and ''Bay Nature,'' devoted to the natural history of the San Francisco Bay Area. In the fall of 2017, he established a new enterprise, the California Institute for Community, Art, and Nature (California ICAN) to continue and expand upon the work that he began more than forty years ago.

Margolin is the author/editor of several books including ''The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area'', named by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' as one of the hundred most important books of the twentieth century by a western writer. His essays and articles have appeared in a number of periodicals including ''[[The Nation Magazine|The Nation]],'' the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

He has received dozens of prestigious honors including a Lifetime Achievement Award from the San Francisco Bay Area Book Reviewers Association, a Community Leadership Award from the [[San Francisco Foundation]], a Gold Medal from the Commonwealth Club of California, an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation, and a Cultural Freedom Award&lt;ref name="lannan1"&gt;http://www.lannan.org/cultural-freedom/detail/malcolm-margolin-awarded-2008-cultural-freedom-award&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Lannan Foundation]]. In 2012 he received the chairman's Commendation from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]],&lt;ref name="neh.gov"&gt;http://www.neh.gov/news/malcolm-margolin&lt;/ref&gt; the second person in the United States to be so honored.

Margolin has lectured widely and has served as advisor and mentor to many other publishers. In addition to founding Heyday (1974), News from Native California (1987), and Bay Nature (2001), he co-founded the Alliance for California Tradition Arts (1997), an organization devoted to California folk arts, and has served on its board since its beginning. In 2001, he co-founded Inlandia Institute, a literary center in Riverside, California. He currently serves on the Publication Committee of the Book Club of California and devotes time and effort to a number of environmental, cultural, and social justice organizations and causes.

Margolin was born in Boston on October 27, 1940, and graduated with a degree in literature from [[Harvard University]] in 1964. He has lived in Berkeley since the late 1960s, where he and his wife, Rina, have raised three children: Reuben (1970), Sadie (1974), and Jacob (1980).

==California ICAN==
[http://www.californiaican.org The California Institute for Community, Art, and Nature] (California ICAN) was created by Margolin to continue and expand upon his four decades of writing, publishing, and cultural advocacy. Margolin has for decades cultivated connections with Bay Area and Native communities, and California ICAN seeks to deepen those ties and bring Native culture to modern readers and audiences. California ICAN also works to uphold and celebrate [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, California's]] literary history and activist culture.  California ICAN’s work revolves around topics such as California Indian cultural heritage, endangered places and species, and the Bay Area’s history, ecology, and people, seeking to build a deeper connection with the world we live in.

'''Manuel de Faria e Sousa''' ({{IPA-pt|mɐnuˈɛɫ dɨ fɐˈɾiɐ i ˈsozɐ}}; {{lang-es|Faria y Sousa}}; 18 March 1590 &amp;ndash; 3 June 1649) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[historian]] and [[poet]]. He frequently wrote in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].
[[File:Manuel de Faria e Sousa.jpg|right|thump|300px|Portrait of '''Manuel de Faria e Sousa''' ''in Ásia portuguesa'']]
He was born of an ancient Portuguese noble family, probably at [[Pombeiro]], studied in [[Braga]] for some years, and when about fourteen entered the service of the [[Bishop of Porto (Portugal)|Bishop of Porto]]. With the exception of about four years, from 1631 to 1634, during which he was a member of the Portuguese embassy in [[Rome]], the greater part of his later life was spent at [[Madrid]], and there he died in June 1649.

He was married to Catarina Machado, the "Albania" of his poems, enabled him to lead a studious domestic life, dividing his cares and affections between his children and his books. His first important work, an ''Epitome de las historias Portuguezas'' (Madrid, 1628), was favorably received; but some passages in his enormous commentary upon Portuguese epic [[Os Lusíadas]], the poem of [[Luís de Camões]],&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11198/ |title = The Lusiads |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1800–1882 |accessdate = 2013-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; excited the suspicion of the inquisitors, caused his temporary incarceration, and led to the permanent loss of his official salary. In spite of the enthusiasm which is said to have prescribed to him the daily task of twelve folio pages, death overtook him before he had completed his greatest enterprise, a history of the Portuguese in all parts of the world.

Several portions of the work appeared at [[Lisbon]] after his death, under the editorship of Captain Faria e Sousa : ''Europa Portugueza'' (1667, 3 vols.); ''Ásia Portugueza'' (1666–1675, 3 vols.); ''África Portugueza'' (1681). As a poet Faria e Sousa was nearly as prolific; but his poems are vitiated by the prevailing [[Gongorism]] of his time. They were for the most part collected in the ''Noches claras'' (Madrid, 1624–1626), and the ''Fuente de Aganipe'', of which four volumes were published at Madrid in 1644-1646. He also wrote, from information supplied by [[P. A. Semmedo]], ''Imperio de China i cultura evangelica en ~l'' (Madrid, 1642); and translated and completed the ''Nobiliário'' of the Count of [[Barcelos, Portugal|Barcelos]].

There are English translations by J. Stevens of the ''History of Portugal'' (London, 1698), and of ''Portuguese Asia'' (London, 1695).

[[File:Martin Mystère 315.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Martin Mystère'' #315, featuring the title character and Java]]
'''''Martin Mystère''''' is both the name and protagonist of an [[Italian comics|Italian comic book]]. Created by writer [[Alfredo Castelli]] and artist [[Giancarlo Alessandrini]], it was first published in [[Italy]] by [[Sergio Bonelli Editore]] in 1982.

[[Dark Horse Comics]] has published the English version of the series in the United States. It is still published in Italy and has been translated in many other languages, sometimes with the name changed (''e.g.'', in [[Germany]], the series is named ''Alan Dark''; in the [[United States]], ''Martin Mystery''/''Martin Mystère''; in [[Serbia]], ''Marti Misterija'', in [[Croatia]], ''Martin Mystère''; in [[Turkey]], ''Atlantis'', and   in [[Tamil Nadu]], ''Marma Manithan Martin'').

The series is one of Bonelli's most popular comic book in Italy, selling over 20,000 copies each month.&lt;ref name="Sales"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/|title=Quanto vendono i fumetti Bonelli|language=Italian|publisher=Fumettologica|date=16 June 2014|access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been adapted to various other media, such as an [[Martin Mystery|animated television series]], video games, and books.

==Overview==
Martin Mystère is an [[art historian]], [[archaeologist]], [[anthropologist]], adventurer, writer, television producer, and [[Collecting|collector]] of unusual objects.  Based in [[New York City]], where he was born Martin Jacques Mystère, he spent much of his early life studying in Italy, where many of his adventures take place.  After the unexplained deaths of his parents in a plane crash (1965), he started to devote his studies to the most enigmatic events and places of human history.  He also helps the New York [[police]] and a United States secret [[government agency]] in their investigations, as well as anyone who comes to him for help and gets him curious.  He is assisted in his adventures all around the world by [[Java (Martin Mystère)|Java]], a mute and very strong [[Neanderthal]] man he discovered in the hidden City of Lucid Shadows in [[Mongolia]].

==Characters==

Java is Martin's closest friend and helper.  He is a Neanderthal man found in a lost city of Neanderthals. He adapted to modern life. In the early series, he mostly followed or found people or things with his instinct or animallike sense of smell; later, he became more normal but lost effect on the stories.  Now he mostly follows Martin everywhere, protects and helps him.

Martin Mystère's main opponents include the [[Men in Black]], the controversial art patron Sergej Orloff, and Mr. Jinx.

Two other antagonists of the series are [[Loki]] and [[Morgan Le Fay]].

His companion is Diana Lombard, who is also his long-time fiancée, later his wife. Mystère is not a womanizer, but he has not always been faithful to Diana either. Diana is a social worker, angry with Martin because he often travels without letting her know in advance, and he is surrounded by beautiful women.

Together with Sergej Orloff, he was educated by the [[guru]] Kut-Humi. Sergej and Martin were friends and after their education they received the weapons called ''Murchadna'' (ancient [[ray-gun]]s from the lost [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]]). However, their friendship ended after Sergej chose the evil path; his weapon can kill whereas Martin's Murchadna can only make the target faint when blasted. Murchadna lost its power later, but showed up a few times more.

The Men in Black are a secret group spreading over the whole world and their aim is to prevent people from learning the true history of the world. The group was founded by Adam--an Atlantean agent--after the great war between Atlantis and Mu. The main aim of the group was to protect mankind from such disasters. After centuries, the organization became corrupt and endeavored to keep the true history of man unknown. The group destroyed all traces of Atlantis and Mu to maintain "world order" (in line with schoolbook history).

Another secret group called "Elsewhere" is a United States secret government agency. This group was founded  by [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Their aim is to save mankind and collect and hide secret and marvellous things. Sometimes they fight The Men in Black, but sometimes they work together. The main contrast between them and The Men in Black is, they don't destroy fantastic objects and beings. They protect and hide them, until mankind is ready to learn.

Kut-Humi is a wise man who has a relationship to [[Agarthi]], which is "a city both in this world and not" (this can be explained as being a utopic city). He has taught Martin and Sergej on spiritual issues. He shows up when needed and guides Martin.

==Universe==

In the true history of the world (according to the comic ''Before The [[Great Flood]]''), two major civilizations emerged on two different continents, named Mu (a pseudo-Asiatic realm ruled by an authoritarian, collectivistic philosophy) and [[Atlantis]] (a proto-Aryan regime devoted to individualism and capitalism); despite their ideological differences, both had developed advanced civilizations, comparable to the 'Eighties' ideas of an early 21st century. As a result of their rivalry, a great war flared up after several [[proxy war|proxy]] conflicts fought over [[Gondwana]], which ultimately saw the employment of [[nuclear warheads]] and other [[final weapons]]; in the end the losing side, triggered a [[Doomsday device|doomsday machine]], which plunged the world in a veritable cataclysm, destroying nearly every sign of the antediluvian civilization.

The Atlantis-Mu overarching storyline was very poignant in the early 1980s, when the comic was born, as the [[antediluvian]] holocaust represented a warning to mankind (then enveloped in the last throes of the USA-USSR arms race); it gradually lost importance during the nineties.

Martin Mystère exists in the same fictional universe with other Sergio Bonelli comics characters, including [[Zagor]], [[Mister No]], and [[Dylan Dog]], a universe which would eventually evolve into the science-fiction milieu of [[Nathan Never]].

Also Martin meets [[Peter Pan]] in London. Peter explains the truth about [[Neverland]]. Neverland is located in the heart of London, the Lost Boys are late 18th-century British students influenced by the French Revolution, and [[Captain Hook]] is a 19th-century pirate who rules Neverland with an iron fist. He and his crew came to Neverland during the early 1800s. Peter Pan is a student who was turned into a flying boy, after he discovered an ancient temple of [[Green Man]] which remained from ancient Celts. Also [[Tinker Bell]] is the fairy guardian of the temple.

Martin meets [[Merlin]] in Stonehenge and also visits [[Avalon]] and  [[Tír na nÓg]].

==Adaptations==
===TV series===
{{main|Martin Mystery}}
The [[animated television series]] ''[[Martin Mystery]]'' (2003–2006) is very loosely based on Martin Mystère. It re-imagines the comic books' main characters Martin and Diana as 16-year-old step-siblings attending Torrington Academy, a high school in Sherbrooke, Quebec. They work for a covert organization known as "The Center", which covertly protects the people of Earth from supernatural threats.

===Video games===
A [[video game]], also, was patterned on the comic series, ''[[Martin Mystère: Operation Dorian Gray]]'', and a role-playing game was published (an offshoot of Dylan Dog as an RPG).

A video game based on the animated series, titled ''Martin Mystery: Monster Invasion'', was produced by Ubisoft and released for [[Nintendo DS]] in 2008.

'''Miccosukee''' is a former small [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in northeastern [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It is located at the junction of [[County Road 59 (Florida)|County Road 59]] (Veterans Memorial Drive) and [[County Road 151 (Florida)|County Road 151]] (Moccasin Gap Road). Miccosukee was a major center of the [[Miccosukee]] tribe, one of the tribes of the developing [[Seminole]] nation, during the 18th century.

==Geography==
Miccosukee, like other unincorporated areas in northern Leon County, is an area of rolling hills dotted with ponds and lakes. The large, [[swamp]]y [[Lake Miccosukee]] borders the eastern edge of the community.

==History==
[[Image:Miccosukee FL.png|thumb|right|272px|Settlement of Miccosukee, Leon County, Florida.]]
The town of Miccosukee or Mikasuki was settled by members of the [[Miccosukee]] tribe, a group of [[Creek people|Creek]] origin who had settled in [[Florida]] and become part of the developing [[Seminole]] nation. The Miccosukee often fought armed battles with white settlers. It was mapped by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] in 1778 and originally called Mikasuki with 60 homes, 28 families, and a town square. Some 70 gunmen protected the town. It was the capital of the short-lived [[State of Muskogee]].

At the time he visited on his voyage of destruction in 1818 ([[First Seminole War]]), "[[Andrew Jackson]] and his men were stunned by the sheer size of the Miccosukee town. Having been occupied since before the [[American Revolution]], it was a town of long-standing permanence." Jackson burned over 300 homes before departing on April 5, 1818.&lt;ref name=Milly&gt;{{cite book

In 1831, a U.S. Post Office was built along with schools, churches, and stores. Eventually the area became a center of cotton plantations, [[Plantations of Leon County|as was most of Leon County]]. Prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] Miccosukee had three cotton plantations nearby, [[Miccosukee Plantation]], [[Ingleside Plantation]] and [[Blakely Plantation]].

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the area reverted to farms and by 1887, the [[Florida Central Railroad (1907–1914)|Florida Central Railroad]] served Miccosukee. During the 1890s, wealthy industrialists bought large tracts of land for [[Northern Bobwhite|quail]] hunting plantations or estates removing thousands of acres of land from agricultural production. Miccosukee thrived until the [[boll weevil]] infestation of 1918. [[The Great Depression]] (1929-1935) destroyed Leon County's agriculture{{cn|date=April 2018}} and the railroad pulled out in the mid-1940s.

==Historical places==
*[[Concord School (Miccosukee)]] was built in 1894 in the town of Miccosukee for grades 1-6. It was closed in 1985. The building is still used for Miccosukee's Head Start program.

*[[Strickland-Herold House]], located northwest of the junction of State Road 59 and Moccasin Gap Road.

'''Monica Charlot''' [[OBE]] née '''Monica Huber''' (1933–2005) was a historian and political scientist.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/13/guardianobituaries.highereducation Monica Charlot],
Anne Corbett, 13 June 2005, The Guardian, Retrieved 29 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Monica Hubert was born at 6 Maitland Villas, [[Chalk Farm]], in the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras|St Pancras Borough]], London, on 31 May 1933. Her father, Joseph, worked at the Swiss consulate. He and Doris May Hubert (née Fickling) had three children. Monica was brought up in England which was her mother's country whilst her father worked as the Swiss consul in Britain, New York and Australia. Monica attended [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]] and studied French.

Whilst working as a language assistant in Paris she met her fiance. In 1956 her new husband was Jean Charlot who was a political scientist. After following her husband to Africa where he was serving his national service in Algeria, Monica Charlot decided to obtain French qualifications for her teaching skills. This route was possible as Charlot had Swiss, English and French citizenships and the latter was essential to take this qualification.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; By this point she and Jean had three daughters.

Charlot studied and competed against French students to become a qualified teacher (agrégée) of English. She spent only a few years teaching at Paris lycees before accepting a lectureship at the [[University of Nanterre]]. Charlot researched the British general elections from 1933 to 1970 and wrote this as her doctoral thesis and defended it in 1971. This successful thesis was important as previously studies by French students of British culture had concentrated on literature. Some of the changes Charlot introduced were seen as a popular answer to the issues raised by the [[May 1968 events in France|1968 student uprising]].

Charlot became a Professor at the [[Sorbonne Nouvelle University]].&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; As professor of British civilisation she targeted adding the study the social and political aspects of culture as a valid part of British and American studies. She was able to ensure that teachers would need to study these aspects as she created an exam paper on British civilisation which teachers had to pass as well as the usual papers on literature and language.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Jean-Claude Sergeant, ‘Charlot, Monica (1933–2005)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/96612, accessed 27 Sept 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, her husband Jean taught electoral politics at d'Edudes Politiques.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

From 1984 to 1991 she was in Oxford directing [[Maison française d'Oxford]] which was a French institution that was targeting cultural exchange with Britain. She exploited the Oxford University environment to diversify the institutions approach.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Charlot was well qualified for this role as she had previously served on a trans-national political body created by [[Edward Heath]] and [[Georges Pompidou]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

She created the ''Centre de Recherches et d'Études en Civilisation Britannique'', a single body to address the study of British civilisation in France. By the time she died in 2003 there were 250 people around France who were members. Moreover, there were over a hundred post doctorate students who had obtained their qualifications with Charlot as their supervisor.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Works==
She created fifteen books in her own right including several that became standard works. Her books included:
*''La démocratie à l'anglaise'', 1972
*''Le temps des incertitudes'', 1981
*''L'Angleterre, cette inconnue: une société qui change'', 1980
*''Victoria: le pouvoir partagé'', 1989 (when partially translated it was called ''Victoria: the Young Queen'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1105">'''Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Jafar Narshakhi''' (or Narshaki) (ca. 899–959), from the village of [[Narshak]] in the [[Bukhara]] oasis is the first known historian in [[Central Asia]]. His unique ''History of Bukhara'' was written in Arabic and presented to the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid]] emperor [[Nuh I]] either in 943 or 948. In 1128 Narshakhi's book was translated into [[Persian language|Persian]] (with abridgements). Nothing is known about Narshakhi except his authorship of this one book, which provides important information on Bukhara that cannot be found in other contemporary sources.

Il was first published in 1892 and translated in French by [[Charles-Henri-Auguste Schefer]] in [[Paris]].

'''George Norman Hillmer''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (born 1942 in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]) is a leading [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[historian]] and teacher and is among the leading scholars on Canada-US relations.

Hillmer completed his B.A. (Hons) and his M.A. in history at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1966 and 1967, respectively, before going on to earn a Ph.D. from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1974. During this period, he also worked as an assistant to former [[Prime Minister]] [[Lester Pearson]], who was then working at [[Carleton University]]'s [[Norman Paterson School of International Affairs]]. In 1972, Hillmer joined the Directorate of History at [[Canada]]'s [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] as a staff historian. He rose to become the acting director of the directorate before shifting in 1990 to a full-time career as a professor of History and International Affairs at [[Carleton University]], a position he continues to hold.

Hillmer collaborates with other scholars on many of his book projects, often with the respected Canadian historian [[J.L. Granatstein]].

In December 2016, Hillmer was named a [[Member of the Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/order-canada-newest-appointees-2016-150-1.3916634 "Order of Canada's newest appointees include Paralympian, Supreme Court judge and astrophysicist"].

'''Polyhymnia''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɒ|l|i|ˈ|h|ɪ|m|n|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|Πολυύμνια}}; "the one of many hymns"), also spelt '''Polymnia''' (Πολύμνια) was in [[Greek mythology]] the [[Muse]] of sacred poetry, sacred [[hymn]], dance, and [[eloquence]] as well as [[agriculture]] and [[pantomime]]. Her name comes from the Greek words "poly" meaning "many" and "hymnos", which means "praise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/MousaPolyhymnia.html|title=Polyhymnia|last=|first=|date=|website=theoi|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is depicted as very serious, pensive and meditative, and often holding a finger to her mouth, dressed in a long [[cloak]] and [[veil]] and resting her elbow on a pillar. Polyhymnia is also sometimes credited as being the Muse of [[geometry]] and [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="talesbeyondbelief"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talesbeyondbelief.com/nymphs/polyhymnia-muse.htm|title=Polyhymnia|last=|first=|date=|website=talesbeyondbelief|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], there are nine asteroids named after the [[Muses]]. The one named after Polyhymnia is a main belt asteroid discovered by [[Jean Chacornac]], a French astronomer, in 1854.&lt;ref name="talesbeyondbelief"/&gt;

On Mount Parnassus, there was a spring that was sacred to Polyhymnia and the other Muses. It was said to flow between two big rocks above [[Delphi]], then down into a large square basin. The water was used by the [[Pythia]], who were priests and priestesses, for oracular purposes including divination.&lt;ref name="talesbeyondbelief"/&gt;

'''Postnationalism''' or '''non-nationalism'''{{Sfn|Bennett|1998|p=232}} is the process or trend by which [[nation states]] and national identities lose their importance relative to cross nation and self organized or supranational and global entities. Although postnationalism is not strictly considered the antonym of [[nationalism]], the two terms and their associated assumptions are antithetic as postnationalism is an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]ic process.

There are several factors that contribute to aspects of postnationalism, including economic, political, and cultural elements.

Increasing [[globalization]] of ''economic'' factors, such as the expansion of [[international trade]] with [[raw materials]], manufactured goods, and services, and the importance of multinational corporations and internationalization of financial markets, have shifted emphasis from national economies to global ones. At the same time, [[socio-political power]] is partially transferred from national authorities to supernational entities, such as [[multinational corporation]]s, the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and [[NATO]]. In addition, [[Broadcast media|media]] and [[entertainment]] industries are becoming increasingly global and facilitate the formation of trends and opinions on a supranational scale. [[human migration|Migration]] of individuals or groups between countries contributes to the formation of postnational identities and beliefs, even though attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.&lt;ref&gt;R. Koopmans and P. Statham; "Challenging the liberal nation-state? Postnationalism, multiculturalism, and the collective claims making of migrants and ethnic minorities in Britain and Germany"; ''American Journal of Sociology'' 105:652–96 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Hackenberg and R.R. Alvarez; "Close-ups of postnationalism: Reports from the US-Mexico borderlands"; ''Human Organization'' 60:97–104 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Bloemraad; "Who claims dual citizenship? The limits of postnationalism, the possibilities of transnationalism, and the persistence of traditional citizenship"; ''International Migration Review'' 38:389–426 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postnationalism and human rights ==
In the scholarly literature, postnationalism is linked to the expansion of international [[human rights]] law and [[peremptory norm|norm]]s.  International human rights norms are reflected in a growing stress on the rights of individuals in terms of their "personhood," not just their citizenship. International human rights law does not recognize the right of entry to any state by [[non-citizens]], but demands that individuals should be judged increasingly on [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] criteria not particularistic criteria (such as blood descent in ethnicity, or favoring a particular sex). This has impacted citizenship and immigration law, especially in [[western world|western]] countries. Germany, for example, has felt pressure to, and has diluted (if not eradicated), [[Jus sanguinis|citizenship based on ethnic descent]], which had caused German-born [[Turkish people|Turks]], for example, to be excluded from German citizenship. Scholars identified with this argument include [[Yasemin Soysal]], [[David Jacobson (scholar)|David Jacobson]], and [[Saskia Sassen]].&lt;ref&gt;Yasemin Soysal, "Limits of Citizenship:Migrants and Postnational Membership in Europe," University of Chicago Press, 1994; and David Jacobson, "Rights Across Borders: Immigration and the Decline of Citizenship", Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the European Union ==
The European integration has created a system of supranational entities and is often discussed in relationship to the concept of postnationalism.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rambour; {{cite web |url=http://erg.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/national_identity/Rambour_Paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306143842/http://erg.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/national_identity/Rambour_Paper.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }} (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Shaw; "Postnational constitutionalism in the European Union"; ''Journal of European Policy'' 6:579–97 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Wilkinson; {{cite web |url=http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=192 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502120037/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=192 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |df= }} (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==
In 2015, Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] while defining [[Canadian values]] declared his country to be the world’s first postnational state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tom Nuttall|title=Politicians must keep better control of migration, and tell the truth|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21699310-politicians-must-keep-better-control-migration-and-tell-truth-welcome-up?fsrc=rss%7Cspr|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Guy Lawson|title=Trudeau’s Canada, Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/magazine/trudeaus-canada-again.html?_r=1|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
Catherine Frost, professor of [[political science]] at [[McMaster University]], argues that while the Internet and online social relations forge social and political bonds across national borders, they do not have "the commitment or cohesiveness needed to underpin a demanding new mode of social and political relations".&lt;ref&gt;C. Frost; "Internet galaxy meets postnational constellation: Prospects for political solidarity after the Internet"; ''Information Society'' 22:45–49 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In sports ==
Postnational trends have been evident in professional sports. Simon Kuper called the 2008 European soccer championship ([[UEFA Euro 2008]]) "the first postnational" European Championship.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Kuper; "Steeds Liever"; ''Vrij Nederland'' p. 24, June 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that during the tournament both for players and fans [[sportsmanship]] and enjoyment of the event were more important than national rivalries or even winning.

{{Numismatics}}
'''Roman provincial currency''' was [[coin]]age minted within the [[Roman Empire]] by local civic rather than imperial authorities. These coins were often continuations of the original currencies that existed prior to the arrival of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Because so many of them were minted in the Greek areas of the empire, they were usually referred to until fairly recently as Greek Imperial coinage, and catalogued at the end of lists of coins minted by the Greek cities. 

When a new region was assimilated into [[Ancient Rome|Roman civilization]], the continuance of pre-existing local currencies was often allowed as a matter of expediency. Also, new [[Roman colonies|colonies]] were frequently given authority to mint bronze coins. These provincial currencies were mostly used by the local inhabitants only for local trade&amp;nbsp;– as their intrinsic values were usually much lower than [[Roman imperial coinage]].

Provincial coins were issued in [[silver]], [[Billon (alloy)|billon]] and [[bronze]] denominations, though never gold.
The majority were bronze. Silver and billon coins were more common in the Eastern regions of the Empire, particularly [[Alexandria]]. In general, the issuance of silver coinage was controlled by Rome. That gave the imperial government a measure of control and influence throughout the empire. Some coins that circulated in the eastern parts of the empire may have been minted at the mint of Rome.

{{clear}}
==Issuance==
By 210 BC Rome was controlling all of the Greek cities in the region of [[Magna Graecia]]. At the beginning of the next century a clear Roman influence on the Greek coinage can be noticed. Both iconography and style of the coins had changed. Greek coinage from this period can be classified as the first instances of Roman provincial currency.&lt;ref name="Sayles2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne G. Sayles|title=Ancient Coin Collecting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VonX-nPVFn4C&amp;pg=PA21|date=July 2003|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|isbn=0-87349-515-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were over 600 provincial [[mint (coin)|mint]]s during the Imperial Era.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Sear,''Greek Imperial Coins'',Seaby 1982,2001&lt;/ref&gt; The mints were located throughout the Empire, with a particular concentration in the Eastern portions of the Empire.

Major provincial cities such as [[Corinth]] or [[Antioch]] possessed their own minting capabilities. Some mints issued only for their cities ([[Viminacium]]) while others issued coins for entire province (e.g. [[Moesia]]). There are several cities known by their coins, as there is no historical mention of them.

== Early life and family ==
Roslyn Cooper was born in [[Leeton, New South Wales]], on 24 June 1938&lt;ref name="EWL" /&gt; to Robert Hewitson Cooper and Dulcie May Butler.&lt;ref name="EWL" /&gt; She attended the [[MLC School, Burwood]], graduating in 1956, going on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in history at the University of Sydney in 1959 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1965 from the [[University of London]], where she was the junior fellow of the [[Warburg Institute]] from 1963–65. Her thesis was on the Italian [[Gonfaloniere]] and statesman, [[Piero Soderini]], entitled ''Piero Soderini, Gonfaloniere a Vita of Florence 1502–1512''.&lt;ref name="EWL" /&gt; She married Albert Pesman in London in 1964; they have two daughters and one son.&lt;ref name="EWL"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pesman, Roslyn (Ros) Louise (1938–)|journal=The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0406b.htm|accessdate=3 November 2014|last = Harrison|first = Sharon M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1966, Pesman was appointed lecturer in history at the University of Sydney and promoted to professor in 1996,&lt;ref name="EWL" /&gt; becoming the fifth Challis Professor of History in 2003, and the first female. Previous Challis Chairs of History had been [[George Arnold Wood]], Stephen Roberts, [[John Manning Ward]] and Deryck Schreuder.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to Annual University Calendars.&lt;/ref&gt; A scholar of the social and political elites of [[History of Florence#Renaissance|Renaissance Florence]], Pesman published a number of works in this field. However, family, teaching and administrative duties limited her capacity to undertake sustained research in Italian archives and she devoted more time to projects within Australia, leading research in fields such as [[Italian Australian|Italian migration to Australia]]&lt;ref name=Aust /&gt; and Australian travel and tourism. She was appointed a fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] in 2002, later serving as its vice-president from 2005–06, served as president of the [[Australian Historical Association]] from 2004–06 and in 2010 she was awarded the [[History Council of New South Wales]] Annual History Citation for services to the discipline.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;{{Citation | title=Who's who in Australia 2013 | publication-date=2013 | publisher=Crown Content | edition=XLIX| isbn=978-1-74095-190-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A28621 | title=Ros Pesman | publisher=AustLit: The Australian Literature Resource | accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was appointed chair of the History Department in 1989 and oversaw the centenary celebrations of the department in 1991. In 1995 she became acting principal of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]] at [[University of Sydney]]. She was elected chair of the University of Sydney of Sydney Academic Board in 1997, the first woman to hold this role,&lt;ref name="EWL" /&gt;  In 1999 she was appointed [[Pro-vice-chancellor|pro vice-chancellor]] of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, one of the then three main faculty groupings at the university.&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt; She retired four years later, becoming [[Academic ranks (Australia and New Zealand)|Emeritus Professor]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="EWL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sydney.edu.au/arts/history/staff/profiles/pesman.shtml | title=Emeritus Professor Ros Pesman&amp;nbsp;– Department of History | publisher=University of Sydney | accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesman was made a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2012 Australia Day Honours]] for "service to tertiary education through academic and administrative roles, particularly the study of the history of Italian migrants in Australia, and to the community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1145163|title=PESMAN, Roslyn Louise|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arch Wanderpfad Fischbeker Heide Station 09 younger burial.jpg|thumb|Detail of the secondary burial. In the foreground is the stone arrangement of the old burial mound. In the background is that of the more recent extension]]
The '''secondary burial''' (German: ''Nachbestattung'' or ''Sekundärbestattung'') is a feature of certain prehistoric grave sites of all types, identified since the [[New Stone Age]], which is a frequent feature of [[megalithic]] tombs and [[tumuli]].  Secondary burials were also a mortuary custom among many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.

== Overview ==
From an archaeological and ethnographic perspective, the types of burial ceremonies for the dead are divided into two categories: primary burials and secondary burials. Primary burials refers to the initial burial, with temporary or final severance of all physical contact of family and community members with the deceased.&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt; Secondary burials may (but do not always) occur after the primary ceremony. Any remains are the focus of the secondary ceremony. These remains are used to alter the spiritual condition of the deceased.&lt;ref name=r1 /&gt;

== Description ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=July 2017}}
Artificial mounds and other, clearly visible, above-ground structures have been re-used since the New Stone Age (and even in later times, often by much later cultures) for burials of bodies, bones or cremated remains (in [[urns]]). These more recent burials, of whatever form, are referred to by [[archaeologist]]s as secondary burials. They are found in grave mounds, usually in those areas of the site that could at the same time be extended. In larger [[dolmen]]s, [[passage grave]]s, [[stone cist]]s, etc. the re-use of the interior space available was usually closer in time to the original burial (e.g. by the [[Globular Amphora culture]]), if necessary also accompanied by the removal or addition of secondary chambers (as in the [[Megalithic tombs of Hagestad]]). The mounds of the megalithic tombs, which were usually covered with earth, were re-used following a similar shape as the original grave mound.

Secondary burial in the Holy Land involved an initial interment in a tomb, for example, prone on a bench, until the body decayed. Subsequently, the decayed remains would be relegated to a nearby receptacle within the same tomb. Later, another person, typically a later member of the same family, would be placed on the same bench, and the process would continue. This practice is described in the article on [[Ketef Hinnom]].

This practice of secondary burial should be distinguished from the continual use of natural caves, even when this falls during the same historical period, because they did not involve artificially constructed monuments.

== Insights and Analysis==
Much of the recordings of burial ceremonies were from the observations of explorers, missionaries, and administrative personnel who lived amongst native peoples.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[[Märta Strömberg]]: ''Die Megalithgräber von Hagestad. Zur Problematik von Grabbauten und Grabriten''. Acta Archaeologica Lundensia, Vol. 8. Bonn and Lund, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th century. Three important figures in analyzing these accounts were Hertz, Schärer, and Stöher. These scholars characterized the secondary burials of the Ngadju-Daya communities. These communities were part of the Dayak culture in Indonesia, and had a very structured approach to secondary burial ceremonies.&lt;ref name=r1 /&gt;  These highly structured ceremonies helped the community feel as though they had some semblance of control over death.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Miles Douglass: ''Socio-Economic Aspects of Secondary Burial''. Oceania, Vol. 35. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation and interpretation of Hertz’ thesis was seminal in the field, and is still used as a basis for understanding and interpreting current cultural practices of secondary burial. The overarching theme for Hertz was that in the Ngadju-Daya communities there was a moral obligation from both the family and community to benefit the deceased in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=r1 /&gt;  In addition to providing for the deceased, this ceremony emphasized the greater good of the community over individualism.&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt; However, it is important to note that neither Hertz, Schärer, or Stöher lived amongst these native people, leaving room for misinterpretation and bias.

Secondary burials are also seen in many cultures over the centuries outside of the Ngadja-Daya. The unique characteristics and frequency of secondary burials are often used to help identify and characterize past settlements.&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt; These traditions have left a strong impression on people’s minds today, and hence have affected how we view past cultures in general.  Some more well-known examples include the megaliths from the late Funnel Beaker culture, the stringent  procedures in the single burial graves of the Battle Axe culture, and the uniqueness of the Pitted Ware Culture.&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt; Some cultures even contain the remains of multiple individuals being subjected to fire, but defleshing as well.&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt;

[[Image:Skinny20080428.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Skinny denim jean [[capris|capri]] pants]]
'''Slim-fit pants''' or '''skinny jeans''' (when made of [[denim]]) have a snug fit through the legs and end in a small leg opening that can be anywhere from 9" to 20" in circumference, depending on size.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHMbJQ50iZoC |date=1996-09-15 |title=The gendered object |isbn=978-0-7190-4475-5 |author=Mary Schoeser |chapter=Legging It}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for this style include '''drainpipes''', '''stovepipes''', '''tight pants''', '''cigarette pants''', '''skinny jeans''', '''pencil pants''', '''skinny pants''', '''gas pipes''', and '''skinnies'''. Skinny jeans taper completely at the bottom of the leg, whereas drainpipe jeans are skinny but then the lower leg is straight instead of tapering and so they are often slightly baggier at the bottom of the leg than skinny jeans. In some styles, [[zippers]] are needed at the bottom of the leg to facilitate pulling them over the feet. Stretch [[denim]], with anywhere from 2% to 4% [[spandex]], may be used to allow jeans to have a super-slim fit. Skinny jeans come in a variety of colors and styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124683780090998061

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:French mens suit 1765 LACMA.jpg|thumb|right|Tight fitting [[breeches]], as worn during the 17th and 18th centuries as part of the [[three piece suit]]]]
Before the 18th century, European men wore [[breeches]] and [[hose (clothing)|hose]]. In Tudor times, these breeches were loose-fitting, but by the 1660s, tight breeches were fashionable. These were popularised by Frenchmen at the court of [[Louis XIII]], as part of the [[three piece suit]] that also included a type of [[frock coat]] called a [[Justacorps]], a [[tricorne hat]], a [[powdered wig]], and a long [[waistcoat]]. During the [[Restoration era]], the tighter breeches were introduced to England, and the rest of Europe, because the cut was deemed more flattering to the leg.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, Norah: The Cut of Men's Clothes 1600-1900, Routledge, London, 1964. {{ISBN|0-87830-025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 16th until the 19th century, the [[Mughlai]] nobility attired themselves in tight-fitting [[Churidar]]s which were worn tied below the knee. These trousers, and other elements of traditional clothing like the [[Shalwar Kameez]], were often worn by Englishmen working in India, especially officers of the [[East India Trading Company]].&lt;ref&gt;^ Yule, Henry and A. C. Burnell. 1903. Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive. London: John Murray. 1021 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The early 19th century===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Louis-Auguste Schwiter.jpg|thumb|[[Regency era]] [[dandy]] wearing [[tailcoat]] and tight fitting pantaloons]]
Tight fitting trousers were fashionable from 1805 until 1850, being descended from the loose work trousers worn as a political statement by [[Sans-Culottes]] during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/522646/sansculotte Sans-Culottes]&lt;/ref&gt;  These "[[trousers|pantaloons]]," popularised by [[Regency era]] Englishmen like [[Beau Brummel]], were worn high on the waist and tailored to accentuate the leg like the [[breeches]] previously fashionable among the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8QTwxJ5hwwC&amp;pg=PA142|page=142|year=1998|title=Nineteenth-century costume and fashion|isbn=978-0-486-40292-5|author=Oswald Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantaloons were tied (or buttoned) around the ankle and commonly put into boots.

===Decline, 1890–1940===
Pants, which had come to mean tight-fitting trousers, but now just a synonym, fitted more loosely from the 1840s onwards as mass-production replaced tailoring. Beginning in the [[Edwardian era]] and continuing into the 1920s, [[baggy pants|baggy "Oxford" or "collegiate" trousers]] and [[plus fours]] were fashionable among the younger generation. As the name suggests, [[Oxford bags]] originated at the UK's elite universities, where young upper class men pursued an active, sports-centred lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsheridanclub.co.uk/newsletters/Newsletter_81.pdf Oxford Bags]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1950s===

Drainpipe trousers re-emerged in the 1950s, with popular [[Western (genre)|Western]] stars such as the [[singing cowboy]] [[Roy Rogers]], The [[Lone Ranger]], [[The Cisco Kid]], [[Zorro]] and [[Gene Autry]] and actresses [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Sandra Dee]] wearing their pants very slim to the ankle from 1955 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-gb/lifestyle/style/what-jeans-looked-like-the-year-you-were-born/ss-AAnMaX6?ocid=spartanntp#image=9 What Jeans looked like the year you were born]&lt;/ref&gt; Tapered jeans became most notable with [[country music]] stars and with the birth of [[rock and roll]] in the 1950s, when [[Elvis Presley]] donned slim-fitting jeans and shocked the country. Drainpipe jeans and rock 'n' roll were inextricably linked to create the "bad boy" image that remains today.

===The 1960s===
In the early 1960s, drainpipes were worn by numerous rock bands and musicians, including [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. Fashion icon [[Audrey Hepburn]] also raised the popularity of drainpipe jeans. Slim fitting pants and jeans were worn not just by members of the teenage  [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] or [[greaser subculture]] but also ordinary people. The trend lasted until the end of the 1960s when "[[hippie]]" culture gave rise to the return to fashionability of flared pants and [[bell bottom]] jeans.

===The 1970s===
In the early 1970s, [[glam rock]] and [[rockabilly]] bands reviving the [[Teddy Boy]] look popularised drainpipe jeans in contrast to the [[flared trousers]] worn by hippies. Red [[tartan]] drainpipe jeans (as they were then called) were popular in the [[punk subculture]] of the late 1970s, and were worn by many bands and scene leaders such as [[Ramones]], [[The Clash]] and [[Sex Pistols]].

===The 1980s===
[[File:Poison.JPG|thumb|right|1980s [[glam metal]] band [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] wearing stonewashed drainpipe jeans]]
Skin-tight [[acid-wash]]ed jeans were also popular in the 1980s with most [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, and in particular those in the [[thrash metal]] scene, such as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]]. This was the trend for those who did not wear [[spandex]], which was popular with the dominant heavy metal scene at the time. They were often worn with white [[high-top|high-top sneakers]] or basketball shoes like [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]. By the late 1980s, drainpipe pants were largely superseded by [[straight leg jeans]] like [[Levi 501]]s, but remained popular among fans of [[hard rock]] until the 1990s. Tight fitting jeans were also worn by pop stars like [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Freddie Mercury]].

===The 1990s===
By the early [[1990s fashion|1990s]], many glam metal bands such as [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Bon Jovi]], and [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], abandoned spandex and wore form fitted jeans. Tight jeans were also worn by members of the [[casual subculture]] from the late 80s until the mid 90s, including [[Ewan McGregor]] in [[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jan/31/from-spud-to-slimane-how-trainspotting-helped-invent-the-skinny-jean Trainspotting jeans]&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the rise of [[grunge]] and [[hip-hop]] music in the mid 1990s and the [[post thrash]] movement, drainpipe jeans quickly went out of fashion in favor of baggy [[carpenter jeans]], as worn by hip-hop/rap acts such as [[Kris Kross]], [[Another Bad Creation]], and [[Snoop Dogg]]. Flared jeans also made a comeback from the mid-1990s onward, furthering the move away from the drainpipe styles.

===2000s===
[[File:Scene kids2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scene (subculture)|Scene kids]] wearing skinny jeans, late-2000s]]
The 2000s saw the continued rejection of slim-fitting pants and jeans throughout the early and middle years in mainstream fashion. However, in 2005, fitted pants were reintroduced to the mainstream market for women. This new style of pants was called "skinny jeans". During its first year, skinny jeans were only sold online, and they were not available in stores. Initially, they were not well received by the public, though there were some early adopters. It was not until 2006 that skinny jeans gained more steam in fashion world, and by this time skinny jeans were being sold at shopping malls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinny legs and all: Jeans get slender|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-04-16-skinny-jeans_x.htm|publisher=usatoday|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2007&lt;ref name="ADDFashion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/all/aughts/62499/ |title=Blink and You Missed It |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; skinny jeans received more mainstream exposure as fashion trends started moving away from the [[bell-bottoms|bell bottoms]] and [[wide leg jeans|baggy pants]] which had been dominant for the past 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2011254_2014381_2014372,00.html |title=Skinny Jean |work=Time |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men's skinny jeans were introduced in 2008 and became the norm by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124683780090998061

===2010s===
[[File:Skinny jeans street style à Strasbourg octobre 2013.jpg|thumb|center|500px|&lt;center&gt;Skinny jeans for men, street style in [[Strasbourg]], October 2013]]
Skinny jeans first spread to men's fashion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/apparel/levis-skinny-511-jeans.html Men's skinny jeans]&lt;/ref&gt; This has continued into the 2010s, entering the mainstream fashion in 2011. Since, it has remain popular and eventually became one of the decade's defining fashion pieces for both men and women. They have become so popular that many men have expanded their wardrobe to include tight fitting [[chino trousers]] coming with variety of colors, but often in khaki, brown or white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/apparel/dockers-alpha-khakis.html Dockers khakis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/interview_500/568c_the-new-gap.html New gap]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's skinny jeans saw the high-waist trend coming back in style. Just like men's the female skinny jeans came in various colors, often in neutral colors like khaki and white.

In Europe, skinny jeans for boys and men have a loose waist to appear "baggy" at the top but skinny on the legs.

==Medical problems==
Victorian doctors theorised that tight trousers caused an outbreak of [[apoplexy]] in New York. However, the veracity of this claim is questionable, given the often speculative nature of early modern medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E01E3DE1338E033A25754C1A9629C94659FD7CF|publisher=New York Times|title=A New Disease|date=April 17, 1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, some physicians believe tight trousers may cause numbness due to compression of [[nerves]].  For example, this may affect the outer thigh in the condition [[meralgia paraesthetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pmid=6700050|title=Meralgia paresthetica and tight trousers|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=1984|volume=251|issue=12|page=1553|doi=10.1001/jama.1984.03340360021010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study by Korean doctors suggests that skinny jeans can cause [[varicose veins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 스키니진이 우리에게 미치는 악영향| author = Kim So-hee | publisher = medicaldaily | date=2013-04-06 |url =http://pann.news.nate.com/info/254535426 | accessdate = 2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among men, tight trousers may also cause [[dyspermia]] due to overheating of the [[testes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.1995.tb00400.x|title=Tight underpants and trousers and risk of aspermia|author=F Parazzini, M Marchini, L Luchini, L Tozzi, R|journal=International Journal of Andrology|year=1995|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119243251/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|volume=18|issue=3|pages=137–140|pmid=7558376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2015 documented the case of skinny jeans causing [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[bilateral peroneal]] and [[tibial neuropathies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion victim: rhabdomyolysis and bilateral peroneal and tibial neuropathies as a result of squatting in ‘skinny jeans’|url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2015/05/27/jnnp-2015-310628.full|website=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp;amp; Psychiatry|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
In the early and mid-2010s, some Middle Eastern [[Islamist]] groups disapproved of tight trousers, because they are considered immodest, overtly sexual, or a threat to local traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-41783620/should-women-in-pakistan-be-told-what-to-wear Skinny jeans banned at Pakistan university]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3658118/Saudi-Arabia-arrests-50-men-wearing-Islamic-clothing.html Saudis ban crocs and ripped skinny jeans]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saudi Arabia]], the police are instructed to arrest teenagers who dress this way because the tight jeans are seen as [[un-Islamic]] and, when worn by men, a sign of [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novafm.com.au/article/emo-girls-arrested-being-emo Girls arrested for being emo]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gaza strip]], [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] youths caught wearing skinny jeans have been arrested and beaten by the [[Hamas]] police.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/gaza-hairstyle-crackdown-sees-heads-shaved-015833484.html#fZWkVKi Gaza hairstyle crackdown]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sudan]] the police have imprisoned and fined women for wearing tight trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7659060.stm|title=Sudan outrage at trouser arrests|author=Peter Martell|date=8 October 2008 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, unknown individuals murdered between twelve and one hundred people in Iraq.

The '''Tajikistan Insurgency''' was a military conflict which took place in eastern Tajikistan between the [[Armed Forces of the Republic of Tajikistan|Tajik Army]] and Islamist militants, led by numerous leaders from the [[Tajikistani Civil War]]. The conflict evolved in 2010 and climaxes in 2012, with the defeat of main rebel forces. Other incidents took place in September 2015, when former deputy defense minister [[Abduhalim Nazarzoda]] led an armed uprising, suspected with ties to the Islamic Renaissance Party.

==Insurgency==

===2010 Rasht Valley offensive===
On 19 September, more than 25 Tajik soldiers were killed in an ambush by suspected Islamist fighters, allied with the [[Islamic movement of Uzbekistan]]. The soldiers were part of a 75-man convoy moving through the [[Rasht Valley]], in eastern Tajikistan. They were ambushed while searching for members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan who previously escaped from a detention prison in Dushanbe on 25 August. The military column was ambushed by gunmen around midday local time, while passing through the mountainous Rasht Valley, approximately 250&amp;nbsp;km (150 miles) east of the capital. The column sustained heavy fire from machine-guns and grenade launchers, in the mountains from above. Initial reports indicated that 40 soldiers were killed but the Tajik minister of defense denied this. Five Tajik officers were among the dead. None of the attackers were reported to have been killed or wounded.

On 4 October, 5 Tajik soldiers along with two insurgents were killed during a military operation in [[Rasht Valley]]. The incident occurred, when a vehicle was stopped at a military checkpoint on the road between [[Garm, Tajikistan|Garm]] and [[Dushanbe]]. As the soldiers  approached the car, gunmen opened fire killing five of them and wounding an additional three more. The soldiers retaliated opening fire at the vehicle, killing the two attackers. Among the dead was a high ranked Tajik officer. Meanwhile, dozens of caches of heavy weapons including grenade launchers, as well as food and medication were discovered in an abandoned Islamist hideout. Twelve military checkpoints were set on the roads leading from the administered region of Rasht to the capital [[Dushambe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Worries_Grow_As_Tajik_Government_Continues_Operation_Against_Militants_/2176159.html |title=Worries Grow As Tajik Government Continues Operation Against Militants |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.huanet.com/english2010/world/2010-10/04/c_13542447.htm] {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October, 28 servicemen from the [[Presidential National Guard]] were killed when their [[Tajik National Guard helicopter crash|helicopter crashed]] during an operation in Rasht Valley near the towns of [[Ezgand]] and [[Tavildara]]. The helicopter became caught in power lines and crashed while attempting to land, leaving no survivors. The helicopter was bringing service men from the capital Dushanbe to the Rasht Valley to take part in the operation.

The same day, 6 other soldiers were killed in a separate incident caused by an accidental mine explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Philippines_Investigating_chopper_tender_999.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20101012134932/http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Philippines_Investigating_chopper_tender_999.html |archivedate=2010-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December, gunmen shot and killed 3 Tajik soldiers in the village of Dulona-Maidon in the [[Buljuvon Region]], 150 kilometers southeast of Dushanbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan_militants/2237957.html |title=Tajik Forces Search For Armed Militants After Deaths |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December, 2 Tajik soldiers were killed when a group of thirty Islamists tried to enter Tajikistan from the Afghan border. After three hours of fighting, a combat helicopter arrived, opening fire on the intruders forcing them to retreat into Afghanistan. Local residents said that three Tajik soldiers were killed with two being the victims of friendly-fire from the helicopter. The Tajik military however claims no one was killed by friendly fire. Several Islamists were also killed in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan_afghanistan_border_gun_battle/2266322.html |title=Tajik Guards Killed In Fight On Afghan Border |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2011-01-03 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|2012 Gorno-Badakhshan clashes}}
On 21 July, the head of the Tajik Intelligence agency was assassinated by insurgents in the city of [[Ishkashim, Tajikistan|Ishkashim]]. The Tajik government then launched a joint military operation on the 25 July in the city of [[Khorog]] with the aim of capturing [[Tolib Ayombekov]], who was said to be behind the 21 July killing and the 19 September ambush. More than 800 Tajik soldiers and several combat helicopters took part in the operation that lasted one day until Tajik president [[Emomali Rahmon]] halted all immediate operations in the area on the 25th. At the end of the day, more than 20 Tajik soldiers were killed and countless numbers were wounded. It's unknown the exact number of militants and civilians killed but military sources claimed more than 30 insurgents along with 30 civilians were killed. The operation was considered to be a success with Ayombekov and his army surrendering themselves to Tajik authorities in August.

'''Tarlach Ó Mealláin''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1641-1650) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Franciscan]], author of [[Cín Lae Uí Mhealláin]].

==Origins and background==
Ó Mealláin was of a [[Tír Eoghain]] ecclesiastical family who were the [[hereditary]] keepers of the [[Bell of Saint Patrick]] ([[Clog na hUachta]]). They ruled an area known as An Mheallánacht, located between Slieve Gallon and [[Lough Neagh]]. They expanded southwards, one branch settling in [[Donaghmore, County Tyrone|Donaghmore]], a second in Clonfeacle. Their lands between the [[Moy, County Tyrone|Moy]] and [[Dungannon]] were known as Grange O Mellan. Churchland near [[Armagh]] was called Lurga Uí Mhealláin (Lurgyvallen). It is not known to which branch he belonged.

Tarlach joined a community of Franciscans who had been expelled from their [[convent]] in Armagh in the 16th century and settled in [[Tyrone]] under the protection of the [[O'Neill dynasty|Ó Neill]]s of Cashlan. They built a [[friary]] in the townland of Gort Tamlach na Muc on the south side of Friary Loch. It was attacked and burned by the [[Scottish people|Scots]] on the morning of 15 June 1643.

He has been described as one "who reflected the Ulster Catholic view of events. He was one of a generation of ardent Franciscans who were tireless in their efforts to record the Irish past for coming generations."

==Cín Lae Uí Mhealláin and the Irish Confederate Wars==
Tarlach was the chaplain to [[Felim O'Neill of Kinard]] during the war, and thus was present at many of the events he describes in the Cín Lae. Examples include the battle of [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] (13 June 1643) and the [[Battle of Benburb]] in 1646, of which he says ''Do bhenadar na sloite da cheile ar Dhruim Fhliuch'' ("The armies met on Drum Flugh"), thereby precisely identifying the battlefield.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Tarlach had a detailed knowledge of the Ulster leaders. As he was familiar too with many of the places in which they fought, he is an invaluable source for the general historian, toponomyst and genealogist and, because of his language, he is an invaluable source for the linguist and the historian of Irish as well."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Cín Lae was written in abbreviated form, apparently as a memory aid to the author who may have intended to produce a fuller history of the period at a later date. Sadly, no such history appears to have been written ... [although] ... he ... had the opportunity of revising at least part of the script."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is written on both sides of twenty-two small sheets of paper (approximately 18.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 14&amp;nbsp;cm). The narrative comes to an abrupt end on the 28th line of page forty-four: ''"Tanic trí mile saigdeor ón Pharlemeint i nÁth C. i n-aghaidh Laighneach agus each ..."''

''"On the eve of the Feast of Saint John Capistranus the lords of Ulster planned to seize in one night, unknown to the English and the Scots, all their walled towns, castles and bawns. The date chosen was 22nd October, Friday to be precise, and the last day of the moon."'' (Saturday 23 October 1641, Old Style)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==After 1647==
A reference to the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]] (June 1650) within the Cín Lae indicates that he was still alive at that date, though his diary ends in 1647. He has been proposed as the attributed author of ''[[An Díbirt go Connachta]]'' which refers to the transplantations of the mid-1650s, but this is uncertain.

'''Thomas Chandler Haliburton''' (17 December 1796 &amp;ndash; 27 August 1865) was a [[Nova Scotia]]n [[politician]], [[judge]], and [[author]]. He made an important political contribution to the state of [[history of Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]] before its entry into [[Confederation of Canada]]. He was the first international best-selling author of fiction from what is now [[Canada]]. In 1856, he emigrated to England, where he served as a [[Member of Parliament|Conservative Member of Parliament]].

He was the father of the British civil servant [[Arthur Lawrence Haliburton, 1st Baron Haliburton|Lord Haliburton]] and of the anthropologist [[Robert Grant Haliburton]].

==Life==
On 17 December 1796, Thomas Chandler Haliburton was born in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]], the son of [[William Hersey Otis Haliburton]],  a lawyer, judge and political figure, and Lucy Chandler Grant. As a small child, his mother died. At the age of seven his father remarried to Susanna Davis. Davis was the daughter of [[Michael Francklin]], who had been [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Lieutenant Governor]].&lt;ref name = DCB&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Haliburton, Thomas Chandler |first=Fred |last=Cogswell |volume=9 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/haliburton_thomas_chandler_9E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adolescent, he attended [[University of King's College]] in Windsor. After graduating, he became a lawyer, opening a practice in [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]], the former capital of the colony.

Haliburton attained distinction as a local businessman and as a judge, but his greatest fame came from his published writings. He wrote a number of books on history, politics, and farm improvement. He first rose to international fame with his ''Clockmaker'' serial, which first appeared in the ''[[Novascotian]]'' and later published as a book throughout the [[British Empire]], becoming popular light reading. The work recounted the humorous adventures of the character [[Sam Slick]].

In 1816, he married Lousia Nevill, daughter of Captain Laurence Neville, of the Eighth [[Light Dragoons]].

Between 1826 and 1829, Haliburton represented [[Annapolis County]] in the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]].

===Relationship with English Burton family===
Thomas Chandler Haliburton resided in England from 1837,&lt;ref name="Davies 2005 p.71"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Richard A.|title=Inventing Sam Slick: A Biography of Thomas Chandler Haliburton|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2005|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was hosted and entertained in London by his cousins [[Decimus Burton]], Jane Burton, [[James Burton (Egyptologist)|James Burton, the Egyptologist]], Septimus Burton, the solicitor, Octavia Burton, and Jessy Burton.&lt;ref name="Davies 2005 p.72"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Richard A.|title=Inventing Sam Slick: A Biography of Thomas Chandler Haliburton|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2005|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas asked [[James Burton (Egyptologist)|James Burton, the Egyptologist]], to check the proofs of his work ''Letter Bag of the Great Western'', with which Burton was unimpressed, in 1839, and those of the third series of ''The Clockmaker'' in 1840.&lt;ref name="Davies 2005 p.73"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Richard A.|title=Inventing Sam Slick: A Biography of Thomas Chandler Haliburton|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2005|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair travelled together to Scotland to investigate their common ancestry, and intended to tour Canada and the United States of America together.&lt;ref name="Davies 2005 p.73"/&gt; Thomas Chandler Haliburton's daughter, Susannah, was impressed by [[James Burton (Egyptologist)|James Burton, the Egyptologist]]: she wrote, in 1839, "''Mr James I admire very much. He is one of the most well-bred persons I saw &amp;... decidedly the flower of the flock''".&lt;ref name="Davies 2005 p.72"/&gt;

===Retirement and subsequent life===
In 1856, Thomas Chandler Haliburton retired from law and moved to England. In the same year, he married Sarah Harriet Owen Williams. In 1859, Haliburton was elected the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]], [[Cornwall]] as a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] minority; he did not stand for re-election in 1865.

Haliburton received an [[honorary degree]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] for his services to literature. He continued writing until his death on 27 August 1865, at his home in [[Isleworth]], near [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard A.

While in England, Thomas Chandler Haliburton met Louisa Neville, daughter of Captain Laurence Neville, of the Eighth [[Light Dragoons]]. In 1816, he married her, soon thereafter returning to [[Nova Scotia]] with her. Louisa's story before marriage is related in the "Haliburton Chaplet," edited by their son, Robert Grant Haliburton (Toronto: 1899). The couple had two sons and five daughters:

*Mrs. A. F. Haliburton
*Mrs. Bainbridge Smith
*Amelia (25 Jul 1829 – 14 Jan 1902), landscape artist, married the Rev.

In 1840, Louisa died and was buried at Windsor.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Haliburton was eager to promote immigration to the colonies of British North America. One of his first written works was an emigrant's guide to Nova Scotia published in 1823, ''A General Description of Nova Scotia; Illustrated by a New and Correct Map''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Davies, ''Inventing Sam Slick'', pp. 28-29; Original online text: [https://archive.org/stream/cihm_35672#page/n9/mode/2up ''A General Description of Nova Scotia; Illustrated by a New and Correct Map'' (Halifax: Printed at the Royal Acadian School, 1823) Internet Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; The community of [[Haliburton, Nova Scotia]] was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofprov00browuoft#page/62/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, [[Haliburton County]] is named after Haliburton in recognition of his work as the first chair of the [[Canadian Land and Emigration Company]].

In 1884, faculty and students at his ''alma mater'' founded a [[literary society]] in honour of the College's most celebrated [[man of letters]]. The Haliburton Society, still active at the [[University of King's College, Halifax]], is the longest-standing collegial literary society throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[North America]].

The mention "hurly on the long pond on the ice", which appears in the second volume of ''The Attaché, or Sam Slick in England'', a work of fiction published in 1844, has been interpreted by some as a reference to a hockey-like game he may have played during his years at King's College. It is the basis of Windsor's disputed [[Windsor,_Nova_Scotia#Ice_hockey|claim]] to being the town that fathered hockey.

In 1902, a memorial to Haliburton and his first wife was erected in [[Christ Church, Windsor]], by four of their children: Laura Cunard, Lord Haliburton, and two surviving sisters.

Nova Scotian artist [[William Valentine (painter)|William Valentine]] painted Haliburton's portrait. His [[Haliburton House Museum|former home in Windsor]] is preserved as a museum.

'''Thurneysen's Law''' is a proposed sound law concerning the alternation of voiced and voiceless fricatives in certain affixes in Gothic. It was first posited in 1896 and published in 1898 by [[Rudolf Thurneysen]], a [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguist]] more famous for his work on the Celtic branch of Indo-European and in particular for his ''Handbuch des Altirischen''. 

== The problem ==
Despite being generally orthographically consistent with regard to voice, Gothic, even more so than other Germanic languages, displays a bewildering set of alternations between voiced and unvoiced spirant consonants. For example, the abstracting suffix -tumni is represented both as -tubni (fastubni, fraistubni, witubni) and as -dufni (waldufni, wundufni). These alternations, and other similar patterns unexplained by [[Verner's Law]] or by [[Proto-Germanic]] sound laws in general became the subject of Thurneysen's Law.

== The solution==
Thurneysen sought to classify the alternations in a general rule as follows:
# Spirants are written as voiced when the preceding vowel is unstressed, and that vowel is preceded by a voiceless consonant, hence -tub-.
# The reverse applies if, in the same circumstances the preceding consonant is voiced, hence -duf.
# If the preceding consonant is a cluster, two possibilities arise:
## If the cluster is of the form /TR/, ie it contains an obstruent followed by a liquid, it is classed as a voiced consonant, and the following consonant will therefore be unvoiced.
## If the cluster is of the form /TY/, ie the post-obstruent position is a glide, it is classed as a voiceless consonant, and the following consonant will be voiced.

== Exceptions ==
Although seeking, in the [[neogrammarian]] tradition, to produce an exceptionless sound law Thurneysen himself acknowledged several classes of exception to his rule.

# In word-final position the alternation is not always visible, due to the vagaries of the Gothic [[Auslautverhärtung]], by which all final consonants in Gothic words could be devoiced.
# As the second part of compound words, the stress pattern of the simplex is used to determine the form of the compound, leading to irregular output.
# Some paradigms display the effect of analogy, or levelling, by which the original alternation of some words has been removed and replaced to better fit a more common pattern.
# Thurneysen also noted seven individual words in need of special treatment - arbaid-, bairizeins, filigri, frumadei, ubizwa, haubid- and þiwadw. He provides explanations for the first five, but the latter two he leaves unexplained.

== Reception and Criticism ==
The reception of Thurneysen's Law has been patchy at best. Many text- and handbooks choose to completely ignore it, or to pass over it with only slight mention, and it remains among the lesser known sound laws of Germanic philology. This is perhaps in part due to its limited scope, but certainly also due to what have been perceived as problematic aspects of its formulation, and the apparent exceptions listed above.

== Recent Formulations ==
In 1968, [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Morris Halle]] published a new and somewhat less sensitive form of Thurneysen's Law in modern notation. This version lacks Thurneysen's rules about consonantal clusters, and his observations on the effects of liquids. It has been seen, therefore, as deficient with respect to the original.

{{Sound change}}

In [[historical linguistics]], '''transphonologization''' is a type of [[sound change]] whereby a [[phonemic contrast]] that used to involve a certain [[Distinctive feature|feature]] X evolves in such a way that the contrast is preserved, yet becomes associated with a different feature Y. 

For example, a language contrasting two words *{{IPA|/sa'''t'''/}} vs. *{{IPA|/sa'''n'''/}} may evolve historically so that final [[consonant]]s are dropped, yet the modern language preserves the contrast through the nature of the [[vowel]], as in a pair {{IPA|/s'''a'''/}} vs. {{IPA|/s'''ã'''/}}. Such a situation would be described by saying that a former contrast between [[Oral consonant|oral]] and [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] consonants has been ''transphonologized'' into a contrast between [[Oral vowel|oral]] vs. [[Nasal vowel|nasal]] vowels.

The term ''transphonologization'' was coined by [[André-Georges Haudricourt]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#agh65|Haudricourt (1965)]], [[#agh70|Haudricourt (1970)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was defined and amply illustrated by [[#hhpp|Hagège &amp; Haudricourt (1978: 74-111)]]; it has been mentioned by several followers of [[Panchronic phonology]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[#mmjbl|Mazaudon &amp; Lowe (1993)]]; [[#af2005|François (2005)]]:452-453); [[#mjr|Michaud, Jacques &amp; Rankin (2012)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#hyman2013|Hyman (2013)]], [[#kirby2013|Kirby (2013)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tentative terms have been used to describe the same phenomenon – including ''rephonologization'' and ''cheshirization'' – yet with less success (see [[#Other names|below]]).

==Transphonologization resulting in a new contrast on vowels==
===Umlaut===
A common example of transphonologization is [[Germanic umlaut]]. 
;Germanic
In many [[Germanic languages]] around 500–700 AD, a sound change fronted a back vowel when an {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} followed in the next syllable.  Typically, the {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} was then lost, leading to a situation where a trace of the original {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} remains in the fronted quality of the preceding vowel.  Alternatively, a distinction formerly expressed through the presence or absence of an {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} suffix was then re-expressed as a distinction between a front or back vowel.

As a specific instance of this, in prehistoric [[Old English]], a certain class of nouns was marked by an {{IPA|/i/}} suffix in the (nominative) plural, but had no suffix in the (nominative) singular.  A word like {{IPA|/muːs/}} "mouse", for example, had a plural {{IPA|/muːsi/}} "mice". After umlaut, the plural became pronounced {{IPA|[myːsi]}}, where the long back vowel {{IPA|/uː/}} was fronted, producing a new subphonemic front-rounded vowel {{IPA|[yː]}}, which serves as a secondary indicator of plurality.  Subsequent loss of final {{IPA|/i/}}, however, made {{IPA|/yː/}} a [[phoneme]] and the primary indicator of plurality, leading to a distinction between {{IPA|/muːs/}} "mouse" and {{IPA|/myːs/}} "mice".  In this case, the lost sound {{IPA|/i/}} left a trace in the presence of {{IPA|/yː/}}; or equivalently, the distinction between singular and plural, formerly expressed through a suffix {{IPA|/i/}}, has been re-expressed using a different feature, namely the front-back distinction of the main vowel. This distinction survives in the modern forms "mouse" {{IPA|/maʊs/}} and "mice" {{IPA|/maɪs/}}, although the specifics have been modified by the [[Great Vowel Shift]].

;outside Germanic
Similar phenomena have been described in languages outside Germanic. 
* For example, 17 languages of northern Vanuatu have gone through a process whereby former *CVCV [[disyllable]]s lost their final vowel, yet preserved their contrast through the creation of new vowels:  e.g. *mat'''i''' vs. *mat'''a''' vs. *mat'''u''' transphonologized to {{IPA|/m'''ɛ'''t/}} vs. {{IPA|/m'''a'''t/}} vs. {{IPA|/m'''ɔ'''t/}}.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#af2005|François (2005)]], [[#af2011|François (2011: 194-5)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the expansion of vowel inventories in the region, from an original five-vowel system (*i e a o u) to inventories up to 10 or 11 vowels (depending on the language).

===Nasalization of vowels===
{{main|Nasalization}}
* In French, a final {{IPA|/n/}} sound disappeared, but left its trace in the [[nasalization]] of the [[French phonology#Nasal vowels|preceding vowel]], as in ''vin blanc'' {{IPA-fr|vɛ̃ blɑ̃|}}, from historical {{IPA|[vin blaŋk]}}.
* In many languages ([[Sino-Tibetan]], [[Austroasiatic]], [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]…), a vowel was nasalized by the nasal consonant preceding it: this "historical transfer of nasality between consonantal onset and vowel" is a case of transphonologization.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#mjr|Michaud, Jacques &amp; Rankin (2012)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensatory lengthening===
{{main|Compensatory lengthening}}
* In [[American English]], the words ''rider'' and ''writer'' are pronounced with a {{IPA|[ɾ]}} instead of {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} as a result of [[flapping]]. The distinction between the two words is preserved by (or transferred to) the length of the vowel (or in this case, diphthong), as vowels are pronounced longer before voiced consonants than before voiceless consonants.

Before disappearing, a sound may trigger or prevent some phonetic change in its vicinity that would not otherwise have occurred, and which may remain long afterward. For example:
* In the [[English language|English]] word ''night, '' the {{IPA|/x/}} sound (spelled ''gh'') disappeared, but before, or perhaps as it did so (see "[[compensatory lengthening]]"), it lengthened the vowel {{angbr|i}}, so that the word is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|t}} "nite" rather than the {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪ|t}} "nit" that would otherwise be expected for a [[closed syllable]].

===Tone languages===
{{main|Tonogenesis}}
*The existence of [[Tone (linguistics)|contrastive tone]] in modern languages often originates in transphonologization of earlier contrasts between consonants: e.g. a former contrast of consonant voicing (*{{IPA|/'''p'''a/}} vs. *{{IPA|/'''b'''a/}}) transphonologizes to a tonal contrast (*{{IPA|/pa '''˥'''/}} vs. *{{IPA|/pa '''˩'''/}})
* The [[tonogenesis|tone split]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], where the [[voiced consonant]]s present in [[Middle Chinese]] lowered the [[varieties of Chinese#Phonology|tone]] of a syllable and subsequently lost their voicing in many varieties.
* [[Floating tone]]s are generally the remains of entire disappeared syllables.

==Transphonologization resulting in a new contrast on consonants==
* [[Consonant mutation#Celtic|Consonant mutation]] in [[Celtic languages]] (a lost vowel triggered initial consonant [[lenition]], and a lost nasal triggered nasalization).
* In [[Sanskrit]], voiced sibilants *z and *ž of the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] language were deleted, which lengthened the preceding vowel. Additionally, the elision of the sound *ž resulted in the following voiced dental consonant {{IPA|/d/}} to become retroflexed, as seen in the development of [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*nizdós'' ("nest") --&gt; [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*niždás'' --&gt; [[Sanskrit]] ''n'''īḍ'''áḥ''. In case of a plain *z, the preceding vowel was lengthened without causing the retroflexion of the following consonant as seen in [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*sízdeti'' ("sits down") --&gt; [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*sízdati'' --&gt; [[Sanskrit]] ''s'''ī́'''dati''.

==Other examples==
* The prevention of sound change by a lost consonant in [[Lahu language|Lahu]];
* In [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and some other [[Uralic languages]], when case endings are elided, the changed root indicates the presence of the case, see [[consonant gradation]].
* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], ''ğ'' lengthens the preceding vowel, unless when followed by another vowel (which it separates into another syllable) or consonant after {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/i/}} (which becomes pronounced as {{IPA|/j/}} in such a case. In the Eastern and lower Ankara dialects, it is pronounced as {{IPA|/ɰ/}}.

== Other names ==
'''Rephonologization''' has been used by [[Roman Jakobson]] (1931 [1972]) to refer to essentially the same process, yet the term didn't catch on, due to its ambiguity. In a 1994 paper, [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Norman]] (1994) used it again in the context of a proposed [[Old Chinese]] sound change that transferred a distinction formerly expressed through putative [[pharyngealization]] of the initial consonant of a syllable to one expressed through presence or absence of a palatal glide {{IPA|/j/}} before the main vowel of the syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Norman |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Norman (sinologist) |title=Pharyngealization in Early Chinese |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=114 |issue=3 |date=July–September 1994 |page=397–408 |doi=10.2307/605083 |jstor=605083}} Specifically, the glide {{IPA|/j/}} occurred whenever the initial consonant was ''not'' pharyngealized.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''rephonologization'' is occasionally used with another meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trask |first=R. L. |title=A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-11261-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to changes such as the [[Germanic sound shift]] or the Slavic change from {{IPA|/ɡ/}} to {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, where the phonological relationships among sounds change but the number of phonemes stays the same.  This can be viewed as a special case of the broader process being described here.

[[James Matisoff]] (1991:443) attempted the coinage '''cheshirization''', as a synonym for transphonologization. This term jokingly refers to the [[Cheshire Cat]], a character in the book ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'',  who "vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone". The term “cheshirization” has been used by some authors (e.g. McWhorter 2005; Chappell 2006) but never really caught on, due to its opacity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">The '''''Versus de pelegrino'''''&lt;ref&gt;The proper Latin title is ''Versus peregrinis'', but the actual title has been [[Catalan language|Catalanised]].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Verses about the Stranger''''' is a [[medieval Latin]] [[drama]] composed by an anonymous playwright of [[Vic]] c. 1130. The ''Versus'' is a short piece of only forty lines on the meeting between [[Mary Magdalene]] and the [[Glorification|glorified]] [[Jesus Christ]] on the road as recorded in the ''[[Gospel of John]]'' (chapter 20). It is a follow-up to the ''[[Verses pascales de tres Maries]]'' and was probably designed as a [[liturgical drama]] for [[Easter Vigil]] as well.

==Story==
The opening lines, spoken by the Magdalene, are an adaptation of the third chapter of the ''[[Song of Songs]]''. In the ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' and in one manuscript grouping of the [[Vulgate]] this chapter has the [[rubric]] ''Mariae Magdalenae ad Ecclesiam'': Mary Magdalene to the Church. The Vic dramatist evidently picked up on this allegorical exegesis and adapted it to his theme. As the play opens, Mary is searching a garden for the tomb of Christ. First some ''angeli'' ([[angel]]s) and then an ''ortolanus'' ([[gardener]])  ask her why she is weeping and for whom she is looking. She mistakes the gardener for Christ when he says to her "Mary, Mary, Mary!" and she responds "Raboni, raboni, master!" The drama does not incorporate a sequence of her on the road meeting Christ, but jumps to her return to the garden from meeting him. There she scoffs at the gardener who deceived her and, meeting the ''discipuli'' ([[Apostle (Christian)|disciples]]), relates to them the fact of Christ's [[resurrection]] and the empty tomb. The disciples do not hesitate to believe her, ''Marie veraci'' (truthful Mary), over the "whole deceitful multitude of Jews" (''Iudeorum turbe fallaci''). The play ends on a prayer, sung by a ''chorus'' ([[choir]]), and the [[Greater Doxology]].

==Analysis==
The ''Versus'' is alone among the [[liturgical drama]]s of the Middle Ages in its choice of subject matter. The ''[[Epitalamica]]'', composed probably later that century at the [[Monastery of the Paraclete]], is a non-dramatic treatment of the same theme, probably derived from the ''Versus'' if its relict dramatic feature are any indication.

Besides the ''Song of Songs'' and John 20, the ''Versus'' relies on the [[Gospels|Gospel]] accounts of the Jews spreading lies that Christ had not risen but merely been stolen from his grave. Outside of the Bible, the anonymous dramatist borrowed a verse form from the north Italian Latin [[ballad]] ''[[Foebus abierat]]'' (c. 1000), in which a lady sees a mirage of her lover's face and embraces it only to find it disappeared. This ballad had made its way to the [[Abbey of Ripoll]] by the twelfth century and would have been accessible to a dramatist working there or at Vic. This composer also drew on an earlier twelfth-century piece, the ''[[Victimae paschali]]'', for the scene of Mary and the disciples. This borrowing became commonplace in thirteenth-century Easter drama, but the Vic play may be its first dramatic adaptation.

The ''Versus'' is written in [[Asclepiad (poetry)|asclepiadic]] [[strophe]]s, [[quatrains]], monorhymed but with lines of varying length. The music for the play survives (the whole thing was sung) in [[Aquitainian]] [[neume]]s and its melodic structure mirrors its poetic. The play is preserved along with the ''Verses pascales'' in codex 105 of the Episcopal Museum of Vic.

'''Émilienne Demougeot''' (1910, [[Bourges]] – 19 June 1994, [[Montpellier]]) was a 20th-century French historian, a specialist of [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Christianity]]. She was one of the first women professors of history at a French university, and the first woman professor at the Faculty of Letters at the [[University of Montpellier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://crises.www.univ-montp3.fr/fr/ressources/archives/la-m%C3%A9moire-de/%C3%A9milienne-demougeot-1910-1994|title=Émilienne DEMOUGEOT (1910 - 1994) {{!}} CRISES|website=crises.www.univ-montp3.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Life ==
She attended elementary and high school in [[Guadeloupe]] from 1917 to 1922, then in Tangier in 1925-1926. Once a history teacher, she taught in high school before the war, and then as an assistant at the Sorbonne. She defended her thesis (''De l’Unité à la division de l’Empire romain.
