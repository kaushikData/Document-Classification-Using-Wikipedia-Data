'''Abomey''' is a city in the [[Zou Department]] of [[Benin]]. Abomey is also the former capital of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] (''c.'' 1600–1904), which would later become a French colony, then the [[Republic of Dahomey]] (1960–1975), and is the modern-day [[Republic of Benin]].

Abomey houses the [[Royal Palaces of Abomey]], a collection of small traditional houses that were inhabited by the Kings of Dahomey from 1600 to 1900, and which were designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1985.

The commune of Abomey covers an area of 142 square kilometres and as of 2012 had a population of 90,195 people.&lt;ref name="Atlasbenin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlasbenin.africa-web.org/Zou/Abomey.htm |title=Abomey |publisher=Atlas Monographique des Communes du Benin |accessdate=January 5, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ybj.html |title=Communes of Benin |publisher=Statoids |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102050757/http://statoids.com/ybj.html |archivedate=2 January 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Royal Palaces of Abomey ==

The [[Royal Palaces of Abomey]] are a group of earthen structures built by the [[Fon people]] between the mid-17th and late 19th Centuries. One of the most famous and historically significant traditional sites in West Africa, the palaces form one of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

The town was surrounded by a mud wall with a circumference estimated at {{convert|10|km|0}}, pierced by six [[gate]]s, and protected by a ditch five feet deep, filled with a dense growth of prickly [[acacia]], the usual defence of West African strongholds. Within the walls were villages separated by fields, several royal palaces, a market-place and a large square containing the barracks. In November 1892, [[Béhanzin]], the last independent reigning king of Dahomey, being defeated by French colonial forces, set fire to Abomey and fled northward.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abomey|volume=1|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French West Africa|French colonial administration]] rebuilt the town and connected it with the coast by a railroad.

When UNESCO designated the royal palaces of Abomey as a World Heritage Site in 1985 it stated
:From 1625 to 1900 twelve kings succeeded one another at the head of the powerful Kingdom of Abomey. With the exception of King Akaba, who used a separate enclosure, they each had their palaces built within the same cob-wall area, in keeping with previous palaces as regards the use of space and materials. The royal palaces of Abomey are a unique reminder of this vanished kingdom.

From 1993, 50 of the 56 bas-reliefs that formerly decorated the walls of King [[Glèlè]] (now termed the '[[Salle des Bijoux]]') have been located and replaced on the rebuilt structure. The bas-reliefs carry an iconographic program expressing the history and power of the Fon people.

Today, the city is of less importance, but is still popular with tourists and as a centre for [[crafts]].

== Threats ==
As reported by [[UNESCO]], the Royal Palaces of Abomey suffered from a fire on 21 January 2009 "which destroyed several buildings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/488 UNESCO World Heritage news], 13 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The fire was the most recent disaster which has plagued the site, coming after a powerful tornado damaged the site in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/1532 |title=State of Conservation: Royal Palaces of Abomey (Benin) |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3702">'''Albert Calmes''', born 26 February 1881 in Paris and died 22 September 1967 in [[Luxembourg]] city, was a Luxembourgish economist and historian.

He was one of the first people to return to Luxembourg with a doctorate in economics. Previously he had taught at universities in Germany and Switzerland. He became a director of [[ARBED]] and received the title ''Ministre plénipotentiaire honoraire''.

While teaching at [[Frankfurt University]] he was commissioned by the [[League of Nations]] to investigate the financial situation in the recently founded [[Principality of Albania]]. His report was published in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/economicfinancia00calm The Economic and Financial Situation of Albania]'', League of Nations, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a historian, he dealt primarily with the history of Luxembourg in the 19th century.

He was the father of [[Christian Calmes]].

[[File:10-meow stamp.jpg|thumb|Artistamp by Elaine with Grey Cats, 2005]]

The term '''artistamp''' (a [[portmanteau]] of the words "artist" and "stamp") or '''artist's stamp''' refers to a [[postage stamp]]-like art form used to depict or [[commemorative stamp|commemorate]] any subject its creator chooses. Artistamps are a form of [[Cinderella stamps]] in that they are not valid for postage, but they differ from  [[forgery|forgeries]] or bogus [[Illegal stamps]] in that typically the creator has no intent to defraud [[post office|postal authorities]] or [[stamp collecting|stamp collectors]].

Artistamp creators often include their work on legitimate mail, alongside valid postage stamps, in order to decorate the envelope with their art. In many countries this practice is legal, provided the artistamp is not passed off as or likely to be mistaken for a genuine postage stamp. When so combined (and sometimes, less strictly speaking, even when not so) the artistamp may be considered part of the [[mail art]] genre.

[[Irony]], [[satire]], [[humor]], [[eroticism]] and subversion of governmental authority are frequent characteristics of artistamps. Artists may leverage the expectation of official endorsement that necessarily inheres in governmentally-issued postage for the purpose of shocking or subverting viewers' expectations, with such actions typically representing a specific political and artistic motive. Other practitioners are content to depict more homey subjects like kittens and family members. Some artists use the form to create fantasy stamps for their own [[postal system|postal administrations]] or [[countries]] – in many cases thereby developing or complementing an imaginary [[government|governmental system]].

==History==
[[File:ArtistampLDzhepko1971.jpg|thumb|Artistamp by [[Leonid Dzhepko]], c. 1971]]
The first [[artist]] to produce an "artist’s stamp" is open to interpretation. It did not take many years after the introduction of postage stamps before UK commercial photographers saw a market in personalised stamp photographs incorporating an individual's portrait within a stamp-like printed border, printed in perforated sheets with gummed backs&lt;ref&gt;Example photo stamps and references from the 1860s can be found at http://www.fadingimages.uk/stamps2.asp&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Fine art]]ists were certainly [[Contract|commissioned]] to create [[poster stamp]]s ([[advertising]] [[poster]]s in [[collectible]] stamp form) from the late 1800s, but none appear to have worked with the format outside the commercial or [[advertising]] context.

In 1919, [[Dada]]ist [[Raoul Hausmann]] affixed a [[Portrait|self-portrait]] postage stamp to a [[postcard]],&lt;ref&gt;John Held, Jr., [http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html ''Robert Watts: The Complete Postage Stamp Sheets, 1961-1986''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=2009-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but given that [[Dada]] was determinedly [[anti-art]] (at least in theory), calling this an "artist’s stamp" seems almost counterintuitive.

[[Germany|German]] artist [[Karl Schwesig]], while a [[political prisoner]] during [[World War II]], drew a series of pseudo-stamps on the blank, [[perforation|perforated]] margins of postage stamp sheets, using coloured inks. Jas Felter asserts that this 1941 series, which illustrated life in a [[concentration camp]], is typically accepted as the first true set of artist's stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Frank, [http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/PFranke.html ''Postal Modernism: Artists' Stamps and Stamp Images'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]], a member of the [[Fluxus]] group, became the first artist to create a full sheet of [faux] postage stamps within a fine art context when he produced a perforated block of 15 stamps combining [[popular culture|popular]] and [[erotic art|erotic]] imagery in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;John Held, Jr., ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian [[multimedia artist]] and [[philatelist]] [[T Michael Bidner]], who made his life's work the cataloguing of all then-known artist's stamps, coined the word "artistamp" in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Felter, ''Artistamps: Francobolli d’artista'', Italy, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly became the term of choice amongst [[mail art]]ists.

Artist [[Clifford Harper]] published a series of designs for [[anarchy|anarchist]] postage stamps in 1988, featuring portraits of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Herbert Read]].

==Recognition of the art form==
Despite the exhibitions, history, number of artists and global sweep of the artistamp movement, the medium had long been ignored by major institutions and derided by the arts establishment: before his death in 1989, Bidner attempted to [[donation|donate]] his definitive collection to several major Canadian institutions but was turned down by every one. The collection eventually went to [[Artpool Art Research Center|Artpool]], an art research centre in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]&lt;ref&gt;[[György Galántai]], [http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/Artistampex/megnyito_e.html ''Thomas Michael Bidner (1944-1989): A Commemorative Exhibition'']&lt;/ref&gt; who organized World Art Post,&lt;ref&gt;World Art Post, Budapest 1982 – [http://www.artpool.hu/events/APS_6/default.html%20 online catalog of the show] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802185042/http://www.artpool.hu/events/APS_6/default.html%20 |date=August 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first big scale artistamp exhibition in [[Central Europe]] in 1982, and in 1987 the first arstistamp exhibition to be held in a renowned museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stamp Images, [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], Budapest, 1987 - [http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/Belyegkepek/default.html online catalog of the show]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death, Bidner's friend Rosemary Gahlinger-Beaune, undertook Bidner's vision and began to catalogue, using philatelic standards, artistamps from over 200 artists from 29 countries, documenting more than 10,0000 artistamp images. In 1999, Gahlinger-Beaune and Bianchini released a CD entitled "The World of Artistamps", the most comprehensive database of artistamps of the time.

Multimedia artist [[James Warren "Jas" Felter]] curated an [[art exhibition|exhibition]] called ''Artists' Stamps and Stamp Images'' at Simon Fraser Gallery, [[Simon Fraser University]], [[Canada]], in 1974: the first exhibition to acknowledge the stamp as an artistic medium. This collection, which toured [[Europe]] and [[North America|America]] for the next ten years, led to an explosion in the number of artists using stamps as an artistic format.

Photographer and multimedia artist [[Ginny Lloyd]] started her Gina Lotta Post series in 1979 and by 1982 had produced some of the first computer-generated imagery used in artists stamps. On a visit to [[Artpool Art Research Center|Artpool]] in 1982, she collaborated with [[György Galántai]] on artistamp issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/artist/Galantai/GinnyFree.html Cooperative stampsheets] by Ginny Lloyd and György Galántai in Artpool's collection&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Lloyd co-organized an Art in Space event in [[San Francisco]] at which a rocket containing artistamps on a microchip was launched. In 1986, the artist received a [[Visual Studies Workshop]] artist-in-residence funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts in the United States. Her project for the residency  culminated with ''Gina Lotta Post,'' a series of artistamps bound into a book and includes a set of postcards. A second book ''Make Your Own Stamps Sheet,'' is a Complete and Return project that originated from the same residency, becoming available in 2011.

In 1989, Felter curated the first of three International Biannual Exhibitions of Artistamps at Davidson Galleries in [[Seattle]].

In 1994, an exhibition sponsored by the Swiss Posts was held in the PTT-Museum in Berne, resulting in the publication of a book and four sheets of artists' stamps (one of the few printed at the costs of an official postal service!). More than 60 artists participated. The word "Artistamps" does not appear in the book, but on one of the stamps, by E.F. Higgins.

In 1995, Patricia Tavenner curated ''The First California Artistamp Exhibit'' at University of California, Berkeley - San Francisco Extension. The exhibit presented works of about 170 artists from around the world.

In 1995 [[Guy Bleus]] organized the traveling exhibition ''The Artistamp Collection'' in the ‘Provinciaal Museum’ (now Z33) in Hasselt, and in the ‘Poorthuis’ in Genk, Belgium. The documentation was the very first artistamp catalogue on CD-ROM. &lt;ref&gt;Guy Bleus, The Artistamp Collection [http://www.artpool.hu/CDRom/Bleus.html] [http://www.worldcat.org/title/artistamp-collection-mail-art-networking/oclc/35598062]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''First Moscow International Artistamp Exhibition'' was held in Moscow in December 1998, as part of International Art Fair XX. The event was curated by Natalie Lamanova, Alexander Kholopv and Jas Felter. This event gave rise to the "Moscow Artistamp Collection" which presently includes more than 700 works of 83 artists from 19 countries.

From November 12, 1999, to January 19, 2000, the Art Institute of Boston hosted the ''Stamp Art and Artists Stamps'' exhibition. The show included artistamp sheets from Natalia Lamanova, Alexander Kholopov of Russia, Vittore Baroni, Clemente Padin, Jose Carlos Soto, Pere Sousa and Donald Evans. PBS documented this exhibit.

February - March 2000: Moscow artists Ivan Kolesnikov and Sergei Denisov presented a joint Artistamp project entitled ''Azbuka Veka (The Alphabet of the Century)'' at the S’ART Gallery in Moscow. The show presented stamps of famous people tagged with letters from the Russian alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Journal, Feb. 13, 2000 [http://www.russiajournal.com/node/10204 "Stamping Symbols into Russian ABC"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, an exhibit featuring artistamps from around the world was displayed at the E. Max von Isser Gallery of Art at Elgin Community College, Elgin, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Herald (Arlington Heights, Ill.), [http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/ADHB/lib00057,0ECF196C0008B151.html ''Event listing'', December 6, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition ''Motherland/Fatherland'' was held at The International Museum Exhibition Centre in Moscow from July 11 to 21, 2002. The event was curated by Natalie Lamanova, Alexander Kholopv and Jas Felter. Presented there were works by 44 artists from Russia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Spain, Korea, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Venezuela, Armenia and the United States.

The [[Sonoma County Museum]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]], hosted the exhibit ''Post Modern Post: International Artistamps'' in April 2003. The show including the work of 50 artists from 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Chronicle, [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/28/NB11924.DTL ''He puts his stamp on his artwork'', March 28, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, The exhibition ''Axis of Evil'' opened at The Nexus Gallery, Philadelphia in March 2005, and later traveled to Chicago and Green Bay, Wisconsin. Curated by Chicago-based artist Michael Hernandez de Luna, the exhibit featured 127 works by 47 stamp artists from 11 countries. It originated with the publication of the book Axis of Evil: Perforated Praeter Naturam, published by Qualiatica Press.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia College Press Office, [http://web3.colum.edu/press_releases/archives/005311.php ''Stamp Artists Exhibit Interpret Sin for 21st Century''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130075244/http://web3.colum.edu/press_releases/archives/005311.php |date=January 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2007, the Budapest [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] hosted a successful exhibition entitled ''ParaStamp: Four Decades of Artistamps, from Fluxus to the Internet''.&lt;ref&gt;ParaStamp: Four Decades of Artistamps, from Fluxus to the Internet - [http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/Para/index.html online catalog of the show]&lt;/ref&gt; Curated by [[György Galántai]], the exhibition presented approximately 500 works selected from the archive of the [[Artpool Art Research Center]]. More than 250 of the most important artists working in the artistamp genre were represented, including Natalie Lamanova, Anna Banana, Ed Varney, [[Guy Bleus]], Twine Workshop, Michael Hernandez de Luna, Steve Smith, [[Vittore Baroni]], [[Robert Watts]], H.R. Fricker, Ryosuke Cohen, Ginny Lloyd, and Al Brandtner. "The new function artistamp has in this exhibition is to convey the explosively changing worldview at the turn of the millennium," said Galántai in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;Kata Bodor, “Interview with György Galántai, the curator of the Parastamp exhibition,” in Parastamp: Four Decades of Artistamps, from Fluxus to the Internet (Budapest: Szépművészeti Múzeum [Museum of Fine Arts], 2007) - [http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/Para/Stamp00.html online version]&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran from March 23 to June 24, 2007.

In July 2007, the SomArts Cultural Center gallery presented the ''Multiplicity/Multiplicidad: Mailart &amp; Artistamp Show'', in collaboration with Vortice Argentina, Buenos Aires.

The [[Weserburg|New Museum Weserburg]] in Bermen, Germany, held the exhibition ''Leck mich! - Künstlerbriefmarken seit den 1960er Jahren'' (''Lick me! - Artist’s Stamps since the Sixties'')&lt;ref name="weserburgexhibit"&gt;[http://www.weserburg.de/index.php?id=251&amp;id=251&amp;L=1 Leck mich! - Künstlerbriefmarken seit den 1960er Jahren]&lt;/ref&gt;  from July 7, 2007 through February 2, 2008, assembling more than 300 works to present a global ensemble of stamp art. A portion of the exhibition description reads:

{{quote|text=The fact that the artist’s stamp sets its own ''stamp'' on an (art) letter is one of the special features of this form of expression. A further facet of this small-format art is its challenging the mail monopoly by laying claim to the perforated and gummed miniature works of art. The stamps the artists create are not meant to swindle the postal service, but to call into question the right to design things. The focus in the exhibition will therefore be the artist’s stamp as an expression of independence and self-determination. Thus the title, Lick me!, is not only an invitation to “remain glued” to this exhibition, rather it also exemplifies the stance of a self-confident genre.&lt;ref name="weserburgexhibit" /&gt;}}

Turner Prize-winning artist and Academy Award-winning filmmaker [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]] assembled the ''Queen and Country'' exhibition comprising stamps depicting British servicemen and women killed in Iraq. The exhibition was hosted at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh between December 3, 2008, and February 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland on Sunday, [https://archive.is/20120715184624/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/arts/Stamps-of-war-dead-on.4652361.jpg ''Stamps of war dead on show'']&lt;/ref&gt;

David Krueger's series of pseudo-stamps critiquing the Bush administration, begun in 2001, was on view at the CUE Art Foundation in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]], New York, from April 24 - May 31, 2008.

The JAY Gallery in Seoul, Korea, sponsored the exhibition, ''American Artistamps,'' curated by John Held, Jr., from May 19 - June 1, 2010. It featured works by Robert Watts, Donald Evans, Harley, Dogfish, Picasso Gaglione, Michael Thompson, Al Ackerman, Darlene Altschul, Mike Dickau and John Ringer.

The Gina Lotta Post Artistamp Museum, curated by Ginny Lloyd, opened in May 2010. Currently located in Jupiter, Florida, the museum collection began in the late 1970s and exhibits over 4,200 works by more than 200 international artistamp creators. Selections from the museum can be seen online. Items from the museum were on exhibit at the Jaffe Center for the Book Arts in Boca Raton, Florida from July 15 to October 27, 2010. Artists stamps by Harley, Jurgen Olbrich, Reed Altemus, Rockola, Picasso Gaglione, Buz Blurr, Vitore Baroni, and Ginny Lloyd were featured as part of the "Carbon Alternative" exhibit.

In November 2012, The Museum of Artistamps opened in Seattle. The museum is curated by Robert Rudine (Dogfish), working in collaboration with James Felter.&lt;ref&gt;The Seattle Star, [http://www.seattlestar.net/2013/01/a-museum-of-art-stamps-opens-on-the-shore-of-lake-union/ ''A Museum Opens on the Shore of Lake Union'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2012, the exhibition, AARPEX (the Artistamp Reunion and Philatelic Expo), was held in Seattle. AARPEX was organized by Carl Chew and Robert Rudine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctchew.com/aarpex.html C.T. Chew website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistamps have been recognized in mainstream stamp publications, such as ''[[Linn's Stamp News]]''. In 2005, Linn's published an article covering the release of Twine Workshop's "The Blighted State of America" artistamp, a piece directly criticizing then U.S. president [[George W. Bush]].

John Held Jr.'s book, ''Small Scale Subversion: Mail Art &amp; Artistamps,'' was published on April 11, 2015.

==Controversy==
In 2005, United States Secret Service agents attended the opening of the ''Axis of Evil'' exhibition at Columbia College Chicago's Glass Curtain Gallery. According to Carol Ann Brown, director of the gallery, the agents were most interested in the work entitled "Patriot Act" by Chicago-based artist Al Brandtner. The work depicts a revolver pointed at the head of then President George W. Bush. Secret Service spokesman Tom Mazur stated, "We need to ensure ... that this is nothing more than artwork with a political statement."&lt;ref&gt;Art Daily, April 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

When the exhibit opened at a gallery on the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay campus on September 15, 2005, university chancellor Bruce Shepard directed the removal of Brandtner's work from the gallery. In a letter to faculty and staff, Shepard said "in a society all too violence prone, using these or other venues to appear to advocate or suggest assassination is not something the UW-Green Bay may do."&lt;ref&gt;Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, September 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==The artistamp creation process==
[[File:БЛОК МАРОК.jpg|thumb|400px|"Stamp Mint Sheet" by Aleksandr Zolotov, 2009]]
Artistamps are created as one-off works of art, in [[Limited Edition Art Print|limited editions]], or as mass-produced product. Artistamps have been produced as multiples of one design per sheet; a multitude of designs per page; as [[miniature sheet]]s with a decorative or inclusive border; in booklets; or any combination/size/shape the artist chooses.

Techniques for the creation of artistamps may include perforating the paper to resemble a traditional perforated stamp, as well as applying [[Postage stamp gum|gum]] to the reverse side of the paper. [[Self-adhesive stamp|Self-adhesive]] paper is also used. The image represented on the stamp may be hand-drawn or painted, [[lithography|lithographed]] or [[offset printing|offset-printed]], [[photography|photographed]], [[photocopier|photocopied]], [[Etching|etched]], [[Engraving|engraved]], [[Serigraphy|silk-screened]], [[rubber stamp]]ed, or produced on a digital [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] or [[laser printer|laser]] printer. While the method of production is entirely the choice of the artist, creators who exclusively or primarily use rubber stamps are occasionally held in contempt by members of the artistamp community, some of whom refer to such producers as "bunny-stampers."

The [[personal computer]], personal printer and color photocopier have served to democratize the means of production of artistamps. It is no coincidence that the early 1980s explosion in artistamp creation paralleled the development and widespread use of color photocopiers, and that a similar surge followed the ubiquity of personal computers and inexpensive color printers. Still, the lack of workable, widely available, cheap and accessible perforators have limited the number of artists who can create convincing simulcra of traditional perforated stamps.

Makers of artistamps sometimes apply [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]]s to the stamps when affixing them to [[Cover (philately)|covers]];  [[first day of issue]] covers for artistamps also exist.

The rise of the [[Internet]] has seen the development of the concept of the so-called cyberstamp, a digital-only stamp-like image designed primarily to be viewed online and often sent with [[e-mail]]. Cyberstamps also allow the use of [[animation|animated imagery]]. Whether a digital image, however, can be considered a "stamp" at all is a matter of dispute.

Artists working in the stamp art medium often employ fixed-line perforators as part of the creation process. Most functional and sought-after of these machines are cast-iron, pedal-operated devices manufactured beginning in the 1880s by bindery equipment makers like F.P Rosback Co. and Latham Machinery Co. Rosback also produced table-top perforators, but surviving models are exceedingly rare. Other methods for perforating paper to resemble stamp sheets have generally proven unsatisfactory. Such alternative methods used include using sewing machines, sewing pounces, leather punches, modified veterinary needles, and speciality scissors. Some owners of pedal-operated or motorized perforators sell pre-perforated paper and offer perforating services for a fee.

In 2005 and 2006, a machinist operating under the name "Dr. Arcane" manufactured and sold about 20 "Whizbang" perforators. These table-top devices worked well, but were reportedly fragile.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In 2004, the International Brotherhood of Perforator Workers (IBPW), an organization based in Washington, D.C., was established to represent the interests of artists owning and/or operating perforators in the creation of stamp art.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Commercial publishers have produced material which could be considered as falling within the artistamp realm: [[Dover Publications]] published William Rowe's stamp book titled ''Surreal Stickers &amp; Unreal Stamps'', 1982, included 224 full-colored gummed and perforated stamps. ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' included perforated, gummed stamps in a few issues. [[Cartoonist]] [[Garry Trudeau]], creator of the [[Doonesbury]] [[comic strip]], released ''The 1990 Doonesbury Stamp Album'' through [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] in 1990; this album contained a large number of perforated, gummed stamps featuring characters and settings from Doonesbury. Another example is a series of [[Ankh-Morpork]] stamps created to publicise the ''[[Discworld]]'' novel ''[[Going Postal]]''.

The '''Bornholm amulet''' is an Arabic [[silver coin]] with [[Latin]] text written with [[Runes|runic inscription]]. The amulet is only 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.

==Discovery==
The finding place is unknown but the coin was handed over to the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in 1821, with information that the coin was found in the year 1770 on [[Bornholm]].

==Dating==
The dating of the amulet was at first considered to be between 907 and 913. In 1965, the dating was revised to be between 885 and 896.

==Inscription==
The height of the runes are 0,3-0,8&amp;nbsp;cm.

[[File:AFM on azusa street.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The mission at [[Azusa Street Revival|312 Azusa Street]] in 1907, [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], the [[United States|US]], considered to be the birthplace of [[Pentecostalism]].]]
The '''history of modern Christianity''' concerns the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] from the end of the Early Modern era to the present day. The Early Modern history of Christianity is usually taken to begin with the [[Protestant Reformation]] {{circa|1517–1525}} (usually rounded down to 1500) and ending in the late 18th century with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the events leading up to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. This article only covers 1720 to the current date. For the [[early modern period]], see the articles on the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and the [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery]].

Becoming common to all of Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], Christianity expanded throughout the world during the [[Age of Exploration]]. Christianity has thus become the [[major religious groups|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] differs most significantly from the other [[religion]]s in the claim that [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] is [[God the Son]], but throughout its history, it has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches. The largest branches of Christianity are the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Protestant]] churches. Following the [[Fall of Constantinople]], Christianity followed two different paths: [[Western Christianity]] and [[Eastern Christianity]].

==Western Christianity==

===The Reformation (1520–1641)===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}
{{See also|Christianity in the 16th century|Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery}}

===Age of Enlightenment (1640–1740)===
[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|150px|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (green), 1642–1645]]
{{See also|Christianity in the 17th century|Christianity in the 18th century}}
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] constituted a new challenge of the Church. Unlike the [[Protestant Reformation]], which questioned certain Christian doctrines, the Enlightenment questioned Christianity as a whole. Generally, it elevated human [[reason]] above  divine [[revelation]] and down-graded religious authorities such as the [[papacy]] based on it&lt;ref&gt;Lortz, IV, 7-11&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puritan movement====
{{See also|History of the Puritans from 1649}}
The [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritan]] party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarized the [[Elizabethan Age]], although it was not until the 1640s that England underwent religious strife comparable to that which its neighbours had suffered some generations before.

The early ''Puritan movement'' (late 16th century-17th century) was [[Reformed]] or [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and was a movement for reform in the [[Church of England]]. Its origins lay in the discontent with the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially [[Geneva]]. The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as [[idolatry|idolatrous]] (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as "[[popish]] pomp and rags". (See [[Vestments controversy]].) They also objected to ecclesiastical courts. They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.

The later Puritan movement were often referred to as [[Dissenters]] and [[Nonconformist]]s and eventually led to the formation of various [[Reformed]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]].

The most famous and well-known emigration to [[United States|America]] was the migration of the Puritans, or [[pilgrims]], left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the [[Low Countries]] but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, so with hopes of a Puritan utopia, they set out to establish the English colonies of [[New England]], which later became the [[United States]].

These Puritan separatists were also known as "[[Pilgrims|the pilgrims]]". After establishing a colony at Plymouth (in what would become later Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the [[King of England]] which legitimized their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of [[mercantilism]]. This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and [[economic freedom]], to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity.

The original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism, which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the Native American Indians and to Christianize the peoples of the Americas.

The most famous colonisation by Protestants in the New World was that of English [[Puritan]]s in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelise the native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Catholic missions====
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. At the same time, missionaries such those from [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China was relatively peaceful and focused on adopted the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting among others the veneration of the dead. The Vatican disagreed and forbade any adaptation in the so-called [[Chinese Rites controversy]] in 1692 and 1742. The expansion of the [[Catholic]] [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] with a significant roled played by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] led to the Christianization of the indigenous populations of the Americas such as the [[Aztec]]s and [[Inca]]s, but, until the 19th century, missions had to work under the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] governments and military.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen, 362&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revivalism (1720–1906)===
{{Main|Revivalism}}
{{See also|Christianity in the 18th century|Christianity in the 19th century}}

Revivalism refers to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and Wesleyan revival, called the [[Great Awakening]], in North America which saw the development of evangelical [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Baptist]], and new [[Methodist]] churches. When the movement eventually waned, it gave rise to new [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationist]] movements.

====Great Awakenings====
{{Main|First Great Awakening|Second Great Awakening|Third Great Awakening}}
The [[First Great Awakening]] was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies ''c''. 1730–1740, emphasising the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a "great international Protestant upheaval" that also created [[Pietism]] in [[Germany]], the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]], and [[Methodism]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; It centred on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, and mostly affected [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], German Reformed, [[Baptist]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800&amp;ndash;1830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instil in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of the [[Restoration Movement]], the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Adventism]] and the [[Holiness movement]]. The [[Third Great Awakening]] began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the "great awakenings" in North America was [[Pentecostalism]], which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street]], in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the [[Charismatic movement]].

====French Revolution and worship of Reason====
{{Main|French Revolution}}
Matters grew still worse with the violent anti-clericalism of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Edward"&gt;Edward, ''The Cambridge Modern History'' (1908), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Direct attacks on the wealth of the Catholic Church and associated grievances led to the wholesale nationalisation of church property and attempts to establish a state-run church.&lt;ref name="Bokenkotter285"/&gt; Large numbers of priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], leading to the Catholic Church being outlawed and replaced by a new religion of the worship of "[[Reason]]"&lt;ref name="Bokenkotter285"/&gt; along with a new [[French Republican Calendar]]. In this period, all monasteries were destroyed, 30,000&amp;nbsp;priests were exiled and hundreds more were killed.&lt;ref name="Bokenkotter285"&gt;Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'' (2004), pp. 283&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Pope Pius VI]] sided against the revolution in the [[First Coalition]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded Italy. The 82-year-old pope was taken as a prisoner to France in February 1799 and died in [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] August 29, 1799 after six months of captivity. To win popular support for his rule, Napoleon re-established the Catholic Church in France through the [[Concordat of 1801]].&lt;ref name="Collins176"&gt;Collins, ''The Story of Christianity'' (1999), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; All over Europe, the end of the Napoleonic wars signaled by the [[Congress of Vienna]], brought Catholic revival, renewed enthusiasm, and new respect for the papacy following the depredations of the previous era.&lt;ref name="Duffy216"&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), pp. 214&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restorationism====
{{Main|Restorationism (Christian primitivism)}}
{{See also|Dispensationalism}}

Restorationism refers to various unaffiliated movements that considered contemporary Christianity, in all its forms, to be a deviation from the true, original Christianity, which these groups then attempted to "Reconstruct", often using the [[Acts of the Apostles|Book of Acts]] as a "guidebook" of sorts. [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]] developed out of the Second Great Awakening and is historically connected to the Protestant Reformation,&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom's summary is as follows: Restorationism has its genesis with Thomas and Alexander Campbell, whose movement is connected to the German Reformed Church through Otterbein, Albright, and Winebrenner (p. 212). American Millennialism and Adventism, which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, produced certain groups such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (p. 387, 501–9), the Jehovah's Witness movement (p. 807), and, as a reaction specifically to William Miller, Seventh Day Adventism (p. 381); Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; but differs in that Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as "reforming" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. The name Restoration is also used to describe the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness Movement]].

=====Latter Day Saints=====
[[File:The Book of Mormon- An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.jpg|thumb|right|Cover page of The Book of Mormon from an original 1830 edition, by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;Image from the U.S. Library of Congress ''Rare Book and Special Collections Division&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}
The driving force behind and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement was [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], and to a lesser extent, during the movement's first two years, [[Oliver Cowdery]]. Throughout his life, Smith told of an experience he had as a boy having [[First Vision|seen God the Father and Jesus Christ]] as two separate beings, who told him that the true church had been lost and would be restored through him, and that he would be given the authority to organize and lead the true [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]. Smith and Cowdery also explained that the [[angels]] [[John the Baptist]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] visited them in 1829 and gave them authority to reestablish the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] and in 1838 Joseph Smith announced that he had received a revelation from God that officially changed the name to the ''[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]''.&lt;ref name = MHC&gt;''Manuscript History of the Church'', LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in [[Dean C. Jessee]] (comp.) (1989). ''The Papers of Joseph Smith: Autobiographical and Historical Writings'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) '''1''':302–303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = marquardt&gt;H. Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). ''Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith first published the [[Book of Mormon]] in March 1830, which LDS members believe was translated from [[Golden Plates]] buried in [[Hill Cumorah|the ground]], and contains a [[Book of Mormon chronology|record of Americas between about 600 BC and 400 AD]] and an original church of Jesus therein.

In 1844, [[William Law (Mormonism)|William Law]] and several other Latter Day Saints in church leadership positions publicly denounced Smith's secret practice of [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|polygamy]] in the controversial ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'', and formed [[True Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|their own church]]. The city council of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] subsequently had the printing press of the ''Expositor'' destroyed. In spite of Smith's later offer to pay damages for destroyed property, critics of Smith and the church considered the destruction heavy-handed. Some called for the Latter Day Saints to be either expelled or destroyed. Following [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|Smith's assassination]] by a mob in [[Carthage, Illinois]], some prominent members of the church claimed to be Smith's legitimate successor.

These various claims resulted in a [[Succession Crisis (Mormon)|succession crisis]], in which the majority of church members followed [[Brigham Young]], he being the senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] of the church; others followed [[Sidney Rigdon]] or [[James Strang]]. The crisis resulted in several permanent schisms as well as the formation of occasional splinter groups, some of which no longer exist. These various groups are occasionally referred to under two geographical headings: "Prairie Saints" (those that remained in the Midwest United States) and "Rocky Mountain Saints" (those who followed Brigham Young to what would later become the state of [[Utah]]). Today, there are many [[Schism (religion)|schism]] organizations who regard themselves as a part of the Latter Day Saint movement, though in most cases they do not acknowledge the other branches as valid and regard their own tradition as the only correct and authorized version of the church Smith founded. The vast majority of Latter Day Saints belong to the largest denomination, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) which claims 13 million members worldwide. The second-largest denomination is the [[Community of Christ]], which reports over 250,000 members.

===Western Christianity since the 20th century===
{{See also|Christianity in the 20th century|Christianity in the 21st century}}

====Fascism====
Fascism describes certain related political regimes in 20th-century Europe, especially the Nazi Germany of Hitler, the Fascist Italy of Mussolini and the falangist Spain of Franco. About Italian Fascism [[Pope Pius XI]] is said to have been moderately sceptic{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and [[G. K. Chesterton]] friendly but critical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In the Spanish Civil War Roman Catholics internationally were mainly in support of either [[José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones|neutral]] or on [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] side, due to [[Manuel Azaña|Azaña's]] de facto toleration of anti-clerical violence in and just before [[Spanish Civil War|this conflict]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Dollfuss in Austria was the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|ideal politician]] realising Pope Pius XI's ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]''.

====Nazism====
The position of Christians in Nazi Fascism is highly complex.

Regarding the matter, historian Derek Holmes wrote, "There is no doubt that the Catholic districts, resisted the lure of National Socialism [Nazism] far better than the Protestant ones."&lt;ref&gt;Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pope Pius XI]] declared - ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' - that Fascist governments had hidden "pagan intentions" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and Totalitarian Fascist State Worship, which placed the nation above God and fundamental human rights and dignity.  His declaration that "Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites" prompted the Nazis to give him the title "Chief Rabbi of the Christian World."&lt;ref&gt;Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in Dachau, and 2,000 of them were executed.  A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.&lt;ref&gt;John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 &amp; n. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Catholic laypeople and clergy played notable roles in sheltering [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]], including [[Pope Pius XII]] (1876–1958).  The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).&lt;ref&gt;John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005),  p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: "The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together."&lt;ref&gt;Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the German Lutheran Church, was complex. Though the majority of Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.

====Ecumenism====
{{Main|Ecumenism}}
Ecumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. "''Ecumenism''" is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἰκουμένη}} ([[oikoumene]]), which means "the inhabited world", but more figuratively something like "universal oneness." The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of "denominationalism" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).

=====Catholic ecumenism=====
{{Main|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}
Over the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the [[East-West Schism|schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches]].  Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism.

On 30 November 1895, [[Pope Leo XIII]] published the Apostolic Letter ''[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm Orientalium Dignitas]'' (On the Churches of the East) safeguarding the importance and continuance of the Eastern traditions for the whole Church. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]] was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.

Some of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient [[Eastern Churches]] concern some doctrine (i.e. [[Filioque]], [[Scholasticism]], functional purposes of asceticism, the [[Essence-Energies distinction|essence]] of God, [[Hesychasm]], [[Fourth Crusade]], establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniatism]] to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world), and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage.

With respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] produced with the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in 1999.

=====Ecumenism within Protestantism=====
Ecumenical movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfil these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a "first among equal" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of "the Church" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfils the essential criteria of "being Christian") is a sub-group of a greater "Christian Church", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or "denomination", claims to be "the Church." Obviously, this ecclesiology is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be "the Church." The "essential criteria" generally consist of belief in the Trinity, belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to have forgiveness and eternal life, and that He died and rose again bodily.

===Trends in theology===

====Modernism and liberal Christianity====
{{Main|Liberal Christianity}}
[[Liberal Christianity]], sometimes called liberal theology, is an umbrella term covering diverse, philosophically-informed religious movements and moods within late 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century Christianity. The word "liberal" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a [[leftist]] ''political'' agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of [[dialectic]] process associated with [[continental philosophy]] and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

====Fundamentalism====
{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}
Fundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and [[United States of America|American]] [[Protestantism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in reaction to [[Modernist Christianity|modernism]] and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves "Christian." Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the "[[fundamentalism|fundamentals]]": [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the [[Bible]], [[Sola Scriptura]], the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]], the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]], the bodily [[Resurrection]] of Jesus, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ.

====Second Vatican Council====
{{Main|Second Vatican Council}}
On 11 October 1962  [[Pope John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]], the 21st [[ecumenical council]] of the Catholic Church. The council was "pastoral" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin

==Eastern Christianity==

===Russian Orthodoxy===
Orthodoxy was very strong in [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], which had recently acquired an [[autocephalous]] status, and as the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire; [[Moscow]] called itself the [[New Rome|Third Rome]], as the heir of Constantinople. In 1721 Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] abolished completely the patriarchate and so the Russian Orthodox Church effectively became a department of the government, ruled by a Most Holy Synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Tsar himself. This continued until the 20th century.

===Orthodoxy under Ottoman rule===
{{See also|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ottoman Empire}}

In 1453, Constantinople fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Under Ottoman rule, the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] acquired substantial power as an autonomous ''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]''. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire "Greek Orthodox nation" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Empire. As a result of the Ottoman conquest and the [[fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West.

For the next four hundred years, it would be confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. This is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in sixteenth-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.

The new [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] that arose from the ashes of Byzantine civilisation was neither primitive nor barbaric. [[Islam]] not only recognised Jesus as a great prophet, but tolerated Christians as another [[People of the Book]]. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organisation significantly disrupted. Its administration continued to function. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]]. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium were, admittedly, converted into mosques, yet countless other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Moreover, it is striking that the patriarch's and the hierarchy's position was considerably strengthened and their power increased. They were endowed with civil as well as ecclesiastical power over all Christians in Ottoman territories. Because [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.

However, these rights and privileges (see [[Dhimmitude]]), including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]], while all Christians were viewed as little more than second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the "infidel" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]).&lt;ref name=AIHG-NYT&gt;[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=2007-06-07 }} ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Moslems was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements.

====Corruption====
The Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. Nor was the patriarchal throne ever secure. Few patriarchs between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's. The hanging of patriarch [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]] from the gate of the patriarchate on Easter Sunday 1821 was accompanied by the execution of two metropolitans and twelve bishops.

====Devshirmeh====
[[Devshirmeh]] was the system of the collection of young boys from conquered [[Christian]] lands by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]]s as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal  army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the "[[Janissary|Janissaries]]", or other servants such as [[tellak]] in hamams. The word ''devşirme'' means "collecting, gathering" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ''[[ghilmán]]'' or ''acemi oglanlar'' ("novice boys").

===Eastern Orthodoxy since the 20th century===
{{see also|History of Eastern Orthodox Churches in the 20th century}}

====Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Empire====
[[File:2003-04-18 Moscow Kremlin.jpg|thumb|300px|Churches of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], as seen from the [[Balchug]] ]]
The Russian Orthodox Church held a privileged position in the [[Russian Empire]], expressed in the motto, [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Populism]], of the late Russian Empire. At the same time, it was placed under the control of the [[Tsar]] by the [[Church reform of Peter I]] in the 18th century. Its governing body was [[Most Holy Synod]], which was run by an official (titled [[Ober-Procurator]]) appointed by the Tsar himself.

The church was involved in the various campaigns of [[russification]],&lt;ref&gt;Natalia Shlikhta (2004) "'Greek Catholic'-'Orthodox'-'Soviet': a symbiosis or a conflict of identities?" in ''Religion, State &amp; Society'', Volume 32, Number 3 (Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt; and accused of the involvement in [[anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]].&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Lambroza, John D. Klier (2003) ''Pogroms: Anti-Jewish Violence in Modern Russian History'' (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of anti-Semitism and the anti-Jewish pogroms, no evidence is given of the direct participation of the church, and many Russian Orthodox clerics, including senior hierarchs, openly defended persecuted Jews, at least from the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=JCR&gt;[http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=787 "Jewish-Christian Relations" ], by the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Church has no official position on Judaism as such.&lt;ref name=JCR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is no coincidence that in the entry on 'Orthodoxy' in the seventh volume of the Kratkaya Evreiskaya Entsyklopedia, devoted to the Russian Orthodox Church (pp. 733–743), where numerous examples are given of persecution of the Jews in Russia, including religious persecution, no evidence is given of the direct participation of the church, either in legislative terms or in the conduct of policy. Although the authors of the article state that the active role of the Church in inciting the government to conduct anti-Jewish acts (for example in the case of Ivan the Terrible's policy in the defeated territories) is 'obvious', no facts are given in their article to support this. http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=787&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church was allowed to impose [[tax]]es on the [[peasant]]s. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

The Church, like the Tsarist state was seen as an enemy of the people by the [[Bolsheviks]] and other Russian revolutionaries.

====Russian Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union====
The Russian Orthodox Church [[collaborationism|collaborated]] with the [[White Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] (see [[White movement]]) after the October Revolution. This may have further strengthened the Bolshevik animus against the church.

After the October Revolution of 7 November 1917 (October 25 Old Calendar) there was a movement within the [[Soviet Union]] to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see [[Communist International]]). This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States. Since some of these Slavic states tied their ethnic heritage to their ethnic churches, both the peoples and their church where targeted by the Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;President of Lithuania: Prisoner of the Gulag a Biography of [[Aleksandras Stulginskis]] by Afonsas Eidintas Genocide and Research Centre of Lithuania {{ISBN|9986-757-41-X}} / 9789986757412 / 9986–757–41-X pg 23 "As early as August 1920 [[Lenin]] wrote to [[E. M. Skliansky]], President of the Revolutionary War Soviet: "We are surrounded by the greens (we pack it to them), we will move only about 10–20 versty and we will choke by hand the [[bourgeoisie]], the clergy and the landowners.

The Soviet Union was the first state to have as an ideological objective the elimination of religion. Toward that end, the Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organised religions were never outlawed.
Some actions against Orthodox priests and believers along with [[execution]] included [[torture]] being sent to [[gulags|prison camps]], [[sharashka|labour camps]] or [[Psikhushka|mental hospitals]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Father Arseny 1893–1973 Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father.

The result of this [[state atheism]] was to transform the Church into a persecuted and martyred Church. In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ostling|Ostling, Richard]]. "Cross meets Kremlin" TIME Magazine, 2001-06-24. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; This included people like the [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]] who was at this point a monastic. Along with her murder was [[Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich]] Romanov; the Princes [[Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia|Ioann Konstantinovich]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Konstantin Konstantinovich]], [[Igor Konstantinovich of Russia|Igor Konstantinovich]] and [[Vladimir Paley|Vladimir Pavlovich Paley]]; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and [[Varvara Yakovleva]], a sister from the Grand Duchess Elizabeth's convent. They were herded into the forest, pushed into an abandoned mineshaft and grenades were then hurled into the mineshaft. Her remains were buried in [[Jerusalem]], in the [[Church of Maria Magdalene]].

[[File:Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour-3.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Christ the Saviour Cathedral Moscow]] after reconstruction]]
The main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. Nearly its entire clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Of these, 95,000 were put to death, executed by firing squad.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Father [[Pavel Florensky]] was one of the [[New-martyr]]s of this particular period.

After Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.&lt;ref&gt;Ostling, Richard. "Cross meets Kremlin" TIME Magazine, 2001-06-24. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated into public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. Outside of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it could not instruct or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all illegal and or banned. This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or [[samizdat]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
Since the fall of the Soviet Union there have been many [[New-martyr]]s added as Saints from the yoke of atheism.

====Diaspora emigration to the West====
One of the most striking developments in modern historical Orthodoxy is the dispersion of Orthodox Christians to the West. Emigration from Greece and the Near East in the last hundred years has created a sizable Orthodox diaspora in Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. In addition, the Bolshevik Revolution forced thousands of Russian exiles westward. As a result, Orthodoxy's traditional frontiers have been profoundly modified. Millions of Orthodox are no longer geographically "eastern" since they live permanently in their newly adopted countries in the West. Nonetheless, they remain Eastern Orthodox in their faith and practice.

'''Cyrildene''' ({{zh|t =西里爾德納|s =西里尔德纳}}) is a suburb of [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. The area is found east of the Johannesburg CBD and is surrounded by the suburbs of [[Linksfield, Gauteng|Linksfield]], [[Observatory, Gauteng|Observatory]] and [[Bruma, Gauteng|Bruma]]. It is noted for a new Chinatown that exists on Derrick Avenue. This new Chinatown is now considered as the main Chinatown in Johannesburg, replacing the declining Chinatown on [[Commissioner Street (Johannesburg)|Commissioner Street]] in the inner-city of Johannesburg. It is located in Region E of the [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality]].

==History==
The suburb is situated on part of an old [[Witwatersrand]] farm called ''Doornfontein''.&lt;ref name="Dict01"&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names | publisher=Jonathan Ball Publishers | author1=Raper, Peter E. | author2=Moller, Lucie A. | author3=du Plessis, Theodorus L. | year=2014 | pages=1412 | isbn=9781868425501}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be proclaimed as suburb on 18 May 1938 and was named after the land developer's son, Cyril Cooper.&lt;ref name=Dict01/&gt;

Up until approximately 2000 Cyrildene was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. Unlike the old and now largely abandoned Chinatown in [[Newtown, Johannesburg|Newtown]], which was largely made up of second or third generation [[South African Chinese]], the new inhabitants of the Chinatown in Cyrildene are overwhelmingly first generation Chinese immigrants from [[mainland China]].&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-01-22-hoes-my-china-nou | title=Hoe's my China nou? | publisher=Mail and Guardian Online | date=January 22, 2007 | accessdate=June 1, 2011 | author=John Matshikiza}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinatown has a [[paifang]] (arch).[[File:Johannesburg-China Town1.jpg|thumb|left|A street scene of the [[Chinatown]] on Derrick Avenue in Cyrildene, Johannesburg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="106889">{{Main|Logarithmic timeline}}

This timeline shows the whole [[history of the universe]], the [[Earth]], and [[Human|mankind]] in one table. Each row is defined in ''years ago'', that is, [[year]]s before the present [[calendar date|date]], with the earliest times at the top of the chart. In each table cell on the right, references to events or notable people are given, more or less in chronological order within the cell.

Each row corresponds to a change in log(time before present) of about 0.1 (using log base 10). The dividing points are taken from the R′′20 [[Renard numbers]].

The table is divided into sections with subtitles. Note that each such section contains about 68% of all the time from the beginning of the section until now.

The term '''directed evolution''' is used within the [[transhumanist]] community to refer to the idea of applying the principles of [[directed evolution]] and [[experimental evolution]] to the control of human evolution.&lt;ref name=mehlman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=Mehlman|title=Will Directed Evolution Destroy Humanity, and If So, What Can We Do About It?|url=http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/SLUJHP/Mehlman_Article.pdf|publisher=3 St. Louis U.J. Health L. &amp; Pol'y 93, 96-97 (2009]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210230309/http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/SLUJHP/Mehlman_Article.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is distinct from the use of the term in [[biochemistry]], which refers only to the evolution of [[proteins]] and [[RNA]]. Maxwell J. Melhmanh has described directed evolution of humans as the Holy Grail of [[transhumanism]].&lt;ref name = mehlman/&gt;
Oxford philosopher [[Julian Savulescu]] wrote that:
{{Quote
 |quote  = Humanity until this point has been a story of evolution for the survival genes - survival and reproduction ... we are entering a new phase of human evolution—evolution under reason—where human beings are masters of their destiny. Power has been transferred from nature to science.
 |source = [[Julian Savulescu]] &lt;ref name=Savulescu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savulescu|first1=Julian|title=Human-Animal Transgenesis and Chimeras Might Be an Expression of Our Humanity|journal=Journal of Bioethics|date=2003|volume=3|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 |width  = 90%
 |align  = center

}}

According to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] biophysicist [[Gregory Stock]]:
{{Quote
 |quote  = Humanity is leaving its childhood and moving into its adolescence as its powers infuse into realms hitherto beyond our reach.
 |source = [[Gregory Stock]] &lt;ref name=gstock&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stock|first1=Gregory|title=Germinal Choice Technology and the Human Future|journal=Ethics L. &amp; Moral Phil. Reprod. Biomedicine|date=2005|volume=10|pages=27–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

[[Riccardo Campa]], from the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], wrote that "self-directed evolution" can be coupled with many different political, philosophical, and religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campa|first1=Riccardo|title=Toward a transhumanist politics|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/campa20090622/|website=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
Andrew Askland, from the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] claims that referring to [[transhumanism]] as directed evolution is problematic because evolution is ateleological and transhumanism is [[teleological]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Askland|first1=Andrew|title=The Misnomer of Transhumanism as Directed Evolution|journal=International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1|pages=71–78|url=https://www.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227044619/https://www.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participant evolution is an alternative term that refers to the process of deliberately redesigning the [[human body]] and [[Human brain|brain]] using [[Technology|technological]] means, rather than through the natural processes of [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]], with the goal of removing "biological limitations" and human enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=28HEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|title=Human Nature in an Age of Biotechnology: The Case for Mediated Posthumanism|first=Tamar|last=Sharon|date=11 October 2013|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LiOheK_2uZ8C&amp;pg=PA376|title=Biomedicalization: Technoscience, Health, and Illness in the U.S.|first1=Adele E.|last1=Clarke|first2=Laura|last2=Mamo|first3=Jennifer Ruth|last3=Fosket|first4=Jennifer R.|last4=Fishman|first5=Janet K.|last5=Shim|date=1 January 2009|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WgPHCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT179|title=The Cybernetics Moment: Or Why We Call Our Age the Information Age|first=Ronald R.|last=Kline|date=25 June 2015|publisher=[[JHU Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mZLV5wLbQvAC&amp;pg=PA58|title=Iphigenias at Aulis: Textual Multiplicity, Radical Philology|first=Sean Alexander|last=Gurd|date=1 January 2005|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WK3Wj2bwHScC&amp;pg=PA169|title=Panic Diaries: A Genealogy of Panic Disorder|first=Jackie|last=Orr|date=8 February 2006|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Ix1HCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Transcend the Flesh: Transhumanism debate|first=Tobiasz|last=Mazan|date=17 April 2015|publisher=Tobiasz Mazan|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g7mZw8FSHpwC|title=Beyond Human: From Animality to Transhumanism|first1=Charlie|last1=Blake|first2=Claire|last2=Molloy|first3=Steven|last3=Shakespeare|date=15 March 2012|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7CIeXt8yIhkC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Frontiers of Cyberspace|first=Daniel|last=Riha|date=28 December 2016|publisher=Rodopi|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=629wC2skzb0C&amp;pg=PA125|title=Rape of the Wild: Man's Violence Against Animals and the Earth|first1=Andrée|last1=Collard|first2=Joyce|last2=Contrucci|date=1 January 1989|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=pDg3jDHDBSUC&amp;pg=PA94|title=Shaw and Science Fiction|first=Milton T.|last=Wolf|date=1 January 1997|publisher=[[Penn State Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoundmusic.com/home/microsound/.blogs/post8883/Drugs%2C%20Space%2C%20and%20Cybernetics%3B%20Evolution%20to%20Cyborgs.pdf |date=1961 |title=Drugs, Space, and Cybernetics: Evolution to Cyborgs |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208174752/http://www.microsoundmusic.com/home/microsound/.blogs/post8883/Drugs%2C%20Space%2C%20and%20Cybernetics%3B%20Evolution%20to%20Cyborgs.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Whilst Clynes and Kline saw participant evolution as the process of creating [[cyborg]]s, the idea has been adopted and propounded by [[Transhumanism|transhumanists]] who argue that individuals should have the choice of using [[human enhancement]] technologies on themselves and their children, to progressively become [[transhuman]] and ultimately [[posthuman]], as part of a voluntary regimen of participant evolution.

'''Edward Hall''' or '''Halle''' (1497–1547), was an English lawyer, Member of Parliament, and historian, best known for his ''The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancastre and Yorke'', commonly known as ''Hall's Chronicle''.

==Family==
Edward Hall, born in 1497, was the son of John Hall (d. 22 February 1528) of Northall in [[Kynnersley]], Shropshire, a London [[Worshipful Company of Grocers|grocer]] and [[Merchants of the Staple|Merchant of the Staple]] who resided in the parish of [[St Mildred, Poultry|St Mildred in the Poultry]].{{sfn|Harding|1982|pp=27980}}{{sfn|Grazebrook|Rylands|1889|pp=207–8}}&lt;ref name=Emerson&gt;[http://www.kateemersonhistoricals.com/TudorWomenG.htm Catherine Gedding (d.1557), A Who’s Who of Tudor Women: G, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct ''Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England'' (1984)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081933/http://www.kateemersonhistoricals.com/TudorWomenG.htm |date=11 June 2013 }} Retrieved 24 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Herman|2004}} The surname Hall appears in the records of the [[Worshipful Company of Grocers]] for several generations prior to Hall's birth, suggesting that members of the family had been London merchants for some time. Hall's father served as Warden of the Grocers in 1512.{{sfn|Herman|2004}}

According to some sources, Hall's mother, Katherine Geddyng, was the daughter and coheir of Thomas Geddyng of [[Norfolk]],{{sfn|Harding|1982|p=279}}&lt;ref name=Emerson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding states on p. 279 that Katherine's father was from Norfolk; however on p. 280 he states that Katherine was from Lackford, Suffolk.&lt;/ref&gt; while according to others she was the daughter of John Geddyng, great-grandson of William Geddyng of [[Lackford]], Suffolk, and Mirabel Aspale, daughter and heiress of Sir John de Aspale.{{sfn|Rokewood|1838|pp=46–8}}{{sfn|Richardson II|2011|p=505}} Katherine (née Geddying) Hall's burial on 19 June 1557 in the church of [[St Benet Sherehog]] was recorded by the diarist [[Henry Machyn]].{{sfn|Cooper|Cooper|1858|p=537}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=machyn;cc=machyn;view=text;idno=5076866.0001.001;rgn=div2;node=5076866.0001.001%3A8.8 A London Provisioner’s Chronicle, 1550–1563, by Henry Machyn] Retrieved 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She appointed as executor of her will [[William Garrard|Sir William Garrard]], and as supervisor Dame Joan Warren, the second wife of [[Ralph Warren (Lord Mayor)|Sir Ralph Warren]], [[List of Lord Mayors of London|Lord Mayor of London]].{{sfn|Harding|1982|p=282}}{{sfn|Archer|2004}} According to some sources, Katherine was the 'Mistress Hall' who in 1555 was imprisoned in [[Newgate]] for her faith under Queen Mary Tudor, and with whom the religious reformer [[John Bradford]] corresponded.&lt;ref name=Emerson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=machyn;cc=machyn;view=text;idno=5076866.0001.001;rgn=div2;node=5076866.0001.001%3A8.8 A London Provisioner’s Chronicle, 1550–1563, by Henry Machyn] Retrieved 24 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnfoxe.org/index.php?realm=text&amp;edition=1576&amp;pageid=1590&amp;gototype=modern Letter from John Bradford to Mistress Hall, prisoner in Newgate, John Foxe’s The Acts and Monuments Online] Retrieved 24 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Hall had a brother, William, who survived him, but no other known brothers or sisters.{{sfn|Herman|2004}}{{sfn|Harding|1982|p=282}}

==Career==
Hall began his education at [[Eton College|Eton]]. In 1514 he was admitted to [[King's College, Cambridge]], graduating BA in 1518.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=HL514E|name=Hall, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Herman|2004}} At about the time of Hall's graduation from university, the second son of [[Robert Fabyan]] (d.1513) became apprentice to Hall's father, and according to Herman, it was perhaps through this connection that Hall developed what became a lifelong interest in chronicling the events of English history.{{sfn|Herman|2004}}

Hall was a student at [[Gray's Inn]] by 1521, and became a lawyer by profession.{{sfn|Herman|2004}} He was [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Autumn Reader]] at his Inn in 1533, and Lent Reader in 1540.{{sfn|Harding|1982|p=279}}

According to Herman, Hall may have been first elected to Parliament as early as 1523. He was elected to represent [[Much Wenlock (UK Parliament constituency)|Much Wenlock]] in 1529, and represented the borough again in 1539.{{sfn|Herman|2004}}&lt;ref&gt;According to Harding, however, the constituency Hall represented in 1539 is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1542, and again in 1545, he was elected for [[Bridgnorth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgnorth]].{{sfn|Harding|1982|p=279}}

Hall served as [[Common Serjeant of London]] from 17 March 1533 to 2 June 1535, and as [[Undersheriff|Under-Sheriff]] from 2 June 1535 until his death.{{sfn|Harding|1982|p=279}}

==''Chronicle''==
[[File:Hall Union 1550.JPG|thumb|right|Title page of the 1550 edition of Hall's ''Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancastre and Yorke'', depicting the descent of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] from [[John of Gaunt]] and [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund of Langley]]]]
Hall's best-known work, ''The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancastre and Yorke'', commonly called ''Hall's Chronicle'', was published by the printer [[Richard Grafton]] in 1548, the year after Hall's death. A revised edition (printed for Grafton by [[Richard Jugge]]) appeared in 1550. Both included a continuation from 1532 compiled by Grafton from the author's notes.{{sfn|Pollard|1933}}&lt;ref&gt;The claim that Hall published an earlier edition of the ''Chronicle'' in 1542 is now discredited.&lt;/ref&gt; The only complete modern edition, entitled ''Hall's Chronicle, Containing the History of England During the Reign of Henry IV and the Succeeding Monarchs to the End of the Reign of Henry VIII'', was prepared under the supervision of Sir [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]] and published in 1809. A reprint was issued in 1965.{{sfn|Herman|2004}} In 1904 the concluding chapter dealing with the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was edited by [[Charles Whibley]].

The ''Chronicle'' begins with the accession of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] to the English throne in 1399; it follows the [[Wars of the Roses|strife between the houses of Lancaster and York]], and with Grafton's continuation carries the story down to the death of Henry VIII in 1547. Hall presents the policy of this king in a very favourable light and shows his own sympathy with the [[Protestants]]. He has a lawyer's respect for ceremonial of all kinds, and his pages are often adorned and encumbered with the pageantry and material garniture of the story.

The value of the ''Chronicle'' in its early stages is not great, but this increases when dealing with the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and is very considerable for the reign of Henry VIII. To the historian it furnishes what is evidently the testimony of an eye-witness on several matters of importance which are neglected by other narrators; and to the student of literature it is of interest as one of the prime sources of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Shakespearean history|history plays]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[James Gairdner]], ''Early Chroniclers of Europe''; England (1879).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 1940 Alan Keen, a dealer in antiquarian books, discovered an extensively annotated copy of Hall's ''Chronicle'' among the contents of a library from outside London which he had just purchased.{{sfn|Keen|Lubbock|1954|p=1}} Keen considered that the marginal annotations, most of which are found in the chapters covering the reigns of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], were made by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].{{sfn|Keen|Lubbock|1954|pp=29–30}} Keen published his findings in two journal articles,{{sfn|Keen|1940|pp=255–62}}{{sfn|Keen|1951|pp=256–270}} and in a book co-authored with Alan Lubbock in 1954, ''The Annotator''. After his death Keen left the volume in the hands of trustees, who placed it in the [[British Library]], where until 2007 it was catalogued as Loan MS 61.&lt;ref&gt;E-mail from Manuscripts Department, British Library, 31 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
There is no evidence as to whether Hall ever married. His will, made in 1546–7, makes no mention of a wife or children, and the only family members named are his brother, William, whom he appoints as executor of his will, and his mother, whom he appoints as overseer. In his will he requested burial in the [[Greyfriars, London]], but he was instead buried in the church of [[St Benet Sherehog]], which was subsequently destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] and not rebuilt. He left all his books in French and English to his brother, William, and his manuscript of his chronicle to [[Richard Grafton]], entrusting him with its publication.{{sfn|Harding|1982|p=282}}{{sfn|Herman|2004}}

Professor '''Enrique García Hernán''' (Madrid 1964) is a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[historian]] of the culture of early modern [[Europe]].  His research examines the interaction of religious sentiment, political thought and [[international relations]] in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  It attempts to bridge the gap between the study of forms of cultural and intellectual expression and the realities of political, diplomatic and military organization.  He is a Corresponding Fellow (''Académico correspondiente'') of the Royal Academy of History (''Real Academia de la Historia''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rah.es/|title=INICIO - Real Academia de la Historia|website=Real Academia de la Historia}}&lt;/ref&gt; member of the Board of Directors (''Vocal'') of the Spanish Commission for Military History (''la Comisión Española de Historia Militar''),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defensa.gob.es/ceseden/cehismi/&lt;/ref&gt; and Fellow (''Académico'') of the Ambrosiana Academy of Milan (''la Academia Ambrosiana de Milán'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambrosiana.eu/cms/page-191-191.html&lt;/ref&gt;  His current academic affiliation is as a research professor (''Profesor de Investigación'') in the Institute of History, within the Center for Humanities and Social Sciences (''Centro de Ciencias Sociales y Humanas'') at the [[Spanish National Research Council]] (''Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas'' or ‘CSIC’).  The Spanish National Research Council is the largest public institution dedicated to research in [[Spain]] and the third largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cchs.csic.es/|title=Inicio - Centro de Ciencias Humanas y Sociales|website=www.cchs.csic.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career trajectory==

Dr García Hernán has two doctorates, one in [[ecclesiastical history]] from the [[Gregorian University]] of [[Rome]], and one within the discipline of [[Early modern period|early modern history]] from the [[University Complutense]] of [[Madrid]].  He has published more than ten monograph studies (single-authored) and one joint-study with his brother, David García Hernán.  In addition he has edited or co-edited nine books, and authored more than seventy articles in Spanish, English and Italian.  He is currently supervising a number of doctoral students.  He is one the editor of a new series of monograph studies dedicated to the international impact of Spain, entitled the Historia de España y su proyección internacional, which is published by ''Albatros Ediciones'' in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graficas-soler.com/albatros/contact_us.htm|title=Albatros Contact-us|website=www.graficas-soler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first research focused on [[Saint Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gandía|Saint Francis Borgia]] and this project led to the publication of a major monograph on Borgia’s diplomatic efforts on behalf of the [[Papacy]] in 1571 and 1572.  This project led him to study the great Mediterranean campaigns fought by the Spanish Monarchy and the Christian [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] in the 1560s and 1570s.  This interest resulted in a number of important and innovative studies, one on the [[Spanish Armada]] and the defense of the Mediterranean during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (1556–1598) and one on the immediate circumstances after the [[Battle of Lepanto of 1571|Battle of Lepanto]] (7 October 1571).  A number of highly regarded papers – for instance, on the diplomatic efforts to establish an alliance between the Holy League and [[Safavid Persia]] in the early 1570s; on the ‘messianic outlook’ of [[Pope Pius V]] (pontificate 1566-1572); on the campaigns that saw the conquest and loss of [[Tunis]] in 1573-74 – have resulted from these works.  In turn, these interests in the Mediterranean have led to a number of research projects and have influenced the works of historians such as Beatriz Alonso Acero and Phillip Williams.

Dr García Hernán's other principal area of interest lies in the relationship between [[Ireland]], the Spanish Monarchy and the Papacy in the sixteenth-, seventeenth- and eighteenth-centuries.  Again, this line of ‘investigación’ can be traced back to the pontificate of Pius V.  Dr García Hernán’s research has cast light on the complex web of diplomatic relations that sprung up after 1560; in particular it has led to the study of the negotiations between Madrid, Rome and the Gaelic nobles and aristocrats who came to be increasingly alienated by the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] regime in Ireland and who, correspondingly, looked to the [[Habsburgs]] of Spain as their natural protectors.  This project has led to the forging of links between groups of historians and academics in Spain and Ireland.  It has provided important new perspectives not only on the (often-tortuous) diplomatic exchanges between [[London]], [[Dublin]], Rome and Madrid, but also on the relative military strengths of the protagonists.  In turn these insights have spawned a number of doctoral research projects, which have been brought to fruition by students such as Igor Pérez Tostado, Óscar Recio Morales, Diego Téllez Alarcia, Eduardo De Mesa and Cristina Bravo.  The exploration of the vast archive holdings in [[Simancas]], Madrid and Rome has made us aware of the presence of large numbers of Irish troops in Habsburg armies and fleets after the defeat of the Irish rebellion at the [[Battle of Kinsale]] (1601).  This rebellion had been sponsored and assisted by [[Philip III of Spain]] (1598–1621).  Dr García Hernán is working currently on the Mission of Ireland, a database with more than 35,000 documents detailing the ‘viatica’ of Irish priests instructed in Spain and sent to Ireland.

==Interdisciplinary research: conferences and workshops==

Prof García Hernán’s edited volumes of essays  have sought to break down barriers between the various disciplines of the humanities and between the self-contained and isolated narratives of national history.  They have also sought to re-integrate our understanding of developments in Spain with events in [[Italy]], [[England]] and `[[Ireland]].

==Current projects and future research plans==
[[File:CPRs.jpg|thumb|Presentation of the volume of essays on the Irish presence in the Cortes of Cádiz, 1812.]]

Prof García Hernán is an academic adviser to the editors of the new [[military history]] of Spain, ''Historia Militar de España'', whose overall director is Hugo O´Donnell.  At present five volumes have been published by Laberinto.&lt;ref&gt;http://edicioneslaberinto.es/collection/61&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other projects have recently been completed - on the Cortes of Cadiz of 1812, War and Society in early modern Europe and the relationship between Poland, northern Europe and Spain in the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guillesb64.wix.com/albatros#!titulos2/c1u2t|title=albatros|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://publicaciones.defensa.gob.es/inicio/libros/libro/presencia-germ%C3%A1nica-en-la-milicia-espa%C3%B1ola-n%C2%BA3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22115757-03501001|title=War and Society in Spain|first=Enrique García|last=Hernán|date=30 May 2015|publisher=|journal=International Bibliography of Military History|volume=35|issue=1|pages=9–35|via=booksandjournals.brillonline.com|doi=10.1163/22115757-03501001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the co-founder and editor of the series of a new series of monograph studies (Historia de España y su proyección internacional, mentioned above) Dr García Hernán welcomes proposals for studies that break down the barriers between national histories and the disciplines.

Dr García Hernán was appointed to the board of the ''Comisión Española de Historia Militar'' in 2006. In the following year he was elected to the ''Real Academia de Historia''.   In 2010 he was made a fellow of the Ambrosiana Academy of Milan (''la Academia Ambrosiana de Milán'').

'''Fu Ssu-nien''' ({{zh|c=傅斯年|p=Fù Sīnián}}; 26 March 1896 – 20 December 1950), was a famous Chinese educator and [[linguistics|linguist]], and one of the leaders of the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919. He studied experimental psychology at [[University College London]] from 1920-23. He was also one of the creators of the [[Academia Sinica]], and was named director of the Institute of History and Philology upon its founding in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Xu Yahui (Hsu Ya-hwei) 許雅惠; Ancient Chinese Writing, Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin, 2002. Illustrated guide to the Special Exhibition of Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica. English translation by [[Mark Caltonhill]] and Jeff Moser. National Palace Museum, Taipei. Govt. Publ. No. 1009100250, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Fu was born on 26 March 1896 in [[Shandong]], immediately after the First Sino-Japanese War,&lt;ref name="f" /&gt; a time when the traditional systems were being challenged and revolutions were about to happen.

In 1909, Fu entered the secondary school set up by [[Tianjin]] government, excelling in mathematics, English, and Chinese. In 1913, Fu was accepted by the preparatory school of [[Peking University]] where he ranked first upon graduation in humanities division.&lt;ref name="f"&gt;Wang, Fan-shen, ''Fu Ssu-nien: A life in Chinese history and politics.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Fu went on to the Chinese Department of Peking University to pursue his bachelor's degree. During his time at the university, Fu gradually changed from a conservative to a radical.&lt;ref name="f" /&gt; In 1919, Fu participated in the famous [[May Fourth Movement]] and was one of the major students leaders. On the morning of 4 May 1919, Fu led a group of approximate 3000 students to protest the Chinese government's weak response to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ceded the Shandong province to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Schwarcz, ''The Chinese Enlightenment: Intellectuals and the Legacy of the May Fourth Movement of 1919'', University of California Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Fu went to Europe to continue his education. His first stop was [[University College London]]. Fu registered in the department of Psychology and took most courses at undergraduate level.&lt;ref name="f" /&gt; He also spent a considerable amount of time in medical school courses. In June 1923, Fu traveled to Berlin and  studied at [[Berlin University]] because the high inflation in Germany after [[World War I]] gave him a favorable exchange rate. It seemed that Fu never intended to obtain a B.A degree at these overseas institutions. Instead, he advised his friends to utilize this rare chance to pursue as much learning as possible.&lt;ref name="f" /&gt;

==Academic career==
In Oct 1926, Fu accepted an offer from [[Zhongshan University|Sun Yat-sen University]] and joined the faculty of humanities and social science. He became the department head in 1928. On the national scene, he established the Institute of History and Philology (IHP) of [[Academia Sinica]], and remained as director until his death.&lt;ref name="f" /&gt;

In 1929, Fu moved  the Institute of History and Philology to Peking and started to teach at [[Peking University]], his alma mater. In 1945, Fu was appointed as acting president of Peking University at the age of 50. In 1946, his second year as the acting president, he excluded many "turncoat" professors who supported the [[Wang Jingwei]] government, a puppet government controlled by Japanese force during [[World War II]]. During his term, Fu also recruited many famous scholars at that time, such as [[Ji Xianlin]] and [[Zhu Guangqian]].&lt;ref name="f" /&gt;

Fu did not shy away from controversy. After organization of the path-breaking [[Yinxu|Yinxu excavations]], he published his [[East Yi West Xia]] theory about the origin of prehistory culture in current China, 1933. This theory has not been accepted by later scholars, but Fu's approach and techniques were widely influential. He is known due to his pioneering historico-philological research of concepts "nature" ''xing'' 性 and "destiny" ''ming'' 命. Rather than making arguments based on philosophy, he developed interpretations proceeding from the archaic morphemes 生 and 令. His condemnation of the [[Chinese medicine]] ''guoyi'' as being not scientific remains a point of debate. Despite his own call for historical objectivity, Fu opposed the [[Mukden incident|Japanese aggression]] with the quasi-historical claim that Manchuria and Mongolia were not entitled for independence from China.&lt;ref name="f" /&gt;

In 1947, after witnessing the drastic deterioration of the economy, Fu published three famous articles calling for Soong's resignation of [[T. V. Soong]]. Soong resigned some days later due to mounting public pressure.&lt;ref name="f" /&gt; In 1948, Fu attempted suicide but was saved because of the retreat of [[KMT]] forces in the civil war. Fu went to [[Taiwan]] in the earlier part of 1949. On 20 January 1949, he was appointed President of [[National Taiwan University]].&lt;ref name="f" /&gt; In July, Fu was accused of recruiting faculty members with communist backgrounds. An article published in a local newspaper said that National Taiwan University under Fu's leadership had turned into a base for communists.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; Despite Fu's deep belief in academic freedom, he was forced to compromise his beliefs with the political pressure of the day and fire those scholars alleged to have communist ties.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;歐素瑛〈貢獻這個大學于宇宙的精神－談傅斯年與臺灣大學師資之改善〉&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1950, Fu died in the Provincial Assembly of Taiwan at the age of 55 due to hypertension.&lt;ref  name="f" /&gt; The Fu Ssu-nien Library of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica in Taiwan was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihp.sinica.edu.tw/english/introduction.html Institute of History and Philology]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous quotes==

'''Gabriel Bucelin''' (also ''Gabriel Buzlin'', ''Gabriel Bincelint'', or ''Gabriel Bucelinus'') (29 December 1599, [[Diessenhofen]], [[Thurgau]] &amp;ndash; 9 June 1681, [[Weingarten, Württemberg|Weingarten]]) was a [[Benedictine]] polymath, Humanist, historical writer and cartographer.

==Life==
A scion of the distinguished line of Bucellini counts, Gabriel, at the age of thirteen, entered the Benedictine monastery at Weingarten. After a course in philosophy and theology at the Jesuit [[University of Dillingen]] he was ordained a priest on April 23, 1624. In the same year he was sent, as master of novices, to restore the primitive fervour and raise the standard of studies in the monastery of St. Trudpert in the [[Black Forest]]. In 1627 he became secretary to Abbott Franz Dietrich and to the Swabian Benedictine congregation. He filled the position of master of novices at Weingarten and professor of humanities at Feldkirch (1635), from which on the approach of the Swedish army he was forced to flee to Vienna, Venice, and finally [[Admont]] (1646). There he was appointed prior of St. John's monastery, Feldkirch (1651), where he remained until a few months before his death, when he returned to Weingarten.

==Works==
Bucelin was a universal scholar and a very prolific writer, being the author of some fifty-three works on genealogy, world history, hagiography and church history. He also drew maps and plans. A large number of his works are still in manuscript in the state library at [[Stuttgart]]. Many of his works remained unpublished, perhaps because of the disruptions of war. His chief claim to contemporary fame lies in the fact that he was, if not the first, at least among the first authors to deal with the ecclesiastical history of Germany. Of his published works the most important are:

*''Germania sacra'' (Augsburg, 1655), containing accounts of the principal ecclesiastics, archbishops, abbots, etc., as well as a list of the most important monasteries of Germany
*''Germaniae topo-chrono-stemmatographia sacra et profana'' (1665–78), treating, as its name implies, of the genealogy of the most distinguished members of the clergy and the nobility
*''Constantia sacra et profana'' (Frankfort, 1667)
*''Rhaetia etrusca, romana, gallica, germanica'' (Augsburg, 1661)
*''Nuclei Historiae universalis cum sacrae...'' (Ulm, 1650, 1654; carried from 1650 to 1735 by Schmier, ''Apparatum ad theologiam scholastico-polemico-practicam''), of great importance to scholars interested in ancient charts, bulls, diplomata, etc.

Bucelin was also the author of many works on the Benedictine Order and its most illustrious members, among them ''Aquila imperii benedictina'' (Venice, 1651), ''Annales Benedictini'' (Vienna 1655, Augsburg 1656) and ''Menologium benedictinum'' (Feldkirch, 1655).

'''George B. McMullen''' was an [[psychic archaeology|intuitive archaeologist]] and forensic [[remote viewing|remote viewer]] who claims that he has the ability{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} to use [[paranormal]] [[psychic]] abilities to use objects to tune into scenes from the past. He claims that he has his strong [[extrasensory perception]] to locate ancient sites for archaeological digs, or describe context of artifacts. Scientific archaeologists tested his claims which revealed to be extreme accurated.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/5568/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The author is deeply indebted to Dr. J. Norman Emerson of the University of Toronto for his instruction and inspiration over a number of years; and especially to Dr. Emerson and his collaborator Mr. George McMullen for their experiments in intuitive archaeology at the Boys site which led to the discovery of the palisade and of the second house structure.'' (THE BOYS SITE: A PICKERING BRANCH VILLAGES IN ONTARIO COUNTY, p. iv-v)

McMullen is the author of One White Crow which was published in 1995 and describes his long life experience as intuitive archaeologist. McMullen is also the author of Running Bear published in 1996, Two Faces published in 1997, and Born Many Times published in 1999.
He died on June 4, 2008.

'''Germán Arciniegas Angueyra''' (December 6, 1900 - November 30, 1999) was a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] historian, author and journalist who was known for his advocacy of educational and cultural issues, as well as his outspoken opposition to dictatorship. He also served as a college professor and held positions in the government, including Minister of Education and several ambassadorships.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/33083/German-Arciniegas Encyclopædia Britannica: Germán Arciniegas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Arciniegas was the son of Rafael Arciniegas Tavera, a farmer, and his wife Aurora Angueyra Figueredo. He had three brothers and four sisters. His father died young, leaving his mother struggling to support the family. His maternal great-grandfather was [[Perucho Figueredo]], an early Cuban [[freedom fighter]] who wrote [[La Bayamesa]], Cuba's [[national anthem]]. Both of Perucho's daughters fled the country when he was executed. Luz, the younger daughter, was married to a Cuban engineer who went to Colombia to help build a railroad line. It was there, amid the dangers of the jungle, that Germán's mother was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caimanbarbudo.cu/literatura/los-raros/2011/05/german-arciniegas/ Germán Arciniegas. Por Rafael Grillo. En El Caimán Barbudo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
At the age of eighteen, he began studying law at the [[National University of Colombia]]. At that time he had already created two journals: ''Año Quinto'' (1916) and ''Voz de la Juventud'' (1917). While a student he founded and managed the magazine ''Universidad'' (1921). He collaborated with many well-known figures at all three periodicals, including [[Luis López de Mesa]], [[José Vasconcelos]], [[León de Greiff]] and [[José Juan Tablada]], who introduced the [[haiku]] into Spanish literature via ''Universidad''. His love of journalism led him to establish and manage numerous cultural magazines throughout his life. In 1928, he joined [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]], a daily newspaper in Bogotá, where he managed the editorial section, put together the Sunday Literary Supplement and wrote a weekly column, becoming the general manager in 1937. He would continue to contribute articles and opinion pieces to El Tiempo for the rest of his life,&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; speaking out against drug trafficking, Marxist guerrillas and restrictive immigration policies.

With the assistance of [[Carlos Pellicer]], he established the Federation of Colombian Students. The group opposed [[Jesuit]] influence in the nation's universities and held student carnivals which verged on riots. He narrowly missed being killed when a bullet grazed his head at one student rally.&lt;ref name="FF" /&gt; Their activism eventually helped to end the [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative Party's]] grip on the government and, in 1933, led to the passage of university reforms, which gave students the right to elect their own rectors and have a representative in the legislature to act as their advocate; a position Arciniegas held for a time.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;[http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/poli/poli40.htm La Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango del Banco de la República: Germán Arciniegas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, students were the axis around which all political and intellectual movements had turned throughout history. This gave rise to his first book ''El Estudiante de la Mesa Redonda'' (The Student of the Round Table, 1932), in which he speaks of history as a "tavern" with the students sitting at a single table, drinking, recounting their deeds and laughing at everybody else.

==Later career==
He continued his fight for students' rights during his brief tenures as [[Ministry of National Education (Colombia)|Minister of Education]] in 1942 and 1945-46. During this time, he founded the [[Caro and Cuervo Institute]] and moved the [[Colombian National Museum]] to its current home in a former prison building.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt;

During World War II, he supported giving aid and asylum to refugees. This was in opposition to [[Luis López de Mesa]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who prohibited the entry of Jews into Colombia. Due to this resurgence of Conservative ideology in the 1940s, Arciniegas felt that he and his family were in danger and moved to the United States, taking advantage of an offer to teach at [[Columbia University]]. He lived in New York for ten years (1947–57).&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;[http://figueredo.freeservers.com/German%20Arciniegas%20Angueyra.htm The Perucho Figueredo Page: Biography of Arciniegas]&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, he wrote his most important and most often banned book, ''Entre la Libertad y el Miedo'' (Between Freedom and Fear, 1952). The work analyzes a critical period in Latin-America, when seven dictators were in power at the same time. He also criticized the [[U.S. State Department]] for its conciliatory behavior towards these regimes and, as a result, was detained for questioning several times after returning from trips abroad. 
The publication and translation of the book was prohibited in at least ten countries. General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]], the President of Colombia, accused Arciniegas of being a Communist and ordered all of his books to be burnt. [[Rafael Trujillo]], the dictator of the Dominican Republic, put Arciniegas on his hit list.&lt;ref name="FF" /&gt;

In terms of culture, Arciniegas strove to achieve and maintain a synthesis between the indigenous and the European. This approach was the driving force behind all of his diplomatic and political activities. He served as [[vice consul]] in London (1929), chancellor at the Colombian embassy in  Argentina (1940) and as Ambassador to Italy (1959), Israel (1962), Venezuela (1966) and the [[Holy See]] (1976).&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; In all of these positions, he acted as an advocate for the art and culture of America, which he perceived as extending from Alaska to Patagonia.

In 1992, he was appointed President  of the ''National Commission for the Celebration of the Five-Hundredeth Anniversary of the Discovery of America''. He was summarily dismissed by then First-Lady [[Ana Milena Muñoz Gómez|Ana Milena Muñoz de Gaviria]], who took over the commission herself; an action that generated much controversy.

'''Henry Louis''' "'''Skip'''" '''Gates Jr.''' (born September 16, 1950) is an American [[literary critic]], [[teacher]], [[historian]], [[filmmaker]] and [[public intellectual]] who currently serves as the [[Alphonse Fletcher]] University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at [[Harvard University]]. He discovered what are considered the [[African-American literature#Early African-American literature|first books by African-American writers]], both women, and has published extensively on appreciating [[African-American literature]] as part of the [[Western canon]].

In addition to producing and hosting previous series on the history and genealogy of prominent American figures, since 2012 Gates has been host for four seasons of the series ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'' on [[PBS]]. It combines the work of expert researchers in genealogy, history, and genetics historic research to tell guests about their ancestors' lives and histories.

==Early life and education==
Gates was born in [[Keyser, West Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/06/internationaleducationnews.highereducation|title=Henry the first|author=[[Maya Jaggi]]|work=The Guardian|date=July 6, 2002|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Henry Louis Gates Sr. and his wife Pauline Augusta (Coleman) Gates. He grew up in neighboring [[Piedmont, West Virginia|Piedmont]]. His father worked in a paper mill and moonlighted as a janitor, while his mother cleaned houses, as described in his memoir ''Colored People'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Louis-Gates-Jr www.britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has learned through contemporary research that his family is descended in part from the [[Yoruba people]] of [[west Africa]].&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzWnSM7TxNE|title=African American Lives The Past Is Another Country 2 4of4 - YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has European ancestry, and is connected to the distinctive [[multiracial]] West Virginia community of the [[Chestnut Ridge people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Your Roots: Decoding Our Past Through DNA|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/decoding-past-dna-full-episode/12882/|website=PBS.org|publisher=Public Broadcasting System}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also of part Irish descent.

At the age of 14 Gates was injured playing [[touch football (American)|touch football]], fracturing the [[ball and socket joint]] of his hip, resulting in a [[slipped capital femoral epiphysis]]. The injury was misdiagnosed by a physician, who told Gates' mother that his problem was psychosomatic. When the physical damage finally healed, his right leg was two inches shorter than his left. Because of the injury, Gates now uses a cane to help him walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/20/society | title=The biggest brother: interview with Henry Louis Gates, black America's foremost intellectual | work=[[The Observer]]| last=O'Hagan | first=Sean | date=July 20, 2003 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;''[http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/gates_h.htm Contemporary Black Biography]''. Vol. 67. [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]], 2008. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center, Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates graduated from Piedmont High School in 1968 and attended [[Potomac State College of West Virginia University]]. He completed his BA degree in [[history]] at [[Yale College]], ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]].'' The first African American to be awarded an [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] Fellowship, Gates sailed on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' for England and [[University of Cambridge]], where he studied [[English literature]] at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] and earned his PhD.

==Personal life==
Gates married Sharon Lynn Adams in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvwc.edu/lib/wv_authors/authors/a_gates.htm |title=West Virginia Weslesyan College biography |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726122601/http://www.wvwc.edu/lib/wv_authors/authors/a_gates.htm |archivedate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two daughters together before they divorced in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Begley, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/01/magazine/black-studies-new-star-henry-louis-gates-jr.html?pagewanted=all "Black Studies' New Star: Henry Louis Gates Jr."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 1, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After a month at [[Yale Law School]], Gates withdrew from the program. In October 1975 he was hired by Charles Davis as a secretary in the Afro-American Studies department at Yale. In July 1976, Gates was promoted to the post of Lecturer in Afro-American Studies with the understanding that he would be promoted to assistant professor upon completion of his doctoral [[dissertation]]. Jointly appointed to assistant professorships in English and Afro-American Studies in 1979, Gates was promoted to associate professor in 1984. While at Yale, Gates guided [[Jodie Foster]], who majored in [[African-American Literature]] at Yale with her [[thesis]] on [[Toni Morrison]].

In 1984, Gates was recruited by [[Cornell University]] with an offer of [[tenure]]; Gates asked Yale if they would match Cornell's offer, but they declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ambinder|first1=Marc J.|title=Yale Afro-Am Chair Resigns After Remarks of Yale Pres.|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/2/14/yale-afro-am-chair-resigns-after-remarks/?page=single|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=The Harvard Crimson|date=February 14, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates moved to Cornell in 1985, where he taught until 1989. Following a two-year stay at [[Duke University]], he was recruited to [[Harvard University]] in 1991. At Harvard, Gates teaches undergraduate and graduate courses as the Alphonse Fletcher [[Harvard University Professor|University Professor]], an endowed chair he was appointed to in 2006, and as a professor of English.&lt;ref name="hacp"&gt;{{cite web|author=History of American Civilization Program |title=Henry Louis Gates Jr. |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~amciv/faculty/gates.shtml |publisher=Harvard University |year=2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724062711/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~amciv/faculty/gates.shtml |archivedate=July 24, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he is the Director of the Hutchins Center for African &amp; African American Research.

As a literary theorist and [[literary criticism|critic]], Gates has combined literary techniques of [[deconstruction]] with native African literary traditions; he draws on [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[semiotics]] to analyze texts and assess matters of [[identity politics]]. As a black intellectual and public figure, Gates has been an outspoken critic of the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] literary canon. He has insisted that [[African-American literature|black literature]] must be evaluated by the aesthetic criteria of its culture of origin, not criteria imported from Western or European cultural traditions that express a "tone deafness to the black cultural voice" and result in "intellectual racism".&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt; In his major scholarly work, ''[[The Signifying Monkey]],'' a [[American Book Awards|1989 American Book Award winner]], Gates expressed what might constitute a [[African-American culture|black cultural aesthetic]]. The work extended application of the concept of "[[signifyin']]" to analysis of African-American works. "Signifyin'" refers to the significance of words that is based on context, and is accessible only to those who share the cultural values of a given speech community. It is rooted African-American literary criticism in the African-American vernacular tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Napier, Winston, ed. African American literary theory: A reader. NYU Press, 2000. pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

While Gates has stressed the need for greater recognition of black literature and black culture, he does not advocate a "separatist" black canon. Rather, he works for greater recognition of black works and their integration into a larger, [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] canon. He has affirmed the value of the Western tradition, but has envisioned a more inclusive canon of diverse works sharing common cultural connections: "Every black American text must confess to a complex ancestry, one high and low (that is, literary and vernacular) but also one white and black ... there can be no doubt that white texts inform and influence black texts (and ''vice versa''), so that a thoroughly integrated canon of American literature is not only politically sound, it is intellectually sound as well."&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

Gates has argued that a separatist, [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] education perpetuates racist stereotypes. He maintains that it is "ridiculous" to think that only blacks should be scholars of [[African literature|African]] and African-American literature. He argues, "It can't be real as a subject if you have to look like the subject to be an expert in the subject,&lt;ref name="ref01"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/gates/interview.html |title=Henry Louis Gates Jr. Interview |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |author=Bruce Cole |year=2002 |accessdate=January 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209194003/http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/gates/interview.html |archivedate=December 9, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; adding, "It's as ridiculous as if someone said I couldn't appreciate [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] because I'm not [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]]. I think it's vulgar and racist whether it comes out of a black mouth or a white mouth."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Breena, and Susan Tifft, "A 'Race Man' Argues for a Broader Curriculum: Henry Louis Gates Jr. Wants W. E. B. DuBois, Wole Soyinka and Phyllis Wheatley on the Nation's Reading Lists, As Well As Western Classics like Milton and Shakespeare", ''Time'': 137(16). April 22, 1991: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mediator between those advocating separatism and those believing in a [[Western canon]], Gates has been criticized by both. Some critics suggest that adding black literature will diminish the value of the Western canon, while separatists say that Gates is too accommodating to the dominant white culture in his advocacy of integration of the canon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Gates has been criticized by [[John Henrik Clarke]], Molefi Asante and the controversial [[Maulana Karenga]], each of whom has been questioned by others in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asante.net/articles/ |title= Papers by Molefi Asante | accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.africawithin.com/clarke/clarke_response.htm | title= Papers by John Henrik Clarke|accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asante.net"&gt;Molefi Kete Asante, [http://www.asante.net/articles/44/where-is-the-white-professor-located/ "Henry Louis Gates is Wrong about African Involvement in the Slave Trade"], Asante.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a literary historian committed to the preservation and study of historical texts, Gates has been integral to the Black Periodical Literature Project, a digital archive of black newspapers and magazines created with financial assistance from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute]] | title=Black Periodical Literature Project | url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~du_bois/research_projects/black_periodical_literature_project.html | publisher=Harvard University | year=2008 | accessdate=August 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build Harvard's visual, documentary, and literary archives of African-American texts, Gates arranged for the purchase of ''The Image of the Black in Western Art,'' a collection assembled by [[Dominique de Ménil]] in [[Houston]].

As a result of research as a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellow]], Gates discovered ''[[Our Nig]]'' by [[Harriet E. Wilson]], written in 1859 and now considered the first novel in the United States written by a black person. He acquired and authenticated the manuscript of ''[[The Bondwoman's Narrative]]'' by [[Hannah Crafts]], a novel from the same period that scholars believe may have been written as early as 1853. It would have precedence as the first-known novel written by a black person in the United States. (Note: ''[[Clotel]]'' (1853) is recognized as the first novel published by an African American but [[William Wells Brown]] wrote and published it in London.) ''The Bondwoman's Narrative'' was first published in 2002 and became a bestseller.

As a prominent black intellectual, Gates has concentrated on building academic institutions to study [[African-American culture|black culture]]. Additionally, he has worked to bring about social, educational, and intellectual equality for black Americans. His writing includes pieces in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that defend [[Hip hop music|rap]] music, and an article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that criticizes black youth culture for glorifying basketball over education. In 1992, he received a [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Award]] for his social commentary in ''The New York Times.'' Gates' prominence has led to his being called as a witness on behalf of the controversial Florida rap group [[2 Live Crew]] in an [[obscenity]] case. He argued that the material, which the government charged was profane, had important roots in [[African American Vernacular English]], games, and literary traditions, and should be protected.

Asked by [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Chairman Bruce Cole to describe his work, Gates responded: "I would say I'm a literary critic. That's the first descriptor that comes to mind. After that I would say I was a teacher. Both would be just as important."&lt;ref name="ref01"/&gt; After his 2003 NEH lecture, Gates published his 2003 book, ''The Trials of [[Phillis Wheatley]].''

==Other activities==
In 1995 Gates presented a program in the [[BBC]] series ''[[Great Railway Journeys]]'' (produced in association with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]). The program documents a 3,000-mile journey Gates took through [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]] and [[Tanzania]], with his then-wife Sharon Adams and daughters Liza and Meggie Gates. This trip came 25 years after Gates worked at a hospital in [[Kilimatinde]] near [[Dodoma]], [[Tanzania]], as a 19-year-old pre-medical student at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074rg2 Great Railway Journeys]". BBC. Retrieved February 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1995, Gates read a five-part abridgement (by [[Margaret Busby]]) of his memoir ''Colored People'' on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/a35eeb381ee44dbca6165166ca036c81 "Coloured People"], ''Radio Times'', Issue 3739, September 14, 1995, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates was the host and co-producer of ''[[African American Lives]]'' (2006) and ''[[African American Lives 2]]'' (2008) in which the lineage of more than a dozen notable African Americans was traced using [[genealogy|genealogical]] and historic resources, as well as [[genealogical DNA test]]ing. In the first series, Gates learned that he has 50% [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European ancestry]]&lt;ref name=10Percenter&gt;[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/the-10-percenter/?_r=0 "The 10 Percenter"], ''The New York Times'', October 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and 50% African ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2011/07/27/138601410/what-it-means-to-be-black-in-latin-america "What It Means to Be Black in Latin America"], NPR Books, January 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He had known of some European ancestry but was surprised to learn the high proportion; he also learned that he was descended from John Redman, a mulatto veteran in New England of the American Revolutionary War. Gates has joined the [[Sons of the American Revolution]]. In the series, he discussed findings with guests about their complex ancestries.

In the second season, Gates learned that he is part of a genetic subgroup possibly descended from or related to the fourth-century Irish king [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]]. He also learned that one of his African ancestors includes a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] man who was trafficked to America from [[Ouidah]] in present-day [[Republic of Benin]]. The two series demonstrated the many strands of heritage and history among African Americans.

Gates hosted ''[[Faces of America]]'', a four-part series presented by PBS in 2010. This program examined the genealogy of 12 North Americans of diverse ancestry: [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]], [[Mario Batali]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Louise Erdrich]], [[Malcolm Gladwell]], [[Eva Longoria]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Mike Nichols]], [[Queen Noor of Jordan]], [[Mehmet Oz]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Kristi Yamaguchi]].

Since 1995, Gates has been the jury chair for the [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]], which honors written works that contribute to society's understanding of racism and the diversity of human culture. Gates was an Anisfield-Wolf prize winner in 1989 for ''The Schomburg Library of Women Writers''.

Since 2012 he has hosted a [[PBS]] TV series,  called ''[[Finding Your Roots|Finding Your Roots&amp;nbsp;– with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/ ''Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.''], PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; The second season of the series, featuring 30 prominent guests across 10 episodes, with Gates as the narrator, interviewer, and genealogical investigator, aired on PBS in fall 2014.  The show's third season was postponed after it was discovered that actor [[Ben Affleck]] had persuaded Gates to omit information about his slave-owning ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11546891/Ben-Afflecks-slave-owning-ancestor-censored-from-genealogy-show.html |title=Ben Affleck's slave-owning ancestor 'censored' from genealogy show |work=The Telegraph |date=April 17, 2015 |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ben-affleck-demanded-pbs-suppress-his-slave-owning-ancestry/ |title=Ben Affleck Demanded PBS Suppress His Slave-Owning Ancestry |publisher=Mediaite |date=2015-04-18 |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koblin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koblin|first1=John|title=Citing Ben Affleck's 'Improper Influence,' PBS Suspends 'Finding Your Roots'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/business/media/citing-ben-afflecks-improper-influence-pbs-suspends-finding-your-roots.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news|accessdate=June 25, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Finding Your Roots'' resumed in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-finding-your-roots-pbs-return-20151019-story.html|title=PBS' 'Finding Your Roots' returning in January after Ben Affleck controversy|accessdate=February 11, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|date=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates's critically acclaimed six-part PBS documentary series, ''[[The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross]],'' traced 500 years of African-American history to the second inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]]. Gates wrote, executive produced, and hosted the series, which earned the 2013 Peabody Award and NAACP Image Award.

=="Ending the Slavery Blame-Game" op-ed==
In 2010, Gates wrote an op-ed in ''The New York Times'' that discussed the role played by Africans in the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Louis Gates Jr. (April 23, 2010). [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?pagewanted=all "Ending the Slavery Blame-Game"], ''The New York Times'', p. A27.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[Newsweek]]'', journalist [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]] reported on the reaction to Gates' article:

{{quote|The enemy of individuality is [[groupthink]], Gates says, and here he holds everyone accountable. Recently, he has enraged many of his colleagues in the [[African-American studies]] field—especially those campaigning for government [[reparations for slavery]]—by insistently reminding them, as he did in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[op-ed]] last year, that the folks who captured and sold blacks into slavery in the first place were also Africans, working for profit. "People wanted to kill me, man," Gates says of the reaction to that op-ed. "Black people were so angry at me. But we need to get some distance from the binary opposition we were raised in: evil white people and good black people. The world just isn't like that."}}

Lolita Buckner Inniss, a professor at the [[Cleveland-Marshall College of Law]], wrote a letter to ''The New York Times'' in response to the Gates' piece. She argued that regardless of who did the capturing, it was white people who created the market for African slaves and perpetuated the practice even after the import trade was banned. "Up until that recent piece, people would have thought of him as someone who took a cautious and nuanced approach to questions like reparations." Gates has such an eminent reputation, she said, and "so much gravitas. Many of us were troubled."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, L. (April 18, 2011). [http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/04/10/skip-gates-s-next-big-idea.html "Skip Gates's Next Big Idea"]. ''Newsweek''. 157 (16), pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates' op-ed begins and ends with the observation that it is very difficult to decide whether or not to give reparations to the descendants of American slaves, whether they should receive compensation for their ancestors' unpaid labor and lack of rights. Gates also notes that it is equally difficult to decide who should get such reparations and who should pay them, as slavery was legal under the laws of the colonies and the United States.

==Cambridge arrest==
{{Main|Henry Louis Gates arrest controversy}}
On July 16, 2009, Gates returned home from a trip to China to find the door to his house jammed. His driver attempted to help him gain entrance. A passerby called police reporting a possible break-in after reporting to 911 "an individual" forcing the front door open. A [[Cambridge Police Department (Massachusetts)|Cambridge police]] officer was dispatched. The confrontation resulted in Gates being arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Prosecutors later dropped the charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/22/charge-dropped-against-black-harvard-scholar/?page=all "Charge dropped against Harvard scholar"], ''The Washington Times'', July 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident spurred a politically charged exchange of views about [[sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] throughout the United States. The arrest attracted national attention after U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] declared that the Cambridge police "acted stupidly" in arresting the 59-year-old Gates. Obama eventually extended an invitation to both Gates and the officer involved to share a beer with him at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Neary |first =Lynn |title= Black And Blue: Police And Minorities |work =[[Talk of the Nation]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=July 23, 2009|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106928434 |accessdate=July 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2010, Gates claimed on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' that he, Sgt. James Crowley, the arresting officer in the Cambridge incident, and Jonathan Johnson (Deputy Comptroller) all share a common [[ancestor]] - an ancient Irish king, [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Dr-Henry-Louis-Gates-Jr-Start-Your-Ancestry-Search "The Importance of Ancestry"], ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History''' (originally '''The History Channel''' from 1995 to 2008) is a [[history]]-based [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television]] [[television network|network]] that is owned by [[A&amp;E Networks]], a [[joint venture]] between the [[Hearst Communications]] and the [[Disney–ABC Television Group]] division of [[the Walt Disney Company]]. In addition to its self-named [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship channel]], History provides sister channels such as [[History en Español]] (Spanish language) and [[Military History (TV channel)|Military History]].

The channel originally broadcast documentary programs and historical fiction series. More recently, it has [[channel drift]]ed to mostly broadcast various [[reality television]] series such as ''[[Pawn Stars]]'', ''[[Ax Men]]'', and other nonhistorical content. The network is criticized by many scientists, historians, and skeptics for broadcasting pseudodocumentaries and unsubstantiated and sensational investigative programming, such as ''[[Ancient Aliens]]'', ''[[UFO Hunters]]'',  ''[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]'', and the ''[[Nostradamus Effect]]''.

As of February 2015, around 96,149,000 American households (82.6% of households with television) receive the network's flagship channel, History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; International localized versions of History are available, in various forms, in [[India]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]]. The first European version was launched in Scandinavia in 1997 by Viasat, which now operates its own channel, Viasat History.

[[File:The History Channel logo.png|left|thumb|150px|The History Channel's original logo, used from January 1, 1995, to February 16, 2008]]
History was launched on January 1, 1995, as '''The History Channel''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16041231.html Winfrey, Lee. "Golf Channel tees off Tuesday, joining History Channel as new cable fare"], [[Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service]], January 16, 1995. Retrieved February 28, 2011, from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; its original format focused entirely on historical series and [[television special|specials]].

[[File:History Logo 2008-2015.svg|150px|thumb|left|History's logo, used from February 16, 2008, to June 1, 2015: The new logo does not have the triangle on the side of the H.]]
On February 16, 2008, a new logo was launched on the U.S. network as part of a rebranding effort. While the trademark "H" was kept, the triangle shape on the left acts as a play button for animation and flyouts during commercials and shows. On March 20, 2008, as part of that same rebranding effort, The History Channel dropped "The" and "Channel" from its name to become simply "History".&lt;ref&gt;International Herald Tribune [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/20/arts/TV-History-Channel.php Television's The History Channel Drops 'The' and 'Channel' from Its Name, Keeps History] March 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2015, the History logo was slightly updated, completely removing the triangle shape on the left.

== Programming ==
{{Main article|List of programs broadcast by History (TV channel)}}
[[File:History HD Logo.svg|thumb|right|190px|History HD logo, 2008–2015]]
Programming on History has covered a wide range of historical [[History by period|periods]] and topics, while similar themed topics are often organized into themed weeks or daily marathons. Subjects include [[warfare]], [[invention]]s, [[aviation]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[civil engineering]], [[technology]], [[mythical creatures]], [[monster]]s, [[unidentified flying object]]s, [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]], [[religion|religious beliefs]], [[disaster]] scenarios, [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] "after man" scenarios, [[End time|doomsday]], and [[2012 Phenomenon|2012]] superstitions. Programming also includes mainstream [[reality television]]-style shows involving truck drivers, alligator hunters, pawn stores, antique and collectible "pickers", car restorers, photography, and others. Occasionally, some programs compare contemporary culture and technology with that of the past.&lt;ref name="EdgertonRollins2001"&gt;Gary Richard Edgerton; Peter C. Rollins. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0QMpg0GGnDQC&amp;pg=PA261 Television Histories: Shaping Collective Memory in the Media Age]''. University Press of Kentucky; 2001. {{ISBN|0-8131-7111-3}}. pp. 261 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 3, 2013, History channel premiered its first original series, [[Vikings (2013 TV series)|''Vikings'']].&lt;ref name="Irish Film Board March 5, 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/VIKINGS_Tops_The_Ratings_With_83_Million_Viewers/2149 | title=VIKINGS Tops The Ratings With 8.3 Million Viewers | publisher=Irish Film Board | date=5 March 2013 | accessdate=11 March 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FhcvQ1Iu?url=http://www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/VIKINGS_Tops_The_Ratings_With_83_Million_Viewers/2149 | archivedate=April 7, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and evaluation==
During the 1990s, History was jokingly referred to as "The [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] Channel"&lt;ref&gt;Schone, Mark. [http://www.salon.com/1997/05/08/media_90/ "All Hitler, All the Time"], [[Salon.com]], May 8, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; for its extensive coverage of [[World War II]]. Much of its military-themed programming has been shifted to its sister network [[Military History (TV channel)|Military History]].

The network has also been criticized for having a bias towards [[history of the United States|U.S. history]]. Another former sister network, [[History International]], more extensively covered history outside the US until in 2011, when it was rebranded as [[History 2]] and started broadcasting more material that had to do with US history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide03/explore1.html|title=Time traveler's guide to the Roman Empire|publisher=Channel4.com|quote=The History Channel: The website of the American cable channel has a bias towards American history, as evidenced by Extreme History with Roger Daltrey|accessdate=August 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network was also criticized by Stanley Kutner for airing the series ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' in 2003.

Some of the network's series, including ''[[Ice Road Truckers]]'', ''[[Ax Men]]'', and ''[[Pawn Stars]]'', garnered increased viewership ratings in the United States, while receiving criticism over the series' [[Channel drift|nonhistorical nature]]. U.S. Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] is a critic of the channel and its lack of historical or educational programming, showing particular disdain for the latter two programs.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Noreen (March 20, 2012).

In his book ''2012: It's Not the End of the World'', Peter Lemesurier describes the channel's ''[[Nostradamus]]'' series, in which he was invited to participate, as "largely fiction" and "lurid nonsense".{{citation need|date=September 2018}} He also lists numerous suggestions made in its films on the alleged Mayan "end of the world" and the "rare" galactic alignment that was supposed by [[John Major Jenkins]] to accompany it in [[2012 Phenomenon|2012]],&lt;ref&gt;Lemesurier, Derwen Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} while Jenkins himself has described ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' as "45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane [[sensationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alignment2012.com/historychannel.html|title=How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary|date= July 28, 2006|accessdate=22 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, [[Politifact]] gave the History Channel's claim that the [[United States Congress]] stayed open on [[Christmas Day]] for most of its first 67 years of existence a "pants on fire" rating, the lowest of its ratings, noting that its own research showed that both the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House|House]] had only convened once in those 67 years on a Christmas Day and adding that, since there's a one in seven chance of Christmas falling on a Sunday (when Congress did not meet in order to attend church), the claim that they would have convened almost every Christmas is "ridiculous".&lt;ref name="Pf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic Jon Stewart says Congress met most Christmas Days in its early years|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/09/jon-stewart/comic-jon-stewart-says-early-congress-met-most-chr/|publisher=[[Politifact]]|accessdate=January 21, 2012|date=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim had first been broadcast on the History Channel program ''[[Christmas Unwrapped|Christmas Unwrapped – The History of Christmas]]'' before being subsequently picked up by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s website on the "Origins of Christmas" and by the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[The Daily Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Pf" /&gt; ''Daily Show'' host [[Jon Stewart]] responded the next day by stating it was their fault for trusting the History Channel and satirized a clip from the History Channel about UFOs and Nazis by stating, "The next thing you know we'll all find out the Nazis did not employ alien technology in their quest for world domination."&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart Fires Back At Politifact Over War On Christmas|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/13/jon-stewart-politifact-war-on-christmas_n_1146118.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=January 21, 2012|date=December 13, 2011|first=Katherine|last=Fung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Jon|title=War on Christmas - Historical Fact-Checking|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-december-12-2011/war-on-christmas---historical-fact-checking|work=[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The History Channel was also singled out for ridicule by ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine.

===Discredited Amelia Earhart documentary ===
{{main|Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence}}
In 2017, a History Channel documentary, ''[[Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence]]'', proposed that a photograph in the National Archives of [[Jaluit Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] was actually a picture of a captured Earhart and Noonan. The picture showed a Caucasian male on a dock who appeared to look like Noonan and a woman sitting on the dock, but facing away from the camera, who was judged to have a physique and haircut resembling Earhart's. The documentary theorizes that the photo was taken after Earhart and Noonan crashed at [[Mili Atoll]]. The documentary also said that physical evidence recovered from Mili matches pieces that could have fallen off an Electra during a crash or subsequent overland move to a barge. ''The Lost Evidence'' proposed that a Japanese ship seen in the photograph was the ''Koshu Maru'', a Japanese military ship.

''The Lost Evidence'' was quickly discredited, however, after Japanese blogger Kota Yamano found the original source of the photograph in the archives in the [[National Diet Library]] Digital Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/amelia-earhart-lost-photograph-discredited-spd/| title=Amelia Earhart 'Lost Photograph' Discredited| last=Greshko| first=Michael| website=nationalgeographic.com| date=July 11, 2017| access-date=August 14, 2018|dead-url=no| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223131301/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/amelia-earhart-lost-photograph-discredited-spd/| archive-date=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original source of the photo was a Japanese travel guide published in October 1935, implying that the photograph was taken in 1935 or before, thus would be unrelated to Earhart and Noonan's 1937 disappearance. Additionally, the researcher who discovered the photo also identified the ship in the right of the photo as another ship called ''Koshu'' seized by [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] Japanese forces in World War I and not the ''Koshu Maru''.&lt;ref name="nprdebunk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Domonoske|first1=Camila|title=Japanese Blogger Points Out Timeline Flaw In Supposed Earhart Photo|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/11/536620463/japanese-blogger-points-out-timeline-flaw-in-supposed-earhart-photo|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=NPR|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher [[Ben Radford]] performed a detailed analysis of the mistakes made by ''The History Channel'' in building their documentary on bad photographic evidence. In his ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' article "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Emmys: An Amelia Earhart Special (Non) Mystery Post-Mortem", critiquing the network's lack of professionalism, Radford said: "Given that the photograph's provenance was established—and thus the key premise of the show discredited—in about half an hour of Google searching, it will be interesting to see what world-class expertise&amp;nbsp;... the History Channel will bring to their reinvestigation of Earhart's disappearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink1=Benjamin Radford|title=A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Emmys: An Amelia Earhart Special (Non)Mystery Post-Mortem|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_amelia_earhart_special_mystery |website=Csicop.org|publisher=CFI|accessdate=9 December 2017|archivedate=9 December 2017|date=18 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209222238/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_amelia_earhart_special_mystery|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On episode 35 of his ''Squaring the Strange'' podcast, released December 7, 2017, Radford reminded listeners that in excess of four months had passed without an apology or explanation from the History Channel as to "how their research went so horribly wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink1=Ben Radford|title=Squaring the Strange: Episode 35|url=https://player.fm/series/squaring-the-strange/episode-35-champs-no-chump-the-best-evidence-for-lake-monsters|website=player.fm|publisher=Player.fm|accessdate=9 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209223431/https://player.fm/series/squaring-the-strange/episode-35-champs-no-chump-the-best-evidence-for-lake-monsters|archivedate=9 December 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3:20}}

==== Canada ====
{{Main article|History (Canada)}}
The History Channel (as it was then known) was not initially related to a similar Canadian service, History Television, which launched in 1997. During the Canadian channel's first several years of operation, despite sharing a similar programming focus, the channels rarely if ever shared programming. Indeed, the phrase "Not available in Canada" became a ''de facto'' slogan for the U.S. channel in its early years as a result of its use in promotional ads on American channels that were imported to Canadian pay television providers, particularly A&amp;E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisnews.com/index.pl?issue=20040722&amp;mode=|title=Librarian and Information Science News|publisher=LIS News|accessdate=August 4, 2007|quote=I always wondered why the History Channel commercials said not available in Canada.}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the late 2000s, flagship History (U.S.) series were slow to reach Canadian viewers (if they aired in that country at all); ''Ice Road Truckers'' debuted in 2007, but did not join the History Television schedule until early 2009. However, the relationship between the two has improved since then. On May 30, 2012, History Television's current owner, [[Shaw Media]], announced that it would rebrand the channel as a Canadian version of History in the fall of 2012, through a licensing agreement with A+E Networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/shaw-media-and-a-e-to-launch-two-new-specialty-channels/1001418951/ Shaw Media and A&amp;E to Launch Two New Specialty Channels], ''Broadcaster Magazine'', May 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; History Television relaunched as History on August 12, 2012; shortly thereafter, another Shaw-owned specialty channel was relaunched as a [[H2 (Canada)|Canadian version of H2]].

On October 21, 2014, [[Corus Entertainment]] reached an agreement to acquire [[Canadian French]]-language rights to History programming for its own channel, [[Historia (TV channel)|Historia]]. On March 9, 2015, the network was relaunched under History's logo and branding, although the network still carries the Historia name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corusent.com/home/Corporate/PressReleases/tabid/1697/Default.aspx?Id=2936|title=Historia: new logo, new look, new shows! |publisher=Corus Entertainment |date=2015-03-09 |accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historia was previously owned as a joint venture between Shaw and [[Astral Media]] (merged with [[Bell Media]] in 2013), which made it a sister to History; Corus purchased the network in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corusent.com/home/Corporate/PressReleases/tabid/1697/Default.aspx?Id=2455|title=Corus Entertainment Expands Interests in French-language Specialty Television Market through Major Deals with Bell and Shaw Media|author=[[Corus Entertainment]]|date=2013-03-04|accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2016, Corus Entertainment acquired Shaw Media, and as a result, now co-owns both History Canada and the [[Canadian English]]-language rights to the History library of original programming with Historia and the Canadian French-language rights to the History library of original programming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Africa ===

==== South Africa ====
The History channel is part of the [[DStv|DSTV]] satellite TV package provided by MultiChoice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dstv.com/channels |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117034731/http://www.dstv.com/channels/ |archive-date=November 17, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;DSTV is owned by Naspers (Nasionale Pers, which translates as National Press). After the appointment of Calvo Mawela as CEO of Multichoice, which owns DSTV, the History Channel has become increasingly politicised toward slanted South African history reflecting the view of the Marxist leaning ANC government of South Africa. No alternative view of the Sharpeville massacre nor the fact that Nelson Mandela was convicted of terrorism, admitting to 156 acts himself, is presented for a balanced view. The CEO, Calvo Mawela, is related to Gwede Mantashe by marriage to Mantashe's daughter. Mantase is the former Secretary General and present National Chairperson of the [[African National Congress]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79999">The history of '''Illyrian warfare''' spans from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC up to the 1st century AD in the region of [[Illyria]] and in southern [[Italy]] where the [[Iapygian]] civilization flourished.

It concerns the armed conflicts of the [[Illyrian tribes]] and [[Illyrian kingdoms|their kingdoms]] in the [[Balkans]] in [[Italian peninsula|Italy]] as well as pirate activity in [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Apart from conflicts between Illyrians and neighboring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Illyrian tribes themselves.

Illyrians were renowned warriors, according to ancient sources. They were known as skilled craftsmen and shipbuilders in ancient times and controlled much of the [[Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]] using their numerous warships. Illyrians had effective weapons such as the [[sica]], a curved-tip sword that originated in Illyria and was eventually adopted all over the Balkans and used later by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

==Mythological==
Instances of Illyrians engaged in armed conflict occurred in [[Greek mythology]] and specifically in the legend of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], where Cadmus led the Illyrian [[Enchelii]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library]]'', 3.5.4. "As the Encheleans were being attacked by the Illyrians, the god declared by an oracle that they would get the better of the Illyrians if they had Cadmus and Harmonia as their leaders. They believed him, and made them their leaders against the Illyrians, and got the better of them. And Cadmus reigned over the Illyrians, and a son Illyrius was born to him."&lt;/ref&gt; in a victorious campaign against&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Classical Mythology by Pierre Grimal and A. R. Maxwell-Hyslop, {{ISBN|0-631-20102-5}}, 1996, page 230, "Illyrius (Ἰλλυριός). The youngest son of Cadmus and Harmonia. He was born during their expedition against the Illyrians"&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Illyrians]] after a divine advice from the [[Oracle]].&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Classical Mythology by Pierre Grimal and A. R. Maxwell-Hyslop, {{ISBN|0-631-20102-5}}, 1996, page 83, "They went to Illyria to live amongst the Encheleans who had been attacked by the Illyrians. The Encheleans had been promised victory by an Oracle if Cadmus and Harmonia would lead them and as this condition was fulfilled they were indeed victorious."&lt;/ref&gt; If the legend is true this war would have occurred around 2000 BC, the time when Cadmus has been claimed to have lived.

==Tribal conflicts==

Illyrian tribes were reluctant to help each other in times of war and even fought amongst each other and they sometimes allied with the neighboring [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 98, ''...North of Dassaretis in the middle and upper valley of the Genusus was the territory of the Illyrian Parthini, likely to have been part of the Taulantii until they first appear as Roman allies late in the third century ..."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greeks]]:&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Edward Romilly Boak and William Gurnee Sinnigen. ''A History of Rome to A.D. 565'', page 111, ''The island of Pharos and some adjacent territory in Illyria were given to a Greek adventurer, Demetrius of Pharos''&lt;/ref&gt; These conflicts happened because of land, pastures and areas of natural substances such as iron and salt. The Romans, before they conquered Illyria, were involved in tribal conflicts and used them to their advantage. The most known incident is the involvement of the Romans in a war between the Dalmatians and the Liburnians over Promona, which in the end were encouraged to take peace. Commonly the Romans were ordered to act as referees in their bloody fights. The tribe of [[Autariatae]] fought against the [[Ardiaei]] for control of valuable salt mines.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 223, "The salt source that was a cause of conflict between the Illyrian Ardiaei and Autariatae may be that at Orahovica in the upper Neretva valley near Konjic."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ardiaei]] were notorious before being defeated by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 216, ''The Ardiaei, or Vardaei as they were known to the Romans, once the ravagers of Italy and now reduced to a mere...''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Daorsi]] had suffered attacks from the [[Delmatae]] to the extent that they requested Roman aid.

==States==

The earliest recorded Illyrian Kingdom was that of the [[Enchele]] in the 8th century BC. The Enchele held dominance for two centuries until their state crumbled from the start of the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="Illyrians, The Illyrian Art page 46-47"&gt;[[Aleksandar Stipčević]] –  Illyrians, The Illyrian Art, The Illyrian Cult Symbols page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=298}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Enchelii the Taulanti formed their own state in the 7th century BC. The Autariatae under [[Pleurias]] (337 BC) were a kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Boardman|1994|p=785}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1969|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of [[Bardyllis]] of the [[Dardani]] and of [[Agron of Illyria|Agron]] of the [[Ardiaei]] who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kipfer|2000|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1993|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Dardanians, they always had separate domains from the rest of the [[Illyrians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papazoglu|1978|p=216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Illyrian kingdoms were composed of small areas within region of Illyria. The exact extent of even the most prominent ones remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berranger|Cabanes|Berranger-Auserve|2007|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] ruled the entire region. The internal organization of the south Illyrian kingdoms points to imitation of their neighboring Greek kingdoms and influence from the Greek and [[Hellenistic]] world in the growth of their [[urban area|urban]] centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polybius]] gives as an image of society within an Illyrian kingdom as peasant infantry fought under aristocrats which he calls in Greek ''Polydynastae'' (Greek: Πολυδυνάστες) where each one controlled a town within the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchy was established on hereditary lines and Illyrian rulers used marriages as a means of alliance with other powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (23–79 AD) writes that the people that formed the nucleus of the Illyrian kingdom were 'Illyrians proper' or [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria#Illyrii Proprie Dicti|Illyrii Proprie Dicti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were the [[Taulantii]], the [[Pleraei]], the [[Endirudini]], [[Sasaei]], [[Grabaei]] and the [[Labeatae]]. These later joined to form the [[Docleatae]].

==Liburnian thalassocracy==
[[File:Corfu topographic map-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of Corfu, the Liburnians most southern recorded outpost]]
Navigable skills and mobility of the [[Liburnians]] on their swift ships, the [[Liburna]] allowed them to be present, very early, not only along the Eastern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, they reached also the opposite, western, [[Italy|Italic]] coast. This process started during great [[Pannonia]]n-Adriatic movements and migrations at the end of the [[Bronze Age]], from the 12th to 10th century BC. In the [[Iron Age]], they were already in the Italic coast, establishing colonies in [[Apulia]] and especially in [[Picenum]], where specific Iron Age cultures developed.&lt;ref&gt;Š. Batović, Le relazioni culturali etc., 30, 42; La “koine” adriatica e il suo processo di formazione, Jadranska obala u protohistoriji.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th to the 6th century BC there was certain koine&amp;nbsp;– cultural unity in the Adriatic, with the general Liburninan seal, whose naval supremacy meant both political and economical authority through a several centuries. Some similar toponyms attested not only Liburnian but also other Illyrian migrations to the central and south Italy, respectively [[Apulia]] and [[Picenum]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Zaninović, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43–67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)&gt;&gt;65&lt;&lt;, pages 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century BC their ruled&lt;ref&gt;The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C. by J. Boardman, [[N. G. L. Hammond]], page 266, "In the ninth century the Liburnians, then the leading seapower in the inner adriatic, expanded southwards so that by the first half of the eighth century..."&lt;/ref&gt; the inner Adriatic sea and in the first half of the 8th century BC they expanded southwards. According to [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geography, 6.2, "While Archias was on his voyage to Sicily, he left Chersicrates, a chief of the race of the Heracleidæ with a part of the expedition to settle the island now called Corcyra,62 but anciently called Scheria, and he, having expelled the Liburni who possessed it, established his colony in the island."&lt;/ref&gt; the Liburnians became masters of island of [[Corcyra]], making it their most southern outpost, by which they controlled the passage into the Adriatic Sea. In 735 BC, they abandoned it, under pressure of [[Corinth]]ian ruler Hersikrates, during the period of Corinthian expansion to South Italy, [[Sicily]] and the Ionian Sea. However, their position in the Adriatic Sea was still strong in the next few centuries. [[Corinth]] was the first that went up against the Liburnians. The [[Bacchiadae|Bacchiade]]&lt;ref&gt;The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C. by J. Boardman, N. G. L. Hammond, page 267, "...the first successful challenge to Liburnian seapower came from Corinth. The Bacchiade sent an unusually large expedition, which drove the Liburnians and the Eretrians from Corcyra."&lt;/ref&gt; expelled the Liburni and the [[Eretria]]ns from [[Corcyra]]. About 625 BC, the [[Taulantii]] asked&lt;ref&gt;The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C. by J. Boardman, N. G. L. Hammond, page 267, "Then about 626 B.C. the Taulantians invoked the aid of Corcyra and Corinth against the Liburnians. Again the Greeks were victorious. They planted a colony at Epidamnus and drove the Illyrian fleets back to the region of Scodra."&lt;/ref&gt; for the aid of Corinth and Corcyra against the Liburni. The Greeks were victorious.

Liburnian control of the Adriatic Sea coasts started to decrease in the 6th century BC.
According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the Liburnians lost supremacy in the Western Adriatic coast due to invasion of the [[Umbri]] and the [[Gauls]], obviously caused by strengthening and expansion of the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] union in the 6th century BC, whose rich material presence in the basin of Po river, undoubtedly meant weakening of the Liburnian thalassocracy influence in the north-west of Adriatic. [[Celts|Celtic]] breaks to the Italian peninsula, after 400 BC, significantly changed ethnic and political picture there, it directly imperiled remaining Liburnian possessions on the western coast.

Unlike at the western Adriatic coast, [[Celt]]ic raids to the narrow Liburnian region at the eastern Adriatic coast were peripheral in geographical meaning. Despite of recorded material exchange, Celtic archaeological forms are marginal and secondary in regions settled by [[Histri]], [[Iapodes]], [[Dalmatae]] and are especially rare in Liburnian Iron Age heritage.

==Iapygian–Tarentine Wars==
{{Main|Iapygian-Tarentine Wars}}
The Iapygian-Tarentine Wars were a set of conflicts and wars between the Greek colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] (Taranto) and the three Iapygian peoples, [[Messapians]], [[Peucetii]] and [[Daunians]].

Conflicts started immediately after the foundation of Tars in 706 BC over domination of the fertile adjacent plains in southern [[Italy]]. The expansion of Taranto was limited to the coast because of the resistance of the populations of inner Apulia. In 473 BC, Taranto signed an alliance with [[Rhegion]], to counter the [[Messapii]], [[Peuceti]], and [[Lucania]]ns, but the joint armies of the Tarentines and Rhegines were defeated near ''Kailìa'' (modern Ceglie), in what Herodotus&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], vii 170.&lt;/ref&gt; claims to be the greatest slaughter of Greeks in his knowledge, with 3,000 Reggians and uncountable Tarentines killed. In 466 BC, Taranto was again defeated by the [[Iapyges]]; according to [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;''Politica'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.1303a v 1303a].&lt;/ref&gt; who praises its government, there were so many aristocrats killed that the democratic party was able to get the power, to remove the monarchy, inaugurate a democracy, and expel the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]].

In c.440 BC the Messapian city-state of Brindisi entered into an alliance with Thurii. The Brindisi-Thurri army had a leadership advantage in the form of Cleandridas, an exiled Spartan general who had been banished from the Peloponnese for accepting an Athenian bribe as an advisor of the Spartan king Pleistoanax. Taranto supported the Peloponnesian side against Athens in the [[Peloponnesian War]], refused anchorage and water to Athens in 415 BC, and even sent ships to help the Peloponnesians, after the Athenian disaster in Sicily. On the other side, Athens supported the Messapians, in order to counter Taranto power.&lt;ref&gt;Land Battles in 5th Century B. C. Greece: A History and Analysis of 173 ... By Fred Eugene Ray&lt;/ref&gt;

After 330 BC the Messapians joined forces with the Tarentines against an even greater force, that of [[Rome]]. The alliances with Taras and with Cleonimus of [[Sparta]] in 304 BC was an anti-Roman campaign. Thus towards the end of the fourth century Rome had become a common enemy for both the Iapygians and the Tarentines, even as far as ending the prolonged battles and causing them to make an alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XVI, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illyrian expansion==
In the 4th century BC [[Bardyllis]] became king of the Illyrians and creator of a new dynasty after overthrowing [[Sirras]] the previous Illyrian king who had entered in a peace treaty over the control of Lyncestis. Bardyllis succeeded in bringing various tribes into a single organisation and soon became a formidable power in the Balkans, resulting in a change of relations with Macedonia. Using new war tactics in 393 BC the Illyrians won a decisive battle against [[Amyntas III]], expelling him and ruling Macedonia through a puppet king. in 392 BC Amyntas III allied himself with the Thessalians and took Macedonia under his rule, taking it from the Dardanians. After continuous invasions Bardyllis forced the Macedonians to pay him an annual tribute in 372 BC.

In 385 BC Bardyllis raided Epirus which was under [[Molossian]] rule. This time the Illyrians were allied with and aided by [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]]&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, N. G. L.

[...] Forming and alliance with Dionysius tyrant of Syracuse he killed 15,000 Molossians."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being aided by 2000 Greek [[hoplites]] and five hundred suits of Greek [[armour]], the Illyrians were defeated by the [[Sparta]]ns led by [[Agesilaus II|Agesilaus]] but not before ravaging the region and killing 15,000 Molossians. Thus their attempt to control Epirus failed. In 360 BC, another Illyrian attack forced the Molossian king [[Arymbas]] to evacuate his non-combatant population to [[Aetolia]] and let the Illyrians loot freely. The [[wikt:stratagem|stratagem]] worked and the Molossians fell upon the Illyrians who were encumbered with booty and defeated them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Diodorus Siculus. ''Library'', Books 14.92, 15.2, 16.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Arymbas of the Mollosians defeats the Illyrians after they raided and looted Epirus.

In 360 BC the southern Paeonian tribes launched raids against Macedonia in support of an Illyrian invasion. In 359 BC Bardyllis won a decisive battle against the Macedonian king [[Perdiccas III]] in which the king himself was killed along with 4,000 of his soldiers and the Illyrians occupied the cities of upper Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge ancient history: The fourth century B.C.

The Macedonian king's attempt to reconquer upper Macedonia had failed.

Following the disastrous defeat of the Macedonians by Bardyllis, when king Philip took control of Macedonian throne in 358 BC, he reaffirmed the treaty with the Illyrians, marrying the Illyrian princess Audata, probably the daughter or the niece of Bardyllis.&lt;ref&gt;''The time of this marriage is somewhat disputed while some historians maintain that the marriage happened after the defeat of Bardyllis'' Women and monarchy in Macedonia Oklahoma Series in Classical Culture by Elizabeth Donnelly Carney, University of Oklahoma Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8061-3212-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3212-9}}; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbI2hZBy_EkC&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=bardylis&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=bardylis&amp;f=false link]&lt;/ref&gt; This gave Philip valuable time to gather his forces and to defeat the Illyrians, who were still under Bardyllis, in the decisive Erigon Valley battle by killing about 7,000 and eliminating the Illyrian menace for some time.

In 358 BC [[Phillip of Macedon]] defeated [[Bardyllis]], [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, Library,16.4"/&gt; (1st century BC) writes this of the event;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''And at first for a long while the battle was evenly poised because of the exceeding gallantry displayed on both sides, and as many were slain and still more wounded, the fortune of battle vacillated first one way then the other, being constantly swayed by the valorous deeds of the combatants; but later as the horsemen pressed on from the flank and rear and Philip with the flower of his troops fought with true heroism, the mass of the Illyrians was compelled to take hastily to flight. When the pursuit had been kept up for a considerable distance and many had been slain in their flight, Philip recalled the Macedonians with the trumpet and erecting a trophy of victory buried his own dead, while the Illyrians, having sent ambassadors and withdrawn from all the Macedonian cities, obtained peace. But more than seven thousand Illyrians were slain in this battle.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Gallic invasions==
{{Main|Gallic invasion of the Balkans}}

From the 4th century BC, Celtic groups pushed into the Carpathian region and the Danube basin, coinciding with their movement into Italy. According to legend, 300,000 Celts moved into Italy and Illyria.&lt;ref&gt;From: The Celts. A history. Daithi O Hogain. Boydell Press. {{ISBN|0-85115-923-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 3rd century, the native inhabitants of Pannonia were almost completely Celticized.&lt;ref name="Mocsy"&gt;Pannonia and Upper Moesia. A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire. A Mocsy, S Frere&lt;/ref&gt; The Illyrians had been waging war against the Greeks, leaving their western flank weak. Whilst [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] ruled Greece, the Celts dared not to push south near Greece. Therefore, early Celtic expeditions were concentrated against Illyrian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians. A Stipcevic. Noyes Press. pg 44&lt;/ref&gt;

We have little information about the affairs in the Illyrian hinterland, but we do know that the first Balkan tribe to be defeated by the Celts was the [[Autariatae]], who during the 4th century had enjoyed a hegemony over much of the central Balkans, centred on the [[Morava rivers, Serbia|Morava valley]].&lt;ref name="Mocsy"/&gt; An interesting account of cunning Celtic tactics is revealed in their attacks on the [[Ardiaei]]. In 310 BC, Celtic general Molistomos attacked deep into Illyrian territory, subduing the [[Dardanians (Balkans)|Dardanians]] and the [[Paeonians]].

In 280 BC they moved in three directions: toward Macedonia and Illyria, toward Greece, and toward Thrace. The main army according to Diodorus, of 150,000-foot soldiers equipped with great shields and 10,000 horsemen was followed by 2,000 wagons transporting food and equipment. All the states of the Balkans at this time looked at this movement with apprehension. Ptolemy, the king of Macedonia, took the news of the Gauls casually. He looked down with derision on the proposal of the king of the Dardanians possibly Monunius who sent delegates to say that they could offer 20,000 warriors to assist him. In an insulting manner, he said that the work was for the Macedonians to do. When the king of the Dardanians was told of this, he replied that the soon glorious Macedonian kingdom would fall because of the immaturity of a youth. And so it happened, for in the battle that took place a few days later in Macedonia, the Macedonian army was routed and Ptolemy was wounded and taken prisoner. After continuing south and raiding the [[Delphi]] the Gallic army decided to return up north to their homeland but were all wiped out by the Dardanians, through which they had to pass.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by Neritan Ceka – 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome expelled Illyrian garrisons at the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Epidamnus]], [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]], [[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]], [[Hvar|Pharos]] and others and established a protectorate over these Greek towns.

The ''Second Illyrian War'' lasted from 220 BC to 219 BC. In 219 BC the [[Roman Republic]] was at war with the [[Celts]] of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], and the [[Second Punic War]] with Carthage&lt;ref&gt;Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 B.C. by Theodore Ayrault Dodge, {{ISBN|0-306-80654-1}}, 1995, Page 164, "...&amp;nbsp;Hannibal was anxious to make his descent on Italy before the Romans had got through with the Gallic and Illyrian wars. He had made many preparations to this end, not only in men and material, but in reconnoitring..."&lt;/ref&gt; was beginning. These distractions gave Demetrius the time he needed to build a new Illyrian war fleet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Leading this fleet of 90 ships, Demetrius sailed south of [[Lissus]], violating his earlier treaty and starting the war.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius: The Rise of the Roman Empire, Book 6.16, "Demetrius of Pharos [...] had broken his treaty with the Republic by sailing beyond Lissus with fifty boats..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Demetrius' fleet first attacked [[Pylos]] where he captured 50 ships after several attempts. From Pylos the fleet sailed to the [[Cyclades]], quelling resistance they found on the way. Demetrius foolishly sent a fleet across the Adriatic, and, with the Illyrian forces divided, the fortified&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J.

During the ''Third Illyrian War'' in 168 BC the Illyrian king [[Gentius]] allied himself with the Macedonians. First in 171 BC, he was allied with the Romans against the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], but in 169 he changed sides and allied himself with [[Perseus of Macedon]]. He arrested two Roman legati and destroyed the cities of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]] and [[Durrës|Dyrrhachium]], which were allied with Rome. In 168 he was defeated at Scodra by a Roman force under L. Anicius Gallus,&lt;ref&gt;Battles of the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Chronological Compendium of 667 Battles to 31Bc, from the Historians of the Ancient World (Greenhill Historic Series) by John Drogo Montagu, {{ISBN|1-85367-389-7}}, 2000, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; and in 167 brought to Rome as a captive to participate in Gallus' [[Roman triumph|triumph]], after which he was interned in [[Iguvium]].

==Great Illyrian revolt==
{{Main|Great Illyrian Revolt}}
The ''Great Illyrian Revolt'', (''Bellum Batonianum'' or ''Pannonian Revolt''&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Norma. ''Tacitus: Annals I'', 2002, {{ISBN|1-85399-358-1}}. ''It had originally been joined to Illyricum, but after the great Illyrian/Pannonian revolt of A.D. 6 it was made a separate province with its own governor.''&lt;/ref&gt;) was a major conflict&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 183, ''...Pannonian Illyrians between Italy and the East. That could only be done at a great cost and not before a rebellion of Illyricum brought the regime of Augustus to the brink of disaster.''&lt;/ref&gt; between an alliance of Illyrian communities and the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] forces that lasted for four years beginning in AD 6 and ending in AD 9. In AD 6, several regiments of [[Daesitiates]], natives of area that now comprises central [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], led by Bato the Daesitiate ([[Bato I]]), were gathered in one place to prepare to join Augustus's stepsonand senior military commander [[Tiberius]] in a war against the [[Germans]]. Instead, the Daesitiates mutinied and defeated a Roman force sent against them. The Daesitiates were soon joined by the [[Breuci]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. ''The Illyrians'', 1992, p. 207, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}. ''The rising began among the Daesitiates of central Bosnia under their leader Bato but they were soon joined by the Breuci. The four-year war which lasted from AD 6 to 9 saw huge...''&lt;/ref&gt; led by Bato of the [[Breuci]] ([[Bato II]]), another community inhabiting the region between the rivers [[Sava]] and [[Drava]] in modern [[Croatia]]. They gave battle to a second Roman force from [[Moesia]] led by [[Aulus Caecina Severus (suffect consul 1 BC)|Caecina Severus]] (the governor of Moesia). Despite their defeat, they inflicted heavy casualties at the Battle of [[Sirmium]]. The rebels were now joined by a large number of other communities. At risk was the strategic province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], recently expanded to include the territory of the [[Pannonii]], an indigenous communities inhabiting the region between the rivers [[Drava]] and [[Sava]], who were subjugated by Rome in 12–9 BC. Illyricum was on Italy's eastern flank, exposing the Roman heartland to the fear of a rebel invasion.

Augustus ordered Tiberius to break off operations in Germany and move his main army to Illyricum. Tiberius sent [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus]] (the governor of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]]) ahead with troops. The panic broke out in Rome&lt;ref&gt;[[Velleius Paterculus]], 2.110–111; [[Dio Cassius]], 55.30,1&lt;/ref&gt; and Augustus raised a second task force under Tiberius's nephew [[Germanicus]]. He resorted to the compulsory purchase and emancipation of thousands of slaves in order to amass enough troops. This happened for the first time since the aftermath of the [[Battle of Cannae]] two centuries earlier. At one moment, in winter AD 6/7, 10 legions were deployed and an equivalent number of auxilia (70 [[cohors]], 10 [[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]] and more than 10,000 veterans).&lt;ref&gt;[[Velleius Paterculus]], ''Historia Romana'' 2.113.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they were assisted by a large number of [[Thracians|Thracian]] troops deployed by their King [[Rhoemetalces I]], a Roman ''amicus'' ("ally") a grand total of some 100,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoemetalces's kingdom was later annexed by emperor Claudius.&lt;/ref&gt;

They faced further reverses on the battlefield and a bitter guerrilla war in the [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. ''The Illyrians'', 1992, p. 216, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}. ''Further east the formidable Daesitiates of central Bosnia retained their name. The great rebellion of AD 6 had been led by their chief Bato, and their relatively low total of 103 decuriae likely reflects...''&lt;/ref&gt; mountains, but bitter fighting also occurred in southern Pannonia around Mons Almus (modern [[Fruška Gora]]) near [[Sirmium]]. It took them three years of hard fighting to quell the revolt, which was described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]] as the most difficult conflict faced by Rome since the [[Punic Wars]] two centuries earlier. Tiberius finally quelled the revolt in AD 9. This was just in time: that same year [[Arminius]] [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|destroyed]] [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus]]'s three legions in Germany. The Roman high command did not doubt that Arminius would have formed a grand alliance with the Illyrians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] LV.29–34; [[Suetonius]] ''Tiberius'' 16, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting of the Illyrian Revolt had lasting effects on Roman soldiers. Unhappy with their payment of swampy and mountainous Pannonian lands for such harsh military service, and with abuses relating to their pay and conditions, Roman soldiers staged a mutiny in AD 14 demanding recompense. [[Tiberius]] dispatched his son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]], to pacify the mutineers.

==Tactics and troop organization==
Illyrians in ancient sources were known as brave and skilled fighters. The Illyrians appeared in war as free warriors under their rulers or kings. Similar to other societies the status of a leader was determined by the number of warriors who followed him. Obedience to a higher authority such as a king was channeled through the collective loyalty of a tribe to the chief. In historical sources they are described as a peasant infantry fighting under aristocratic proprietors (polydynastae) each one controlling a town within the kingdom. The Dalmatians were known to use Partisan tactics against the Romans which were successful in inflicting serious defeats on the best of the Roman legions.

[[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century BC) writes of the Illyrian military formation in this battle that was an attempt for a coordinated stance by forming a square.&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, Library,16.4"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0084:book=16:chapter=4&amp;highlight=illyrian%2Cinfantry Diodorus Siculus, Library,16.4]&lt;/ref&gt; His exact words are: "Ἰλλυριοὶ συντάξαντες ἑαυτούς εἰς πλινθίον&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, Library,16.4" /&gt; ἐρρωμένος".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But the Illyrians, forming themselves into a square, courageously entered the fray. And at first for a long while the battle was evenly poised because of the exceeding gallantry displayed on both sides, and as many were slain and still more wounded, the fortune of battle vacillated first one way then the other"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 2nd century BC the army of [[Agron of Illyria|Agron]] and Teuta is no more represented in phalanxes but in smaller troops, armored well and fast moving. These tactics also used in Roman times were ready for independent operations and so were more effective than earlier phalanxes. These exact tactics were agile for quick and surprising actions and soon showed to be superior against Greek tactics and as a result the Illyrians received some wonderful victories against the Greeks.

On the sea the Illyrians used guerrilla-partisan tactics with their sophisticated navy. These sea tactics made the Illyrians masters of the [[Adriatic Sea]] for many centuries. Their ships, which were relatively small were not capable of direct naval battle with the heavier war-ships of the Greeks and Romans and most of the time were defeated. An exception is the victory over the island of [[Paxoi]] when the Illyrians used a new form of tactic which involved connecting their ships in groups of four and attacking the Greek ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaponry==
{{Main|Illyrian weaponry}}

The fact that Illyrian warriors were buried with their weapons has resulted in an abundant amount of surviving intact. The works of ancient authors fail to provide a clear picture on Illyrian weapons and the only true contributor to this matter was the Roman poet [[Ennius]] (239 BC&amp;nbsp;– 169 BC) who was of [[Messapii|Messapian]] origin. Weaponry was very important to the Illyrian in the time of war however sometimes only the rich and nobles could afford some types such as greaves and helmets. A lot of armor was imported to mainly from the Greek mainland proved by the findings of Greek weapons in the Glacinac graves dating from the 7th century BC.

Shields were used among the Illyrian as early as the [[Bronze Age]]. In the [[Iron Age]] two types of shields were used, the Illyrian circular shield and the oval/rectangular type used by the northern Illyrians. The most common was the circular shield which was made of wood and leather with a [[bronze]] boss and was like a mostly light [[pelte]].&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 240&lt;/ref&gt; The Illyrian circular shield resembled the Macedonian version but differed from the number of circular decortication. Their shapes with either round (peltes), rectangular or oval.&lt;ref name="Early Roman Armies 1995"&gt;{{citation |title=Early Roman Armies |series=Men-at-Arms |last= [[Nicholas Sekunda]] and S Northwood, illustrated by Richard Hook |year= 1995 |isbn=1-85532-513-6 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page= Colour plates, The Venetic fighting system, Fifth century BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A type of wooden [[rectangle|oblong]] shield with an iron boss was introduced to Illyria from the [[Celts]].&lt;ref name="The Illyrians 1977, page 174"&gt;''The Illyrians: history and culture'', History and Culture Series, The Illyrians: History and Culture, Aleksandar Stipčević, {{ISBN|0-8155-5052-9}}, 1977, page 174, "Resembling the northern Illyrian oval shield was one introduced into Illyria by the Celts. Apart from the iron boss, nothing was preserved from these Celtic shields. It is known though that they were oblong shaped and made of wood with an umbo in the center..."&lt;/ref&gt; This type of shield resembled the Illyrian oval shield used in northern Illyria.

Breast-armor and greaves were a specialty for the rich only in Illyrian society. Bronze breast-armor was used very rarely by the northern Illyrians and only three examples have been discovered so far in [[Slovenia]]. However another form of body armor was a bronze pectoral that may have protected part of the back as well. It was more like a disc "breastplate" of 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. Greaves to protect the legs were used from the 7th century BC and probably even earlier. They first appeared in Illyria from its southern borders and are found only in princely graves.
[[File:Recreation of Frieze showing War Chariots from Slovenia 6th century BCE (Vackasitula).jpg|thumb|right|330px|Illyrian chariots from Vace – 6th century BC]]
In northern Illyria the ''bronze helmet'' was employed. The bronze helmet developed into the common [[Conical helmet]] which sometimes contained a plume. The most intriguing of all Illyrian helmets developed, the [[Shmarjet helmet]], was made by the [[Japodes]] in the Lika valley. It was made from wicker and chain-mail while metal plates around the sides were optional. Under influence from Illyria's northern neighbours, the Italic peoples, the [[Negau helmet]] was used from the 5th century BC to the 4th century BC. The most widespread helmet was the [[Illyrian helmet]] with its use beginning from the 7th century BC. The Illyrian helmet was made from bronze and consisted of a great, crested plume on the top. The origin and the time period this helmet used has been a subject of much debate. Some experts allocate its origins in [[Corinth]] and claim it went out of use in Illyria in the 4th century BC. Others{{Who|date=November 2012}} claim that the helmet has its origins in Illyria and that it was used up to the 2nd century BC, proven by depictions on Illyrian city coins of the time.

The principal sword of the Illyrians was the [[sica]], a single-edged curved sword similar to the Greek [[machaira]].&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 238, "Their principal offensive weapon was the single edged curved-sword, similar to the Greek machaira, a form of weapon that can be traced back to Bronze age times..."&lt;/ref&gt; The sica was developed during the Bronze Age. The sica's blade was about {{convert|16|–|18|in|cm|abbr=off}} long. It became widely used and adopted by other peoples such as the [[Thracians]], Dacians and the Romans. The Illyrians also used the ''fighting sword'' short curved swords, long swords in addition to various knives. According to historian John Wilkes:&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 238-239, "Although a short curved sword was used by several peoples around the Mediterranean the Romans regarded the sica as a distinct Illyrian weapon used by the stealthy 'assassin' (sicarius)"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Although a short curved sword was used by several peoples around the Mediterranean the Romans regarded the ''[[sica]]'' as a distinct Illyrian weapon used by the stealthy 'assassin' (sicarius)''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Illyrians also used a variety of other weapons, like javelins, long metallic spears called ''Sibyna''&lt;ref&gt;''The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe)'' by John Wilkes, 1996, page 239&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Ancient Greek]] Σιβύνη) that resembled [[boar spear]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Illustrated Dictionary of Words Used in Art and Archeology'' by J. W. Mollett, {{ISBN|0-7661-3577-2}}, 2003, page 296, "Sibina, Sibyna, Gr. and R. σιβύνη. A kind of boar spear deployed in hunting"&lt;/ref&gt; short thrusting spears, battle axes, single-handed axes that could be hurled and also bows and arrows which were used from the start of the 2nd millennium BC.

==Mercenaries==
Illyrians acted as mercenaries on several occasions&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19807-9}}, page 168, "Like Thracians to the east the Illyrians were an important source of military manpower, and often served as separate contingents under their own leaders..."&lt;/ref&gt; whether on the side of the Greeks or the Romans. [[Perdiccas II of Macedon]] had hired Illyrian mercenaries in the 5th century BC but they betrayed him, allying with his enemy, Arrhabaeus of Lyncus. In another incident, [[Lysimachus]] killed all of his 5,000 Illyrian mercenaries (of the [[Autariatae]] tribe) to the last man, because he was convinced that they would join the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;The legacy of Alexander: politics, warfare, and propaganda under the successors, {{ISBN|0-19-815306-6}}, 2002, page 248-249, "It concernes 5,000 Illyrian troops whose baggage Demetrius had captured 'in the battle around Lampsacus'. They had lost everything and Lysimachus was seriously worried they would mutiny. He therefore took preventive action, withdrew them from the front on the pretext of issuing their rations and killed them to the last man."&lt;/ref&gt; Previously in 302 BC 2,000 of his Illyrian mercenaries had defected&lt;ref&gt;The legacy of Alexander: politics, warfare, and propaganda under the successors, {{ISBN|0-19-815306-6}}, 2002, page 249&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]]. Illyrians were not considered as reliable mercenaries, in the ancient world&lt;ref&gt;The legacy of Alexander: politics, warfare, and propaganda under the successors, {{ISBN|0-19-815306-6}}, 2002, page 248, "The Illyrians moreover had not been reliable auxiliaries in the recent past"&lt;/ref&gt; but were at the same time acknowledged as a skilled fighting force

==Nobility==
[[File:IllyrianKingorNoble.jpg|150px|thumb|Illyrian king or noble, 500 BC – 100 BC]]
The nobility had access to breastplates and greaves whilst the bulk of the army did not. The kings did not resemble the rest of the army and were the only ones with full body protection which was a rarity.&lt;ref name="Wilkes, J. J 1992, page 240"&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 240, "Body armour, breastplates [...] greaves and helmets were the privilege of a minority with a few examples of full body protection being known only in the Dolensko region of Slovenia."&lt;/ref&gt; Illyrian kings and rulers wore bronze [[torq]]ues around their necks&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 223, "Illyrian chiefs wore heavy bronze torques"&lt;/ref&gt; and were heavily armored in antithesis to the bulk of their armies. A number of weapons and armaments were imported from [[Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 54, "A double edged Greek sword and two pairs of greaves also imports were recovered "&lt;/ref&gt; including helmets.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 54, "there were imported helmets Corinthian type and an early version of the 'GraecoIllyrian helmet'"&lt;/ref&gt; Armaments were mostly made of [[bronze]].&lt;ref name="The Cambridge Ancient History 2000, page 261"&gt;The Cambridge Ancient History, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-85073-8}}, 2000, page 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of body armor was a bronze [[breastplate|pectoral]]&lt;ref name="GreeceRome"&gt;Greece and Rome at War by Peter Connolly, {{ISBN|1-85367-303-X}}, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (that may have protected part of the back as well). It was more like a disc "breastplate" of 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. Local greaves made of bronze were strapped on the legs.&lt;ref name="The Illyrians 1996, page 42"&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19807-9}}, page 42, "Chieftain burial"&lt;/ref&gt; Metal riveted belts were used as well.&lt;ref name="GreeceRome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Illyrians 1996, page 42"/&gt;

==Illyrian navy==
The Illyrians were notorious sailors in the ancient world. They were great ship builders and seafarers. The most skillful Illyrian sailors were the Liburnians, Japodes, Delmatae and Ardiaei. The greatest navy was built by [[Agron (king)|Agron]] in the 3rd century BC. The Illyrian tactics consisted of lashing their galleys together in groups of four and inviting a broadside attack from a ram. The Illyrians would then board the enemy craft in overwhelming numbers. Illyrian war ships were adopted by many peoples especially the Greeks and Romans. Illyrian craftsmen were even hired by the King of Macedon to build 100 ships in the [[First Macedonian War]] because to him they bore a special gift of ship building. The earliest evidence of Illyrian ships is from the design of a ship incised on bronze greaves from Glasinac dating from the 8th century BC to the 7th century BC. The front of this ship is constructed in the form of an animal probably a horse.&lt;ref name="Illyrians, The Illyrian Art page 46-47"/&gt;

Illyrian ships were a favourite depiction on Illyrian coins especially on the coinage of the Labatae. The type of war ships presented on the coins is hard to determine. However, all the depictions show a similarity in which the bows of the ships were shaped in the form of a serpents head. The Byzantine author from the 6th century wrote that the Adriatic was a sea in which serpents swam.[[File:GlasinacShipDesign.jpg|thumb|270px|The earliest depiction of an Illyrian ship dating from the 8th–7th century BC|left]]

The Liburnians were renowned seafarers dominating the Adriatic and [[Ionian Sea]] from the start of the 1st millennium to the 5th century BC. The Romans knew them principally as a people addicted to [[piracy]]. The major harbour of Liburnian navy since the 5th century BC was ''Corynthia'' at eastern cape of [[Krk]] island, including 7 unearthed docks, marine arsenal, and stony fortifications; this early harbour persisted in ancient and medieval function to the 16th century.
Liburnians constructed different ship types; their ''galaia'' was an early prototype of transport galleys, ''lembus'' was a fishing ship&lt;ref&gt;Hans Krahe, ''Die Sprache der Illyrier'', I. Teil, Wiesbaden, 1955, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Krahe, ''Griech. λέμβος, lat. lembus&amp;nbsp;– eine illyrische Schiffsbezeichnung?'', Gymnasium, 59/1952, H. 1, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Casson, ''Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World'', Princeton, 1971, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; continued by the actual Croatian ''levut'', and a ''drakoforos'' was apparently mounted with a dragonhead at the prow.
Remains of a 10 meters long ship from the 1st century BC, were found in [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] near [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] ([[Aenona]] in Classical Liburnia), a ship keel with bottom planking made of 6 rows of the wooden boards on each side, specifically joined together, sewn with resin cords and wooden wedges, testifying the Liburnian shipbuilding tradition style, therefore named "''Serilia Liburnica''". Deciduous trees (oak and beech) were used, while some climber was used for the cords.

The Illyrians were often referred to as pirates, raiding Greek and Roman vessels. Illyrian's indulgence in piracy was one that brought them infamy and invited their downfall. Their rugged broken coast with its screen of islands formed a perfect base from which their light and speedy little to attack unwary shipss. The Illyrians piratical career reached its zenith under [[Queen Teuta]]. The Illyrians practiced boarding tactics against enemy vessels. Although this view was widely accepted at first this connection is not completely true. Ancient Greek and Roman authors often attacked Illyrians in their works merely because they saw them as enemies and so many sources may be heavily exaggerated.

The three main types of Illyrian warships were the [[Lembus]], the [[Liburna]] and the Pristis.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek State at War, William Kendrick Pritchett, {{ISBN|0-520-07374-6}}, 1991, page 76, "Similarly the pirates on the Illyrian coast are said to have developed vessels that were named after their tribes, the lembus, pristis and liburna"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lembus===
The lembos (from {{lang-el|λέμβος}}, "boat",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fmbos λέμβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romanization|romanized]] as ''lembus''), was an ancient Illyrian [[warship]], with a single bank of oars and no sails. It was small and light, with a low freeboard. It was a fast and maneuverable warship capable of carrying 50 men in addition to the rowers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 157, Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.3 2.3].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; It was most commonly associated with the vessels used by the Illyrian tribes, chiefly for piracy, in the area of [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; This type of craft was also adopted by [[Philip V of Macedon]], and soon after by the [[Seleucids]], Rome, and even the [[Sparta]]n king [[Nabis]] in his attempt to rebuild the Spartan navy.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary authors, the name was associated with a class rather than a specific type of vessels, as considerable variation is evident in the sources: the number of oars ranged from 16 to 50, they could be one- or double-banked, and some types did not have a ram, presumably being used as couriers and fast cargo vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liburna===
[[File:058 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel LVIII.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Romanized Liburna during [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]].]]
The most known Liburnian ship was their warship, known as a ''libyrnis'' to the Greeks and a ''liburna'' to the Romans, propelled by oars.
According to some thoughts, liburna was shown in the scene of naval battle, curved on a stone tablet (Stele di Novilara) found near Antique Pisaurum ([[Pesaro]]), outlined to 5th or 6th century BC, the most possibly showing imaginary battle between Liburnian and [[Picenum|Picenian]] fleets. Liburna was presented as light type of the ship with one row or the oars, one mast, one sail and prow twisted outwards. Under the prow there was a rostrum made for striking the enemy ships under the sea.

By its original form, the liburna was the most similar to the Greek [[Penteconter (ship)|penteconter]]. It had one bench with 25 oars on each side, while in the late ages of the Roman Republic, it became a smaller version of a [[trireme]], but with two banks of oars (a [[bireme]]), faster, lighter, and more agile than biremes and triremes. The liburnian design was adopted by the Romans and became a key part of [[Ancient Rome]]'s [[Roman Navy|navy]], most possibly by mediation of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] navy in the 2nd half of the 1st century BC. Liburna ships played a key role in naval [[battle of Actium]] in Greece, which lasted from August 31 to September 2 of 31 BC. Because of the its naval and maneuver features and bravery of its Liburnian crews, these ships completely defeated much bigger and heavier eastern ships, quadriremes and penterames.
Liburna was different from the battle triremes, [[quadrireme]]s and [[quinquereme]]s not because of rowing but rather because of its specific constructional features.&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Starr Jr., The Roman Imperial Navy 31 B.C.&amp;nbsp;– A.D. 324, West-port, Connecticut 1975, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Zaninović, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43–67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)&gt;&gt;65&lt;&lt;, pages 46, 47&lt;/ref&gt;
It was {{convert|109|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|16|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} wide with a {{convert|3|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} draft. Two rows of oarsmen pulled 18 oars per side. The ship could make up to 14 knots under sail and more than 7 under oars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Gabriel | first = Richard A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Masters of the Mediterranean | journal = Military History | volume = | issue = December 2007 | pages = | publisher = | location = | date = | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a vessel, used as a merchantman, might take on a passenger, as Lycinus relates in the 2nd-century dialogue, traditionally attributed to [[Lucian of Samosata]]: "I had a speedy vessel readied, the kind of bireme used above all by the Liburnians of the Ionian Gulf."

Once the Romans had adopted the Liburnian, they proceeded to make a few adaptations to improve the ships’ use within the navy. The benefits gained from the addition of rams and protection from missiles more than made-up for the slight loss of speed.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, J. S., and J. F. Coates. 1996. Greek and Roman Warships 399-30 B.C. Oxford. pgs 170, 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the construction, the ships required that the regular Roman military unit be simplified in order to function more smoothly. Each ship operated as an individual entity, so the more complicated organization normally used was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Starr, ''The Roman Imperial Navy 31 BC-AD 324'', 3rd ed., Chicago, 1993, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the navy, there were probably liburnian of several varying sizes, all put to specific tasks such as scouting and patrolling Roman waters against piracy.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Morrison and J. F. Coates, ''Greek and Roman Warships 399-30 B.C.'', Oxford, 1996, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans made use of the liburnian particularly within the provinces of the empire, where the ships formed the bulk of the fleets,&lt;ref&gt;L. Casson, ''Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World'', Princeton, 1971, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Starr, ''The Roman Imperial Navy 31 BC-AD 324'', 3rd ed., Chicago, 1993, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Morrison and J. F. Coates, ''Greek and Roman Warships 399-30 B.C.'', Oxford, 1996, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; while it was included by small numbers in fleets of Ravenna and Micenum, where a large number of the Illyrians were serving, especially Dalmatae, Liburnians and Pannonians.

Gradually liburna became general name for the different types of the Roman ships, attached also to the cargo ships in the Late Antique. [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]] were using it as a synonym for the battle ship. In inscriptions it was mentioned as the last in class of the battle ships: ''hexeres'', ''penteres'', ''quadrieres'', ''trieres'', ''liburna''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Zaninović, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43–67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)&gt;&gt;65&lt;&lt;, page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Medieval sources the "liburna" ships were often recorded in use by the Medieval [[Croats|Croatian]] and [[Dalmatia]]n pirates and sailors, but probably not always referring to the ships of the same form.

===Pristis===
The Pristis ([[Ancient Greek]] Πρίστις) was a ''beaked''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0234:book=18:chapter=1&amp;highlight=pristis Polybius, Histories,18.1], "WHEN the time appointed arrived, Philip put to sea from Congress at Nicaea in Locris, winter of B. C. 198-197. Coss. Titus Quinctius Flamininus, Sext. Aelius Paetus Catus. Demetrias and came into the Melian Gulf, with five galleys and one beaked war-ship (pristis)..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;πρίστις, a sea-monster (another form of pistrix), V.—A long, narrow ship of war, L.—As the name of a vessel, V.Lewis, Charlton, T.

A. 5.114]&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Fortifications==
[[File:Daorson.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Giant walls of Daorson]]
Illyrians built hill-forts as places of refuge (and perhaps as dwellings&lt;ref name="The Illyrians 1996, page 205"&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 205&lt;/ref&gt;) such as [[Tilurium]]&lt;ref name="The Illyrians 1996, page 190"&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 190&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Setovia]]&lt;ref name="The Illyrians 1996, page 190"/&gt; of the [[Delmatae]]. Most enclosures were round or oval with very few exceptions for other shapes and the largest two were 200 meters across&lt;ref name="The Illyrians 1996, page 205"/&gt; while most are not anything more than fortified blockhouses.

The ''Castellieri'' were fortified boroughs, usually located on hills or mountains or, more rarely (such as in Friuli), in plains. They were constituted by one or more concentric series of walls, of rounded or elliptical shape in Istria and Venezia Giulia, or quadrangular in Friuli, within which was the inhabited area. Some a hundred of ''castellieri'' have been discovered in Istria, Friuli and Venezia Giulia, such as that of [[Leme, Croatia|Leme]], in the central-western Istria, of the Elleri, near [[Muggia]], of Monte Giove near Prosecco ([[Trieste]]) and San Polo, not far from [[Monfalcone]]. However, the largest ''castelliere'' was perhaps that of ''[[Nesactium]]'', in the southern Istria, not far from [[Pula]].

==External influences==

Apart from other cultural influences and imported weapons and armor from the [[Ancient Greeks]] the Illyrians had adopted the ornamentation of Ancient [[Macedon]] on their shields&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians: history and culture, History and Culture Series,The Illyrians: History and Culture, Aleksandar Stipčević, {{ISBN|0-8155-5052-9}}, 1977, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and used similar designs on bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 233&amp;236, "The Illyrians liked decorated belt-buckles or clasps (see figure 29). Some of gold and silver with openwork designs of stylised birds have a similar distribution to the Mramorac bracelets and may also have been produced under Greek influence."&lt;/ref&gt; The Illyrians used four concentric half circles whilst the Macedons five. This ancient Greek symbol was prominent in [[Thessaly]] and [[Macedon]],&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity by Jonathan M. Hall, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-78999-0}}, page 116, "...early appearance of this motiff in Thessaly and Makedonia, from where it was diffused southwards..."&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in the 10th century BC and had spread throughout southern Greece. A typical adoption of the symbol in the [[Hellenistic period]] from Illyrians is seen on an iron round [[pelte]] with similar decorations and a diameter of 35&amp;nbsp;cm. This is evident during the Greek rule of south Illyria the [[Antipatrid dynasty]] &amp; the [[Antigonid dynasty]] retained until the Roman conquest. Tactics&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians by John Wilkes, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, 1996, page 150, "This episode shows how much the Dardanians had been influenced by the military traditions of the Hellenistic world"&lt;/ref&gt; had been influenced as well, evident in an incident involving [[Dardanians (Balkans)|Dardanians]]. The hellenised&lt;ref name="Dalmatia 2006, page 21"/&gt; city of [[Daorson]] located in [[Dalmatia]] included "''[[cyclopean walls]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Urbano biće Bosne i Hercegovine – page 27 by Seka Brkljača – 1996, "Its name was Daorson. It belonged to the Hellenistic civilization and sphere of the Greek culture. Its 46 meters of the old fortress are preserved"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman===
Illyria became a Roman province at 168 BC. The Illyrians, that were eventually [[Romanized]] rebelled in AD 6. Nearly two hundred years of Roman rule changed the weapons of the Illyrians by the time of the rebellion and they resembled those of [[Roman legionaries]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. The tribes that rebelled had been [[Celticized]] by the time Romans conquered Illyria in 168 BC and their equipment reflected this. Inhabitants of Roman Dalmatia applied a poison on their arrows called ''ninum''.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19807-9}}, page 222&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a Roman influence but was mentioned during that time.

[[Octavius]] against [[Pannonians]] in [[Siscia]], Illyrian defeat&lt;ref name="Antony Spawforth 2003"&gt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, 2003, page 1106, "Pannonia, a Roman province established AD 9 and named after the Pannonii, a group of Illyrian peoples (see ILLYRII) who had absorbed Celtic influences to various degrees (see CELTS), lay south and west of the Danube (*Danuvius) in the valleys of the Drava and Sava and the latter’s Bosnian tributaries. In 119 BC the Romans campaigned against them, not for the first time, seizing *Siscia. In 35 BC Octavian (see AUGUSTUS) advanced against them and recaptured Siscia, where he established a garrison. Fighting broke out in 16 BC with a Pannonian invasion of Istria and continued in 14. In 13 M. *Vipsantius Agrippa and M. *Vinicius advanced eastward down the Sava and Drava valleys. After Agrippa’s death (12 BC) the conquest of the Pannonians, notably the Breuci in the Sava valley was completed ruthlessly by *Tiberius and Roman control was extended to the Danube (Res Gestae Rivi Augusti 100 30). Pannonia north of the Drava appears to have accepted Roman rule without a struggle probably owing to fear of the Dacians to the east. Some fighting is attested in 8 BC by Sex.

'''Jacob Haight Morrison, IV''' (March 12, 1905 &amp;ndash; December 4, 1974), was an [[Lawyer|attorney]], journalist, author, and [[historical preservationist]] from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. He helped preserve the Vieux Carré or [[French Quarter]], which has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark District|National Historic District]], and published a pioneer textbook on historic preservation law.

He was born into a political family: his father was district attorney of [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|Pointe Coupee Parish]], and his half-brother [[deLesseps Story Morrison|deLesseps Story "Chep" Morrison, Sr.]] later was elected as [[Mayor of New Orleans]]. Chep's son [[DeLesseps Morrison, Jr.|DeLesseps Story "Toni" Morrison, Jr.]] was elected to the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana House of Representatives]].

==Early life, education, and marriage==
Morrison was born in 1905 in [[New Roads, Louisiana|New Roads]], the seat of [[Pointe Coupee Parish]] (pronounced COO PEA), to the former Eloise Yancy (1876–1905) of [[Jonesville, Louisiana|Jonesville]] in [[Catahoula Parish]], who died the same year as her son's birth. His father, Jacob Haight Morrison, III (1875–1929), was the [[district attorney]] of Pointe Coupee Parish. He married again, to Anita Olivier, a New Orleans socialite; they had a son, [[deLesseps Story Morrison|deLesseps Story "Chep" Morrison, Sr.]] Anita became a stepmother to the boy Jacob. His half-brother "Chep" became an attorney and politician and was  elected as [[Mayor of New Orleans]]. He ran unsuccessfully for [[governor of Louisiana]] on three occasions.

Morrison, IV, was educated in public schools, earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]]. He received his [[law]] degree from the [[Tulane University Law School]] in New Orleans.

On July 4, 1938, Morrison married Mary Meek (February 2, 1911 - February 26, 1999) of [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]], [[Mississippi]]. The couple had no children.

==Career==
Before entering his law practice, Jacob Morrison reported on Louisiana State University sports for the ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' and was [[sports]] editor of the former ''Baton Rouge State Times''. His two law partners were his half-brother "Chep" Morrison and [[Hale Boggs|Thomas Hale Boggs, Sr.]], a future [[U.S. Representative]] from New Orleans.

Morrison was elected as a member of the Louisiana State Board of Education in the late 1930s. He served in the [[United States Army]] from 1943 to 1945 during [[World War II]]. He resumed his law practice after the war.

Morrison led preservation of the [[French Quarter|Vieux Carre]] or [[French Quarter]] during the 1940s through his presidency of the Vieux Carre Property Owners and Association, Inc. He worked to find ways to support preservation through existing and new legislation, to provide incentives for owners to maintain properties. In 1957, he published his pioneer law textbook on preservation, ''Historic Preservation Law''. He was a member of the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].

Morrison was a member of the local, state, and national bar associations; [[Phi Delta Phi]] national legal fraternity, [[Sigma Delta Chi]] society of journalists, and the [[Roman Catholic]] Church.

Jacob Morrison died in New Orleans. He and his wife are interred at [[Lafayette Cemetery No. 1]] in New Orleans.

==Legacy and honors==
*The French Quarter has received protection as a [[National Historic Landmark District|National Historic District]], as have other significant areas of New Orleans. 
*1974, two months before his death, Morrison and his wife received the Louise [[DuPont]] Crownshield Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, for their outstanding work.

MacArthur Foundation]]|accessdate=2 August 2017|date=1 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Jones was born in [[Delaware]]. Jones' mother taught at [[Delaware Technical and Community College]]. Her father, Albert P. Jones (died 1995), worked for [[DuPont]] and was the president of the [[Delaware State Board of Education]] for many years; she attended an elementary school in [[Christiana, Delaware]] named after him in 1996.&lt;ref name="udel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Beth|title=Historian of American labor wins MacArthur award|journal=Messenger|date=1999|volume=8|issue=4|url=http://www1.udel.edu/PR/Messenger/99/4/historian.html|accessdate=2 August 2017|publisher=University of Delaware}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones received a [[B.A.]] in 1970 from the [[University of Delaware]], and a [[Ph.D.]] in 1976 from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. She has held academic positions at [[Wellesley College]], [[Brown University]] and [[Brandeis University]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacqueline Jones–Curriculum Vitae|url=https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/files/nKenm6aWsQ|publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]]|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1999 Jones was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. Although the award typically allows academics to take time off from their teaching, she decided to wait before beginning her research and worked through the period of the fellowship, saying, "I think I will take time off in a few years, but I really like being here on campus, being around my colleagues, teaching." Jones has also been awarded a [[Ford Fellowship]], a [[Woodrow Wilson Fellowship]], and an [[American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship]], and was twice a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in history. She is married to the Political Scientist and Law Professor [[Jeffrey Abramson]], author of ''We, The Jury'' and ''Minerva's Owl'', among other texts. The couple has two daughters, Sarah Jones Abramson and Anna Jones Abramson.&lt;ref name="TexasLaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeffrey B. Abramson–Texas Law Faculty|url=https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/ja27365/|website=[[Texas Law]]|publisher=[[The University of Texas at Austin]]|accessdate=2 August 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideas and awards ==
In 1986, Jones's second book ''Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow: Black Women, Work, and the Family from Slavery to the Present'' won her the [[Bancroft Prize]]. In ''Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow'', Jones demonstrates her extensive knowledge of the history of the [[American South|South]] from 1830 to 1915. The book begins as a study of African Americans and the hardships they faced during the nineteenth century, but then develops to include commentary on the impact of class and gender on women in the South. The book goes on to debunk ideas about 'race' and also to blend analysis of the hardships faced by women and blacks into a single integrated picture centering on the figure of the black working-class woman. The book's combination of historical and feminist scholarship is characteristic of Jones's career. Upon winning a MacArthur fellowship Jones noted that finishing her Bancroft-winning volume inspired her to write her third book, ''The Dispossessed, America's Underclasses from the Civil War to the Present'', which examines poverty in America across the boundaries of race and gender. That book would go on to win her a Choice Award for Outstanding Academic Title in 1992 as well as finalist standing for the Lillian Smith Award for non-fiction. In 2001, Jones published ''Creek Walking'', a memoir of her childhood in Delaware during the 1950s. Although her expertise is primarily in African American history, Jones's books range widely in their coverage, from the effect of economic policies on workers' lives to American educational history. Her understanding of women's history has gained her recognition outside her own field among feminist circles, and she continues to reach non-academic audiences with the expansion of her areas of research. ''American Work: Four Centuries of Black and White Labor'' was a History Book Club Selection and in 2002 she was named a fellow in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Jones has reflected in an interview that her work involves "writing about issues of race and class and how the United States has changed over the years, how different groups have viewed each other and interacted, how certain groups have been assigned certain kinds of work." Her history writing increasingly features case studies focusing on the overlooked but nonetheless exemplary lives of individuals. Her most recent book, ''A Dreadful Deceit: The Myth of Race From the Colonial Era to Obama’s America'', was published in 2013.

When asked by ''[[Politico Magazine]]'' to weigh in on which historical figures [[Donald Trump]] was comparable to, Jones said he echoed the comments of past Mississippi Governor [[James K. Vardaman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump's Historical Antecedents|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/gallery/2015/08/trumps-historical-antecedents-000525?slide=9|accessdate=2 August 2017|work=[[Politico Magazine]]|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph G. Baldacchino''' (17 July 1894 – 6 July 1974) was a [[Malta|Maltese]] archaeologist. He was born in  [[Siġġiewi]] and spent his early childhood in that locality until 1901, when his family moved to Tarxien. In 1909, the family moved to Qormi, where he studied medicine, graduating as a medical doctor in 1919.

Although he worked as a general practitioner for over a decade, by 1930 he was showing a deep interest in paleontology. He was appointed curator of natural history within the Malta Museum Department in 1933. He continued work on the [[Għar Dalam]] Museum and excavated the cave at this site. His hypothesis formulated at this time, that the cave was originally an underground cavern divided by an ancient river is still considered as valid today.

After the war he was appointed director of the Museum Department in 1947. Under his directorship the department toiled to bring out material stored during the war years and display it once again. A number of restoration and excavation campaigns were conducted at [[Ħaġar Qim]], [[Mnajdra]] and [[Tarxien Temples]] while material uncovered following serendipitous discoveries was published.

Baldacchino retired from the Museum Department in 1955 and for a number of years worked at the [[University of Malta]]. He died on 6 July 1974 and was buried at the Addolorata Cemetery, Just eleven days missed off 80.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4203">'''Krzysztof Budzyń''' (born September 4, 1957), is a Polish entrepreneur and amateur historian, specializing in the history of the Śrem region in western Poland, and author of many publications on this subject.

== Education and business career ==
Krzysztof Budzyń was born in [[Śrem]], Poland. Since his birth, he has been living in his home village [[Binkowo]] near Śrem. After finishing elementary school in [[Pysząca, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Pysząca]], he attended Gen. Józef Wybicki High School in Śrem. After passing his ''[[matura]]'' school leaving examinations, he was studying at the Chemical Engineering Faculty of [[Szczecin University of Technology]], where he was awarded a Master of Science degree.&lt;ref&gt;''Moja Ziemia Śremska (ze zbiorów Krzysztofa Budzynia)'', Biblioteka Raczyńskich, Poznań 2010, pp. 2−4.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from university, he worked for companies of the chemical industry for some time; in the late 1980s he decided to start his own business. In 1990, he opened a wholesale company dealing in household chemicals and cosmetics; in 1995 he extended his business to include a chain of retail outlets.&lt;ref&gt;''Moja Ziemia Śremska...'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work as a regional historian ==
Despite his technical background and running a trading company, Krzysztof Budzyń has been interested in humanities, especially history and literature, for many years; occasionally he is also engaged in literary work himself.

He made his debut as early as 1981 in ''[[Szpilki]]'' (''Pins''), a Polish magazine of humour and satire, as an author of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]]. Since the early 1990s he has been writing articles on regional history to local newspapers and the periodical ''Pierwiosnek'' (''Primrose'') published by the Gen. Józef Wybicki High School in Śrem. He is a [[bibliophilia|bibliophile]] and collector of historical mementoes – old maps, documents, photographs, postcards, mainly from the Śrem region, covering the territory of present [[Śrem County]] and the neighbouring communes of [[gmina Kórnik|Kórnik]] and [[gmina Mosina|Mosina]], which were part of Śrem County in the past.

Since 2008, Krzysztof Budzyń has been publishing ''Śremski Notatnik Historyczny'' (''Śrem Historical Notebook''), a "magazine for lovers of the Śrem region", a periodical published irregularly, featuring articles on the history of the region and its eminent citizens. Six volumes of ''Śremski Notatnik Historyczny'' have been published so far. Krzysztof Budzyń is the publisher, editor-in-chief and author of a great deal of texts in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;''Moja Ziemia Śremska...'', pp. 5−12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of his collections was displayed at the exhibition "Moja Ziemia Śremska (ze zbiorów Krzysztofa Budzynia)" ("My Śrem Region – Krzysztof Budzyń's collections") in the [[Raczyński Library in Poznań]] from November 25, 2010 to January 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bracz.edu.pl//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=375&amp;Itemid=100 Information on the exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matilda Ridout Edgar''' (29 September 1844 – 29 September 1910) was a Canadian historian and feminist.
She was born Matilda Ridout, became Matilda Edgar by marriage, and became '''Lady Edgar''' in 1898 when her husband was knighted.
The mother of nine children, she turned to historical research and writing when in her forties.
She published three books in her lifetime and was working on a fourth when she died.
She was active in a number of Toronto-based societies, and in her later years was a strong advocate of women's causes.

==Early years==
Matilda Ridout was born in Toronto, Canada, on 29 September 1844, the fifth child and second daughter of Thomas Gibbs Ridout and Matilda Ann Bramley.
Her grandfather, [[Thomas Ridout]] of [[Sherborne]], Dorset, was surveyor general of [[Upper Canada]] from 1810 to 1829.
Her father was the first cashier of the Bank of Upper Canada from 1822 until he retired in 1861.{{sfn|Sketch of Lady Edgar's Life, Transaction 1914|p=3}}
Her father died a few months after retiring, and his mother was left with little money to support a family of nine.
On 5 September 1865 Matilda married [[James David Edgar]], a barrister, lawyer and author, becoming Matilda Edgar.
The marriage of "Tillie" (Matilda) and James was happy and loving, as is shown by the letters he wrote to her daily when politics took him to Ottawa.{{sfn|McLean|Stamp|1998|p=8}}

She enjoyed raising their three daughters and six sons, although they left her with little free time.{{sfn|Breault|2014}}
Eight of the children lived into adulthood.{{sfn|McLean|Stamp|1998|p=9}}
Their eldest son was James Frederic Edgar, born on 6 July 1866.{{sfn|McLean|Stamp|1998|p=9}}
Their second surviving son was Pelham Edgar and their oldest daughter was Maud.{{sfn|McLean|Stamp|1998|p=9}}
They were followed by William Wilkie, born on 26 October 1874, Beatrice on 25 August 1877, David Keithock on 29 November 1879 and Herbert Wedderlie on 20 June 1883.{{sfn|McLean|Stamp|1998|p=130}}
Marjorie was born in 1886.{{sfn|McLean|Stamp|1998|p=190}}

Her husband ran on the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] platform and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada to represent [[Monck, Ontario|Monck]], Ontario on 12 October 1872, but lost his seat in the election of 22 January 1874. He ran again without success in several by-elections and elections until being elected on the Liberal platform for [[Ontario West]] on 22 August 1884.{{sfn|EDGAR, The Hon. Sir James David, Canada}}
During his time out of office he became the unofficial organizer for Prime Minister [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] in Ontario, and negotiated a new railway clause for the entry of British Columbia into the Confederation of Canada.{{sfn|Hon. Sir James David Edgar, Parliament}}

==Philanthropist==
James David Edgar was appointed Speaker of the House of Commons on 19 August 1896, holding this position until his death.{{sfn|EDGAR, The Hon. Sir James David, Canada}}
As his wife, Matilda Edgar was invited to become patron of enterprises such as the Toronto Infants' Home, the [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]], and the [[Women's Art Association of Canada]] (WAAC).{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=84}}
In 1898 Matilda Edgar and [[Mary Dignam]], president of the WAAC, arranged for members of the House and Senate to subscribe $1,000 to purchase the [[Cabot Commemorative State Dinner Service]]. This was a hand-painted eight-course, 24-place dinner set representing Canadian subjects that had been made by WAAC members to commemorate the 400th anniversary of [[John Cabot]]'s discovery of Canada. The set was formally presented to [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]] on the occasion of her husband finishing his assignment as Governor General of Canada.{{sfn|Elwood|1977|p=46}}

Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] appointed Edgar to the Privy Council, and in 1898 he was knighted.
He was already showing the symptoms of [[nephritis]], a kidney disease.{{sfn|Hon. Sir James David Edgar, Parliament}}
For part of 1898 Matilda, now Lady Edgar, was acting president of the [[National Council of Women of Canada]].{{sfn|Breault|2014}}
When her husband died on 31 July 1899 Matilda Edgar  was devastated, and gave up all public activities for the next year. She briefly turned to [[spiritualism]], and thought she received a message from her husband telling her to continue to work and to give her support to the children.{{sfn|Breault|2014}}

Matilda Edgar became active in public again in 1900.
She threw herself into women's causes, proposing that women should have the right to receive higher education, support themselves and vote.
Women should not lose control of their property when they married.
She became a life member of the National Council of Women in 1906, and was elected president of the council that year.
She was elected president again in 1909.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=85}}

A sketch of her life published by the Women's Canadian Historical Society in 1914 said, "The resultant volume ... revealed her sense of historical perspective, her easy mastery of detail, and her possession of a literary style that was at once limpid, nervous and strong".{{sfn|Sketch of Lady Edgar's Life, Transaction 1914|p=3}}

Matilda Edgar and [[Sarah Anne Curzon]] founded the Canadian Women's Historical Society in 1895.{{sfn|Bird|2007}}

The book was published in 1912, after her death, and was highly praised.{{sfn|Sketch of Lady Edgar's Life, Transaction 1914|p=4}}

'''Myna Gayle Hicks Potts''' (born March 30, 1927) is a [[historical]] [[preservationist]] from [[Chillicothe, Texas|Chillicothe]] in [[Hardeman County, Texas|Hardeman County]] in [[West Texas]] who is the [[curator]] of the Medicine Mound [[Museum]] in the nearby [[ghost town]] of [[Medicine Mound, Texas|Medicine Mound]]. Only two buildings remain in the town. Medicine Mound has received [[Non-profit organization|non-profit status]] and has been placed in the domain of the newly established Downtown Medicine Mound Preservation Group, a [[501(c)|501(c)(3) public charity]].&lt;ref&gt;Guidestar, Downtown Medicine Mound Preservation Group:http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?partner=justgivews&amp;ein=11-3788422&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Medicine Mounds==
 
Medicine Mound is near four [[dolomite]] hills known as '''Medicine Mounds''', which are considered sacred by the [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] who believe that the landmarks contain mystical spirits to improve the quality of their lives. The mounds are on [[private property]] and not available for public tours beyond an outer five-mile limit. One can see for approximately fifty miles from the top of the mounds.&lt;ref name=memories&gt;"Memories of the Mounds", website of Downtown Medicine Mound Preservation Group:http://www.medicinemound.com/themounds.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
 
John A. Bates of [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] in [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]], [[Michigan]], near [[Detroit]], the former executive director of the Downtown Medicine Mound Preservation Group&lt;ref&gt;Texas Association of Museums website:http://www.museumsusa.org/directory/info/2314110&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[cousin]] of Myna Potts, recalls having visited the ghost town when he was a boy:  "The Comanche would come to the Medicine Mounds for their healing powers, often trading [[flint]] and other goods and racing their ponies around the mound below us.  . . . We carefully descended about seventy-five feet or so to an almost imperceptible track that circled the entire mound, which was used by [[Quanah Parker]]'s braves to test their horsemanship. [In 1966], this 'track' was still quite visible, especially for a young man with a fertile imagination. Sadly, it is slowly disappearing as the young [[Cedar wood|cedar]] trees begin to reclaim the ground."&lt;ref name=memories/&gt;

The four mounds, which range in elevation from two hundred to five hundred feet, were Comanche campsites and ceremonial grounds. The mounds had abundant spring water which encouraged [[hunting]], the gathering of [[medicine|medicinal]] plants, and for worship. The [[Comanche Nation]] still considers two of these mounds to be sacred: the tallest, Medicine Mound, and the second tallest, Cedar Mound. The Indians return to these sites to gather plants and [[herbs]] and to seek spiritual guidance.&lt;ref&gt;"The Skipper's Report", U.S. Merchant Marine:http://bhirdo.net/2007_October_Liberty_Log.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and family==
 
Potts was the only daughter of five children of Ira Lee Hicks (1886–1966) and the former Lillie Bell Holmes (1892–1989), who are buried in Chillicothe. She was born in [[Bonita, Texas|Bonita]], an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] community in [[Montague County, Texas|Montague County]] northwest of [[Denton, Texas|Denton]]. The Pottses moved west of [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]] to Medicine Mound in Hardeman County when Myna was still an [[infant]]. Ira Hicks and his brother-in-law, Lon Cobb (died 1942), operated the Hicks-Cobb General Store, since the museum which Potts oversees as the major focus of her historical preservation efforts.&lt;ref name=statement&gt;Statement of Myna Potts, September 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Potts attended [[elementary school]] in Medicine Mound and graduated from Quanah High School in [[Quanah, Texas|Quanah]], the seat of Hardeman County, named for the Comanche chief Quanah Parker. She attended [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] for one year. Potts was married to John Luther Potts, Jr. (1922-2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who retired from the Lykes Shipping Company of [[New Orleans]]. As a skipper in the [[merchant marine]], he was away from home in Chillicothe six months at a time, a situation which led Mrs. Potts to master the [[ham radio]] to maintain communication with her husband.&lt;ref name=statement/&gt; The couple had one son, David Lee Potts (born January 12, 1947).&lt;ref&gt;USGENWEB [[Archives]], [[Hardeman County, Texas]], Births 1947:http://files.usgwarchives.org/tx/hardeman/vitals/births/1947/hardeb47.txt{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic preservation==
 
Potts grew up in the store, which she still describes as her "playhouse".  In addition to the Hicks-Cobb [[General Store]], Medicine Mound in its heyday had the W.W. Cole Building, a combination [[bank]], [[Pharmacy|drugstore]], [[gasoline station]] (with rusty pumps remaining), and [[post office]], a [[laundry]] (specifically, New York Steam Laundry), a [[school]], and a [[Church (building)|church]]. [[U.S. Highway 287]] bypassed Medicine Mound in the late 1920s, and the community slowly declined in [[population]].&lt;ref name=txex&gt;"Texas' Favorite Detour: Could Medicine Mound Be Texas' Most Interesting Ghost Town?", TexasEscapes.com: http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasTowns/Medicine-Mound-Texas-Favorite-Detour.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The ghost town is located at the junction of Texas Farm or Ranch Roads 91 and 1167, which can be reached from U.S. 287 southward at Chillicothe or several miles further west of Chillicothe. It is southeast of the [[county seat]] of Quanah. 
 
[[Cotton]] was grown about Medicine Mound, and times were generally prosperous until the [[Great Depression]]. A [[fire]] swept through Medicine Mound in 1933, but the community rebuilt. Though the original town buildings were wooden, solid [[granite]] round rocks were placed on the revised structures—the stone is really prehistoric gravel&lt;ref name=txex/&gt; and was brought from the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[Oklahoma]],&lt;ref name=comanche&gt;The Comanche Language and Cultural Preservation Committee newsletter, 1999:{{cite web |url=http://www.comanchelanguage.org/November%201999%20Newsletter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509081237/http://www.comanchelanguage.org/November%201999%20Newsletter.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The population steadily declined from some five hundred to nothing, meaning a ghost town, though the 2000 [[census]] placed the count at fifty, most living away from the town itself. When Hicks-Cobb closed in 1966, the town died. There are four [[Texas Historical Commission]] markers outside the old store dedicated to (1) the community of Medicine Mound, (2) the Hicks-Cobb store, turned into a museum by Potts, (3) a [[Works Progress Administration]] [[sanitation]] project from the 1930s, and (4) a pioneer cemetery  south of Medicine Mound, which is believed to have a total of nine graves.
&lt;ref name=comanche/&gt;
 
On April 5, 2008, Potts addressed the [[West Texas Historical Association]] annual meeting in [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]] south of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] on her historical preservation work and her attempt to highlight the contributions of rural Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[[West Texas Historical Association]], Myna Potts, "Medicine Mound: A Look at our Past", annual meeting, April 5, 2008, Canyon, Texas&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Texas Country Reporter''==
 
In 2007, Potts told [[Bob Phillips]] in his ''[[Texas Country Reporter]]'' [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] that Medicine Mound "was [[rural]] America, and it was complete. We had everything we needed right here. . . . I want the people remembered who settled the area. . . . [This place] has meaning; they had a place in history." &lt;ref name=tcr&gt;Myna Potts, ''[[Texas Country Reporter]]'', [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] narrated by [[Bob Phillips]], September 1, 2007:{{cite web |url=http://www.texascountryreporter.com/show.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415225255/http://www.texascountryreporter.com/show.htm |archivedate=2009-04-15 |df= }}; Myna (Hicks) Potts, D.M.M.P.G./Medicine Mound Museum, 8450 South FM 91, Quanah, Texas 79252, 940-839-4344 or medicinemound.com&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Phillips narrated his observations as follows: [Potts] is one woman determined to keep this town's history together. . . . We found Medicine Mound on Highway 1167 far from anything but the hills that the native Comanche held sacred, the mounds that give this place its name. Once we were here, we felt close to those who built the community, and the past didn't seem so far away."&lt;ref name=tcr/&gt;

==Museum access==
 
The museum is particularly known for its extensive collection of hundreds of [[photograph]]s of early pioneers as well as old bottles, store fixtures, and a variety of items once sold in the mercantile, such as hats. Potts began assembling the pictures when she worked with [[Western (genre)|western]] [[author]] Bill Neal, who wrote on a book on the region, ''Our Stories, Legends of the Mounds''.&lt;ref&gt;"Medicine Mound Texas: Population Zero", website of Downtown Medicine Mound Preservation Group:http://www.medicinemound.com/portfolio/content.cfm?imageStart=4&amp;StartRow=1&amp;PageNum=1&amp;cate=1&amp;pageType=3&amp;pageID=1&amp;imageID=259&amp;oneachpage=12&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Museum hours are usually 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday but also by appointment. In many ways, Medicine Mound Museum is Potts' "personal museum", the story of her own life.&lt;ref&gt;''Texas State Travel Guide, 2008'', See section under "Quanah", pp. 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a highway rest stop on U.S. 287 to assist travelers desiring to detour to Medicine Mound to see the four mounds, the historical museum, and the ghost town.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Timmons, "Kiosks make travel touch and go," ''[[Amarillo Globe-News]], June 30, 2003:http://www.amarillo.com/stories/063003/tex_kioskshelpful.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Photographer]] Joe Miller recommends a visit to Medicine Mound for those who like solitude: "Potts is a gracious hostess and the place is certainly worth a visit. I love places like Medicine Mound because I hate crowds -- especially when I'm trying to do photography.  I set up my heavy [[tripod]] in the middle of the street knowing that there probably wouldn't be any traffic and, if someone did come along they would most likely pull around me and wave like they do when you meet them on the highway. There's not a lot of [[road rage]] in Medicine Mound."&lt;ref&gt;Joe Miller Fine Art Photography, Photo Log, 2004:http://www.fineart-photography.com/photologS4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30386">'''Nuclear famine''' is a [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] famine considered a potential threat following global or regional [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear exchange]]. It is thought that even subtle cooling effects resulting from a regional nuclear exchange could have a substantial impact on agriculture production, triggering a food crisis amongst the world's survivors.

While belief in the "[[nuclear winter]]" hypothesis is both popular and heavily [[nuclear winter#Criticism and debate|debated]], the issue of potential food supply disruption from blast and fallout effects following a nuclear war is less controversial. Several books have been written on the food supply issue, including ''[[Fallout Protection]]'', ''[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]'', ''[[Philip J. Dolan#Unclassified publications|Would the Insects Inherit the Earth and Other Subjects of Concern to Those Who Worry About Nuclear War]]'', and most recently the extreme nuclear winter and [[impact winter|comet impact]] countermeasuring ''[[Feeding Everyone No Matter What]]''.

Together with these largely introductory texts, more official tomes with a focus on organization, agriculture, and [[radioecology]] include ''Nutrition in the Postattack Environment'' by the [[RAND Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5052.html|title=Nutrition in the postattack environment|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112108/http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5052.html|archivedate=2015-01-28|df=|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[continuity of government]] plans for preventing a famine in ''On Reorganizing After Nuclear Attack'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3764.html Brown, William Morle, On Reorganizing After Nuclear Attack, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation, P-3764, 1968.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192713/http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3764.html |date=2016-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Survival of the Relocated Population of the U.S. After a Nuclear Attack'' by Nobel Prize winner [[Eugene Wigner]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1976/3445600218921.pdf Survival of the relocated population of the U.S. after a nuclear attack 1976. full PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207061152/http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1976/3445600218921.pdf |date=2017-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while those focused solely on radioecology and agriculture include ''Effects of Fallout Radiation on Crop Production'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:7225106  Effects of fallout radiation on crop production Killion, D.D.; Constantin, M.J.UT-ERDA Comparative Animal Research Lab., Oak Ridge, Tenn.

==Early work==
One of the first works to discuss the problem of fallout, farming, food and supply was [[Herman Kahn]]'s 1960 publication ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]''. Kahn argued that while [[total war]] would indeed be an "unprecedented catastrophe", food which is slightly-to-moderately contaminated need not be wasted as the ingestion of such food by the elderly would not result in any observable increase in cancer in this [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]. This is due to the fact that, like other common carcinogens such as cigarette smoke, [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to radiation]] or specifically from nuclear fallout; instead cancer has a minimum [[Radiation-induced cancer|latency period]] of some 5+ years, which is supported by the research of [[Project 4.1]]. It is for this reason that the elderly could eat slight-to-moderately contaminated food without much, if any, ill effect, allowing for the most uncontaminated food to be saved for younger generations.

==Overview==

From 1983-1985, in a time period during which the "[[nuclear winter]]" hypothesis was notably still in its early [[nuclear winter#Criticism and debate|"apocalyptic" 1-D computer model phase]], more than 300 physical, atmospheric, agricultural and ecological scientists from over 30 countries around the world came together to participate in the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment-Environmental Effects of Nuclear War (SCOPE-ENUWAR) project. This project assessed the global consequences of nuclear war, resulting in a two-volume publication titled ''Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War'', detailing the physical, atmospheric, ecological and agricultural effects of a major nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pittock|first1=Barrie|last2=Ackerman|first2=Thomas|last3=Paul|first3=Crutzen|last4=Charles|first4=Shapiro|title=Environmental Consequences of Nuclear WarVolume I- Physical and Atmospheric Effects|date=1986|publisher=Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)|url=http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_28_1/SCOPE_28I.html|accessdate=27 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716044514/http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_28_1/SCOPE_28I.html|archivedate=16 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mark|first1=Harwell|last2=Thomas|first2=Hutchinson|title=Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War Volume II-Ecological and Agricultural Effects|date=1985|publisher=Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) of the International Council of Scientific Unions|url=http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_28_2/SCOPE_28II.html|accessdate=27 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716055619/http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_28_2/SCOPE_28II.html|archivedate=16 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the publication, it is predicted that billions of survivors in the aftermath of nuclear war, even in non-combatant countries, ''may'' experience a dwindling food supply (if the [[continuity of government]] countermeasures were not fielded) which plunges survivors into "massive levels of malnutrition and starvation," and in dire situations, "only a small fraction of the current world population could expect to survive a few years".&lt;ref name=SCOPEIICHAP5&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mark|first1=Harwell|last2=Thomas|first2=Hutchinson|title=Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War Volume II: ecological and Agricultural Effects|date=1985|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of SCOPE of the ICSU|page=Chapter 5|url=http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_28_2/SCOPE_28-2_3.1_Chapter5_359-426.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718055146/http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_28_2/SCOPE_28-2_3.1_Chapter5_359-426.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many processes can be involved leading up to a massive food shortage on a global scale. To begin, crops, stored food and agricultural supplies such as fertilizers and pesticides can be instantly destroyed in nuclear blasts; nuclear contamination of soil, air and water can render food unsafe to eat, and crops unable to grow properly; and uncontrollable fires can impede normal agricultural or food gathering activities. Experts predicted that in the first few years that follow a nuclear war, more complex processes, such as the crippling of the international economy and trade systems, collapse of global food transportation and distribution networks, loss of exportation incentives and importation, drastic climatic stress on the agroecosystems, and associated chaos and disruption in society can spawn to escalate the problem of food shortage.&lt;ref name=SCOPEIICHAP5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nuclearfamine&gt;Harwell, M., and C.

Following the publication of ''Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War'', more studies have emerged based on modeling and analysis of hypothetical nuclear exchanges between nuclear-armed nations. The conclusions of these studies illustrate that a nuclear war is a self-destructive road to mass starvation, and echoed the statement made in ''The Medical Implications of Nuclear War'', a publication by the National Academy of Sciences, that "the primary mechanism for human fatalities would likely not be from blast effects, not from thermal radiation burns, and not from ionizing radiation, but, rather, from mass starvation".&lt;ref name="medimplications"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fredric|first1=Solomon|last2=Robert|first2=Marston|title=The Medical Implications of Nuclear War|date=Jan 1, 1866|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|location=Washington, D.C.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NUUrAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the total number of global nuclear weapons had declined by two thirds following the U.S.-Soviet [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START) compared to the early 80s, some experts feel that the risk of nuclear conflict has not decreased, but has instead risen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Julian|first1=Borger|title=Nuclear weapons risk greater than in cold war, says ex-Pentagon chief|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/nuclear-weapons-risk-greater-than-in-cold-war-says-ex-pentagon-chief|accessdate=27 July 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=Jan 7, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729195902/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/nuclear-weapons-risk-greater-than-in-cold-war-says-ex-pentagon-chief|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to [[nuclear proliferation]] as more countries such as [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]], [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]], and [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]] now have nuclear arsenals, increasing the risk of regional nuclear conflicts. Growing military tensions, accidents, sabotages and cyber-attacks are all potential trigger points of massive nuclear disruption and regional, if not global famine.

Biologists have long analyzed that a number of factors arising from "nuclear winter" will induce a significant impact on agriculture. For instance, nuclear war in growing seasons can bring about sudden episodes of low temperature (-10 degree Celsius or more) for days to weeks, and drawing reference from the "[[Year Without a Summer|year without a summer]]" in 1816, episodes of freezing events are capable of destroying a large quantity of crops.&lt;ref name=nuclearfamine /&gt; In addition, growing season would potentially be shortened, as reported by Robock et al., who calculated that a regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan will substantially reduce freeze-free growing season in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for several years and devastate agricultural produce as crops do not have sufficient time to reach maturity.&lt;ref name=robock2007a /&gt;

In contrast, the natural marine ecosystems, a major supplier of food to human societies, are less vulnerable to sudden temperature fall. However, they are highly sensitive to reduced incident sunlight and increased level of UV-B radiation.&lt;ref name=nuclearfamine /&gt; In the event of a large-scale nuclear war, a mere 25% reduction in ozone is predicted to cause an enhanced UV-B radiation that reduce net photosynthesis in the surface euphotic zone by 35%, and in the whole euphotic zone by 10% (euphotic zone refers to depths in the ocean with light levels sufficient for active photosynthesis). With a corresponding reduction in light available for photosynthesis, phytoplankton populations, in the 1985 book, were expected to plummet,&lt;ref name=chap3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mark|first1=Harwell|last2=Thomas|first2=Hutchinson|title=Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War Volume II: ecological and Agricultural Effects|date=1985|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of SCOPE of the ICSU|page=Chapter 3|url=http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_28_2/SCOPE_28-2_1.3_Chapter3_173-267.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718060423/http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_28_2/SCOPE_28-2_1.3_Chapter3_173-267.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scientists had even speculated that most of the phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplanktons (that feed on phytoplanktons) in more than half of the Northern Hemisphere oceans would die.&lt;ref name=twilight /&gt; More [[Nuclear winter#early work|modern appraisals of potential ozone layer issues]] arising from nuclear fireballs, have determined these earlier assuptions to have been [[Nuclear winter#early work| completely unfounded]]. According to [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSDNET/0,,contentMDK:23168627~pagePK:64885161~piPK:64884432~theSitePK:5929282,00.html The World Bank], the ocean supplies the world's population with 16% of their animal protein intake; given that the marine food chains are built upon the photosynthesis of phytoplanktons, large-scale nuclear wars, [[Nuclear winter#early work|in these 1980s models and books]], was regarded as inadvertently devastating fisheries and to affect millions, if not billions of people who rely on the ocean for food.

==Effects of nuclear war on food distribution==

In addition to the adverse effects on the agroecosystems, socio-economical factors of war and nuclear destructions also possess far-reaching implications on food availability. It was observed in the aftermath of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] in Hiroshima and Nagasaki that food was even more scarce as crops in nearby regions were destroyed and distribution of homegrown food from other parts of Japan was cut off as a result of railroad demolitions, when crop production was already affected drastically in previous years by war and poor weather.&lt;ref name="Downfall"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Richard|title=Downfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire|date=1999|publisher=Random House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJXtAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780679414247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after the war in 1946, the amount of food available in Japan could only provide individual Japanese with 1325 calories a day,{{better source|date=December 2016}} a drop from 2000 calories consumed by an average citizen in 1941. Very soon, crippled distribution system, delayed relief and siphoning of resources from official channels to feed a thriving [[black market]] had gone so much out of hand that by the end of 1946, neglecting the input of the black market and looking solely at the official [[food ration]]s, they could barely provide Japanese in affected cities{{which|date=December 2016}} with 800 calories a day. Although the total death toll due to starvation in Japan immediately after World War II could not be calculated,{{why|date=December 2016}} a distinguished Japanese historian, [[Daikichi Irokawa]], noted that "immediately after the 1945 defeat, some estimated{{why|date=December 2016}} that 10 million people were likely{{vague|date=December 2016}} to starve to death".{{dubious|date=December 2016}}

Today, 85% of the nations in the world have low to marginal amount of homegrown food to sustain themselves and are increasingly reliant on well-connected food trade networks for imported food. A recent study (2014) examined the consequences of continental-scale disruptions on wheat and rice trade networks that can occur when global food supply is substantially reduced, such as following a large-scale nuclear war. Considering the tendency for exporting countries to withhold their crops in times of food shortage, the prediction model in this study determined that the amount of wheat and rice exports are reduced combined with losses in export networks. Critically, the authors found that the least developed countries will suffer greater import losses due to financial constraints, and the loss of trade networks will eventually lead to a larger population vulnerable to food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puma|first1=Michael|last2=Bose|first2=Satyajit|last3=Chon|first3=So Young|last4=Cook|first4=Benjamin|title=Assessing the evolving fragility of the global food system|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=22 May 2014|volume=10|issue=2|pages=024007|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/2/024007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global famine due to regional nuclear conflict==
{{see also|Nuclear holocaust}}
Much of the speculative research on nuclear war-induced climate change to date focuses on a hypothetical, large-scale nuclear exchange between  modern day Russia and the United States. However, the post-Cold War world also includes a number of other nuclear-armed countries — such as India, Pakistan, and North Korea — that are currently engaged in de facto or frozen armed conflicts with their neighbors. In comparison to "global" nuclear war, a regional conflict between nations with relatively small nuclear arsenals would likely produce less dramatic climate effects. Nonetheless, it has been argued that global cooling resulting from such a conflict could have large-scale impacts on agriculture and food supply systems worldwide.

Several studies led by Alan Robock of Rutgers University describe this possibility. A 2007 analysis using contemporary climate models found that a hypothetical nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan involving 100 Hiroshima-size bombs (less than 0.1% of the explosive yield of the current global nuclear arsenal) would be sufficient to cause drastic global cooling. The model not only predicted effects consistent with the traditional "nuclear winter" concept, but also suggested that climate effects would last longer than previously expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alan|first1=Robock|last2=Luke|first2=Oman|last3=Georgiy|first3=Stenchikov|title=Nuclear winter revisited with a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic consequences|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=Jul 6, 2007|volume=112|issue=D13|pages=D13107|doi=10.1029/2006JD008235|bibcode=2007JGRD..11213107R|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects could include marked changes in normal seasonal patterns, a 10% average decline in rainfall around the world, and "a cooling of several degrees ... over large areas of North America and Eurasia, including most of the grain-growing regions".&lt;ref name=robock2007a&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alan|first1=Robock|last2=Luke|first2=Oman|last3=Georgiy|first3=Stenchikov|last4=Charles|first4=Bardeen|last5=Richard|first5=Turco|title=Climatic consequences of regional nuclear conflicts|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|doi=10.5194/acp-7-2003-2007|date=Apr 19, 2007|volume=7|issue=8|pages=2003–2012|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-2003-2007.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629153655/http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-2003-2007.pdf|archivedate=2013-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related 2012 study assimilated a dynamic agrosystem model to predict the agricultural effects of an India-Pakistan war. The model in this case showed that a regional nuclear war on a separate continent could lead to a significant drop in yield for both corn and soybean production in the American Midwest, with the greatest crop losses occurring five years following the event.&lt;ref name="Oz2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Özdoğan|first1=Mutlu|last2=Robock|first2=Alan|last3=Kucharik|first3=Christopher J.|title=Impacts of a nuclear war in South Asia on soybean and maize production in the Midwest United States|journal=Climate Change|date=22 June 2012|volume=116|issue=2|pages=373–387|doi=10.1007/s10584-012-0518-1|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.6786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the ten years following the event, corn production was predicted to decline by an average of 10% and soybean by an average of 6–12%, depending on location. Year-to-year variability was expected to be high, and could be affected by anomalies in temperature, rainfall, and sunlight.

Other studies based on a Robock et al. style India-Pakistan war utilize a different agricultural model to predict effects on rice production in China. After taking into consideration the weather conditions and farming practices specific to different provinces, rice production was predicted to decline by an average of 21% for the first four years and by approximately 10% the following six years.&lt;ref name="Xia2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xia|first1=Lili|last2=Robock|first2=Alan|title=Impacts of a nuclear war in South Asia on rice production in Mainland China|journal=Climate Change|date=2013|volume=116|issue=2|pages=357–372|doi=10.1007/s10584-012-0475-8|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/XiaRobockNuclearChinaPrint.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317081920/http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/XiaRobockNuclearChinaPrint.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While potential adaptive measures (such as increasing rice plantations in less affected provinces or fertilizer adjustments) could be implemented, these strategies come with their own limitations and consequences—including further environmental pollution. Chinese production of maize and wheat could also be affected.&lt;ref name="Xia2013b"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xia|first1=Lili|last2=Mills|first2=Michael|last3=Stenke|first3=Andrea|last4=Helfand|first4=Ira|title=Global famine after a regional nuclear war|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/NWXIA8AR.pdf|publisher=Submitted to Earth's Future, 2013|accessdate=13 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312112951/http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/NWXIA8AR.pdf|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, wheat production in the wake of such an incident could drop by more than 50% in the first year and decline by an average of 39% in the first 5 years.

===Vulnerable populations===
The [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]] (IPPNW) reported in 2013 that more than two billion people would be at risk of starvation in the event of a limited nuclear exchange, such as one that could occur between India and Pakistan, or by the use of even a small number of the nuclear weapons held by the US and Russia.&lt;ref name="IPPNWStudy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helfand|first1=Ira|title=Nuclear Famine: Two Billion People at Risk?|url=http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/nuclear-famine-two-billion-at-risk-2013.pdf|website=International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War|accessdate=13 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405015355/http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/nuclear-famine-two-billion-at-risk-2013.pdf|archivedate=5 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPPNWPress"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loretz|first1=John|title=Nobel Laureate Warns Two Billion at Risk from Nuclear Famine|url=http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/nuclear-famine-2013-press-release-english.pdf|website=IPPNW|accessdate=13 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203024127/http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/nuclear-famine-2013-press-release-english.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This report argued that the world is in a state in which it is particularly vulnerable to even modest declines in food production. In turn, small changes in average global temperature can have disproportionately large effects on crops. Agricultural studies predicting substantial declines in U.S. and Chinese crop production may be conservative, as they do not take into account ozone depletion or daily temperature extremes. They cite the example of the [[Mount Tambora]] volcanic eruption in 1815, which produced an average annual temperature deviation of only −0.7&amp;nbsp;°C, but which brought mid-summer killing frosts to the mid-Atlantic states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stommel H, Stommel E |year=1979|title= The year without a summer|journal= Scientific American|volume= 240|issue=6|pages=176–186|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0679-176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused up to 75% crop losses in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Post, J. |year=1983|title= Climatic change and subsistence crises|journal= Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume= 14|pages=153–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the report authors argue that small perturbations in the food supply are highly amplified for malnourished populations. In particular, about 800 million people are chronically malnourished, and even a 10% decline in their food consumption would put them at risk.&lt;ref name="Hefland2007"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hefland|first1=Ira|title=An Assessment of the Extent of Projected Global Famine Resulting From Limited, Regional Nuclear War|url=http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/helfandpaper.pdf|website=Physicians for Social Responsibility|publisher=Royal Society of Medicine|accessdate=13 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151110165237/http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/helfandpaper.pdf|archivedate=10 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; World reserves of grain stocks could serve as a buffer to this; however, rough estimates suggest that current reserves would only last approximately 68–77 days.&lt;ref name="IPPNWStudy"/&gt;

Famines are also often associated with epidemics. Following the Mount Tambora eruption, an 1816 famine in Ireland{{dubious|date=January 2017}} triggered a [[Year Without a Summer#Effects|typhus epidemic]] in Ireland that spread to much of Europe, and the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] was associated with major localized epidemics of cholera, malaria, smallpox, and dysentery.&lt;ref name="IPPNWStudy"/&gt;{{better source|date=January 2017}} Similarly, the vast and crowded megacities of the developing world could see major outbreaks of infectious disease as a secondary result of famine.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

However, as reported in a paper published in the journal ''Public Health Reports'', it is one of a number of prevalent myths that infectious diseases always occur after a disaster in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2496928 | pmid=18828410 | volume=123 | issue=5 | title=Disaster mythology and fact: Hurricane Katrina and social attachment | author=Jacob B, Mawson AR, Payton M, Guignard JC | journal=Public Health Rep | pages=555–66| year=2008 | doi=10.1177/003335490812300505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publichealthreports.org/issueopen.cfm?articleID=2091&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|[[Epidemic]]s seldom occur after a disaster, and dead bodies do not lead to catastrophic outbreaks of [[infectious disease]]s. Intuitively, epidemic diseases, illnesses, and injuries might be expected following major disasters. However, as noted by de Goyet, epidemics seldom occur after disasters, and unless deaths are caused by one of a small number of infectious diseases such as smallpox, typhus, or plague, exposure to dead bodies does not cause disease ... [[Cholera]] and [[typhoid]] seldom pose a major health threat after disasters unless they are already endemic.}}

'''Olimpia Fulvia Morata''' (1526 – 26 October 1555) was an [[Italy|Italian]] classical scholar. She was born in [[Ferrara]] to [[Fulvio Pellegrino Morato]] and a certain Lucrezia (possibly Gozi).

Her father, who had been tutor to the young princes of the ducal house of Este, was on intimate terms with the most learned men of Italy, and the daughter grew up in an atmosphere of classical learning. At the age of twelve she was able to converse fluently in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]].

About this time she was summoned to the palace as companion and instructor of the younger but equally gifted [[Anna d'Este]], daughter of [[Renée, duchess of Ferrara|Renata, duchess of Ferrara]]. Many people with literary fame or [[Protestant]] leanings, like [[John Calvin]], [[Vittoria Colonna]] and [[Clément Marot]] visited the court of the duchess. In her teens Olympia lectured on [[Cicero]] and Calvin's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robin, Larsen and Levin | page=269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1546 she left court to take care of her ailing father and, after his death, she took care of the education of her brothers and sisters. Olympia's father died a convert to [[Protestantism]], and Olympia embraced the doctrines of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and Calvin. When she returned to court, Anna d'Este's marriage to [[Francis, Duke of Guise]] left Olympia isolated. She spent her time studying philosophy and corresponded with [[Gasparo Sardi]], who dedicated his ''De Triplici Philosophia'' to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robin, Larsen and Levin | page=269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the end of 1550, she married a young student of medicine and philosophy, Andreas Grundler of [[Schweinfurt]] in [[Bavaria]]. In 1554 she accompanied Grundler to his place of birth, where he had been appointed physician to the garrison of Spanish troops. In 1553 the margrave [[Albert of Brandenburg]] on one of his plundering expeditions took possession of [[Schweinfurt]], and was in turn besieged by the Protestants. At length Albert evacuated the place, and Olympia and her husband made their escape. In the course of these events many of her writings were lost.

They finally succeeded in reaching [[Heidelberg]] in 1554 where a medical lectureship had been obtained for Grundler through the influence of the Erbach family, by whom they had been hospitably entertained during their flight.

In 1558, after her death, a major collection of some of her Greek letters and Latin dialogues was published in [[Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robin, Larsen and Levin | page=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a labour which she entrusted to her friend and correspondent [[Celio Secondo Curione|Caelius Secundus Curio]].&lt;ref&gt;T.

[[File:Portrait-of-Henry-Danvers-Earl-of-Danby.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Henry Danvers, Earl of Danby]], was outlawed in 1597 by a coroner's court for the murder of Henry Long. He went to France and joined the French army; two years later he was pardoned by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and returned to England.]]

In [[legal history|historical legal systems]], an '''outlaw''' is declared as outside the protection of the [[law]]. In pre-modern societies, the criminal is withdrawn all legal protection, so that anyone is legally empowered to [[persecute]] or kill them. Outlawry was thus one of the harshest penalties in the legal system. In [[early Germanic law]], the [[death penalty]] is conspicuously absent, and outlawing is the most extreme punishment, presumably amounting to a death sentence in practice. The concept is known from [[Roman law]], as the status of ''[[homo sacer]]'', and persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

In the [[common law]] of England, a "Writ of Outlawry" made the pronouncement ''[[Caput lupinum]]'' ("Let his be a wolf's head", literally "May he bear a wolfish head") with respect to its subject, using "head" [[Synecdoche|to refer to the entire]] person (cf. "per capita") and equating that person with a wolf ([[warg]]) in the eyes of the law: not only was the subject deprived of all legal rights of the law being outside the "law", but others could kill him on sight as if he were a wolf or other wild animal.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Women were declared "waived" rather than outlawed but it was effectively the same punishment.&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012&gt;{{cite web|author=National Archives staff |date=26 January 2012 |title=The outlaw in medieval and early modern England|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/outlawry.htm |publisher= British [[National Archives]]|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal history==

===Ancient Rome===
Among other forms of [[exile]], [[Roman law]] included the penalty of ''interdicere aquae et ignis'' ("to forbid water and fire"). People so penalized were required to leave Roman territory and forfeit their property. If they returned, they were effectively outlaws; providing them the use of fire or water was illegal, and they could be killed at will without legal penalty.{{sfn|Berger|p=507}}

''Interdicere aquae et ignis'' was traditionally imposed by the [[tribune of the plebs]], and is attested to have been in use during the [[First Punic War]] of the third century BC by [[Cato the Elder]].{{sfn|Kelly|2006|p=28}} It was later also applied by many other officials, such as the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], magistrates,{{sfn|Berger|p=507}} and [[Julius Caesar]] as a [[general]] and provincial governor during the [[Gallic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, Julius. ''De Bello Gallico'', book VI, section XLIV.&lt;/ref&gt; It fell out of use during the [[Principate|early Empire]].{{sfn|Berger|p=507}}

Also see: [[Homo sacer]].

===England===
[[File:Robin Hood Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of [[Robin Hood]], a heroic outlaw in English folklore]]
{{see also|Outlawries Bill}}
In [[English law|English]] [[common law]], an outlaw was{{when?|date=July 2018}} a person who had defied the laws of the realm, by such acts as ignoring a [[summons]] to court, or fleeing instead of appearing to plead when charged with a [[crime]].&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012/&gt;

====Criminal====
The term ''outlawry ''referred to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e. putting him outside the sphere of legal protection.&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012/&gt; In the [[common law]] of England, a judgment of (criminal) outlawry was one of the harshest penalties in the legal system, since the outlaw could not use the legal system for protection, e.g. from [[mob justice]].  To be declared an outlaw was to suffer a form of [[civil death|civil]] or [[social death|social]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zygmunt |last=Bauman |year=n.d. |title=Modernity and Holocaust |page={{page needed|date=July 2012}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; death.  The outlaw was debarred from all civilized society. No one was allowed to give him food, shelter, or any other sort of support – to do so was to commit the crime of [[aiding and abetting]], and to be in danger of the ban oneself. A more recent concept of "[[Wanted poster#Dead or alive|wanted dead or alive]]" is similar, but implies that a trial is desired (namely if the wanted person is returned alive), whereas outlawry precludes a trial.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

An outlaw might be killed with impunity; and it was not only lawful but meritorious to kill a thief fleeing from justice — to do so was not [[Murder in English law|murder]]. A man who slew a thief was expected to declare the fact without delay, otherwise the dead man’s kindred might [[Compurgation|clear his name by their oath]] and require the slayer to pay weregild as for a true man.{{sfn|Pollock|Maitland|1968|p=53}}

By the rules of common law, a criminal outlaw did not need to be guilty of the crime for which he was an outlaw.  If a man was accused of a treason or [[felony]] but failed to appear in court to defend himself, he was deemed to be convicted of the said offence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'' (30th ed., 1938) page 71&lt;/ref&gt; If he was accused of a [[misdemeanour]], then he was guilty of a serious contempt of court which was itself a capital crime.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the context of [[criminal law]], outlawry faded out, not so much by legal changes as by the greater population density of the country, which made it harder for wanted fugitives to evade capture; and by the adoption of international [[extradition]] pacts.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} It was obsolete by the time the offence was abolished in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Archbold'' (30th ed., 1938) page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Archbold'' (31st ed., 1943) page 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1938, section 12&lt;/ref&gt;. Outlawry was, however, a living practice as of 1855: in 1841, a William John Bankes, formerly a MP on several times 1810...1835, was outlawed by due process of law for absenting himself from trial for indecent exposure, and died in 1855 in Venice as an outlaw.

====Civil====
There was also a doctrine of civil outlawry.  Civil outlawry did not carry the sentence of capital punishment.  It was however imposed on defendants who fled or evaded justice when sued for civil actions like debts or torts.  The punishments for civil outlawry were nevertheless harsh, including confiscation of chattels (movable property) left behind by the outlaw.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', Book 3, Chapter XIX "Of Process"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the civil context, outlawry became obsolescent in [[civil procedure]] by reforms that no longer required summoned [[defendant]]s to appear and plead.  Still, the possibility of being declared an outlaw for derelictions of [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] duty continued to exist in English law until 1879 and, in [[Scots law]] until the late 1940s.  Since then, failure to find the defendant and serve process is usually interpreted in favour of the plaintiff, and harsh penalties for mere nonappearance (merely presumed flight to escape justice) no longer apply.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt;

===In other countries===
[[File:Eric the Red.png|thumb|left|[[Erik the Red]] was outlawed by the Icelandic [[Althing]] for three years (so in about 982 he went [[viking]] and explored Greenland).]]
[[File:Ned kelly 1874.jpg|thumb|[[Ned Kelly]], with other members of his gang, were outlawed by the [[Parliament of Victoria|Parliament]] of the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria State|Victoria]] on 1 November 1878]]
Outlawry also existed in other ancient legal codes, such as the ancient [[Norsemen|Norse]] and [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Icelandic legal code]].

In early modern times, the term [[Vogelfrei]] and its cognates came to be used in Germany, the Low Countries and Scandinavia, referring to a person stripped of his civil rights being "free" for the taking like a bird.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt–Wiegand, Ruth (1998). "Vogelfrei". Handwörterbuch der Deutschen Rechtsgeschichte [Dictionary of the History of German Law]. 5: Straftheorie [Penal theory]. Berlin: Schmidt. pp. 930–932. {{ISBN|3-503-00015-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Germany and Slavic countries in 15th–19th centuries groups of outlaws composed from former prisoners, soldiers etc. became an important social phenomenon. They lived from robbery and their activity was often supported by local inhabitants from lower classes (as a form of a social people resistance against oppressive political and economic systems). The best known are [[Juraj Jánošík]] and [[Jakub Surovec]] in Slovakia, [[Oleksa Dovbush]] in Ukraine, [[Rózsa Sándor]] in Hungary, [[Schinderhannes]] and [[Hans Kohlhase]] in Germany etc.

The concept of outlawry was reintroduced to British law by several Australian colonial governments in the late 19th century to deal with the menace of [[bushranging]]. The [[Felons Apprehension Act (1865)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/1865-2a.pdf | author=New South Wales government website | title = Text of the Felons Apprehension Act (1865) |accessdate= 4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[New South Wales]] provided that a judge could, upon proof of sufficiently notorious conduct, issue a special [[bench warrant]] requiring a person to submit themselves to police custody before a given date, or be declared an outlaw. An outlawed person could be apprehended "alive or dead" by any of the Queen's subjects, "whether a constable or not", and without "being accountable for using of any deadly weapon in aid of such apprehension." Similar provisions were passed in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anzlhsejournal.auckland.ac.nz/pdfs_2005/Eburn.pdf | author = ANZLH E-Journal | title=
Outlawry in Colonial Australia: The Felons Apprehension Acts 1865-1899  |accessdate= 4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the provisions of the New South Wales Felons Apprehension Act were not exercised after the end of the bushranging era, they remained on the statute book until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anzlhsejournal.auckland.ac.nz/pdfs_2005/Eburn.pdf | author = ANZLH E-Journal | title =

The [[Third Reich]] made extensive use of outlawry in the persecution of Jews or other persons deemed undesirable to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shirer, William L. |year=2011|title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany|pages=233, 439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the government of the [[First Spanish Republic]], unable to reduce the [[cantonalism|Cantonalist]] rebellion centered in [[Cartagena, Spain]], declared the Cartagena fleet  to be "[[piracy|piratic]]", which allowed any nation to prey on it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Taking the opposite road, some outlaws became political leaders, such as [[Ethiopia]]'s Kassa Hailu who became Emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Popular usage==
{{main|Outlaw (stock character)}}
{{further|Social bandits}}
Though the judgment of outlawry is now obsolete (even though it inspired the ''pro forma'' [[Outlawries Bill]] which is still to this day introduced in the [[British House of Commons]] during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]), romanticised outlaws became [[stock character]]s in several fictional settings.  This was particularly so in the United States, where outlaws were popular subjects of newspaper coverage and stories in the 19th century, and 20th century fiction and [[Western movie]]s.  Thus, "outlaw" is still commonly used to mean those violating the law&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary at 1255 (4th ed. 1951), citing ''Oliveros v. Henderson'', 116 S.C. 77, 106 S.E. 855, 859.&lt;/ref&gt; or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to "law-and-order" notions of conformity and authority (such as the "[[outlaw country]]" music movement in the 1970s).

[[Rudolf Steiner]] wrote four plays that follow the initiation journeys of a group of fictional characters through a [[reincarnation|series of lives]]. These plays were intended to be modern [[mystery play]]s. Steiner outlined the plot of a fifth play to be set at the [[Castalian Spring|Castalian spring]] at [[Delphi]], but due to the outbreak of [[First World War]], this remained an unfulfilled project.&lt;ref&gt;Hammacher (1995), p 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The titles of the completed plays are:
*''The Portal of Initiation'' - World premiere on 15 August 1910, at the [[Schauspielhaus]] in [[Munich, Germany|Munich]].
*''The Trial of the Soul'' - World premiere on 17 August 1911, in the Gardener's Place Theatre in Munich.
*''The Guardian of the Threshold'' - World premiere on 24 August 1912, in the Gardener's Place Theatre in Munich.
*''The Soul's Awakening'' - World premiere on 22 August 1913, at the National Theatre in Munich.

==Genesis of the characters==
In these four plays. Steiner intended to show how spiritual development might manifest in a karmically-intertwined group of people. The experiences of the main characters of the play, particularly Johannes Thomasius, Capesius and Strader, represent aspects of the path of [[initiation]] "differing according to the karma of the respective individualities."&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Von der Initiation. Von Ewigkeit und Augenblick. Von Geisteslicht und Lebensdunkel.'' (GA 138), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner based the first play on Goethe's "[[The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily|Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]]".  In his first draft of the play, the names of the characters were those of the characters in Goethe's tale, but in the course of his work, he replaced the fairytale characters with characters of his own imagination.  The following table shows the names from Goethe's fairy tale and the characters these turned into in this first drama:

The characters of Helena and [[Lucifer]] have no precedent in Goethe's fairy tale and were to be played by the same actress.

===Historical antecedents===
In 1907, at the Munich Theosophical Congress, Rudolf Steiner had directed a play by [[Édouard Schuré]], "The Sacred Drama of Eleusis".  Two years later, Steiner staged Schuré's "The Children of Lucifer". At this time, Steiner was looking for a spiritual content and artistic form that could reflect what he believed to be a new age in human consciousness.  

==Reincarnation and karma==
For the first time in dramatic poetry, Rudolf Steiner in his dramas presents the driving forces of destiny events, openly and consistently on the stage.  The success of the characterizing people towards the inevitability of fate, has always been the main nerve of tragic poetry, and Steiner's characters also remain true to these causes, which are ultimately enigmatic. Rudolf Steiner was the background of the fate complications to their true causes, namely karmic entanglements in former lives on earth, returning and brought dramatically to display in the present for the characters on stage.  This is a critical and necessary impetus for the progress of dramatic art, even if it may take long time until it is taken up more widely by the public.

'''Scientism''' is an [[ideology]] that promotes [[science]] as the purportedly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] means by which society should determine [[normative]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] values. The term ''scientism'' is generally used critically, pointing to the cosmetic application of science in unwarranted situations not amenable to application of the [[scientific method]] or similar scientific standards.  

In [[philosophy of science]], the term ''scientism'' frequently implies a critique of the more extreme expressions of [[logical positivism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rey | first= Abel | title = Review of ''La Philosophie Moderne'' | journal = The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods |volume = 6.2 |date = 1909 | pages = 51–3 | doi= 10.2307/2011609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Abraham | last = Maslow | quote = There are criticisms of orthodox, 19th Century scientism and I intend to continue with this enterprise | title = Toward a Psychology of Being | chapter = Preface | edition = 1st|year=1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by social scientists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hayek | title = The Counter Revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason | publisher = Liberty Fund | date = June 1, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers of science such as [[Karl Popper]],&lt;ref name = Popper-Hacohen&gt;{{cite book |last = Hacohen|first = Malachi Haim| title = Karl Popper: the formative years, 1902–1945: politics and philosophy in interwar Vienna | date = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-89055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref name= Putnam&gt;{{cite book| last= Putnam| first= Hilary | title = Renewing Philosophy |date= 1992|publisher= Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge, MA|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tzvetan Todorov]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov, Tzvetan]]. ''The Imperfect Garden: the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2001. Pg. 20. "Scientism does not eliminate the will but decides that since the results of science are valid for everyone, this will must be something shared, not individual. In practice, the individual must submit to the collectivity, which "knows" better than he does."&lt;/ref&gt; to describe (for example) the dogmatic endorsement of scientific methodology and the reduction of all knowledge to only that which is measured or confirmatory.&lt;ref name=Outhwaite22&gt;{{Citation | last = Outhwaite | first = William | origyear = 1988 | title = Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers | publisher = Polity Press | edition = 2nd | date = 2009 | page = 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, scientism is often interpreted as science applied "in excess". The term ''scientism'' has two senses:

# The improper usage of [[science]] or scientific claims.{{Sfn | Peterson | 2003 | p = 753 | ps =: 'the best way to understand the charge of scientism is as a kind of logical fallacy involving improper usage of science or scientific claims'}}  This usage applies equally in contexts where science might not apply,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = Denver | url = http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/scientism_este.html | title = Scientism | first = Martin | last = Ryder | publisher = University of Colorado | accessdate = July 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630205732/http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/scientism_este.html|archivedate=2012-06-30|deadurl=yes|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as when the topic is perceived as beyond the scope of [[Scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and in contexts where there is insufficient [[empirical evidence]] to justify a scientific conclusion. It includes an excessive deference to the claims of scientists or an uncritical eagerness to accept any result described as scientific. This can be a [[counterargument]] to [[argument from authority|appeals to scientific authority]]. It can also address the attempt to apply "hard science" methodology and claims of certainty to the [[social science]]s, which Friedrich Hayek described in ''[[The Counter-Revolution of Science]]'' (1952) as being impossible, because that methodology involves attempting to eliminate the "human factor", while social sciences (including his own field of [[economics]]) center almost purely on [[praxeology|human action]].

W. Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-34411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also sometimes used to describe universal applicability of the scientific method and approach, and the view that [[empirical science]] constitutes the most authoritative [[worldview]] or the most valuable part of human learning—to the complete exclusion of other viewpoints, such as historical, philosophical, economic or cultural worldviews. It has been defined as "the view that the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and, in particular, that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society".&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock &amp; Stephen Trombley (Eds), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought,'' London: Harper Collins, 1999, p.775&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''scientism'' is also used by historians, philosophers, and cultural critics to highlight the possible dangers of lapses towards excessive [[reductionism]] in all fields of human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Collins | title = A Critical Analysis of Competency-based Systems in Adult Education | journal = Adult Education Quarterly | date = March 20, 1983 | volume = 33 | number = 3 | pages = 174–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Irwin | last = Chargaff | title = In Dispraise of Reductionism | journal = BioScience | volume = 47 | number = 11 |date= Dec 1997 | pages = 795–7 | doi= 10.2307/1313101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = R Keith | last = Sawyer | title = Connecting Culture, Psychology and Biology: Essay Review on Inghilleri's From Subjective Experience to Cultural Change | journal = Human Development | volume = 43 | date =  2000 | pages = 56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Republic"&gt;{{cite web|last= Wieseltier|first= Leon|title= Crimes Against Humanities|url= https://newrepublic.com/article/114548/leon-wieseltier-responds-steven-pinkers-scientism|accessdate= 21 December 2013|date=4 September 2013|quote= His essay, a defense of "scientism," is a long exercise in assimilating humanistic inquiries into scientific ones.

For [[social theorist]]s in the tradition of [[Max Weber]], such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Max Horkheimer]], the concept of scientism relates significantly to the philosophy of [[positivism]], but also to the cultural [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] for modern [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=Outhwaite22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brunkhorst|first= Hauke|title= On Max Horkheimer: New Perspectives|date= 1995|publisher= The MIT Press|isbn= 0262522071|pages= 74|editor= Seyla Benhabib|editor2= Wolfgang Bonss|editor3= John McCole|chapter= Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British novelist [[Sara Maitland]] has called scientism a "myth as pernicious as any sort of [[fundamentalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

Reviewing the references to scientism in the works of contemporary scholars, Gregory R. Peterson&lt;ref name="Peterson2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Gregory R.|title=Demarcation and the Scientistic Fallacy |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science |date=2003|volume=38|issue=4|pages=751–761|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2003.00536.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; detects two main broad themes:
# It is used to criticize a totalizing view of science as if it were capable of describing ''all'' [[reality]] and [[knowledge]], or as if it were the ''only'' true way to acquire knowledge about reality and the nature of things;
# It is used, often pejoratively,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The term scientism is ordinarily used with pejorative intent. | first = Donald R | last = Peterson | title = Science, Scientism, and Professional Responsibility | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 196–210 |date=June 2004 | doi=10.1093/clipsy.bph072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The term 'scientism' is sometimes used in a pejorative sense | first = C | last = Hakfoort | title = Science deified: Wilhelm Osstwald's energeticist world-view and the history of scientism | journal = Annals of Science | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | date = 1992 | pages = 525–44 | doi=10.1080/00033799200200441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Scientism... a term of abuse since [[Friedrich Hayek]] first popularized it in the 1940s. | first = Robert C | last = Bannister | title = Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880–1940 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | date = 1991 | page = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  to denote a border-crossing violation in which the theories and methods of one (scientific) discipline are inappropriately applied to another (scientific or non-scientific) discipline and its domain. An example of this second usage is to label as scientism any attempt to claim science as the only or primary source of human values (a traditional domain of [[ethics]]) or as the source of [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] and purpose (a traditional domain of [[religion]] and related [[worldviews]]).

The term ''scientism'' was popularized by the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] winner [[F.A. Hayek]], who defined it as the "slavish imitation of the method and language of Science".&lt;ref name="Hayek1942"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hayek |first=F. A. v. |date=1942 |title=Scientism and the Study of Society. Part I |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2549540 |journal=Economica |volume=9 |issue=35 |pages=267–291 |doi=10.2307/2549540}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper defines scientism as "the aping of what is widely mistaken for the method of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/objectiveknowled00popp |title=Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach |last=Popper |first=Karl R. |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press |edition=Revised |lccn=79318586 |ol=OL4489088M|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mikael Stenmark]] proposes the expression ''scientific expansionism'' as a synonym of scientism.&lt;ref name="expansionism"&gt;{{Citation | first = Mikael | last = Stenmark | contribution = Scientism | editor-first = J Wentzel Vrede | editor-last = van Huyssteen | title = Encyclopedia of science and religion | edition = 2nd | publisher = Thomson Gale | date = 2003 | page = 783}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Encyclopedia of science and religion'', he writes that, while the [[doctrine]]s that are described as scientism have many possible forms and varying degrees of ambition, they share the idea that the boundaries of science (that is, typically the natural sciences) could and should be expanded so that something that has not been previously considered as a subject pertinent to science can now be understood as part of science (usually with science becoming the sole or the main arbiter regarding this area or dimension).&lt;ref name="expansionism" /&gt;

According to Stenmark, the strongest form of scientism states that science has no boundaries and that all human problems and all aspects of human endeavor, with due time, will be dealt with and solved by science alone.&lt;ref name ="expansionism"/&gt; This idea has also been called the [[Myth of Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = G | last1 = Monastra | first2 = MM | last2 = Zarandi | title = Science and the Myth of Progress | date = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. F. Schumacher]], in his ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'', criticized scientism as an impoverished world view confined solely to what can be counted, measured and weighed. "The architects of the modern worldview, notably [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]], assumed that those things that could be weighed, measured, and counted were more true than those that could not be quantified. If it couldn't be counted, in other words, it didn't count."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.schumachersociety.org/publications/orr_92.html | first = David | last = Orr | contribution = Environmental Literacy: Education as if the Earth Mattered | title = Twelfth Annual EF Schumacher Lectures |date=October 1992 | place = Great Barrington, [[Massachusetts|MA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual historian [[T.J. Jackson Lears]] argues there has been a recent reemergence of "nineteenth-century positivist faith that a reified 'science' has discovered (or is about to discover) all the important truths about human life. Precise measurement and rigorous calculation, in this view, are the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies." Lears specifically identifies Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]]'s work as falling in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lears|first=T.J. Jackson|title=Get Happy!!|date= 6 November 2013|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/177016/get-happy?page=full#|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers [[John N. Gray]] and [[Thomas Nagel]] have leveled similar criticisms against popular works by moral psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]], neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and writer [[Malcolm Gladwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=John|title=The Knowns and the Unknowns|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/102760/righteous-mind-haidt-morality-politics-scientism|publisher=The New Republic|date= 20 April 2012|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=These theories show the continuing appeal of scientism—the modern belief that scientific inquiry can enable us to resolve conflicts and dilemmas in contexts where traditional sources of wisdom and practical knowledge seem to have failed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=John|title=Malcolm Gladwell Is America's Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/115467/malcolm-gladwells-david-and-goliath-fairy-tales|publisher=The New Republic|date= 22 November 2013|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=... the mix of moralism and scientism is an ever-winning formula, as Gladwell's career demonstrates.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=Thomas|title=The Facts Fetish|date= 20 October 2010|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/78546/the-facts-fetish-morality-science|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=Harris urges that we use scientific knowledge about humans to discover what will maximize their well-being, and thereby to discover the right way to live. This is an instrumental use of science, starting out from his basic moral premise.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic biologist Austin L. Hughes wrote in conservative journal ''[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]'' that scientism has much in common with superstition: "the stubborn insistence that something...has powers which no evidence supports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Austin| last = Hughes| title = The Folly of Scientism | journal = The New Atlantis | date = Fall 2012 | volume = 37 | pages = 32–50 | url = https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-folly-of-scientism | access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to debates about science and religion==
Several scholars use the term to describe the work of vocal critics of religion-as-such. Individuals associated with [[New Atheism]] have garnered this label from both religious and non-religious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Robinson | first = Marilynne | title = Hysterical Scientism: The Ecstasy of Richard Dawkins | newspaper = Harper's Magazine |date=Nov 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Stephen LeDrew on his 'The Evolution of Atheism' an Interview | url = http://positivists.org/blog/archives/5325 |date= 10 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[John Haught]] argues that [[Daniel Dennett]] and other new atheists subscribe to a belief system of [[scientific naturalism]], which holds the central dogma that "only nature, including humans and our creations, is real: that God does not exist; and that science alone can give us complete and reliable knowledge of reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=John|title=God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haught argues that this belief system is self-refuting since it requires its adherents to assent to beliefs that violate its own stated requirements for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=John|title=God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Philosopher Peter Williams argues that it is only by conflating science with scientism that new atheists feel qualified to "pontificate on metaphysical issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Peter S.|title=C.S. Lewis vs. the New Atheists|date=2013|publisher=Paternoster|page=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] responded to religious criticism of his book ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'' by saying that accusations of scientism "[are] an all-purpose, wild-card smear... When someone puts forward a scientific theory that [religious critics] really don't like, they just try to discredit it as 'scientism'. But when it comes to [[facts]], and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | first = Sholto | last = Byrnes | title = When it comes to facts, and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town | newspaper = New Statesman | date = 10 April 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016131703/http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | archive-date = 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-religious scholars have also linked New Atheist thought with scientism. Atheist philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] argues that neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] conflates all empirical knowledge with that of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=Thomas|title=The Facts Fetish|date= 20 October 2010|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/78546/the-facts-fetish-morality-science|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=He says that the discovery of moral truth depends on science, but this turns out to be misleading, because he includes under "science" all empirical knowledge of what the world is like...Harris urges that we use scientific knowledge about humans to discover what will maximize their well-being, and thereby to discover the right way to live.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] argues that [[Christopher Hitchens]] possesses an "old-fashioned scientistic notion of what counts as evidence" that reduces knowledge to what can and cannot be proven by scientific procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|title=Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnostic philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] has also criticized New Atheist philosopher [[Alexander Rosenberg]]'s ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality'' for resurrecting a self-refuting [[epistemology]] of [[logical positivism]] and reducing all knowledge of the universe to the discipline of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Anthony|title=True Believers|journal=Times Literary Supplement|date=June 2012|quote=The main tenets of this philosophy are bracingly summed up in a series of questions and answers: Is there a God? No. What is the nature of reality? What physics says it is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], draws a parallel between scientism and traditional religious movements, pointing to the [[cult of personality]] that develops around some scientists in the public eye. He defines scientism as a worldview that encompasses natural explanations, eschews [[supernatural]] and [[paranormal]] speculations, and embraces empiricism and [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shermer | first = Michael | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000AA74F-FF5F-1CDB-B4A8809EC588EEDF | title = The Shamans of Scientism | journal = [[Scientific American]] |date=June 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian scholar [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] has stated that in the [[Western world]], many will accept the [[ideology]] of modern science, not as "simple ordinary science", but as a replacement for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chittick | first = William | title = The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr | publisher = World Wisdom | location = Bloomington | date = 2007 | isbn = 1-933316-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory R. Peterson writes that "for many theologians and philosophers, scientism is among the greatest of intellectual sins".&lt;ref name="Peterson2003"/&gt;

==Philosophy of science==
{{main article|Philosophy of science}}
In his essay ''Against Method'', [[Paul Feyerabend]] characterizes science as "an essentially anarchic enterprise"{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | p = vii | ps =: '[[Imre Lakatos]] loved to embarrass serious opponents with jokes and irony and so I, too, occasionally wrote in a rather ironical vein. An example is the end of Chapter 1: 'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I hold... but the terrified exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history'}} and argues emphatically that science merits no exclusive monopoly over "dealing in knowledge" and that scientists have never operated within a distinct and narrowly self-defined tradition. He depicts the process of contemporary scientific education as a mild form of indoctrination, aimed at "making the history of science duller, simpler, more uniform, more 'objective' and more easily accessible to treatment by strict and unchanging rules."{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=8y-FVtrKeSYC&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=PA11  viii, 9, 11]}}

==Rhetoric of science==
{{main article|Rhetoric of science}}
Thomas M. Lessl argues that religious themes persist in what he calls scientism, the [[public rhetoric]] of science.&lt;ref name="Lessl1996"/&gt; There are two methodologies that illustrate this idea of scientism. One is the epistemological approach, the assumption that the scientific method trumps other ways of knowing and the ontological approach, that the rational mind reflects the world and both operate in knowable ways. According to Lessl, the ontological approach is an attempt to "resolve the conflict between rationalism and skepticism". Lessl also argues that without scientism, there would not be a scientific culture.&lt;ref name="Lessl1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessl|first=Thomas M.|title=Naturalizing science: Two episodes in the evolution of a rhetoric of scientism|journal=Western Journal of Communication|date=Fall 1996|volume=60|issue=4|page=1|doi=10.1080/10570319609374555}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3/5/2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and philosophy==
Philosopher of religion [[Keith Ward]] has said scientism is philosophically inconsistent or even [[self-refuting]], as the truth of the statements "no statements are true unless they can be proven scientifically (or logically)" or "no statements are true unless they can be shown empirically to be true" cannot themselves be proven scientifically, logically, or empirically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Keith | last = Ward | author-link = Keith Ward | title = [[Is Religion Dangerous?]]|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=William P |last=Alston |chapter=Religious language and verificationism |editor-first=Paul K |editor-last=Moser |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Copan |title= The Rationality of Theism |location= New York |publisher= Routledge |date= 2003 |isbn= 0-415-26332-8 |pages= 26–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationalization and modernity==
{{Main article|Rationalization (sociology)}}
In the introduction to his collected oeuvre on the [[sociology of religion]], [[Max Weber]] asks why "the scientific, the artistic, the political, or the economic development [elsewhere]… did not enter upon that path of rationalization which is peculiar to the Occident?" According to the distinguished German social theorist, [[Jürgen Habermas]], "For Weber, the intrinsic (that is, not merely [[contingent]]) relationship between [[modernity]] and what he called 'Occidental rationalism' was still self-evident." Weber described a process of rationalisation, [[disenchantment]] and the "disintegration of religious world views"  that resulted in modern [[secularisation|secular]] societies and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Habermas1990"&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1990), ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'', Polity Press, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|"Modernization" was introduced as a technical term only in the 1950s. It is the mark of a theoretical approach that takes up Weber's problem but elaborates it with the tools of social-scientific [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]]… The theory of modernization performs two abstractions on Weber's concept of "modernity". It dissociates "modernity" from its modern European origins and stylizes it into a spatio-temporally neutral model for processes of social development in general. Furthermore, it breaks the internal connections between modernity and the historical context of Western [[rationalism]], so that processes of modernization… [are] no longer burdened with the idea of a completion of modernity, that is to say, of a goal state after which "[[postmodern]]" developments would have to set in.  …Indeed it is precisely modernization research that has contributed to the currency of the expression "postmodern" even among social scientists.||author=[[Jürgen Habermas]]|title=''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]''}}

Habermas is critical of pure [[instrumental rationality]], arguing that the "Social Life–World" is better suited to literary expression, the former being "intersubjectively accessible experiences" that can be generalized in a [[formal language]], while the latter "must generate an intersubjectivity of mutual understanding in each concrete case":&lt;ref name="Olson2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Olson |date=2008 |title=Science and scientism in nineteenth-century Europe |publisher= University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-07433-2 |lccn= 2007005146 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h8C7fe50J0AC&amp;pg=PA1 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J |last = Habermas |first2=JJ |last2=Shapiro |date=1971 |title=Toward a rational society: student protest, science, and politics | format = paperback |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-4177-2 |lccn= 73121827 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cW7PmVj7kzQC&amp;pg=PA50 |pages= 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Sinai bus crash''' was a bus accident in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in August 2006 which left twelve [[Israel]]i tourists dead. The tourists, who were [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]], were riding a chartered bus as part of a convoy of eight buses carrying Arab tourists. The bus  overturned and landed upside down between [[Nuweiba]] and [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]]. The survivors claimed the driver intentionally crashed the bus and the incident was a [[terrorist attack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3294430,00.html Sinai bus crash]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Israel sent 40 ambulances from [[Magen David Adom]] with emergency crews to assist the casualties, but Egyptian security forces at the [[Taba Border Crossing]] held them up, while Egyptian rescue forces only arrived after an hour, with European tourists helping to rescue the wounded. The Egyptians evacuated the passengers who sustained severe injuries to hospitals in [[Nuweiba]] and [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], while those who sustained lighter injuries were taken to the Taba border terminal and received by Magen David Adom personnel at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3294430,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian authorities delayed the passage of victims who wanted to cross into Israel via Taba, and made it difficult for those being treated in Egyptian hospitals to transfer to Israel for treatment. The delay in medical attention is blamed for at least one death. Those hospitalized in Egypt also alleged poor treatment in Egyptian hospitals. [[Israeli Air Force]] helicopters later airlifted some of the victims being treated in Egypt to Israeli hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3294616,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3294523,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the attack, the Eilat Police set up an emergency command post in the city, where some of the injured were evacuated to for treatment, a team from the Israeli Embassy in [[Cairo]] visited the site, and the Israeli Interior Ministry issued a temporary order allowing all Israelis in the Sinai to return to Israel even without a passport.

The Egyptian driver was convicted of negligence by an Egyptian court and sentenced to one year in prison. Egyptian authorities were accused of deliberately handing down a lenient sentence and treating the victims' families in a deplorable way. The mayor of the [[local council (Israel)|local council]] of Kafr Manda, where three of the dead came from, said Egypt treated them badly because they were Israeli citizens.

Based on evidence amassed since the crash, the survivors maintain that the attack was premeditated. They believe that the initial plan was to kill Jews, but that the terrorist cell decided not to abort the plan even when they discovered that the passengers were Arabs.

According to one of the survivors, a newlywed whose wife was killed in the crash, "The entire ride the driver was very nervous. The driver said to us: you got Jewish education, you are the trash of the Jews and that we are traitors. When we asked him to turn on the air conditioning, he refused, saying 'soon you will all be very cold'. After the bus overturned, he walked out, stepped into a car that was waiting for him, and disappeared."

The victims submitted compensation claims to Israel’s Terror Victim Fund on the basis of these charges, but they claimed that for political convenience, the two governments classified the tragedy as an accident, a ruling disputed legally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3303434,00.html Israeli Arabs against Mubarak: Learn from Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albi (2012.08) 02.jpg|thumb|[[Albi Cathedral]]]]
'''Southern French Gothic''' ({{lang-fr|gothique méridional}}) is a specific style of [[Gothic architecture]] developed in the south of France. It arose in the early 13th century following the victory of the [[Catholic church]] over the [[Cathar heresy|Cathars]], as the church sought to re-establish its authority in the region, and as a result church buildings typically present features drawn from military architecture.  Southern French Gothic is simpler and less ornate than [[French Gothic architecture|northern French Gothic]], and differs also in that the construction material is typically brick rather than stone. In time the style came to influence secular buildings as well as churches, and spread beyond the area where Catharism had flourished.

== Origins ==
During the rise of [[Cathar heresy|Catharism]], the luxury of Roman Catholic Church was constantly criticized by the Cathar ecclesiastics. After the political eradication of the Cathar aristocracy during the [[Albigensian crusade]] (1209-1229), the clergy of southern France understood that after having won the war, it was necessary for them to win back the minds of the population. In addition to setting up the [[Medieval Inquisition]], they adopted a more austere and uncluttered architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;fr:La cathédrale Sainte-Cécile, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical area ==
Southern French Gothic, as its name suggests, is found in the southern part of France, mainly in the regions where [[Catharism]] had developed, and which were subjected to religious and military repression from the North. The reconquest by the Catholic hierarchy gave rise to the construction or reconstruction of many religious buildings, but also of secular ones. The regions concerned are therefore the current départements of the Haute-Garonne ([[Toulouse]]), the Tarn ([[Albi]]), the Tarn-et-Garonne ([[Montauban]]), the Ariège, the Gers, the Aude, the Pyrénées-Orientales, the Hérault, with instances in neighboring départements as well.

== Characteristics == 
Southern French Gothic is characterized by the austerity of the constructions, such as the use of solid [[buttresses]] rather than [[flying buttresses]], while the openings are few and narrow. [[Romanesque architecture]] persisted for longer in the south of France than in the north, and the transition to Gothic was progressive. Many of the buildings in the Southern Gothic style are thus built with a single nave, and are covered by roof-frames resting on diaphragm arches.

=== Brick construction ===

[[Image:ArcMitre.jpg|thumb|180px|Bell Tower of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins of Toulouse]], illustration from the '' Dictionary '' of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]]]]
In an area poor in stone, the typical construction material was brick, whose use in the Southern French Gothic of the regions of Toulouse, Montauban, and Albi became one of its distinguishing marks. The builders used techniques adapted to this material, such as the mitre arches typical of this style. Brick lends itself to geometric decorative compositions, and consequently there are few sculptures integrated into the architecture. Depending on the type of clay used, the bricks can be molded or rounded by abrasion. Some buildings use stone sparingly to create colour contrasts.

Neighbouring regions coming under this influence but dominated by stone construction often adopted the same architectural vocabulary.

=== Single nave ===
After the Cathar episode, one goal of the Catholic church was the recovery of the faithful through preaching (hence the foundation by [[Saint Dominic|Dominique de Guzmán]] of the [[Dominican Order|order of the Friars Preachers]]). To this end the preference was for the single nave, which promotes acoustics and places all the faithful under the gaze of the preacher. The nave is lined with side chapels, lodged between the buttresses, and surmounted by large windows that illuminate it.

However, the presence of a single nave is not necessarily related to this desire, but may be related to other considerationssuch as a single pre-existing nave. Conversely, the very wide nave of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins of Toulouse]] is divided by a row of pillars, but is nevertheless a single entity.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Bell tower ===

The bell towers can be of all types, but two forms stand out: the "Toulouse" bell tower, and the wall belfry.

==== Octagonal "Toulouse" bell tower ====
In the Toulouse region the typical bell tower appeared in the Romanesque period, with an octagonal floor plan and storeys progressively decreasing in size. In the transition to Gothic, only the shape of the bays changed. Bell towers are usually surmounted by a spire, but a certain number of these are missing, either because they have been destroyed, or because the construction was interrupted. The typical example is the bell tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint-Sernin of Toulouse]], enhanced in the Gothic period with mitre arches succeeding the Romanesque arched windows, but there are also ogival bays.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Wall belfry ====
The other form of bell tower, more common in smaller buildings, is the wall belfry, also frequently characterised by mitre arches, and often resembling fortifications in having elements such as battlements and machicolations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Fortification elements ===

Defensive elements such as battlements, machicolations, walkways, and watchtowers are frequent in Southern Gothic churches. Most of the time, except in cases where the church is included in a defensive system, these elements have only a decorative and especially a symbolic role, tending to assert the power of the Church. At the church of Notre-Dame de Simorre, it was the 19th-century architect and conservationist [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] who added battlements and watchtowers to the top of the buttresses.

File:Eglise Saint-Nicolas de Toulouse.jpg|Church of Saint-Nicolas, Toulouse
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Secular buildings ==

The term "Southern French Gothic" is applied mainly to buildings of worship, churches and cathedrals. The same architectural principles of sobriety of construction, absence or limitation of carved decoration, massive appearance, and defensive elements can however be found in buildings used for other purposes. Examples in Toulouse include mansions and the [[Saint-Raymond Museum|Saint-Raymond College]]; in Albi, the [[Musée Toulouse-Lautrec|Berbie Palace]], etc ...

'''Thomas Carlyle''' (4 December 1795{{spaced ndash}}5 February 1881) was a Scottish [[philosopher]], [[satire|satirical]] writer, [[essay]]ist, [[translation|translator]], [[historian]], [[mathematician]], and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Carlyle" (bio), Dumfries-and-Galloway, 2008, webpage:
  [http://www.dumfries-and-galloway.co.uk/people/&lt;!--
  --&gt;carlyle.htm  dumfries-and-galloway.co.uk-carlyle].
&lt;/ref&gt; Considered one of the most important social commentators of his time, he presented many lectures during his lifetime with certain acclaim in the [[Victorian era]]. One of those conferences resulted in his famous work ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History]]'' where he explains that the key role in history lies in the actions of the "[[Great man theory|Great Man]]", claiming that "the history of the world is but the biography of great men".&lt;ref name="On Heroes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlyle|first=Thomas|title=On Heroes, Hero-worship, &amp; the Heroic in History|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Czx0kvu-onIC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22The+history+of+the+world+is+but+the+biography+of+great+men%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20history%20of%20the%20world%20is%20but%20the%20biography%20of%20great%20men%22&amp;f=false|year=1841|page=34|place=New York|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A respected historian, his 1837 book ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' was the inspiration for [[Charles Dickens]]' 1859 novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', and remains popular today. Carlyle's 1836 ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' is a notable philosophical novel.

A great polemicist, Carlyle coined the term "[[the dismal science]]" for economics, in his essay ''[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Carlyle |first=Thomas |year=1849 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000080778727;view=1up;seq=690 |title=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question |magazine=Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country |volume=40 |page=672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote articles for the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;For a complete list of Carlyle's works, see Sheperd, Richard Herne (1881). [https://archive.org/stream/bibliographyofca00shepuoft#page/n5/mode/2up ''The Bibliography of Carlyle.''] London: Elliot Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]]'' (1849) remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Du"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Once a Christian, Carlyle lost his faith while attending the [[University of Edinburgh]], later adopting a form of [[deism]].&lt;ref&gt;"He believed there was a God in heaven, and that God's laws, or God's justice, reigned on earth". – Lang, Timothy (2006). ''The Victorians and the Stuart Heritage: Interpretations of a Discordant Past''. Cambridge University Press, p. 119 {{ISBN|978-0-521-02625-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], he is known for the [[Carlyle circle]],&lt;ref name=DeTemple&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeTemple|first=Duane W.|title=Carlyle circles and Lemoine simplicity of polygon constructions|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=Feb 1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages= 97–208|url= http://apollonius.math.nthu.edu.tw/d1/ne01/jyt/linkjstor/regular/1.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221113614/http://apollonius.math.nthu.edu.tw/d1/ne01/jyt/linkjstor/regular/1.pdf |accessdate=6 November 2011|doi=10.2307/2323939|archivedate=2015-12-21 |deadurl=yes|jstor=2323939}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method used in [[quadratic equation]]s and for developing [[ruler-and-compass constructions]] of [[regular polygons]].

==Early life and influences==
[[File:Thomas Carlyle's birthplace.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Thomas Carlyle, Ecclefechan]]
Carlyle was born in [[Ecclefechan]] in Dumfriesshire.&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; His parents determinedly afforded him an education at [[Annan Academy]], [[Annan, Dumfries and Galloway|Annan]], where he was bullied and tormented so much that he left after three years.&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marshall.thefreelibrary.com/English-Literature-For-Boys-And-Girls/82-1| title=Carlyle – The Sage of Chelsea|work=English Literature For Boys And Girls |publisher=Farlex Free Library|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a member of the [[Burgher (Church history)|Burgher]] secession church.&lt;ref&gt;"Among these humble, stern, earnest religionists of the Burgher phase of Dissent Thomas Carlyle was born." – Sloan, John MacGavin (1904). [https://archive.org/stream/carlylecountrywi00sloauoft#page/n9/mode/2up ''The Carlyle Country, with a Study of Carlyle's Life.''] London: Chapman &amp; Hall, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In early life, his family's (and nation's) strong [[Calvinist]] beliefs powerfully influenced the young man.

After attending the [[University of Edinburgh]], Carlyle became a mathematics teacher,&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; first in Annan and then in [[Kirkcaldy]], where he became close friends with the mystic [[Edward Irving]]. (Confusingly, there is [[Thomas Carlyle (Scottish lawyer)|another Scottish Thomas Carlyle]], born a few years later, connected to Irving via work with the [[Catholic Apostolic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;"As a 'double-goer', perplexing strangers in foreign parts as well as at home, the 'Apostle' was occasionally an innocent, inadvertent nuisance to 'our Tom'." – Wilson, David Alec (1923). [https://archive.org/stream/carlyletillmarri00wilsuoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''Carlyle Till Marriage 1795 to 1826'']. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1819–1821, Carlyle returned to the University of Edinburgh, where he suffered an intense crisis of faith and a conversion, which provided the material for ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' ("The Tailor Retailored"), which first brought him to the public's notice.

Carlyle developed a painful stomach ailment, possibly gastric ulcers,&lt;ref name="LL" /&gt; that remained throughout his life and likely contributed to his reputation as a crotchety, argumentative, somewhat disagreeable personality. His prose style, famously cranky and occasionally savage, helped cement an air of irascibility.&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/thomas-carlyle|title=Who2 Biography: Thomas Carlyle, Writer / Historian|year=2009|publisher=Answers.com|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carlyle's House Ampton Street.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Carlyle's home at 4 (now 33) Ampton Street, London, marked with a [[blue plaque|plaque]] by the [[London County Council]]]]
Carlyle's thinking became heavily influenced by [[German idealism]], in particular the work of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]. He established himself as an expert on [[German literature]] in a series of essays for ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', and by translating German works, notably [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s novel ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship|Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre]]''.&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; He also wrote a ''Life of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'' (1825).&lt;ref name=Du/&gt;

In 1826, Thomas Carlyle married fellow intellectual [[Jane Welsh Carlyle|Jane Baillie Welsh]], whom he had met through Edmund Irving during his period of German studies.&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; In 1827, he applied for the Chair of Moral Philosophy at [[St Andrews University]] but was not appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Nichol, John (1892). [https://archive.org/stream/thomascarlyle00nichuoft#page/n5/mode/2up ''Thomas Carlyle.''] London: Macmillan &amp; Co., p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A residence provided by Jane's estate was a house on [[Craigenputtock]], a farm in Dumfriesshire, Scotland.&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; He often wrote about his life at Craigenputtock – in particular: "It is certain that for living and thinking in I have never since found in the world a place so favourable." Here Carlyle wrote some of his most distinguished essays, and began a lifelong friendship with the American essayist [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref name=Du/&gt;

In 1831, the Carlyles moved to London, settling initially in lodgings at 4 (now 33) Ampton Street, [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]]. In 1834, they moved to 5 (now 24) [[Cheyne Row]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], which has since been [[Carlyle's House|preserved as a museum]] to Carlyle's memory. He became known as the "Sage of Chelsea", and a member of a literary circle which included the essayists [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref name=Du/&gt;

Here Carlyle wrote ''The French Revolution: A History'' (2 volumes, 1837), a historical study concentrating both on the oppression of the poor of France and on the horrors of the mob unleashed. The book was immediately successful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Writings==
===Early writings===
By 1821, Carlyle abandoned the clergy as a career and focused on making a life as a writer. His first fiction was "Cruthers and Jonson", one of several abortive attempts at writing a novel. Following his work on a translation of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'',&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; he came to distrust the form of the realistic novel and so worked on developing a new form of fiction. In addition to his essays on German literature, he branched out into wider ranging commentary on modern culture in his influential essays ''Signs of the Times'' and'' Characteristics''.&lt;ref name="daiches89"&gt;D. Daiches ed., ''Companion to Literature 1'' (London, 1965), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, he laid down his abiding preference for the natural over the artificial: "Thus, as we have an artificial Poetry, and prize only the natural; so likewise we have an artificial Morality, an artificial Wisdom, an artificial Society".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (Oxford, 1971), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, at this time he penned  articles appraising the life and works of various poets and men of letters, including [[Goethe]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Diderot]].

===''Sartor Resartus''===
[[File:Craigenputtock by George Moir.png|thumb|right|[[Craigenputtock|Craigenputtock House]], by George Moir, 1829]]
His first major work, ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' ("The Tailor Retailored") was begun as an article on 'the philosophy of clothes', and surprised him by growing into a full-length book.  He wrote it in 1831 at his home (which his wife Jane provided for him from her estate), [[Craigenputtock]],&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; and was intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. Ironically, it commented on its own formal structure while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where 'truth' is to be found. ''Sartor Resartus'' was first serialised in ''Fraser's Magazine'' from 1833 to 1834.&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; The text presents itself as an unnamed editor's attempt to introduce the British public to Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, a German philosopher of clothes, who is in fact a fictional creation of Carlyle's. The Editor is struck with admiration, but for the most part is confounded by Teufelsdröckh's outlandish philosophy, of which the Editor translates choice selections. To try to make sense of Teufelsdröckh's philosophy, the Editor tries to piece together a biography, but with limited success. Underneath the German philosopher's seemingly ridiculous statements, there are mordant attacks on [[Utilitarianism]] and the commercialisation of British society. The fragmentary biography of Teufelsdröckh that the Editor recovers from a chaotic mass of documents reveals the philosopher's [Carlyle’s] spiritual journey.&lt;ref name="ousby828"&gt;I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 828.&lt;/ref&gt; He develops a contempt for the corrupt condition of modern life. He contemplates the "Everlasting No" of refusal, comes to the "Centre of Indifference", and eventually embraces the "Everlasting Yea".&lt;ref name="ousby828"/&gt; This voyage from denial to disengagement to volition would later be described as part of the [[existentialist]] awakening.

Given the enigmatic nature of ''Sartor Resartus'', it is not surprising that it first achieved little success. Its popularity developed over the next few years, and it was published in book form in Boston 1836, with a preface by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], influencing the development of [[New England Transcendentalism]]. The first English edition followed in 1838.

====Everlasting Yea and No====
[[File:Water-colour Sketch of Thomas Carlyle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Watercolor sketch of Thomas Carlyle, age 46, by Samuel Laurence]]
''The Everlasting Yea'' is Carlyle's name in the book for the spirit of faith in God in an express attitude of clear, resolute, steady, and uncompromising antagonism to the ''Everlasting No'', and the principle that there is no such thing as faith in God except in such antagonism against the spirit opposed to God.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Nuttall Encyclopædia/E|"Everlasting Yea, The."]] In: ''The Nuttall Encyclopædia,'' Edited by the Reverend James Wood, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Everlasting No'' is Carlyle's name for the spirit of unbelief in God, especially as it manifested itself in his own, or rather ''Teufelsdröckh''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, warfare against it; the spirit, which, as embodied in the [[Mephistopheles]] of [[Goethe]], is forever denying – ''der stets verneint'' – the reality of the divine in the thoughts, the character, and the life of humanity, and has a malicious pleasure in scoffing at everything high and noble as hollow and void.

In ''Sartor Resartus,'' the narrator moves from the "Everlasting No" to the "Everlasting Yea," but only through "The Centre of Indifference," a position of agnosticism and detachment.  Only after reducing desires and certainty, aiming at a [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]]-like "indifference", can the narrator realise affirmation.  In some ways, this is similar to the contemporary philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s "[[leap of faith]]" in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript.''

====Worship of Silence and Sorrow====
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Based on Goethe's having described Christianity as the "Worship of Sorrow", and "our highest religion, for the Son of Man", Carlyle adds, interpreting this, "there is no noble crown, well worn or even ill worn, but is a crown of thorns".

The "Worship of Silence" is Carlyle's name for the sacred respect for restraint in speech till "thought has silently matured itself, … to hold one's tongue till some meaning lie behind to set it wagging," a doctrine which many misunderstand, almost wilfully, it would seem; silence being to him the very womb out of which all great things are born.

===''The French Revolution''===
[[File:Monument to Thomas Carlyle, Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|Monument to Thomas Carlyle, Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow]]
In 1834, Carlyle moved to London from Craigenputtock and began to move among celebrated company.&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; Within the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], Carlyle's success was assured by the publication of his three-volume work ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' in 1837.&lt;ref name=Du/&gt; After the completed manuscript of the first volume was accidentally burned by the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s maid, Carlyle wrote the second and third volumes before rewriting the first from scratch.&lt;ref name="FF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=8890 |title=Thomas Carlyle|last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=20 September 2009|work=Professional Works|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting work had a passion new to historical writing. In a politically charged Europe, filled with fears and hopes of revolution, Carlyle's account of the motivations and urges that inspired the events in France seemed powerfully relevant. Carlyle's style of historical writing stressed the immediacy of action – often using the present tense – and incorporating many different perspectives on the changing events.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Carlyle, chaotic events demanded what he called 'heroes' to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. While not denying the importance of economic and practical explanations for events, he saw these forces as 'spiritual' – the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies ("formulas" or "[[-ism|isms]]", as he called them). In Carlyle's view, only dynamic individuals could master events and direct these spiritual energies effectively: as soon as ideological 'formulas' replaced heroic human action, society became dehumanised.{{citeneeded|date=March 2018}}

[[Charles Dickens]] used Carlyle's work as a secondary source for the events of the French Revolution in his novel ''A Tale of Two Cities''.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, David D. (1976). "The Carlylean Vision of 'Tales of Two Cities'," ''Studies in the Novel'' '''8''' (1), pp. 56–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Heroes and Hero Worship''===
Like the opinions of many deep thinkers of the time, these ideas were influential on the development and rise of both Socialism and Fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, Mark (2004).

Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, p. 223 {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlyle moved towards his later thinking during the 1840s, leading to a break with many old friends and allies, such as Mill and, to a lesser extent, Emerson. His belief in the importance of heroic leadership found form in the book ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History]]'', in which he was seen to compare a wide range of different types of heroes, including [[Odin]], [[Muhammad]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Napoleon]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Dante]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Robert Burns]], [[John Knox]], and [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;Delaura, David J. (1969). "Ishmael as Prophet: Heroes and Hero-Worship and the Self-Expressive Basis of Carlyle's Art," ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language'', Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 705–732.&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures of Carlyle's are regarded as an early and powerful formulation of the [[Great Man theory]].

[[File:Picture of Thomas Carlyle.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Carlyle in 1854]]
The book was based on a course of lectures he had given. ''The French Revolution'' had brought Carlyle fame, but little money. His friends worked to set him on his feet by organising courses of public lectures for him, drumming up an audience and selling [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] tickets. Carlyle did not like lecturing, but found that he could do it, and more importantly that it brought in some much-needed money. Between 1837 and 1840, Carlyle delivered four such courses of lectures. The final course was on "Heroes." From the notes he had prepared for this course, he wrote out his book, reproducing the curious effects of the spoken discourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Heroes and Hero-worship |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Hero as Man of Letters" (1840):
* "In books lies the soul of the whole Past Time; the articulate audible voice of the Past, when the body and material substance of it has altogether vanished like a dream."
* "A man lives by believing something; not by debating and arguing about many things."
* "All that mankind has done, thought, gained or been: it is lying as in magic preservation in the pages of books."
* "What we become depends on what we read after all of the professors have finished with us. The greatest university of all is a collection of books."
* "The suffering man ought really to consume his own smoke; there is no good in emitting smoke till you have made it into fire."
* "Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man; but for one man who can stand prosperity, there are a hundred that will stand adversity." (Often shortened to "can't stand prosperity" as an unknown quote.)
* "Not what I have, but what I do, is my kingdom."

Carlyle was one of the very few philosophers who witnessed the industrial revolution but still kept a non-materialistic view of the world. The book included lectures discussing people ranging from the field of religion through to literature and politics. The figures chosen for each lecture were presented by Carlyle as archetypal examples of individuals who, in their respective fields of endeavor, had dramatically impacted history in some way, for good or ill, and included such figures as [[Dante]] (poet), [[Martin Luther|Luther]] (priest), and [[Napoleon]] (king).&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad]] himself found a place in the book in the lecture titled "The Hero as Prophet". In his work, Carlyle outlined Muhammad as a Hegelian agent of reform, insisting on his sincerity and commenting "how one man single-handedly, could weld warring tribes and wandering Bedouins into a most powerful and civilised nation in less than two decades." His interpretation has been widely cited by Muslim scholars seeking Western support that Muhammad was one of the great men of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=The Lives of Muhammad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oWYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=2014|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-74448-6|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlyle held "That great men should rule and that others should revere them," a view that for him was supported by a complex faith in history and evolutionary progress. Societies, like organisms, evolve throughout history, thrive for a time, but inevitably become weak and die out, giving place to a stronger, superior breed. Heroes are those who affirm this life process, accepting its cruelty as necessary and thus good. For them courage is a more valuable virtue than love; heroes are noblemen, not saints. The hero functions first as a pattern for others to imitate, and second as a creator, moving history forwards not backwards (history being the biography of great men). Carlyle was among the first of his age to recognize that the death of God is in itself nothing to be happy about, unless man steps in and creates new values to replace the old. For Carlyle the hero should become the object of worship, the center of a new religion proclaiming humanity as "the miracle of miracles... the only divinity we can know."&lt;ref name="daiches89"/&gt; For Carlyle's creed Bentley proposes the name Heroic Vitalism, a term embracing both a political theory, Aristocratic Radicalism, and a metaphysic, Supernatural Naturalism. The Heroic Vitalists feared that the recent trends toward democracy would hand over power to the ill-bred, uneducated, and immoral, whereas their belief in a transcendent force in nature directing itself onward and upward gave some hope that this overarching force would overrule in favor of the strong, intelligent, and noble.&lt;ref name=Bentley&gt;Bentley, Eric. ''The Cult of the Superman''. Peter Smith, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–18,49–58}}

Nietzsche agreed with much of Carlyle's hero worship, transferring many qualities of the hero to his concept of the superman. He believed that the hero should be revered, not for the good he has done for the people, but simply out of admiration for the marvelous. The hero justifies himself as a man chosen by destiny to be great. In the life struggle he is a conqueror, growing stronger through conflict. The hero is not ashamed of his strength; instead of the Christian virtues of meekness, humility and compassion, he abides by the beatitudes of Heroic Vitalism: courage, nobility, pride, and the right to rule. His slogan: "The good old rule, the simple plan, that he should keep who has the power, and he should take who can."&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt;{{rp|52}}

For Carlyle, the hero was somewhat similar to [[Aristotle]]'s "Magnanimous" man – a person who flourished in the fullest sense. However, for Carlyle, unlike Aristotle, the world was filled with contradictions with which the hero had to deal. All heroes will be flawed. Their heroism lay in their creative energy in the face of these difficulties, not in their moral perfection. To sneer at such a person for their failings is the philosophy of those who seek comfort in the conventional. Carlyle called this 'valetism', from the expression 'no man is a hero to his [[valet]].'&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, Thomas (1869). ''On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History''. London: Chapman and Hall, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Past and Present''===
In 1843, he published his anti-democratic ''Past and Present'', with its doctrine of ordered work.&lt;ref name="daiches90"&gt;D. Daiches ed., ''Companion to Literature 1'' (London, 1965), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he influentially called attention to what he termed "The condition of England...England is full of wealth...supply for human want in every kind; yet England is dying of inanition".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. Halevy, ''Victorian Years'' (London, 1961), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later work===
[[File:Mrs Helen Allingham - Thomas Carlyle, 1795 - 1881. Historian and essayist - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Helen Allingham]]'s 1879 painting of Carlyle]]
All these books were influential in their day, especially on writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[John Ruskin]]. However, after the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and political agitations in the United Kingdom, Carlyle published a collection of essays entitled "[[Latter-Day Pamphlets]]" (1850) in which he attacked democracy as an absurd social ideal, while equally condemning hereditary aristocratic leadership. Two of these essays, No. I: "The Present Times" and No. II: "Model Prisons" were reviewed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in April 1850.&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politish-Ökonomische Revue No. 4" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'' (International Publishers: New York, 1978) pp. 301–310.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carlyle criticised hereditary aristocratic leadership as "deadening"; however, he criticised democracy as nonsensical, mocking the idea that objective truth could be discovered by weighing up the votes for it. Government should come from those most able to lead. But how such leaders were to be found, and how to follow their lead, was something Carlyle could not (or would not) clearly say.  Marx and Engels agreed with Carlyle as far as his criticism of the hereditary aristocracy.  However they criticised Carlyle's plan to use democracy to find the "Noblest" and the other "Nobles" that are to form the government by the "ablest" persons.&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews from the Neue Rheinisch Zeitung Politisch-Ökonomische Revue No. 4" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'', p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Trollope]] for his part considered that in the Pamphlets "the grain of sense is so smothered in a sack of the sheerest trash….He has one idea – a hatred of spoken and acted falsehood; and on this he harps through the whole eight pamphlets".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. Sadleir, ''Trollope'' (London, 1945), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, [[Northrop Frye]] would similarly speak on Carlyle's "tantrum prose...rhetorical ectoplasm".&lt;ref&gt;N. Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton, 1971), pp. 21 and 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Carlyle Vanity Fair 22 October 1870.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caricature by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Ape]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1870]]
In later writings, Carlyle sought to examine instances of heroic leadership in history. The ''Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell'' (1845) presented a positive image of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]: someone who attempted to weld order from the conflicting forces of reform in his own day. Carlyle sought to make Cromwell's words live in their own terms by quoting him directly, and then commenting on the significance of these words in the troubled context of the time. Again this was intended to make the 'past' 'present' to his readers: “he is epic, still living”.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, quoted in G. M. Trevelyan, ''An Autobiography'' (London, 1949), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

His essay "[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]]" (1849) suggested that slavery should never have been abolished, or else replaced with [[serfdom]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It had kept order, he argued, and forced work from people who would otherwise have been lazy and feckless: “West Indian blacks are emancipated and, it appears, refuse to work”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. Halevy, ''Victorian Years'' (London, 1961), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and Carlyle's support for the repressive measures of Governor [[Edward Eyre]] in Jamaica during the [[Morant Bay rebellion]],&lt;ref name="daiches90"/&gt; further alienated him from his old liberal allies. As Governor of the Colony, Eyre, fearful of an island wide uprising, brutally suppressed the rebellion, and had many black peasants killed. Hundreds were flogged. He also authorised the  execution of [[George William Gordon]], a mixed-race  colonial assemblyman who was suspected of involvement in the rebellion.  These events created great controversy in Britain, resulting in demands for Eyre to be arrested and tried for murdering Gordon. [[John Stuart Mill]] organised the [[Jamaica Committee]], which demanded his prosecution and included some well-known British liberal intellectuals (such as [[John Bright]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Frederic Harrison]], [[Thomas Hughes]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], and [[Herbert Spencer]]).

Carlyle set up rival Governor Eyre Defense and Aid Committee for the defence, arguing that Eyre had acted decisively to restore order.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Catherine (2002). ''Civilising Subjects: Metropole and Colony in the English Imagination, 1830–1867''. University of Chicago Press, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; His supporters included [[John Ruskin]], [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Charles Dickens]],  [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[John Tyndall]]. Twice Eyre was charged with murder, but the cases never proceeded.

Similar hard-line views were expressed in ''Shooting Niagara, and After?'', written after the passing of the [[Reform Act 1867|Electoral Reform Act of 1867]] in which he "reaffirmed his belief in wise leadership (and wise [[followership]]), his disbelief in democracy and his hatred of all workmanship – from brickmaking to diplomacy – that was not genuine".&lt;ref&gt;Trella, D.J. (1992). "Carlyle's 'Shooting Niagara': The Writing and Revising of an Article and Pamphlet", ''Victorian Periodicals Review'' '''25''' (1), pp. 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Frederick the Great''====
[[File:Maurice.JPG|thumbnail|upright|Carlyle (left) depicted with [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]] in [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''[[Work (painting)|Work]]'' (1865)]]
His last major work was the epic life of [[Frederick the Great]] (1858–1865). In this Carlyle tried to show how a heroic leader can forge a state, and help create a new moral culture for a nation. For Carlyle, Frederick epitomised the transition from the liberal [[the Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of the eighteenth century to a new modern culture of spiritual dynamism embodied by Germany, its thought and its polity. The book is most famous for its vivid, arguably very biased, portrayal of Frederick's battles, in which Carlyle communicated his vision of almost overwhelming chaos mastered by leadership of genius.

Carlyle struggled to write the book, calling it his "Thirteen Years War" with Frederick. Some of the nicknames he came up with for the work included, "the Nightmare," "the Minotaur," and "the Unutterable book"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futilitycloset.com/2018/07/15/peace-and-quiet-4/|title=Peace and Quiet|last=Ross|first=Greg|date=15 July 2018|website=[[Futility Closet]]|access-date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1852, he made his first trip to Germany to gather material, visiting the scenes of Frederick's battles and noting their topography.  He made another trip to Germany to study battlefields in 1858. The work comprised six volumes; the first two volumes appeared in 1858, the third in 1862, the fourth in 1864 and the last two in 1865. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] considered it "Infinitely the wittiest book that was ever written". [[James Russell Lowell]] pointed out some faults, but wrote: "The figures of most historians seem like dolls stuffed with bran, whose whole substance runs out through any hole that criticism may tear in them; but Carlyle's are so real in comparison, that, if you prick them, they bleed." The work was studied as a textbook in the military academies of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Frederick the Great |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Carlyle, Thomas |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Daiches]], however, later concluded that "since his 'idea' of Frederick is not really borne out by the evidence, his mythopoeic effort partially fails".&lt;ref name="daiches90"/&gt;

The effort involved in the writing of the book took its toll on Carlyle, who became increasingly depressed, and subject to various probably psychosomatic ailments. In 1853 he wrote a letter to his sister describing the construction of a small [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]] room over his home in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], intended as a [[Soundproofing|soundproof]] writer's room. Unfortunately, the skylight made it "the noisiest room in the house"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The mixed reception to the book also contributed to Carlyle's decreased literary output.

====Last works====
Later writings were generally short essays, notably the (unsuccessful) ''The Early Kings of Norway'',&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; a series on early-medieval Norwegian warlords.  Also ''An Essay on the Portraits of John Knox'' appeared in 1875, attempting to prove that the best-known portrait of [[John Knox]] did not depict the Scottish prelate. This was linked to Carlyle's long interest in historical portraiture, which had earlier fuelled his project to found a gallery of national portraits, fulfilled by the creation of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] and the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==London Library==
Carlyle was the chief instigator in the foundation of the [[London Library]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Grindea |editor-first=Miron |editor-link=Miron Grindea |year=1978 |title=The London Library |place=Ipswich |pages=9–13 |publisher=Boydell Press/Adam Books |isbn=0 85115 098 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John |authorlink=John Wells (satirist) |year=1991 |title=Rude Words: a discursive history of the London Library |place=London |publisher=Macmillan |pages=12–56 |isbn=978-0333475195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had become frustrated by the facilities available at the [[British Library|British Museum Library]], where he was often unable to find a seat (obliging him to perch on ladders), where he complained that the enforced close confinement with his fellow readers gave him a "museum headache", where the books were unavailable for loan, and where he found the library's collections of pamphlets and other material relating to the French Revolution and English Civil Wars inadequately catalogued. In particular, he developed an antipathy to the Keeper of Printed Books, [[Anthony Panizzi]] (despite the fact that Panizzi had allowed him many privileges not granted to other readers), and criticised him, as the "respectable Sub-Librarian", in a footnote to an article published in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1991), pp. 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlyle's eventual solution, with the support of a number of influential friends, was to call for the establishment of a private [[subscription library]] from which books could be borrowed.

==Private life==
[[File:Portrait of Carlyle in his garden at Chelsea (4671347).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Carlyle in his garden at Chelsea]]
[[File:Jane Baillie Carlyle (née Welsh) by Samuel Laurence detail.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Portrait of Jane Welsh Carlyle by [[Samuel Laurence]], {{circa|lk=no|1852}}]]
Carlyle had a number of would-be romances before he married [[Jane Welsh Carlyle|Jane Welsh]], important as a literary figure in her own right. The most notable were with Margaret Gordon, a pupil of his friend [[Edward Irving]]. Even after he met Jane, he became enamoured of [[Kitty Kirkpatrick]], the daughter of a British officer and an Indian princess. [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]], author of ''[[White Mughals]]'', suggests that feelings were mutual, but social circumstances made the marriage impossible, as Carlyle was then poor. Both Margaret and Kitty have been suggested as the original of "[[Sartor Resartus#Characters|Blumine]]", Teufelsdröckh's beloved, in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heffer, Simon (1995). ''Moral Desperado – A Life of Thomas Carlyle''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas also had a friendship with writer [[Geraldine Jewsbury]] starting in 1840. During that year Jewsbury was going through a depressive state and also experiencing religious doubt. She wrote to Carlyle for guidance and also thanked him for his well-written essays. Eventually Carlyle invited Jewsbury out to Cheyne Row, where Carlyle and Jane resided. Jewsbury and Jane from then on had a tight friendship and Carlyle also helped Jewsbury get on to the English literary scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Susanne|title=Geraldine Jewsbury, Her Life and Errors|date=1935|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Carlyle married Jane Welsh in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Collis, John Stewart (1971). ''The Carlyles: A Biography of Thomas and Jane Carlyle''. London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson.&lt;/ref&gt; He met Welsh through his friend and her tutor [[Edward Irving]], with whom she came to have a mutual romantic (although not intimate) attraction. Welsh was the subject of Leigh Hunt's charming poem, "[[Jenny kiss'd Me]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/leigh-hunt ''Leigh Hunt, 1784–1859,''] Poetry Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their marriage proved to be one of the most famous, well documented, and unhappy of literary unions. Over 9000 letters between Carlyle and his wife have been published showing the couple had an affection for each other marred by frequent and angry quarrels.&lt;ref name="WA" /&gt;

{{quote|It was very good of God to let Carlyle and Mrs Carlyle marry one another, and so make only two people miserable and not four.|[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Samuel (1935). ''Letters Between Samuel Butler and E.M.A. Savage 1871–1885''. London: Jonathan Cape, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carlyle became increasingly alienated from his wife. Carlyle's biographer James Anthony Froude published (posthumously) his opinion that the marriage remained unconsummated.&lt;ref name=Froude&gt;{{cite book|last=Froude|first=James|title=''My Relations with Carlyle''|year=1903|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/stream/myrelationswith00stepgoog#page/n8/mode/2up}} On pages 21–24, Mr. Froude insinuates that Carlyle was impotent (p. 21): "She [Mrs. Carlyle] had longed for children, and children were denied to her.  This had been at the bottom of all the quarrels and all the unhappiness"; (p. 22): "Intellectual and spiritual affection being all which he had to give [his wife]"; (p. 23): "Carlyle did not know when he married what his constitution was. The morning after his wedding-day he tore to pieces the flower-garden at the Comeley Bank in a fit of ungovernable fury."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she had been an invalid for some time, his wife's sudden death in 1866 was unexpected and it greatly distressed Carlyle who was moved to write his highly self-critical "Reminiscences of Jane Welsh Carlyle", published posthumously.&lt;ref name = Cumming2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Cumming|title=The Carlyle Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Nvdx-4-CzoC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=19 March 2013|year=2004|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3792-0|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Carlyle was named Lord Rector of Edinburgh University. Three weeks after his inaugural address there, Jane died, and he partly retired from active society. His last years were spent at 24 Cheyne Row (then numbered 5), Chelsea, London SW3 (which is now a National Trust property&lt;ref name="NT website"&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-carlyleshouse/ Carlyle's House.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015103425/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-carlyleshouse/ |date=15 October 2008 }},&lt;/ref&gt; commemorating his life and works) but he always wished to return to Craigenputtock.

===Death===
[[File:Picture of Carlyle's Grave.jpg|thumb|Carlyle's Grave at [[Ecclefechan]]]]
Upon Carlyle's death on 5 February 1881 in London interment in [[Westminster Abbey]] was offered but rejected due to his explicit wish to be buried beside his parents in [[Ecclefechan]].&lt;ref name="Cumming2004" /&gt; His final words were, "So, this is death. Well!"&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Barnaby (1961). ''Famous Last Words''. London: Alvin Redman, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biography===
Carlyle would have preferred that no biography of him were written, but when he heard that his wishes would not be respected and several people were waiting for him to die before they published, he relented and supplied his friend [[James Anthony Froude]] with many of his and his wife's papers. Carlyle's essay about his wife was included in ''Reminiscences, ''published shortly after his death by Froude, who also published the ''Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle'' annotated by Carlyle himself. Froude's ''Life of Carlyle'' was published over 1882–84. The frankness of this book was unheard of by the usually respectful standards of 19th-century biographies of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Waldo Hilary (1930). ''Froude &amp; Carlyle, a Study of the Froude-Carlyle Controversy''. London, Longmans, Green and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Froude's work was attacked by Carlyle's family, especially his nephew, Alexander Carlyle&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, Alexander &amp; Sir James Crichton-Browne (1903). [https://archive.org/stream/nemesisoffrouder00carl#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Nemesis of Froude: A Rejoinder to James Anthony Froude's "My Melations with Carlyle"'']. New York and London: John Lane: The Bodley Head.&lt;/ref&gt; and his niece, Margaret Aitken Carlyle. However, the biography in question was consistent with Carlyle's own conviction that the flaws of heroes should be openly discussed, without diminishing their achievements. Froude, who had been designated by Carlyle himself as his biographer-to-be, was acutely aware of this belief. Froude's defence of his decision, ''My Relations With Carlyle'' was published posthumously in 1903, including a reprint of Carlyle's 1873 will, in which Carlyle equivocated: "Express biography of me I had really rather that there should be none." Nevertheless, Carlyle in the will simultaneously and completely deferred to Froude's judgement on the matter, whose "decision is to be taken as mine."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/myrelationswith00stepgoog#page/n82/mode/2up "Will and Codicil of Thomas Carlyle, Esq.,"] in ''My Relations with Carlyle.'' New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Thomas Carlyle by Sir John Everett Millais, 1st Bt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Carlyle painted by [[John Everett Millais]]. Froude wrote of this painting "under Millais's hands the old Carlyle stood again upon the canvas as I had not seen him for thirty years. The inner secret of the features had been evidently caught. There was a likeness which no sculptor, no photographer, had yet equalled or approached. Afterwards, I knew not how, it seemed to fade away."]]
Thomas Carlyle is notable both for his continuation of older traditions of the [[Tory]] satirists of the 18th century in England and for forging a new tradition of [[Victorian era]] criticism of progress known as [[sage writing]].&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, John (1953). ''The Victorian Sage: Studies in Argument''. London: Macmillan; Landow, George (1986). ''Elegant Jeremiahs: The Sage from Carlyle to Mailer''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sartor Resartus'' can be seen both as an extension of the chaotic, sceptical satires of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Laurence Sterne]] and as an enunciation of a new point of view on values.

Carlyle is also important for helping to introduce German Romantic literature to Britain. Although [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] had also been a proponent of [[Schiller]], Carlyle's efforts on behalf of Schiller and Goethe would bear fruit.&lt;ref name = "fair"/&gt;

The reputation of Carlyle's early work remained high during the 19th century, but declined in the 20th century. [[George Orwell]] called him, "a master of belittlement. Even at his emptiest sneer (as when he said that [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] ''thought he was a big man because he lived in a big country'') the victim does seem to shrink a little. That [...] is the power of the orator, the man of phrases and adjectives, turned to a base use."&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Review of ''the Two Carlyles'' by Osbert Burdett, ''The Adelphi'', March 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Whitman himself described Carlyle as lighting "up our Nineteenth Century with the light of a powerful, penetrating and perfectly honest intellect of the first-class" and "Never had political progressivism a foe it could more heartily respect".&lt;ref&gt;Specimen Days by Walt Whitman (1883).[https://archive.org/stream/specimendayscoll00whit/specimendayscoll00whit_djvu.txt ''Specimen Days'']&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation in Germany was always high, because of his promotion of German thought and his biography of [[Frederick the Great]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whose ideas are comparable to Carlyle's in some respects,&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, H. J. C. (1933). ''Carlyle &amp; Hitler: The Adamson Lecture in the University of Manchester''.

[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodevilpr00nie#page/n5/mode/2up ''Beyond Good and Evil''].

''Victorian Critics and Democracy: Carlyle, Ruskin, Arnold, Stephen, Maine, Lecky''. London: H. Milford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and his belief in charismatic leadership was appealing to [[Joseph Goebbels]], who read Carlyle's biography of Frederick to Hitler during his last days in 1945.&lt;ref name = "fair"&gt;Cumming, Mark (2004). ''The Carlyle Encyclopedia'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, pp. 200ff; 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, Timothy W. (2010). ''Hitler's Private Library: The Books that Shaped His Life''. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics in the 20th century identified Carlyle as an influence on fascism and Nazism.&lt;ref name = "fair"/&gt; [[Ernst Cassirer]] argued in ''The Myth of the State'' that Carlyle's hero worship contributed to 20th-century ideas of political leadership that became part of fascist political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Casirer, Ernest (1946). ''The Myth of the State.'' Yale: Yale University Press. See also Voegelin, Eric (2001). ''Selected Book Reviews''. The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, Vol. XIII. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, pp. 156–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sartor Resartus'' has recently been recognised once more as a unique masterpiece, anticipating many major philosophical and cultural developments, from Existentialism to [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gravil, Richard (2007). ''Existentialism''. Humanities, p. 35; Böhnke, Dietmar (2004). ''Shades of Gray: Science Fiction, History and the Problem of Postmodernism in the Works of Alidair Gray''. Berlin: Galda &amp; Wilch, p. 73; d'Haen, Theo &amp; Pieter Vermeulen (2006). ''Cultural Identity and Postmodern Writing''. Amsterdam: Editions Rodopi, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that his critique of ideological formulas in ''The French Revolution'' provides a good account of the ways in which revolutionary cultures turn into repressive dogmatisms.

Essentially a [[Romanticism|Romantic]], Carlyle attempted to reconcile Romantic affirmations of feeling and freedom with respect for historical and political fact. Many believe that he was always more attracted to the idea of heroic struggle itself, than to any specific goal for which the struggle was being made. However, Carlyle's belief in the continued use to humanity of the [[Great Man theory|Hero, or Great Man]], is stated succinctly at the end of his essay on [[Muhammad]] (in ''On Heroes, Hero Worship &amp; the Heroic in History''), in which he concludes that: “the Great Man was always as lightning out of Heaven; the rest of men waited for him like fuel, and then they too would flame."&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, Thomas (1840). ''On Heroes, Hero-worship and the Heroic in History''. London: Chapman and Hall, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bust of Carlyle is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].

There are several published "Collected Works" of Carlyle:

Unauthorized lifetime editions:
* "Thomas' Carlyle's Ausgewählte Schriften", 1855–56, Leipzig. Translations by A. Kretzschmar. Abandoned after 6 vols.
Authorised lifetime editions:
* Uniform edition, [[Chapman and Hall]], 16 vols, 1857–58.
* Library edition, [[Chapman and Hall]], 34 vols (30 vols 1869–71, 3 additional vols added 1871 and one more 1875). The most lavish lifetime edition, it sold for 6 to 9 shillings per volume (or £15 the set)
* People's edition, [[Chapman and Hall]], 39 vols (37 vols 1871–74, with 2 extra volumes added in 1874 and 1878). Carlyle insisted the price be kept to 2 shillings per volume.
* Cabinet edition, [[Chapman and Hall]], 37 vols in 18, 1874 (printed from the plates of the People's Edition)
Posthumous editions:
* Centennial edition, [[Chapman and Hall]], 30 vol, 1896–99 (with reprints to at least 1907). Introductions by [[Henry Duff Traill]]. The text is based on the People's edition, and it is used by many scholars as the standard edition of Caryle's works.
* Norman and Charlotte Strouse edition (originally the California Carlyle edition), [[University of California Press]], 1993–2006. Only 4 volumes were issued: "On Heroes" (1993), "Sartor Resartus" (2000), "Historical Essays" (2003) and "Past and Present" (2006). Despite being incomplete, it is the only critical edition of (some of) Carlyle's works.

==Definitions==
Carlyle had quite a few unusual definitions at hand, which were collected by the [[Nuttall Encyclopedia]]. Some include:

;''Centre of Immensities'': An expression of Carlyle's to signify that wherever any one is, he is in touch with the whole universe of being, and is, if he knew it, as near the heart of it there as anywhere else he can be.
;''Eleutheromania'': A mania or frantic zeal for freedom.
;''Gigman'': Carlyle's name for a man who prides himself on, and pays all respect to, respectability. It is derived from a definition once given in a court of justice by a witness who, having described a person as respectable, was asked by the judge in the case what he meant by the word; "one that keeps a [[Gig (carriage)|gig]]," was the answer. Carlyle also refers to "gigmanity" at large.
;''Hallowed Fire'': An expression of Carlyle's in definition of Christianity "at its rise and spread" as sacred, and kindling what was sacred and divine in man's soul, and burning up all that was not.
;''Mights and Rights'': The Carlyle doctrine that Rights are nothing till they have realised and established themselves as Mights; they ''are'' rights first only then.
;''Pig-Philosophy'': The name given by Carlyle in his ''[[Latter-Day Pamphlets]],'' in the one on Jesuitism, to the widespread philosophy of the time, which regarded the human being as a mere creature of appetite instead of a creature of God endowed with a soul, as having no nobler idea of well-being than the gratification of desire – that his only Heaven, and the reverse of it his Hell.
;''Plugston of Undershot'': Carlyle's name for a "[[captain of industry]]" or member of the manufacturing class.
;''Present Time'': Defined by Carlyle as "the youngest born of Eternity, child and heir of all the past times, with their good and evil, and parent of all the future with new questions and significance," on the right or wrong understanding of which depend the issues of life or death to us all, the sphinx riddle given to all of us to rede as we would live and not die.
;''Prinzenraub'' (the stealing of the princes): Name given to an attempt to satisfy a private grudge of his, on the part of [[Kunz von Kaufungen]] to carry off, on the night of 7 July 1455, two Saxon princes from the castle of [[Altenburg]], in which he was defeated by apprehension at the hands of a collier named Schmidt, through whom he was handed over to justice and beheaded. See Carlyle's account of this in his "Miscellanies."
;''Printed Paper'': Carlyle's satirical name for the literature of France prior to the Revolution.
;''Progress of the Species Magazines'': Carlyle's name for the literature of the day which does nothing to help the progress in question, but keeps idly boasting of the fact, taking all the credit to itself, like French Poet [[Jean de La Fontaine]]'s fly on the axle of the careening chariot soliloquising, "What a dust I raise!"
;''Sauerteig'': (i. e. leaven), an imaginary authority alive to the "celestial infernal" fermentation that goes on in the world, who has an eye specially to the evil elements at work, and to whose opinion Carlyle frequently appeals in his condemnatory verdict on sublunary things.
;''The Conflux of Eternities'': Carlyle's expressive phrase for ''time'', as in every moment of it a centre in which all the forces to and from eternity meet and unite, so that by no past and no future can we be brought nearer to Eternity than where we at any moment of Time are; the Present Time, the youngest born of Eternity, being the child and heir of all the Past times with their good and evil, and the parent of all the Future. By the import of which (see Matt. xvi. 27), it is accordingly the first and most sacred duty of every successive age, and especially the leaders of it, to know and lay to heart as the only link by which Eternity lays hold of it, and it of Eternity.

== June 2013 ==
After the U.S.-based editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'' held several meetings in New York City, it was decided that Greenwald, Poitras, and ''The Guardian''{{'}}s defence and intelligence correspondent Ewen MacAskill would fly to Hong Kong to meet Snowden.

In addition, the German government was well aware of the PRISM surveillance program long before Edward Snowden made details public.

The Obama Administration secretly won permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the National Security Agency’s use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails, permitting the agency to search deliberately for Americans’ communications in its massive databases. The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner “reasonably believed” to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year. But a warrant for each target would thus no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or “foreign powers.” The FISC extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Both measures were done without public debate or any specific authority from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|title=Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-had-restrictions-on-nsa-reversed-in-2011/2013/09/07/c26ef658-0fe5-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_print.html|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' jointly reported that the NSA and the GCHQ have made repeated attempts to spy on anonymous Internet users who have been communicating in secret via the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. Several of these surveillance operations involve the implantation of malicious code into the computers of Tor users who visit particular websites. The NSA and GCHQ have partly succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. The government agencies were also able to uncover the identity of some anonymous Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret NSA documents show campaign against Tor encrypted network|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secret-nsa-documents-show-campaign-against-tor-encrypted-network/2013/10/04/610f08b6-2d05-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Barton Gellman, Craig Timberg  |author2=Steven Rich |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA slideshow on 'The TOR problem'|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-slideshow-on-the-tor-problem/499/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013|author1=Steven Rich  |author2=Matt DeLong |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|title=Everything you need to know about the NSA and Tor in one FAQ|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-nsa-and-tor-in-one-faq/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA report on the Tor encrypted network|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-research-report-on-the-tor-encryption-program/501/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ report on 'MULLENIZE' program to 'stain' anonymous electronic traffic|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/gchq-report-on-mullenize-program-to-stain-anonymous-electronic-traffic/502/|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013|author1=James Ball, Bruce Schneier  |author2=Glenn Greenwald |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|title=Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Tor Stinks' presentation – read the full document|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tor: 'The king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly sensitive signals intelligence collection program known as '''[[Stateroom (surveillance program)|Stateroom]]''' involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic. It is operated out of the diplomatic missions of the [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] (Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) in numerous locations around the world. The program conducted at U.S. diplomatic missions is run in concert by the U.S. intelligence agencies NSA and CIA in a joint venture group called "'''[[Special Collection Service]]'''" (SCS), whose members work undercover in shielded areas of the American Embassies and Consulates, where they are officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges. Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered. The SCS for example used the American Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to monitor communications in Germany's government district with its parliament and the seat of the government.&lt;ref name="Spiegel20131027"&gt;{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel Cover Story: How NSA Spied on Merkel Cell Phone from Berlin Embassy - Embassy Espionage: The NSA's Secret Spy Hub in Berlin|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html|accessdate=November 1, 2013|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=October 27, 2013|author=Jacob Appelbaum, Nikolaus Blome, Hubert Gude, Ralf Neukirch, René Pfister, Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Jörg Schindler, Gregor Peter Schmitz and Holger Stark.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the NSA carries out an eavesdropping effort, dubbed Operation Dreadnought, against the [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]. During his 2009 visit to [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the agency collaborated with the GCHQ and the U.S.'s [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], collecting radio transmissions between aircraft and airports, examining Khamenei's convoy with satellite imagery, and enumerating military radar stations. According to the story, an objective of the operation is "communications fingerprinting": the ability to distinguish Khamenei's communications from those of other people in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"&gt;{{cite news

The same story revealed an operation code-named Ironavenger, in which the NSA intercepted e-mails sent between a country allied with the United States and the government of "an adversary". The ally was conducting a [[spear-phishing]] attack: its e-mails contained [[malware]]. The NSA gathered documents and [[login]] credentials belonging to the enemy country, along with knowledge of the ally's capabilities for [[Cyberwarfare|attacking computers]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"/&gt;

According to the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', the British intelligence agency GCHQ maintains a listening post on the roof of the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Berlin|British Embassy in Berlin]] that is capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications all over the German capital, including adjacent government buildings such as the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] (seat of the German parliament) and the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] (seat of Germany's head of government) clustered around the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|title=Revealed: Britain's 'secret listening post in the heart of Berlin'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/revealed-britains-secret-listening-post-in-the-heart-of-berlin-8921548.html|accessdate=November 5, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating under the code-name "Quantum Insert", the GCHQ set up a fake website masquerading as [[LinkedIn]], a social website used for [[professional network]]ing, as part of its efforts to install surveillance software on the computers of the telecommunications operator [[Belgacom]].&lt;ref name=gchqlinkin&gt;{{cite news|last=Tony Paterson|title=GCHQ used 'Quantum Insert' technique to set up fake LinkedIn pages and spy on mobile phone giants|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gchq-used-quantum-insert-technique-to-set-up-fake-linkedin-pagesand-spy-on-mobile-phone-giants-8931528.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the headquarters of the oil cartel [[OPEC]] were infiltrated by the GCHQ as well as the NSA, which bugged the computers of nine OPEC employees and monitored the [[List of Secretaries General of OPEC|General Secretary of OPEC]].&lt;ref name=gchqlinkin/&gt;

For more than three years the GCHQ has been using an automated monitoring system code-named "Royal Concierge" to infiltrate the [[hotel reservation system|reservation systems]] of at least 350 upscale hotels in many different parts of the world in order to target, search and analyze reservations to detect diplomats and government officials.&lt;ref name="spirgelconcierge"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach  |author2=Holger Stark |lastauthoramp=yes |title='Royal Concierge': GCHQ Monitors Hotel Reservations to Track Diplomats|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/gchq-monitors-hotel-reservations-to-track-diplomats-a-933914.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=November 17, 2013|date=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; First tested in 2010, the aim of the "Royal Concierge" is to track down the travel plans of diplomats, and it is often supplemented with surveillance methods related to [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT). Other covert operations include the wiretapping of room telephones and fax machines used in targeted hotels as well as the monitoring of computers hooked up to the hotel network.&lt;ref name="spirgelconcierge"/&gt;

In November 2013, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed that the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] ('''DSD''') had attempted to listen to the private phone calls of the [[president of Indonesia]] and his wife. The Indonesian foreign minister, [[Marty Natalegawa]], confirmed that he and the president had contacted the ambassador in Canberra. Natalegawa said any tapping of Indonesian politicians’ personal phones “violates every single decent and legal instrument I can think of—national in Indonesia, national in Australia, international as well”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/indonesia-recalls-ambassador-yudhoyono-phone-tapping-australia Indonesia recalls Canberra ambassador over Yudhoyono phone tapping attempt, Foreign minister demands explanation after documents reveal Australian agencies targeted phones of president and his wife] The Guardian 18 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrying the title "[[3G]] impact and update", a classified presentation leaked by Snowden revealed the attempts of the ASD/DSD to keep up to pace with the rollout of 3G technology in Indonesia and across [[Southeast Asia]]. The ASD/DSD motto placed at the bottom of each page reads: "Reveal their secrets—protect our own."&lt;ref name=auind1/&gt;

Under a secret deal approved by British intelligence officials, the NSA has been storing and analyzing the internet and email records of UK citizens since 2007. The NSA also proposed in 2005 a procedure for spying on the citizens of the UK and other [[UKUSA Agreement|Five-Eyes nations alliance]], even where the partner government has explicitly denied the U.S. permission to do so. Under the proposal, partner countries must neither be informed about this particular type of surveillance, nor the procedure of doing so.&lt;ref name="ukusaball"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary authorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue legal authorities..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Strategy for Surveillance Powers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/23/us/politics/23nsa-sigint-strategy-document.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone’s constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment.

According to the New York Times the NSA is monitoring approximately 100.000 computers worldwide with spy software named Quantum. Quantum enables the NSA to conduct surveillance on those computers on the one hand and can also create a digital highway for launching cyberattacks on the other hand. Among the targets are the Chinese and Russian military, but also trade institutions within the European Union. The NYT also reported that the NSA can access and alter computers which are not connected with the internet by a secret technology in use by the NSA since 2008. The prerequisite is the physically insertion of the radio frequency hardware by a spy, a manufacturer or an unwitting user.  The technology relies on a covert channel of radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards inserted surreptitiously into the computers. In some cases, they are sent to a briefcase-size relay station that intelligence agencies can set up miles away from the target. The technology can also transmit malware back to the infected computer.&lt;ref name="NYT20140114" /&gt;

In a separate 20-page report dated 2012, the GCHQ cited the popular smarphone game "[[Angry Birds]]" as an example of how an application could be used to extract user data. Taken together, such forms of data collection would allow the agencies to collect vital information about a user's life, including his or her home country, current location (through [[geolocation]]), age, gender, [[ZIP code]], [[marital status]], [[income]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], education level, number of children, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=James|title=NSA and GCHQ target 'leaky' phone apps like Angry Birds to scoop user data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-gchq-smartphone-app-angry-birds-personal-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=JAMES GLANZ, JEFF LARSON  |author2=ANDREW W.

The [[Communications Security Establishment Canada]] (CSEC) has been tracking Canadian air passengers via free [[Wi-Fi]] services at a major Canadian airport. Passengers who exited the airport terminal continued to be tracked as they showed up at other [[Wi-Fi]] locations across Canada. In a CSEC document dated May 2012, the agency described how it had gained access to two communications systems with over 300,000 users in order to pinpoint a specific imaginary target. The operation was executed on behalf of the NSA as a trial run to test a new technology capable of tracking down "any target that makes occasional forays into other cities/regions." This technology was subsequently shared with Canada's [[Five Eyes]] partners - Australia, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Greg Weston |author2=Glenn Greenwald |author3=Ryan Gallagher |title=CSEC used airport Wi-Fi to track Canadian travellers: Edward Snowden documents |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csec-used-airport-wi-fi-to-track-canadian-travellers-edward-snowden-documents-1.2517881|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden leaks: Canada 'spied on airport travellers'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25977620|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmott|first=Mark|title=Canada Used Airport Wi-Fi To Track Travelers, Snowden Leak Alleges |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/31/269418375/airport-wi-fi-used-to-track-travelers-snowden-leak-alleges|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and TV network [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] the mobile phone of former German chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] was monitored from 2002 onwards, reportedly because of his government's opposition to [[Iraq War|military intervention in Iraq]]. The source of the latest information is a document leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The document, containing information about the '''National Sigint Requirement List''' (NSRL), had previously been interpreted as referring only to [[Angela Merkel]]'s mobile. However ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' and NDR claim to have confirmation from NSA insiders that the surveillance authorisation pertains not to the individual, but the political post – which in 2002 was still held by Schröder. According to research by the two media outlets, Schröder was placed as number 388 on the list, which contains the names of persons and institutions to be put under surveillance by the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA hatte auch Gerhard Schröder im Visier|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausspaehung-des-bundeskanzlers-nsa-hatte-auch-gerhard-schroeder-im-visier-1.1880004|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=4 February 2014|author=Stefan Kornelius, Hans Leyendecker und Georg Mascolo|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ottermann|first=Philip|title=NSA tapped German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder's phone – report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/us-nsa-gerhard-schroeder-surveillance|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 February 2014|location=[[Berlin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: NSA spied on Merkel's predecessor too |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |work=Associated Press (AP) |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |accessdate=5 February 2014 |date=4 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205020031/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |archivedate=February 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smale|first=Alison|title=German Paper Says U.S. Kept Tabs on Leader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/europe/german-paper-says-us-kept-tabs-on-leader.html?src=recg|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== March 2014 ==
The NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. The NSA relies on an automated system codenamed [[TURBINE (US government project)|TURBINE]] which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices). As quoted by ''The Intercept'', TURBINE is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually."&lt;ref name="TC20140312"&gt;{{cite news|title=How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014|author=Ryan Gallagher and Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance – the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of:

* breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks
* infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive
* covertly recording audio from a computer’s microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam
* launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites
* exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer

The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance "sensors" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith Hill, England. Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data "selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique "cookies" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates.&lt;ref name="TC20140312" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Ryan|title=Compare the NSA’s Facebook Malware Denial to its Own Secret Documents|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/15/nsa-facebook-malware-turbine-non-denial-denial/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|title=NSA's automated hacking engine offers hands-free pwning of the world|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/|accessdate=March 23, 2014|publisher=Ars Technica|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Implants|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Industrial-Scale Exploitation|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/industrial-scale-exploitation/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA Technology Directorate Analysis of Converged Data|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-technology-directorate-analysis-converged-data/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There Is More Than One Way to Quantum|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA Phishing Tactics and Man in the Middle Attacks|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-phishing-tactics-man-middle-attacks/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quantum Insert Diagrams|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/quantum-insert-diagrams/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TURBINE and TURMOIL|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/turbine-turmoil/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The NSA and GCHQ’s QUANTUMTHEORY Hacking Tactics|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-gchqs-quantumtheory-hacking-tactics/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Menwith Hill Station Leverages XKeyscore for Quantum Against Yahoo and Hotmail|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/menwith-hill-station-leverages-xkeyscore-quantum-yahoo-hotmail/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Eyes Hacking Large Routers|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/five-eyes-hacking-large-routers/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selector Types|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/selector-types/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VPN and VOIP Exploitation With HAMMERCHANT and HAMMERSTEIN|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/vpn-voip-exploitation-hammerchant-hammerstein/|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Implants|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/|accessdate=March 13, 2014|newspaper=The Intercept|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of April, Edward Snowden said that the United States surveillance agencies spy on Americans more than anyone else in the world, contrary to anything that has been said by the government up until this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Volz Dustin|first=Dustin|title=Edward Snowden: NSA Spies Most on Americans|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/edward-snowden-nsa-spies-most-on-americans-20140430|accessdate=May 5, 2014|newspaper=National Journal|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Intercept'' and [[WikiLeaks]] revealed information about which countries were having their communications collected as part of the [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]] surveillance program. On May 19, ''The Intercept'' reported that the NSA is recording and archiving nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas with a system called SOMALGET, a subprogram of [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]]. The mass surveillance has been occurring without the Bahamian government's permission.&lt;ref name="data pirates"&gt;{{cite web| first1=Ryan |last1=Devereaux |first2=Glenn |last2=Greenwald |first3=Laura |last3=Poitras| url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/ |title=Data Pirates of the Caribbean: The NSA Is Recording Every Cell Phone Call in the Bahamas |work=[[The Intercept]] |publisher=[[First Look Media]] |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the Bahamas, ''The Intercept'' reported NSA interception of cell phone metadata in [[Kenya]], the [[Philippines]], [[Mexico]] and a fifth country it did not name due to "credible concerns that doing so could lead to increased violence." WikiLeaks released a statement on May 23 claiming that [[Afghanistan]] was the unnamed nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zach |last=Schonfeld |title=The Intercept Wouldn’t Reveal a Country the U.S. Is Spying On, So WikiLeaks Did Instead |url=http://www.newsweek.com/intercept-wouldnt-reveal-country-us-spying-so-wikileaks-did-instead-252320 |work=Newsweek |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement responding to the revelations, the NSA said "the implication that NSA's foreign intelligence collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false."&lt;ref name="data pirates" /&gt;

Through its global surveillance operations the NSA exploits the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications to harvest millions of images. These images are then used by the NSA in sophisticated [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition programs]] to track suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Risen|first1=James|last2=Poitras|first2=Laura|title=N.S.A.

Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin – our analogue laws need a digital overhaul."&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Vodafone published its first Law Enforcement Disclosure Report on June 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Vodafone group privacy officer Stephen Deadman said "These pipes exist, the direct access model exists. We are making a call to end direct access as a means of government agencies obtaining people's communication data. Without an official warrant, there is no external visibility.

The fact that a government has to issue a piece of paper is an important constraint on how powers are used."&lt;ref name=guardian-vodafone-reveals-existence-of-secret-wires /&gt; Gus Hosein, director of [[Privacy International]] said "I never thought the telcos would be so complicit.

Above-[[Top Secret|top-secret]] documentation of a covert surveillance program named Overseas Processing Centre 1 (OPC-1) (codenamed "CIRCUIT") by [[GCHQ]] was published by ''[[The Register]]''. Based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, GCHQ taps into undersea fiber optic cables via secret spy bases near the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and Yemen. [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Vodafone]] are implicated.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_secret_british_intelligence_middleeast_internet_spy_base/ "Revealed: Beyond top secret British intelligence Middleeast Internet spy base"], ''[[The Register]]'', June 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information and ''The Intercept'' revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed [[RAMPART-A]]. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries tap into fiber optic cables carrying the majority of the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over IP software like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory. Among the partners participating in the NSA mass surveillance program are Denmark and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA 'third party' partners tap the Internet backbone in global surveillance program|accessdate=June 19, 2014|work=Dagbladet Information|date=June 19, 2014|url=http://www.information.dk/501280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jensen|first1=Kristian|title=Documentation: The Snowden files|url=http://www.information.dk/databloggen/501278|accessdate=June 19, 2014|work=Dagbladet Information|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Ryan|title=How Secret Partners Expand NSA's Surveillance Dragnet|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a|accessdate=June 18, 2014|work=The Intercept|date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== July 2014 ==
During the week of July 4, a 31-year-old male employee of [[Germany]]'s intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] was arrested on suspicion of [[espionage|spying]] for the [[United States]]. The employee is suspected of spying on the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28160767 |title=Germany arrests man suspected of spying for US |publisher=BBC |date=July 4, 2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former NSA official and whistleblower [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] spoke at a [[Centre for Investigative Journalism]] conference in London. According to Binney, "at least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores." He also stated that the majority of [[Optical fiber cable|fiber optic cables]] run through the U.S., which "is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowenstein|first1=Antony|title=The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control|journal=The Guardian|date=July 10, 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' released a review of a cache provided by Snowden containing roughly 160,000 text messages and e-mails intercepted by the NSA between 2009 and 2012. The newspaper concluded that nine out of ten account holders whose conversations were recorded by the agency "were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else." In its analysis, ''The Post'' also noted that many of the account holders were Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellman|first1=Barton|last2=Tate|first2=Julie|last3=Soltani|first3=Ashkan|title=In NSA-intercepted data, those not targeted far outnumber the foreigners who are|journal=The Washington Post|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, former State Department official [[John Tye (whistleblower)|John Tye]] released an editorial in ''The Washington Post'', highlighting concerns over data collection under [[Executive Order 12333]].

Based on documents obtained from Snowden, ''The Intercept'' reported that the [[NSA]] and [[GCHQ]] had broken into the internal computer network of [[Gemalto]] and stolen the encryption keys that are used in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM cards]] no later than 2010. {{As of|2015}}, the company is the world's largest manufacturer of SIM cards, making about two billion cards a year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2787">'''Wilhelm Diekamp''' (13 May 1854, [[Geldern]] – 25 December 1885, [[Rome]]) was a German historian.

Soon after his birth, his parents moved to [[Münster]] in [[Westphalia]], where he made his collegiate studies (1867–72). From 1872 to 1875 he studied theology at [[Würzburg]] and at Münster. Feeling uncertain, however, as to his ecclesiastical calling, he abandoned his desire of entering the priesthood, and took up the study of [[philology]].

In 1877 he graduated as doctor of philosophy with the dissertation: "Widukind, der Sachsenführer nach Geschichte und Sage" (Münster, 1877). Excessive study led to grave pulmonary disease. For some time he taught in the public schools of Münster, Arnsberg, and Aachen, developing in the meantime his historical training. Evidence of this was his ''Vitae S. Ludgeri'' (Geschichtsquellen des Bistums Münster, IV, Münster, 1881).

In 1881 the Westfalischer Verein fur Geschichte und Altertumskunde confided to him the continuation of the ''Westfälisches Urkundenbuch''. He returned to Münster and in 1882 he became ''[[Privatdozent]]'' for history there. Previously, however, he spent a year at Vienna for improvement in diplomatics at the "Institut fur oesterreichische Geschichtsforschung" under the direction of [[Theodor von Sickel]].

At Easter, 1883, he began his teaching at Münster, continuing at the same time his historical investigations, specially on Westphalian documents, the history of the [[papal chancery]], and [[papal diplomatics]]. In 1885 he published at Münster the first part of the supplement of the ''Westfälisches Urkundenbuch''.

In the autumn of this year he went to Rome, chiefly to collect in the Vatican archives the material for the large works he had in mind. But [[typhoid]]  carried him off in the midst of his labours. He was buried in the German Campo Santo near St. Peter's.

Diekamp also published between 1878 and 1885 several important studies in different reviews concerning the history of the Middle Ages and diplomatics or official style of the medieval papal documents.
