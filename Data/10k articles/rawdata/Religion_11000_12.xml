'''Aaron Siskind''' (December 4, 1903 – February 8, 1991) was an American [[photographer]]. He is considered to be closely involved with, if not a part of, the [[abstract expressionist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10051&amp;texttype=2 Abstract Expressionism - Museum of Modern Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

Siskind was a grade school English teacher in the New York Public School System for 25 years, and began photography when he received a camera as a wedding gift and began taking pictures on his honeymoon. Early in his career Siskind was a member of the New York [[Photo League]], where he produced several significant socially conscious series of images in the 1930s, among them "Harlem Document".

Siskind's work focuses on the details of nature and [[architecture]]. He presents them as flat surfaces to create a new image which stands independent of the original subject. For some his work has been described as crossing the line between photography and painting, his photographs are works unique to the art form of photography.

== Life ==
Born in [[New York City]], Siskind grew up on the Lower East Side. Shortly after graduating from [[City College of New York|City College]], he became a public school English teacher. In 1950 Siskind met [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]] when both were teaching at [[Black Mountain College]] in the summer. Later, Callahan persuaded Siskind to join him as part of the faculty of the [[IIT Institute of Design]] in Chicago (founded by [[László Moholy-Nagy]] as the [[New Bauhaus]]). In 1971 he followed Callahan (who had left in 1961) by his invitation to teach at the Rhode Island School of Design, until both retired in the late 1970s. Siskind's monumental work includes works done in Rome in 1963 and 1967, Mexico in the 1970s, and in the 1980s works such as the Tar Series in Providence, Vermont, and Route 88 near Westport, Rhode Island. He continued making photographs until his death on February 8, 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31705">The '''Diocese of Lisieux''' was a [[Roman Catholic]] ecclesiastical territory in [[France]], centered on [[Lisieux]], in [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]].

[[Image:Lisieux-Cathedrale.jpg|thumb|380px|[[Lisieux Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Pierre, Lisieux]]]]
The bishop of Lisieux was the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of the [[Roman Catholic]] Diocese of [[Lisieux]]. The first known Bishop of Lisieux is one Theodibandes, mentioned in connection with a council held in 538.

The bishopric was suppressed during the [[French revolution]] and was not reinstated. Present day Lisieux is part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayeux|Diocese of Bayeux]].

==History==

A list of alleged early bishops of Lisieux was included in the ''Ritual of Lisieux'', published in 1661 under the direction of Bishop Léonor (I ) Goyon de Matignon. The list, however, was padded with the names of saints whose putative relics were stored in the Cathedral.  These included Saint Ursinus,&lt;ref&gt;Ursinus' relics were brought from Bourges under Bishop Hugues (1050–1077), nephew of Duke Robert II of Normandy. Guillaume Bassin, ''Concilia Rotomagensia'' (Rouen: apud Franciscum Vaultier 1717), p. 475 column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Patrick and Saint Cande, none of whom can be shown to have been a bishop.&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' XI, p. 762. Fisquet, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bishop of Lisieux was ex-officio Conservator of the University of Caen.

The Chapter of the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre was composed of nine dignities and thirty Canons.  The dignities were: the Dean, the Cantor, the Treasurer, the Capicerio, the Magister Scholarum, and the  four Archdeacons (Lieuven, Auge, Pont-Audemer, and Gacé). All were appointed by the bishop, except the Dean, who was elected by the Chapter. There were thirty-one prebends, the first eleven of whom were called 'Barons'. The Cathedral also had four Vicars and thirty chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' XI, p. 762. Fisquet, pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The diocese of Lisieux contained 487 parishes and 520 rectories.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 243 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The diocese had six abbeys for men and two for women. Five of the abbeys belonged to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] ([[Abbey of Saint-Evroul|Saint-Evroul]], Bernay, Préaux, Grestain,&lt;ref&gt;Léchaud d'Anisy, ''[http://le50enlignebis.free.fr/spip.php?article15547 Les anciens abbayes de Normandie]'' Tome II (Caen: E. Brunet 1824), pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cormeilles Abbey|Cormeilles]]). The [[Premonstratensians]] had an abbey at Mont-Dée ([[Mondaye Abbey|Mondaye]]). The two convents for women belonged to the Order of Saint Benedict (Saint-Léger,&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' XI, pp. 853-855.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Désir&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana'' XI, pp. 855-857.&lt;/ref&gt;).

A synod was held at Lisieux in 1055 by the Papal Legate, Bishop Hermanfried of Sion, with the cooperation of Duke William the Bastard (future king of England), in which Archbishop [[Mauger (Archbishop of Rouen)|Malgerius]] of Rouen was deposed. His dissolute life was notorious, he had refused to attend a Roman Council though summoned, and he made rebellion against the Duke. The deposition had already been agreed to by [[Pope Leo IX]].&lt;ref&gt;J.-D. Mansi (ed.), ''Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio'', [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/20vs/200_Mansi/1692-1769,_Mansi_JD,_Sacrorum_Conciliorum_Nova_Amplissima_Collectio_Vol_019,_LT.pdf Tomus XIX] (Venice 1774), pp. 837-840. C. J. Hefele, [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/20vs/222_Hefele_KJ/1809-1893,_Hefele_KJ,_Histoire_des_Concilies_d'apress_les_Documents_Originaux_Vol_04_02,_FR.pdf ''Histoire des conciles'' IV. 2] (Paris: Letouzey 1911), pp. 1121-1122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of October 1106, King Henry I of England visited Lisieux, where he held an assembly of the leaders of the duchy of Normandy, both lay and ecclesiastical. He dealt with the disorders which had been caused by his brother Robert, taking hostages (who were sent to England) including Duke Robert, and condemning to imprisonment for life Count Guillaume Werlenc of Mortain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

The Collége de Lisieux was founded at Paris in 1336 by Bishop Guy de Harcourt, Bishop of Lisieux, by testamentary bequest, and with additional endowments from three members of the d'Estouteville family. It supported twenty-four poor students of the diocese. It lasted until 1764, when it was transferred to the Collège de Dormans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Paris, from the Earliest Period to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rM_UAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA268|volume=Volume II|year=1832|publisher=A. and W. Galignani|location=Paris|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1417, King Henry V of England besieged, captured and sacked the city of Lisieux. When the Bishop of Lisieux, Pierre Fresnel, was killed in street fighting in Paris on 12 June 1418, King Henry considered it a good moment to install a bishop in Lisieux who would be favorable to the English cause. His wishes ran contrary to those of [[Pope Martin V]], leading to the appointment of Cardinal Branda Castiglione as administrator of the diocese. When Henry died on 31 August 1422, Martin V was able to appoint Castiglione's nephew as the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Louis François Du Bois, ''Histoire de Lisieux'', Vol. 1, p. 130. {{cite book|author=Bernard Guenée|title=Between Church and State: The Lives of Four French Prelates in the Late Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9Qwkh0DKxwC&amp;pg=PA290|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-31032-9|pages=290–294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poonja]] in 1986, a self-styled teacher who taught that no effort is needed to attain enlightenment "because it is merely the realisation of what one already is".{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=192}} At their first meeting, Cohen realized that he "had always been free".{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=192}} Cohen claimed that Poonja declared Cohen to be his heir, and Cohen began to teach as a [[neo-Advaita]] teacher, and gathered a community around him.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=192}}

Within a few years, Cohen noticed that the ecstatic experiences his students had in his presence were limited.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=193}} Being convinced that he himself was fully free from karmic bondage, he began to demand more commitment from his students,{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=193}} insisting on complete "ego-transcendence".{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=195}} The change in teaching-style led to dissent, and a break with Poonja, who was now regarded by Cohen as shortcoming in ethical and enlightened behavior.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194-195}}

According to Cohen, "Poonja insisted that the realization of the Self had nothing to do with worldly behavior, and he did not believe fully transcending the ego was possible."{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} According to Poonja, "karmic tendencies remained after enlightenment, [but] the enlightened person was no longer identified with them and, therefore, did not accrue further karmic consequences."{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} For Poonja, ethical standards were based on a dualistic understanding of duality and the notion of an individual agent, and therefore were not representative of [[Advaita]]:{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} "For Poonja, the goal was the realisation of the self; the illusory realm of relative reality was ultimately irrelevant."{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}} Cohen did not agree, insisting instead on "flawless behavior" as the manifestation of enlightenment.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=194}}

In 1991 Cohen founded ''EnlightenNext'' magazine (under its former title, ''What Is Enlightenment?''), which "established him as a major contemporary spiritual figure."{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=195}} In 2004, ''EnlightenNext'' magazine partnered with the Graduate Institute&lt;ref group=web &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.edu/ |title=The Graduate Institute |publisher=Learn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Connecticut to offer a master's program in conscious evolution. From 2004 to 2007, Cohen served as a core faculty of that institute.&lt;ref group=web&gt;The Graduate Institute, ''Catalog of Program'', Conscious Evolution Program, 2004–07&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine stopped publishing in 2011.

After the break with Poonja, Cohen's teachings were further developed into "Evolutionary Enlightenment", aiming at an impersonal enlightenment which transcends the personal.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=195-196}} Yet, the change in teaching-style led also to "physical force, verbal abuse, and intense psychological pressure against students."{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=196}} The growing complaints from students have been described in several publications from former students and from his own mother.{{sfn|Tarlo|2009}}{{sfn|Braak|2003}}{{sfn|Yenner|2009}}

In 2001, Cohen co-formed the jazz-funk-fusion band Unfulfilled Desires, in which he played drums. The band played original compositions and standards, and performed in Europe and the United States. They released four CDs: ''Live at the Iron Horse'' (2002), ''Enlightened Dog'' (2004), ''Punk Funk'' (2008), and ''Plugged'' (2010).

On June 26, 2013, Cohen announced on his blog that he would be taking "a sabbatical for an extended period of time", after confrontational exchanges with some of his closest students, who helped Cohen to realize, as he put it, that "in spite of the depth of my awakening, my ego is still alive and well".&lt;ref group=web name="An Apology"&gt;[http://andrewcohen.org/blog/apology http://andrewcohen.org/blog/apology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805162324/http://andrewcohen.org/blog/apology |date=August 5, 2013 }}, An Apology.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/27/what-happens-when-your-guru-disappears.html |title=What Happens When Your Guru Disappears? |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |author=Eliezer Sobel |date=March 27, 2015 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 2015, Cohen posted an extensive apology letter to his former students on his blog, his first writing after emerging from a two-year sabbatical. In it he wrote about the need to embrace the spiritual principle of [[agape]], as well as eros, and expressed regret for the ways in which his lack of the former in his teaching methods hurt and alienated many former students.&lt;ref group=web name="An open letter to all my former students upon return my sabbatical"&gt;[http://www.andrewcohen.org/blog/open-letter-all-my-former-students-upon-return-my-sabbatical "An open letter to all my former students upon return my sabbatical"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515234523/http://www.andrewcohen.org/blog/open-letter-all-my-former-students-upon-return-my-sabbatical |date=May 15, 2015 }}, Andrew Cohen's website blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, after over three years absence from public life, Cohen unveiled a redesigned website. This included an announcement of his intention to return to formal teaching, beginning with a retreat planned for early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.andrewcohen.com/events/european-retreat-january-2017 |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004085347/http://www.andrewcohen.com/events/european-retreat-january-2017/ |archive-date=October 4, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==

===Influences===
When beginning to teach, Cohen was influenced by [[H. W. L. Poonja]], who offered a "deinstitutionalised and experiential Advaita,"{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=191}} comparable to [[Ramana Maharshi]]'s teachings, which differ from the traditional Advaita Vedanta of Shankara.{{sfn|Gleig|2013|p=191}} Cohen credits the ideas of cosmologist [[Brian Swimme]], Christian theologian [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and the early 20th century Indian mystic [[Sri Aurobindo]] as helping him form his thinking about the evolutionary context of the human experience.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} He likewise credits the "integral philosopher" [[Ken Wilber]], with whom he conducts frequent public discourses, with helping him form the theoretical framework of his teachings.{{sfn|Cohen|(2011|p=xvii, Acknowledgements}}{{refn|group=note|They call their public dialogues “The Guru and the Pandit.”&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/cohen-wilber/ |title=Andrew Cohen &amp; Ken Wilber: Dialogues on Enlightenment and the Evolution of Consciousness |publisher=Enlightennext.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310121237/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/cohen-wilber/ |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cohen is a Founding Member of Integral Spirituality, which is part of Wilber's Integral Institute. Cohen's most recent book, ''Evolutionary Enlightenment'', is dedicated to Wilber.}} He has also been influenced by the Spiral Dynamics theories put forward by [[Clare Graves]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2011/oct/08/evolutionary-spirituality/ |title=Evolutionary Spirituality The Santa Barbara Independent |publisher=Independent.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen was also inspired by [[Swami Krishnananda]] of the [[Divine Life Society]] in India, and his call "In unity there is strength; come together, come together."&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j19/andrew.asp |title=Andrew Cohen: Come Together |publisher=Enlightennext.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310112757/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j19/andrew.asp |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary Enlightenment===
According to Cohen, "traditional" enlightenment is the realization of the transcendental aspect of God, and it often goes hand in hand with the realization that the world is an [[Maya (illusion)|illusion]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Cohen says that he has discovered a different form of "enlightened awareness," which he claims to be unique. He first called this "impersonal enlightenment" to reflect the fact that it was a realization shared between people rather than an individual attainment. He later changed the name to Evolutionary Enlightenment, both to reflect his belief that it indicates the next stage of the evolution of enlightenment and to convey the creative, world-embracing vision of spiritual awakening as an unending process of individual and cultural development.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j25/andrew.asp |title=Andrew Cohen: The New Enlightenment |publisher=Enlightennext.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310113407/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j25/andrew.asp |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental aspect of Cohen's Evolutionary Enlightenment is the distinction between what he sees as two fundamental, yet opposing, aspects of the human psyche: the "[[Ego (spirituality)|ego]]" and the "[[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] [[self (philosophy)|self]]",&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.andrewcohen.org/teachings/authentic-self-ego.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615150432/http://www.andrewcohen.org/teachings/authentic-self-ego.asp |date=June 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his teaching, ego is defined as "the deeply ingrained, compulsive need to remain separate and superior at all times, in all places, under all circumstances."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.andrewcohen.org/teachings/ego.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815134505/http://www.andrewcohen.org/teachings/ego.asp |date=August 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authentic self, on the other hand, is defined as "the urge to become more conscious".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

According to Cohen and Wilber, "enlightenment" does not refer to an unchanging state, but has to be in accord with an ongoing evolution of humanity, which is the "Authentic Self." According to Cohen, individuals need to recognize that their own spiritual transformation is essential for cultural evolution. To achieve that, in Cohen's view, an individual should strive to realize his or her true self as being "one with the timeless Ground of all Being and with the evolutionary impulse that is driving the entire cosmos."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

According to Wilber, evolutionary enlightenment means "the realization of oneness with all states and all stages that have evolved so far and that are in existence at any given time."{{sfn|Wilber|2007a|p=95}} Cohen believes that individuals need to transcend egoism to express the "Authentic Self." Through identifying the evolutionary impulse as their own Authentic Self, individuals can transcend ego, and find a deeper self-sense without relying on asceticism or solitude.

Cohen's ideas are co-inspired by Wilber's [[Integral Theory]], offering an integral vision of the integral evolution of matter and consciousness.{{sfn|Wilber|2007b|p=57}} According to this theory, human development parallels the evolution of all being.{{sfn|Wilber|2007b|p=116}}

==Awards==
In 2012 [[Watkins Books]] listed Cohen at Number 28 on their "Spiritual 100" list.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-2012 |title=Watkins’ Spiritual 100 List for 2012 &amp;#124; Esoteric News |publisher=Watkinsbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HMtYeqnv?url=http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-2012 |archive-date=June 14, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
HWL Poonja, also known as Papaji, the Indian Guru who Andrew claims called him his "heir" stated publicly that Andrew only spent 25 hours in satsang before proclaiming himself as enlightened. Papaji describes Andrew's claims as the arrogance of his ego and never acknowledged Andrew as a master or heir, but rather described him as a messenger.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=RG-8RRHrIWk |title=The Fake Messengers |publisher=www.kosi.co/gangaji |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental, physical, and financial abuse Andrew perpetrated against former students, which Andrew justifies as "crazy wisdom" are documented in books such as ''American Guru'',{{sfn|Yenner|2009}} ''Enlightenment Blues'', {{sfn|Braak|2003}} and ''Mother of God'',{{sfn|Tarlo|2009}} as well as popular blogs such as ''What Enlightenment?''&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatenlightenment.net/ |title=www.whatenlightenment.net |publisher=www.whatenlightenment.net |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''EnlightenNixt''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://essentialwhatenlightenment.blogspot.com/ |title=EnlightenNIXT |publisher=Essentialwhatenlightenment.blogspot.com |date=June 2, 2005 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Cohen's former followers, including his mother, Luna Tarlo, have viewed him as a manipulative spiritual teacher. Tarlo wrote a critical book, called ''Mother of God'', about her experience as one of his disciples.{{sfn|Tarlo|2009}} In a ''Psychology Today'', article, published in 1998 entitled "Crimes of the Soul", Tarlo recounted how she became a disciple of her son who told her "to give way to him or their relationship would end" and forbade her "to express an opinion on anything". Tarlo said she "knew if I seriously objected to anything, I'd be kicked out" and stated that her son, formerly the "sweetest, sensitive kid, had changed into an unrecognizable tyrant."&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|last=Neimark |first=Jill |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199803/crimes-the-soul |title='&amp;#39;Psychology Today'&amp;#39;, 1998 |publisher=Psychologytoday.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André van der Braak's ''Enlightenment Blues: My Years with an American Guru'' alleges that Cohen demanded large sums of money and extreme and unquestioning devotion from his students.{{sfn|Braak|2003}}

''American Guru: A Story of Love, Betrayal and Healing'', by William Yenner and other former Cohen student contributors (foreword by [[Stephen Batchelor (agnostic)|Stephen Batchelor]]), allege authoritarianism, financial manipulation, physical and psychological abuse in Cohen's community, and discusses the challenges of healing after leaving the community.{{sfn|Yenner|2009}}

Poonja himself has been sharply criticized for too easily authorising students to teach:
{{quote|One of the tragedies of Poonjaji's teaching ministry is that he either told, inferred, or allowed hundreds of individuals to believe they were fully enlightened simply because they'd had one, or many, powerful experiences of awakening. These "enlightened" teachers then proceeded to enlighten their own students in a similar way, and thus was born what is known as the "[[neo-Advaita]]", or "satsang" movement in western culture.{{sfn|Caplan|2009|p=16-17}}}}

Over the years, there were many indications that Cohen’s group was in difficult financial straits. In 2011 it officially ended publication of its magazine ''EnlightenNext''. Cohen was accused of being a cult leader. &lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ncreview.com/2011/09/17/enlightennext-magazine-going-out-of-print/ |title=EnlightenNext Magazine Going Out of Print &amp;#124; New Consciousness Review Blog |publisher=Blog.ncreview.com |date=September 17, 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525100815/http://blog.ncreview.com/2011/09/17/enlightennext-magazine-going-out-of-print/ |archivedate=May 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2014, the EnlightenNext organization's main building on its property in Lenox, Massachusetts, which had been on the market for years, remained up for sale.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanguru.net/news-and-reviews/not-so-fast/ |title=Not So Fast: Following the Money |publisher=AmericanGuru.net |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, over 200 of Cohen's former students signed an online petition titled "Stop Andrew Cohen teaching again", including detailed explanations of why they believe him to be unfit to teach others.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=ttps://www.thepetitionsite.com/131/591/349/stop-andrew-cohen-teaching-again|title=STOP Andrew From Teaching Again|publisher=former students|date=May 22, 2016 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
An '''apostolic prefect''' or '''prefect apostolic''' is a priest who heads what is known as an '''apostolic prefecture''', a 'pre-diocesan' missionary jurisdiction where the [[Catholic Church]] is not yet sufficiently developed to have it made a [[diocese]]. Although it usually has an (embryonal) see, sometimes even a [[cathedral]] it is often not called after such city but rather after a natural and/or administrative (in many cases colonial) geographical area: region(s), sometimes a country or even larger.

If a prefecture grows and flourishes, it may be elevated to an [[apostolic vicariate]], headed by a [[titular bishop]], in the hope that with time the region will generate enough Catholics and stability for its Catholic institutions, to warrant being established as a diocese. Both these stages remain missionary, hence [[Exemption (church)|exempt]], i.e. directly subject to the [[Holy See]] (notably the [[Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]]), normally not part of an [[ecclesiastical province]].

The full sequence of development is: independent mission, apostolic prefecture, apostolic vicariate, apostolic diocese; however steps may be skipped at the papal discretion, so the next steps may be bishopric or even archbishopric.

The apostolic prefecture and the apostolic vicariate are to be distinguished from the [[territorial abbacy]] (formerly called an "[[abbey nullius]]").

== History ==
During the last centuries of the second millennium it was the practice of the Holy See to govern either through prefects apostolic or [[apostolic vicariates]], many territories where no dioceses with resident bishops were erected and where local circumstances, such as the character and customs of the people or hostility of civil powers, made it doubtful whether an episcopal see could be permanently established. The establishing of a prefecture apostolic in a place supposes that the Church has attained only a small development in the area. Fuller growth leads to the foundation of an apostolic vicariate as an intermediate stage to becoming a diocese.

A prefect apostolic is of lower rank than a vicar apostolic. The prefect's powers are more limited and do not normally possess the episcopal character, as is ordinarily the case with a vicar apostolic. The duties of a prefect apostolic consist in directing the work of the mission entrusted to his care; his powers are in general those necessarily connected with the ordinary administration of such an office, for instance: the assigning of missionaries and the making of regulations for the good management of the affairs of the mission. Until the [[Second Vatican Council]], the prefect apostolic had extraordinary faculties for several cases reserved otherwise to diocesan bishops, such as absolutions from censures, dispensations from matrimonial impediments and the faculty of consecrating chalices, patens, and portable altars, with some having the power to administer Confirmation.

Prefects apostolic govern independent territories and are subject only to the [[pope]]. When a vicariate or a diocese extended over a very large territory in which the Catholic population was unequally distributed, the Holy See sometimes placed a portion of the territory in charge of a prefect apostolic; in which case the faculties of the prefect were more limited, and in the exercise of his office he was supervised by the vicar apostolic or the diocesan bishop. With a view to better protecting the authority of the local vicar apostolic or bishop, it was proposed in the [[First Vatican Council]] to abolish prefects apostolic having jurisdiction over districts within a vicariate or diocese of the Latin Rite, but the Council was interrupted and the practice continued until [[Pope Leo XIII]] abolished them within the Oriental Churches by a decree of [[Propaganda Fide]] on 12 September 1896, and established superiors with special dependence on the papal representatives of the areas concerned.

In 1911 there were 66 prefectures apostolic: 5 in Europe; 17 in Asia; 3 in North America (e.g., the Yukon); 11 in South America; 23 in Africa and 7 in Oceania.

At the end of 2010, the prefectures apostolic were only 39, of which the vast majority (29) were in PR [[China]] (many vacant), where development of the Catholic Church, including that of the prefectures, had long been hindered by actions of the government. The 10 other prefectures included a newly created one for Azerbaijan, 4 more in Asia, 3 in Africa, 1 in the Americas and 1 in Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2012'', pp. 1061-1065&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Heinrich Arthur Drews''' ({{IPA-de|dʁɛfs|lang}}; November 1, 1865 – July 19, 1935) was a [[German people|German]] writer, historian, [[philosopher]], and important representative of German [[Monism|monist]] thought. He was born in [[Uetersen]], [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]], in present-day [[Germany]].

==Biography==
Drews became a professor of philosophy and German language at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe]]. During his career he wrote widely on the histories of philosophy, religions and mythology. He was a disciple of [[Eduard von Hartmann]] who claimed that reality is the "[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Geist|World Spirit]]", also expressed in history through religions and the formation of [[consciousness]] in the minds of philosophers. Drews often provoked controversy, in part because of his unorthodox ideas on religion and in part because of his attacks on [[Nietzsche]] and passionate support of [[Wagner]]. He rose to international prominence with his book ''[[The Christ Myth]]'' (1909), by amplifying and publicizing the thesis initially advanced by [[Bruno Bauer]],&lt;ref name= "Bauer"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bauer/ "Bruno Bauer", by Douglas Moddach, 2009, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)'']&lt;/ref&gt; which denies the [[historicity of Jesus]].

The international controversy provoked by the "Christ Myth" was an early part of Drews's lifelong advocacy of the abandonment of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], both of which he regarded as based on ancient beliefs from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], and shaped by religious [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].&lt;ref name="dualism"&gt;See also "[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)]]" and [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/ "Dualism" (''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'')]&lt;/ref&gt; He urged a ''renewal of faith'' [''Glaubenserneuerung''] based on [[Monism]] and [[German Idealism]]. He asserted that true religion could not be reduced to a [[cult of personality]], even if based on the worship of the "unique and great personality" of a [[historical Jesus]], as claimed by Protestant [[liberal Christianity|liberal theologians]], which he argued was nothing more than the adaptation of the [[Great Man Theory]] of history promoted by [[Romanticism]] of the 19th century.

Drews was considered a [[dissenter]]. Many German academics{{who|date=August 2012}} didn't accept his "dilettantism" (''abweichungen von der communis opinio'', that is, "straying from common opinions"). Drews was a reformer, and stayed involved in religious [[activism]] all his life. He was, in his last few years, to witness and participate in an attempt by the [[:de:Freireligiöse Bewegung|Free Religion Movement]] to inspire a more liberal form of worship. This was his reason for parting with the [[German Faith Movement]], a venture trying to promote (without success) an awakening of a ''German Faith'', an unusual form of nationalistic and racist faith with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] overtones — far removed from the elitist [[German Idealism]] Drews expounded in his last book, ''The German Religion'' (''Deutsche Religion'', 1935) which he had hoped to see replace Christianity and what he considered its primitive [[superstition]]s.&lt;ref name="ArthurDrewsNYT1911"&gt;[[s:The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus/Part 4/Section 14|Arthur Drews, "Idea and Personality: Settlement of the Religious Crisis" (Last chapter 14 of "The Witness of the Gospels", Part IV of ''The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus'', 1912)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Drews came back to the same subject in ''[[The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present]]'' (1926), which is a historical review of some 35 major deniers of Jesus historicity, covering the period 1780–1926.

==Influences==

During Drews's life, Germany was going through turbulent times, both politically and culturally. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] had become a prominent cultural icon while [[Richard Wagner]] was a highly controversial personality. Nietzsche was a strong critic of [[Christianity]] and its morality, which he perceived as glorifying weakness and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/ Robert Wicks, "Nietzsche", 2011, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt; At first he was a friend and admirer of Wagner, but soon became a disgruntled critic, turning against his previous friend. He reproached Wagner for his conversion to anti-semitic Christianity and his glorification of medieval sagas and spiritual chastity as the sign of a decadent, dying culture. He posited that Wagner's "unending melody" only dramatizes theatrical posing and is hostile to the affirmation of vital [[Dionysian]] life forces. Nietzsche claimed that Wagner's art was not Germanic, but closer to Italy's [[Roman Catholicism]]. Nietzsche passionately critiqued Wagner's ideas, detailed in ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]''.

Drews was a staunch supporter of Wagner and wrote many books and articles on Wagner's religious and nationalistic ideas, which are still considered by some scholars{{who|date=August 2012}} to be important works on the subject. He also embarked on a critique of Nietzsche, who was a lifelong critic of Christianity and Christian morality. Drews reproached Nietzsche for being an apostle of unbridled individualism — a stance which put Drews in an awkward position in the German establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radikalkritik.de/Drews.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910162034/http://www.radikalkritik.de/Drews.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His criticisms were never well received by academics nor by German society as a whole, since Nietzsche had become a national figure.

In 1904, Drews gave a critical lecture in Münich on the philosophy of Nietzsche, ''Nietzsches Philosophie''. "[Nietzsche] is not aiming at bypassing morality as such, only the external morality which imposes its commandments to the individual, and results in the decay and submission of the Self. He would like to counter this old morality enemy of the Self with a ''new morality springing from the individual will'' and in conformity with his nature." [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Drews, ''Nietzsches Philosophie'', Heidelberg, C. Winter, 1904, p.331 ff. Quoted by Gianni Vattimo, ''Introduction to Nietzsche'', De Bœck &amp; Larcier, Paris, Bruxelles, 1991 p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Drews continued with his philosophical critique of Nietzsche in ''Nietzsche als Antipode Wagners'', 1919 [''Nietzsche, Antipodes of Wagner'']. His 1931 book on Wagner came out with a supplement on Nietzsche and Wagner, for which [[Bernhard Hoffers]] asserted that many of Drews' views later borrowed by the standard scholarship on Wagner without giving him credit.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Drews delivered his last public critique of Nietzsche in his article ''Nietzsche als Philosoph des ''Nationalsozialismus''?'' ["Nietzsche, a philosopher of National Socialism?"] in the journal ''Nordische Stimmen'' No. 4 (1934: 172–79). There Drews again attacked Nietzsche on philosophical grounds, in direct opposition to the Nazi effort to enlist Nietzsche in its propaganda, and unconcerned about potential consequences. Wolfang Müller-Lauter, in ''Experiences with Nietzsche'', quotes Drews: &lt;blockquote&gt; One finds in Nietzsche ''neither national sympathy nor social awareness'', [Drews claimed]. Nietzsche is, on the contrary, and particularly after his break with Richard Wagner, ''an enemy of everything German''; he supports the creation of a “good European,” and goes so far as to ''accord the Jews a leading role in the dissolution of all nations.'' Finally, he is an ''individualist'', with no notion of “the National Socialist credo: ‘collective over individual utility’...After all this, it must seem unbelievable that Nietzsche has been honored as the Philosopher of National Socialism, … for he preaches in all things ''the opposite of National Socialism''”, setting aside a few scattered utterances. The fact that such honors have repeatedly been bestowed on him has as its main reason, that most people who talk about Nietzsche tend only to ''pick the ‘raisins' from the cake of his philosophy'' and, because of his aphoristic style, ''lack any clear understanding of the way his entire thought coheres''. [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TYBdpeDZMqQC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Jacob+Golomb+et+Robert+S.+Wistrich:+Nietzsche,+godfather+of+fascism+%3F:+on+the+uses+and+abuses+of+a+philosophy,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qv9Nt3rJJa&amp;sig=mExKFUm5FdG1EbTnb0rRxhLCLp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=umYWUNv6KM-p0AX5-4HYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Drews&amp;f=false Jacob Golomb et Robert S.

==Drews's views on religion==
[[File:Drews1c.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Arthur Drews, Karlsruhe]]

=== Eduard von Hartmann ===
Drews, unsatisfied by the abstract rationality of [[Kantian]] philosophy, was attracted to religion, but was put off by what he regarded as the spiritual dryness (geistige Dürre) of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0001/bsb00016320/images/index.html?id=00016320&amp;projekt=1047387120&amp;nativeno=117 Hermann Lübbe, "Biographical Note on Drews", by, in ''Neue deutsche Biographie'' - Falck, Berlin, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; Drews found his anchor in the [[monism]] of [[Eduard von Hartmann]] (1842–1906), professor of philosophy in Berlin. Hartmann had been strongly influenced by [[Schopenhauer]] and his pessimism and had embraced [[Darwinism]] and history. Hartmann published his work  ''[[Philosophy of the Unconscious]]'', in 1869. The concept of the [[unconscious mind]] (''das Unbewusstsein'') became the new form of the ultimate reality, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], or the [[Geist]], or World Spirit of [[Hegel]], combining [[pantheism]] with [[Rationality|rational]] [[idealism]] (with the double attributes of [[Will (philosophy)|will]] and [[reason]]). In his view the human mind is not separate from this unconscious reality, but exists as it approaches [[self-consciousness]] (''Selbstbewusstsein''), especially in the opinion of the philosophical community.

Drews expanded his views in ''Die Religion als Selbst-bewusstsein Gottes: eine philosophische Untersuchung über das Wesen der Religion'', (Religion as Self-Consciousness of God: A philosophical inquiry in the Essence of Religion, 1906). The text expressed that religions are conscious expressions of the unconscious, and philosophy and religion can finally be united. The absolute Spirit was not another separate entity, and Hartmann and Drews rejected the idea of any [[personal God]] and mind-matter [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].&lt;ref name="dualism"/&gt;

In ''Christ Myth II'', Drews specified his motivation: "The chief danger that has come to our time, especially to religion, ''under the influence of science'' is ''the denial of objective purpose in the universe''. Let men be taught to believe again in ideas, and then monism, in its idealistic form, will become the first principle of all deep religious life." [emphasis added] Drews goes on to proclaim a need for the "religion of the future" to be a "concrete" monism. The advocacy of this system of monism became Drews's life program and the subject of his philosophical and religious writings. It was also the motivation for his social activism in the Free Religion Movement, which had been sprouting cultural associations (''Kulturbünde'') in Germany, especially in the search for a new religion anchored in European and, more specifically, German culture. Both Hartmann and Drews shared an infatuation with history, and the belief in the direction of history, transmuted into a philosophical axiom by Hegel, was applied to the history of religion and mythology.

=== Influence of Albert Kalthoff and Bauer ===
Drews derived additional key ideas from [[Albert Kalthoff]] (1850–1906). Kalthoff was an active minister who managed to marry three times in his short life, and revived Bruno Bauer's Christ Myth thesis in his ''Das Christus-Problem. Grundlinien zu einer Sozialtheologie'' (''The Problem of Christ: Principles of a Social Theology'', 1902) and ''Die Entstehung des Christentums, Neue Beiträge zum Christusproblem'' (''The Rise of Christianity'', 1907). Kalthoff criticized what he regarded as the romanticist and sentimental image of Jesus as a "great personality" of history developed by German liberal theologians (including Albert Schweitzer). In Kalthoff's views, it was the early church that created the New Testament, not the reverse; the early Jesus movement was [[socialist]], expecting a social reform and a better world, which fused with the Jewish apocalyptic belief in a Messiah. Kalthoff saw Christianity as a social [[psychosis]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Drews accepted Kalthoff's ideas, but insisted that the original Christian socialism was religious, not economic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/enfant_terrible_im_talar.htm ''Enfant Terrible im Talar - Albert Kalthoff (1850-1906)'' Johannes Abresch - German text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051016/http://www.radikalkritik.de/enfant_terrible_im_talar.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egodeath.com/drewshistorymythiconlyjesus.htm#_Toc51777073 Arthur Drews, ''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present 1926'' - See chapter on Kalthoff]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critique of liberal theology ===

Drews did become an acerbic critic of what he called the "faulty [[historical method]]" of [[Liberal Christianity|academic liberal theologians]]. His primary critique of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] was that they were ancient, archaic myths from antiquity that had become [[Obsolescence|obsolete]], and "their concepts [are] foreign to our mindsets in the modern scientific age". He opposed the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[cult of personality]] applied to Jesus in what he referred to as the Christ myth. He rejected the attempt of liberal theologians like Albert Schweitzer to idolize a [[historical Jesus]] as a unique personality, which he asserted was the result of [[The Great Man Theory]] subjected to modern manipulations by scholars of the [[Historical Theology]] school. This view had been already advanced by Schweitzer himself in his review of [[historical criticism]] in Germany with his book ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]'' (1906).

In ''Die Religion als Selbst-bewusstsein Gottes : eine philosophische Untersuchung über das Wesen der Religion'' (''Religion as Self-Consciousness of God: a Philosophical Inquiry in the Essence of Religion'', 1906), Drews saw the phenomenon of religion through his philosophical approach as the self-consciousness of God through the mind of mankind. "Godmen" were to be replaced by "God-mankind", an adaptation of [[Georg Friedrich Hegel]]'s "World-Spirit".

In ''The Strong Personality'', Ch. 12 of "The Witness of the Gospels", Part IV of ''Christ Myth II'', Drews argues that the force of personality of ahuman Jesus cannot be at the source of Christendom's spread: &lt;blockquote&gt; [First, quoting Dupuis] Each man fights for his own chimera, not for history...in matters of religion ''the belief of many generations proves nothing but their own credulity''... ''A great error is propagated more easily than a great truth'', because it is ''easier to believe than to reflect'', and men ''prefer the wonders of romance'' to the plain facts of history... we might urge against Christians that the faith of any people in the miracles and oracles of its religion proved its truth; I doubt if they would admit the argument, and we will do the same with theirs. I know that they will say that they alone have the truth; but the other people say the same. &lt;br/&gt;[The Christ cult replaced the [[Mithras]] cult for reasons other than the force of personality]...the Persian Mithra was a very shadowy form beside Jesus, who ''came nearer to the heart'', especially of ''women, invalids, and the weak'', in his human features and on account of the ''touching description of his death''. But that shows at the most that the ''more concrete idea'' has the better prospect of triumphing in a spiritual struggle than ''the more abstract''; it proves nothing as regards the historical reality of the idea. Moreover, history teaches us that it was quite different causes—partly external and ''accidental causes'' of a political nature, such as the ''death in the Persian war of the Emperor Julian'', one of the most zealous followers of Mithra—that gave Christianity the victory over Mithraism. [emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He had been outspoken in presenting his views on religion with extreme clarity in ''Idea and Personality: Settlement of the Religious Crisis'', Ch. 14 of ''The Witness of the Gospels'', and Part IV of ''Christ Myth II''. Drews asserted that mankind cannot let the present be still shackled by what he called "past [[superstition]]s of ancient times". He outlined what he called the religion of the future, which he said must acknowledge the World-Spirit (geist) proclaimed by Hegel as God-mankind, which is God manifesting himself through history with human actors and oracles who are merely major agents. The cult of "great personalities" he dismissed as an illusion; individuals could no longer be seen as ''godmen'', just as revealers and oracles of the divinity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The purely historical conception of Jesus cannot satisfy the religious consciousness of our age. [It is] obsolete''. [Humanity] has not merely broken with the geocentric and anthropocentric view of the origin of Christianity, but has seen through the superstitious nature of ecclesiastical [[Christology]]. Modern humanity has, therefore, the task of again universalising the idea of divine redemption, or enlarging the idea of a god-''man''...to the idea of a ''god-''humanity''...&lt;br /&gt;

[It] returns in a certain sense to pre-Christian religion and its numerous “god-men,”... filled with the idea of the one reality and its spiritual nature, to which the various individuals are related only as ''modi'', phenomena, or'revelations, confiding in the divine control of the world, and therefore in its rationality and goodness...Thus man secures a faith in himself, in the divine nature of his being, in the rationality of existence; thus he is placed in a position to save himself, without a mediator, simply on account of his own divine nature... The religion of the future will either be a belief in the divine nature of the self, or will be nothing... no Christ is needed for it, and there is no ground for concern that religion may perish with the denial of the historicity of Jesus...&lt;br /&gt;
[The belief in Christ"] is not only superfluous, but mischievous. It loads the religious consciousness with doubtful historical ballast; it grants the past an authority over the religious life of the present, and it prevents men from deducing the real consequences of their Monistic religious principles. Hence I insist that the belief in the historical reality of Jesus is the chief obstacle to religious progress...

[No need to appeal to Hegel] to whom this high appreciation of the present above history may be traced, as well as this vindication of “personalities of world-history.” The great personality has clearly a value even in our own view: in it the unity of God and man, the God-mankind, attains a clearer expression. It serves as proof to the religious consciousness that God raises up the right man at the right time. It reveals the living connection of the common individual life with the universal spiritual life. The divinity lives in history, and reveals itself therein. History is, in union with nature, the sole place of divine activity... one continuous stream of divine activity flows through time... To bind up religion with history, as modern theologians do, and to represent an historical religion as the need of modern man, is no proof of insight, but of a determination... to recognise the Christian religion alone.&lt;ref name="ArthurDrewsNYT1911"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Studies of monism ===
Drews believed that religion was intimately linked to the prevalent beliefs of the social group and not just the expression of individual beliefs and faith. He reflected on the history of the great faiths of the world, the European history of the 19th century, and [[nationalism]]. His own mysticism, as a modern form of monism, glamorized the German idealism of the great German thinkers and poets as the superior form of future religion for mankind. It also was related to [[Spinoza|Spinoza's]] [[pantheism]], which also rejected Judaism and Christianity as ancient superstition no longer valid for the rationalism of our modern times.

Drews was especially drawn to [[Plotinus]], who founded [[Neoplatonism]] 600 years after the time of Plato. A year later, Drews edited ''Der Monismus: dargestellt in Beiträgen seiner Vertreter'', where he analyzes the major philosophers of monism. In 1913, he published ''History of Monism in Antiquity'' (1912) throughout the various schools of [[hellenistic philosophy]].

Drews thus managed to produce a modern system of philosophy joining the ancient idealism and monism of Plotinus's Neoplatonism and the modern historical idealism of Hegel, for whom the World-Spirit manifests itself in History. Towards the end of his life, Drews started writing more explicitly on what the idea of a monist God means in the context of modern Germany in the 1930s. ''God'' (1930) and ''The Word of God'' (1933) demonstrated his trend towards a German-inspired form of religion.

=== Astromythical views related to early Christianity ===
Drews was intrigued by the alleged influence of ancient [[astronomy]] on the origins of religion, developed by the French [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Volney]] and Dupuis{{clarify|date=August 2012}} and promoted throughout the 19th century. He included modern considerations on astromythical topics in some pages of his major books. The ''Appendix'' to his 1912 book ''The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus'' was an essay on the astral speculations of the Ancients in relation to Psalm 22. Hoffers notes that, in the 1921 book on ''The [[Gospel of Mark]] as a Witness against the Historicity of Jesus'', Drews demonstrates "how Mark reflects an astromythical triple journey along the [[zodiac]]". In 1923 Drews published a general introduction into astral mythology, ''Der sternhimmel in der Dichtung und Religion der Alten Völker und des Christentums, eine Einführung in die Astralmythologie'' (''The Celestial Sky in the Poetry and Religion of the Ancients and Christianity: an Introduction to Astral Mythology''), and its special influence on early Christianity. His interest remained a professional expression of curiosity and admitted speculations on relations detected by intuition and finesse, and never replaced rigorous text and historical criticism.

=== Other books on early Christianity ===
Drews also wrote a few more books on various aspects of Christianity where he systematically analyzes what he regarded as the mythical nature of the personages involved with Jesus Christ. Klaus Schilling wrote in his "English summary" to ''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present'':&lt;blockquote&gt; Drews was involved too deep into the subject to stop there, and went boldly further, exploring how Christianity could ''become a world religion without a historical founder'' or core group described in scripture... During the [First World] war, Schweitzer published more essays in a weak attempt to justify theology, which strengthened Drews' attitude and endeavor. [emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Legend of Peter'' (1910, translated into English in 1997 by [[Frank Zindler]]), Drews complains that "the confusion in educated circles...is so great and the posture of Rome so impudent", and exposes the completely legendary character of the figure of [[Saint Peter|Peter]], both in the Gospels and the fantastical history of Peter in Rome. According to Drews (in Klaus Schilling's "English Summary" of ''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus''): &lt;blockquote&gt;The Gospel is a poetic retelling of the astral mythical journey of the sun god, dressed in Tanakh pictures... The order of the tales follows almost strictly the astral mythical cycle. Mark's gospel is of astral magical, ''Gnostic origin from the middle of the second century''... Drews had published an introduction to astral mythology in the cultures of the Mediterranean and Iranian region up to imperial times, in order to decrease the above ignorance. But theologians continued to indulge in their self-induced ignorance. [emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1924 book ''The Origin of Christianity in Gnosticism'', Drews developed the hypothesis of the ''derivation of Christianity from a [[gnosticism]] environment''. In Drews's own words (in Klaus Schilling's "English Summary" of ''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus''): &lt;blockquote&gt;''Gnosticism is undeniably pre-Christian'', with both Jewish and gentile roots. The [[wisdom of Solomon]] already contained Gnostic elements and prototypes for the Jesus of the Gospels...God stops being the Lord of righteous deed and becomes the Good One...A clear pre-Christian Gnosticism can be distilled from the epistles of Paul. ''Paul is recklessly misunderstood by those who try to read anything Historical Jesus-ish into it''. The conversion of Paul in the Acts of the Apostles is a ''mere forgery from various Tanakh passages.''.. [The epistles] are from Christian mystics of the middle of the second century. ''Paul is thus the strongest witness against the Historical Jesus'' hypothesis...John's Gnostic origin is more evident than that of the synoptics. Its acceptance proves that even the Church wasn't concerned with historical facts at all. [emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Myth of Mary'' (1928), which reads as ''Jesus's Family and Entourage Exposed'', Drews asserted that all the characters around Jesus were as imaginary and fantastic as Jesus himself.

== Drews's activism for free religion and monism ==

===The need for a modern reform of religion===
One consequence of the success of the German school of historical criticism had been to instill an overt skepticism towards the Christian religion among the German population. A search for a German, non-Christian religion dated to pre-World War I times. Arthur Drews himself was a product of this emerging opposition to Christianity, expressed in his lifelong concern about the state of the Christian churches. After World War I, Germany became ''radicalized'', the skepticism towards the two established Christian churches and the search for a new kind of worship attuned to the national culture became a latent national preoccupation, as alluded to by Leonard Foster in his 1938 article on "The New Paganism and the Old Teutonic Religion".&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Forster, "The New Paganism and the Old Teutonic Religion" (1938) - in: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0483.1938.tb01855.x/abstract ''German Life and Letters''] 2a (2): 119-131.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Drews's concerns was about restoring the authenticity of religion in mankind. Both William Benjamin Smith and Arthur Drews denied the historicity of Jesus Christ, but, unlike most exponents of the myth thesis, they were dedicated theists who thought that by purging religion of all its legendary accretions, they were providing an important cleanup service and equipping it with the tools to efficiently withstand the onslaught of modern materialism.

Drews felt an urgent need to reform the structure of established religion, free it from its attachment to the primitive features of the early mythical Christianity. In ''Christ Myth II'' he glorifies the greatness of the German mind and complains: "How, then, can we be asked to admit that the salvation of modern times depends on a belief that has, in the Churches, degenerated into a stupid superstition?...Why, then, should we be compelled to take our religious possessions from the past? ...Are the ideas of a remote age and a degenerate culture to keep us under their power for ever?" Drews's books were released during a phase of profound turmoil in Germany and a restructuring of its religious scene. Repeatedly, Drews came back to the same theme of reform and started thinking about the nature of religion in the future.

=== The Free Religion movement ===
Drews was one of those scholars and intellectuals who were not averse to bringing their ideas to the public, especially, in his case, if it was for the cause of countering the influence of Christian churches. He was a religious activist, willing to descend into the public forum, stand up for his views, and harangue the crowds. The concern about a renewal of religion had been Drews's preoccupation all his life, along with many other Germans. Germany was going through a craze of forming all kinds of associations for matters of public concern, including religion. Alongside the established churches, Germany had seen a few important movements emerge with a liberated attitude towards religion. In 1859 the German Association of Free Religion Societies (''Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands'') was founded. This was followed in 1881 by the ''German Association of Freethinkers'' (''Deutscher [[:de:Freidenker|Freidenkerbund]]''), and in 1906 the ''German Association of Monists'' ([[:de:Deutscher Monistenbund|''Deutscher Monistenbund'']]).

Drews threw in his lot with both the Free Religion Association and the Monist Association, which were part of the Free Religion Movement ([[:de:Freireligiöse Bewegung|''Freireligiöse Bewegung'']]). In addition, Drews was a member of the new No-Confession Committee (''Komitee Konfessionslos''), formed in 1909, becoming president in 1912. The Komitee supported the Church Exist Movement [''Kirchenaustrittsbewegung''], which became very successful since its inception in 1905 for attracting lapsed members of other churches as well as scientists, academic personalities, and cultural celebrities. In 1924 Drews, who was the leader of the ''Free Religion Society of Karlsruhe'', joined a few other Societies of the Southwest to form a new Association of Free Religion for the Southwest(''Verband Freireligiöser Gemeinden Süd- und Westdeutschlands''), with a more religious and less political orientation than the other movements.

=== The Völkish movement ===
In opposition to the religious movements, a non-religious cultural current had gained some impetus: the so-called ''[[:de:Völkische Bewegung#Von der Jahrhundertwende bis zum Ende des Ersten Weltkriegs|Völkische Bewegung]]'' (Völkish movement), which dated back to the Romanticist movement of the 1850s, when the German revolutionary drives had been crushed by the arrival of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]. [[:de:Uwe Puschner|Uwe Puschner]] is a well-known historian of this movement. This movement had a popular base and combined various elements: extreme nationalism, anti-Christianity, a reverence for the mythical [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] past, racism, anti-semitism, and a revival of Germanic paganism.
This trend is described in the books by [[:de:Hubert Cancik|Hubert Cancik]] &amp; Uwe Puschner, ''Antisemitismus, Paganismus, Völkische Religion'' (''Anti-semitism, Paganism, and Völkish Religion'', 2004), and by [[:de:Stefan Breuer|Stefan Breuer]], ''Die Völkischen in Deutschland'' (''The Popular Societies in Germany,'' 2008). Although the Völkish Movement was different in ideology from National Socialism, Uwe Puschner has stressed that the two movements had great similarities and that the Völkish significantly contributed to the eventual success of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/voelkische-weltanschauung-und-bewegung Uwe Puschner: ''Völkische Weltanschauung und Bewegung''] (2008, "The Völkish Vision and Movement") - An excerpt from ''Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Gott. Völkische Weltanschauung und Bewegung'', ["One People, one Country, one God" - in [[:de:Bernd Sösemann|Bernd Sösemann]], ''Der Nationalsozialismus und die deutsche Gesellschaft'', (2002, ''National Socialism and German Society''), Munich&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The new popular myth of the superior German race ===
Drews had been a philosopher and an historian of philosophy, with a proselytizing drive for promoting his brand of idealistic monism. His interest in religion and mythology made him sensitive to the religious "essence" of social cultural beliefs. Romantic Nordic mysticism had become a prevalent fascination among the 19th-century German elite, such as Richard Wagner and contemporary artists, historians, and writers. It had unavoidably aroused Drews' attention for the old Teutonic beliefs that were much in vogue in Northern Europe.

Drews had seen in early Christianity a religion of promise of rebirth and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]] for a defeated and oppressed country (announcing the coming of the Kingdom of God), and the creation of a national myth giving hope to ancient occupied Palestinian Jews (an expectation of a [[Messiah|messianic]] leader and liberator). Jews were expecting that Palestine was going to go through its own course of death and rebirth.

During its rise in Germany, the Nazi Party included in its ideology the old Teutonic mysticism of the highly educated artistic and literary elite, and its propaganda vulgarized it into a crude, popular mass mythology of Germanic [[Aryan]] superiority with quasi-religious overtones, encouraging the fringe development of what came to be called [[Germanic neopaganism]]. Aging and close to death, Drews was struck by the theoretical parallel of early Christianity with modern National Socialist mysticism, a promise of national rebirth and transfiguration from an oppressed state and ofrenewed hope for a defeated country under the leadership of a new charismatic liberator, which resonated with his own concept of a future religion based on German monist idealism.

====German nationalism and repudiation of Christianity====
With the National Socialist Party's propaganda overwhelming the country, Drews's language in his last theological writings became increasingly focused on the concepts of glorified Germanness by opposition to the people of the [[Ancient Near East]], whose cultures had given rise to Greco-Roman classicism (including Drews' beloved Plotinus), but also Christianity — now all devalued and labeled as foreign races. Drews thus seemed convinced that the unconscious World Spirit had moved from the Mediterranean to Germany, and the philosopher had to go along.

Feeling in touch with the new cultural spirit of national rebirth and exalted hope in the future then prevailing in Germany, Drews started evangelizing on the theme of German nationalism, using it as another argument against Christianity. Thus, he wrote in ''Das Wort Gottes'' (''The Word of God'', 1933, p.&amp;nbsp;11): &lt;blockquote&gt;[Free Religion believers] are “German and not Romans…[and must reject] a determination of our faith on the Bible and its knowledge...Christendom is the expression of sunken times and of ''the mindset of a race foreign to us''…''Christendom has absolutely nothing to do with Germanness'' [Deutschtum]...and a German Christendom [would be] ''nonsense'' ... [As for Protestantism] with the blows it delivers on the Gospels, it is straight on its way to Rome... Jesus the Aryan [is] ''a pure ideal''. [There is] no reason [to assume] a Nordic origin of Jesus. [But the question of the origin of Jesus is secondary for Drews]...[Contrary to] believers in the Bible for whom Palestine is the 'Holy Land', for devotees of Free Religion, ''Germany is the Holy Land''. [The German is], as an Aryan, fundamentally Monist, (Pantheist), [contrary to dualist Christians. Free Religion is] the manifestation of the essence [''Wesensausdruck''] of our German people. [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Drews, ''Das Wort Gottes. Zur religiösen Lage der Gegenwart'', Mainz 1933, p. 11, 26 - In [http://www.freireligioese.de/bfgd/Magisterarbeit.pdf Christian G. Langenbach, ''Freireligiöse Gemeinden im Nationalsozialismus'', 2004] [''The Free Religion Societies in the NSDAP''], p. 59, 61, 66, 69, 87]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Drews systematically used monism in his battle against Christianity. Drews concluded that free religion was "the very expression of the being of our German people".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Drews, ''Richtlinien der Gemeinde Deutsch-Idealistischen Glaubens'', in Freie Religion, 1933, p. 77 - In [http://www.freireligioese.de/bfgd/Magisterarbeit.pdf Christian G. Langenbach, ''Freireligiöse Gemeinden im Nationalsozialismus'', 2004], [''The Free Religion Societies in the NSDAP''] p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Using the accoutrements of the rampant nationalistic fervor for his own agenda, Drews was still upholding his lofty ideals, but now in the form of a German monist idealism.

====Berdyaev's critique====

[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] (1874–1948) was a Russian philosopher of religion and politics. Writing in 1927 as a refugee from the Bolsheviks in a Paris threatened by Germany, he contends that Drews, as a religious anti-Semite, argues against the historical existence of Jesus for the religious life of Aryanism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Drews -- is a philosopher of the Hartmann school. In his capacity as an Hartmannist, he preaches a ''religion of pure spirit''. And he fights against the historicity of Jesus Christ in the name of a religion of spirit, he contends ''against the religious materialism'' which he detests. He is prepared to admit the existence of Christ, as the Logos. But for him ''the Logos never could have been incarnated into a man'' upon the earth, within earthly history. The ''religious materialism of Christianity is a legacy inherited from Judaism'', it is a Semitic graft, and Drews in his capacity ''as a religious anti-Semite'', struggles against this materialistic Semitic graft ''for the religious life of Aryanism'', expressing itself in its purest guise in India. Drews, just like E. Hartmann, is a resolute ''antagonist against Protestantism'' and the religion of Jesus. For him Jesus was not real, in the metaphysical sense that Christ is real. He is the ''antipode to Harnack'', a result of the splitting apart of the God-Man -- the polar opposite to the Jesusism of the Protestants. (With the Christian Myth was connected the teaching of Drews and E. Hartmann about the unconscious Divinity, which in a fit of madness created the vale of being and ''comes to consciousness through man''. cf. Drews, ''Die Religion als Selbstbewustsein Gottes''.) [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1927_318.html#9 Nikolai A. Berdyaev, "The Scientific Discipline of Religion and Christian Apologetics" (1927), ''Journal Put' '', No. 6, p. 50-68]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Drews was opposed to the theology of ancient Hebraism as much as he is ''opposed to Christianity'', and even more opposed to liberal Protestantism. This cannot be construed as a claim that Drews was a social anti-semite, as he was firmly opposed to social anti-semitism.

Drews shared the intense belief with the German elite of the sublimity of German consciousness (in art, literature, philosophy, and science), again re-iterated in his book ''Das Wort Gottes''. However, he saw religion as an expression of the unconscious World-Spirit anchored in a community tightly rooted on an ancestral territory. In the late 1920s and '30s, hoping to see Germany pull away from Christianity, his writings took on an even stronger German nationalist fervor left in the wake of the Nazis.

=== The German Faith movement ===
A thorough description of this religious movement was presented by Ulrich Nanko in his 1993 book on the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Nanko, ''Die Deutsche Glaubensbewegung. Eine historische und soziologische Untersuchung'', 1993 (Diagonal Verlag, Marburg) [''The German Faith Movement''] - with many citations in [http://www.freireligioese.de/bfgd/Magisterarbeit.pdf Christian G. Langenbach, ''Freireligiöse Gemeinden im Nationalsozialismus'' (2004) [''The Free Religion Societies in National Socialism''] p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Many adventurers were trying to ride the coattails of the Nazi success to establish new spiritual/religious movements. Among them were the founders of the new [[German Faith Movement]] (''[[Deutsche Glaubensbewegung]]''), founded by [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer|Jakob W. Hauer]] (1881–1962), and [[Ernst Graf zu Reventlow]] (1869–1943). Hauer had been a Protestant missionary in India, who had turned into a Sanskrit scholar imbued with the spirituality of [[Hinduism]] and a professor at the [[University of Tübingen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nazireligions.com/HTML/Newsroom/New-Religions-Nazi-Power.htm Joe Woodard, Pre-review of ''New Religions and the Nazis'', 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306003756/http://nazireligions.com/HTML/Newsroom/New-Religions-Nazi-Power.htm |date=2007-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His friend [[Ernst Graf zu Reventlow]] had been a navy officer, a journalist, and a Reichstag deputy who had joined the NSDAP in 1927. He was an influential Nazi party member, but one who never gained the trust of Hitler and never received a position from the Nazi government. The movement adopted as its official emblem the “Sun Cross”, an image of the sun forming a rounded shape with the Nazi swastika.

Hauer had started a religious movement that he wanted to expand with a larger group from the Völkish movement. Reventlow's cultural (but not racial) antisemitism led him to accept an alliance with Hauer in organizing a conference in July 1933 that would create another entity, the [[German Faith Movement]]. This new religious group became active in 1934. Hauer's ambition was to use Reventlow's NSDAP connections to engineer a unification of the Free Religion movement with the Völkish movement. As the movement developed, its objectives were revealed as follows: A state religion, anti-Christian with a Hinduism coloration, veneration of the sun, and pursuing a "species-true faith" for Germany, (a goal that resonated with Drews' hopes to see the emergence of a German religion). Also included were ''[[Blood and soil|Blood and Soil]]'' (''Blut und Boden''), racist values (blood descent), nationalism (ancestral land occupation), Völkish populism (fusion with the racist/antisemitic Völkish movement), and German neopaganism.

The Southwest Association for Free Religion, including Drews' Karlsruhe Society, had formed and Drews was invited to sit on the Working Committee of this new movement. The collaboration was short-lived, however. The new group's political objectives (dreams of becoming a state religion) clashed with the basic program of the Free Religion Societies, which were pursuing more limited interests of freer religion. In addition, racism and antisemitism, which had become more overt in the NSDAP's national policy after it had reached political power, became also quickly apparent as a major goal of Hauer and Reventlow. As a result, the Southwest Association of Free Religion, in which Drews' Karlsruhe Free Religion Society was a member, soon withdrew from the German Faith Movement.

The two leaders of the new group proved that they didn't have enough political pull. Hauer could not implement the planned fusion with the Völkish movement. Reventlow's connections did not bring any benefits from the Nazi government. Contrary to their hopes, the German Faith movement never became endorsed as a Nazi party organization, never obtained the privileges Hauer was seeking, and never achieved its latent goal of becoming legitimized as the state religion by the NSDAP, in a vain hope to duplicate the endorsement of the Catholic Church by the Roman Emperor Theodosius in 380 AD. Disillusioned, Hauer left in 1936, and joined the Party in 1937; Reventlow also left the movement early to resume the practice of Christianity and was still unable to gain Hitler's favor.

The anthropologist [[Karla Poewe]] has devoted her book ''New Religions and the Nazis'' (2005) to Hauer's attempt at founding a national religion.&lt;ref&gt;Karla Poewe, ''New Religions and the Nazis'', (2005, Routledge) p. 96 - [https://www.amazon.com/New-Religions-Nazis-Karla-Poewe/dp/0415290252/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343662328&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Karla+Poewe%2C+New+Religions+and+the+Nazis%2C Amazon listing &amp; reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Steigmann-Gall]], author of ''The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919-1945'' (2004), is another expert on this period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RreXLeUG_AIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Richard Steigmann-Gall, ''The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919-1945'' (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that Poewe, sharing "Hauer's sense of grandiosity", portrays Hauer as more significant than he was, making of "Hauer a 'truer' exemplar of Nazism than its own institutional incarnation". Whereas Hauer was at most a fellow traveler of the Nazis, a hanger-on with big ambition, "intent to appear relevant but ultimately rejected..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://egregores.blogspot.com/2010/02/karla-poewes-new-religions-and-nazis.html Richard Steignmann-Gall, Review of Karla Poewe's ''New Religions and the Nazis''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement never achieved more than the status of a small esoteric fringe group. It never managed to dent, let alone replace, Christianity in the land of Martin Luther. It turned out to be merely a cultural flash-in-the-pan, a curiosity in the complex landscape of Germany's religious life in the mid '30s. The NSDAP government changed its name in 1938 and jettisoned it as a nuisance that was incapable of displacing the two strong Christian churches in Germany, and only risked to alienate them against the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.com/articles/fascism/Nazi5Poewe1.html Koenraad Elst, ''The religion of the Nazis'' - Review of ''New Religions and the Nazis''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207124551/http://koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.com/articles/fascism/Nazi5Poewe1.html |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, in spite of Drews' hope to promote a new religion based on idealistic monism and pantheism of a distinct German character, the participation of the Karlsruhe Free Religion Society in Hauer's effort to unify the provincial Free Religion associations with the Völkish movement was short-lived and produced no results. Drews, an elitist thinker in the Hegel and Hartmann tradition, had been an advocate of the unconscious World Spirit as being the fundamental engine of religion acting in history through agents and oracles. He remained hostile to any religion based on a historic personality cult and, late in life, was confronted with the practical difficulty of translating his lofty ambitions to the simpler drives and requirements of a mass movement.

=== ''German Religion'' ===
Drews had been all his life opposed to any cult of a historical personality. It was one of his major criticisms of Christianity. The unconscious World-Spirit was larger than any individual — as he felt that great personalities were not godly, but simply its agents and expressions. Similarly, no modern form of religion could be based on the cult of a contemporary leader, even though it was the tendency of the NSDAP ideology. But the NSDAP never went all the way, and didn't try to impose a new religion to displace Christianity, which was still a strong force in Germany and which had been partly accepted by the new Nazi leadership. The NSDAP quickly got rid of the German Faith Movement, which had proven to be an unnecessary nuisance.

All his life, in most of his books, Drews had been concerned by the obsolete survival of Christianity, foreseeing its eventual disappearance, and insisting on the urgent need to define and implement the religion of the future. Drews's book, ''Deutsche Religion: Grundzüge eines Gottesglaubens im Geiste des deutschen Idealismus'' (''German religion: Principles of a Belief in God in the Spirit of German Idealism''), was published in 1935, the year of his death, and would be his final message as he died the same year at 70. In it, he tried to adjust his lifelong beliefs in idealistic monism to the perspective of the new social situation in Germany. The philosopher's conscience had to move with the flow of the Unconscious World Spirit.

Drews's book is included in a catalogue of Nazi Collection Research Resources at the [[Ball State University]] library. The citation for the book describes it as a "Work on the 'new' German religion that mixes faith and Nazi mysticism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsu.edu/libraries/archives/guides/NaziCollectionBibliography2009.pdf ''Nazi Collection Research Resources'', p. 12.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913212716/http://www.bsu.edu/libraries/archives/guides/NaziCollectionBibliography2009.pdf |date=September 13, 2012 }} A catalogue of 64 p. compiled by student Amanda Morrison, edited by Maren Read, 2006, updated in 2009, in the "Archives and Special Collections, University Libraries”, Ball State Un. Library. The collection was a gift from a collector, and the catalogue PDF is accessible online.&lt;/ref&gt; This description, likely entered by the collector, painted Drews's book with the Nazi ideology brush and reflects a popular misconception that is not scholarly justified and does not reflect the 1935 German text. For Drews, "faith" meant faith in the unconscious World-Spirit, which for him is the divine manifested in history through human consciousness; and Nazi mysticism, if based on the cult of a personality, mythical or historical — be it Zeus, Mithras, Jesus Christ, Napoleon, or ''Der Führer'' — was the primary kind of mysticism that Drews always dismissed as a caricature of religion.

What Drews had endeavored to do was to stress the potential development of his own idealistic kind of monist religion in the form of Free Religion with a nationalistic German character. He had never become a Nazi Party activist. His very brief involvement, before his death in 1935, with the aborted attempt of the Southwest Association for Free Religion to join the brand-new venture called the German Faith Movement, was misinterpreted as his "having lent his support to the early attempts to unite the various German pagan organizations into a unified body", a description that tended to make Drews wrongly appear as a promoter of old Teutonic values and neopaganism, in complete opposition to his lifelong beliefs in idealism and monism.

Critics of Drews like to present a much simplified and distorted version of events of his last two years, unable or unwilling to understand his motivations and ambitions. They forget to mention that Drews and his Free Religion colleagues abandoned the [[German Faith Movement]] anddissociated themselves from Hauer and Reventlow as soon as it became clear that the two leaders' ambition was much more political than religious. Drews was not interested in old mythical values. He put his last ounces of energy, just before his death, into writing a theoretical treatise to repeat his old message, urging a renewal of religion in the future, this time with a more pronounced German character, but still anchored on the German Idealism that he had been promoting ever since his youthful infatuation with Eduard von Hartmann.

=== Against anti-Semitism ===

Among the many reservations about the German Faith Movement, one reason for abandoning it was what Drews and others perceived as blatant antisemitism. Drews objected to the racist assumption in antisemitism in an article, Jesus the Aryan (''Jesus der Arier,'' 1934) where he paid homage to the courage and moral fiber of the Jews through history and to the ancient Hebrew prophets who transformed the primitive god of wrath into a god of mercy in the ''Psalms'', ''Proverbs'', and ''Wisdom'' books:

&lt;blockquote&gt; [Drews denies that] a Jew cannot be driven by liberty and courage... [Drews mentioned the] fights for freedom of the ''Maccabees'', the fatal defense of Jerusalem against the Romans and the last desperate fight of the Jews in the ''Bar Kokhba wars'' [the third and last Jewish war against the Roman army, that led to the final destruction of the Jewish state in Palestine]. [In the same vein, Drews referred to the courage of those] poor Jews of the ''medieval Ghetto'' who preferred to endure a thousand dead rather than renounce their faith, and climbed, still self-controlled, to the stakes...[the Jewish prophets] impassioned by freedom and courage...[who] never feared jail, exile, or death...[In the course of the progress of the Jewish religion] the desert god Yahweh of the Old Testament has ''become larger, more tolerant, more humane, more friendly''...[so that] from an angry and authoritarian god he changed ''into a merciful god'', who is all goodness and love, ''the god from the Psalms, the Proverbs and the Wisdom writings''. [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Drews, ''Jesus der Arier'' ["Jesus, the Aryan"], In ''Freie Religion'', 1934, pp. 18–26 - In [http://www.freireligioese.de/bfgd/Magisterarbeit.pdf Christian G. Langenbach, ''Freireligiöse Gemeinden im Nationalsozialismus'', 2004],[''The Free Religion Societies in the NSDAP''] p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contrary to other Free Religion devotees who parroted the slogans of the NSDAP propaganda, Drews engaged in a real discussion with Jewish intellectuals and scholars. He was able to deliver a tribute to the Jewish faith, which, on one hand, brought to light its differences with Free Religion, but also showed respect to people who had other thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freireligioese.de/bfgd/Magisterarbeit.pdf Christian G. Langenbach, ''Freireligiöse Gemeinden im Nationalsozialismus'', &amp;#91;''The Free Religion Societies in the NSDAP''&amp;#93; 2004], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Drews died on 19 July 1935 in Illenau, [[Achern]] (near [[Bühl (Baden)|Bühl]]), [[Republic of Baden|Baden]] at the age of 70.

== Re-evaluation of Drews by Bernhard Hoffers ==
Germany has been struggling with the legacy of the Nazi era and is still in the process of [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitating]] its exceptional scholars. Bernhardt Hoffers, in his 2003 biographical eulogy, took up the challenge of restoring Drews's reputation that he felt had been unfairly tarnished. He stressed the following facts: He highlighted that Drews, during his life, had been an irritant, continually encroaching on the turf of many specialists in German universities: in theology, philology, astronomy, mythology, music criticism, and psychology. Specialists didn't welcome his interference and even resented him as an outsider. Drews had been regarded as a maverick; his philosophy stood outside of academia, which didn't accept his dilettantism (''Abweichungen von der communis opinio''). Hartmann was not in vogue, either, and Drews' dependence on this old professor was another hindrance. Drews created no school and had no followers in Germany. He had to remain a teacher in his Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe for the rest of his life.

Drews' support of Wagner and opposition to Nietzsche did nothing to improve his standing. He met with the studied indifference [''das Ignorieren''] and the silence [''das Totschweigen''] of the academic pundits, while his international public popularity and press coverage were increasing. Even the University of Karlsruhe, in the very town where he lived and taught, didn't want to mention his name. His treatment at the hands of academics was similar to those of William B. Smith in the US, John M. Robertson and later George A. Wells in England, and Paul-Louis Couchoud in France.

After his death his name was largely forgotten. He was mentioned in the German media mostly for having advocated the need for a religion renewal, and in the literature about Wagner and Nietzsche. His work was omitted or grossly misrepresented and discredited in major German reference books. His books in Germany are now hard to find. However, his book on Plotinus is still in demand, the ''Christ Myth'' is widely available in the English-speaking world, and Hermann Detering of ''Radikalkritik'' continues to make the ''Denial of the Historicity of Jesus'' still available..

Drews had been fighting all his life for acceptance and recognition in Germany and for tenure at a university. In spite of his enormous scholarly output, and his popularity, he never was able to obtain a university position. One has to understand why, at the end of his life, Drews was expressing a hope for a renewal of Germany. Hoffers, for the sake of fairness, remarked that Drews never was a member of the Nazi party, and spoke out early against growing antisemitism in the 1920s . He never was involved in any action against Jewish intellectuals, artists, and academics. Whereas, for instance, a philosopher like [[Heidegger]] was more visibly active in the Nazi movement, as Rüdiger Safranski has described in detail in ''Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil'' (1999).

Hoffers emphasized that "As a scholar, Drews had always been objective and honest’‘." In spite of scholarly differences, he maintained a friendship with Schweitzer for a while. He was a polyglot and collected Japanese art prints. He was a gifted, energetic man, with a tremendous capacity for work. He gained the esteem of [[Gustaaf Adolf van den Bergh van Eysinga|van den Bergh van Eysinga]], the leader of the [[Radical criticism|Dutch Radical school]], who viewed him as a" good guy" (''ein netter Kerl'').

In conclusion, Hoffers urged scholars to renew an acquaintance with Drews' books. Claiming that the arguments developed in his work were outmoded or refuted [''überholt''] is unjustified. As a parting shot, Hoffers asks a pertinent question: "Is it really true that the question of Jesus's historicity has been absolutely clarified and is moreover uninteresting, as can be heard in discussions with theologians? (''Ist es wirklich so, dass die Frage nach der Historizität Jesu absolut geklärt und obendrein noch so nebensächlich ist, wie man in Gesprächen mit Theologen zu hören bekommt?'')." Hoffers concludes that Drews's life was a fascinating chapter of the ''zeitgeschichte'' (history of our times).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/Arthur_Drews.htm Dr. Bernhard Hoffers, "Arthur Drews (1865 – 1935)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723063129/http://www.radikalkritik.de/Arthur_Drews.htm |date=July 23, 2012 }} - a eulogy and biographical lecture, Karlsruhe, April 2003 (in German).

'''Arthur Findlay College''' is a college of [[Spiritualism]] and psychic sciences at [[Stansted Hall]] in [[Stansted Mountfitchet]], [[Essex]], [[England]].

[[Stansted Hall]] was built in 1871, and the college was founded there in 1964. In accordance with [[Arthur Findlay]]'s wishes, the college building and grounds are administered by the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] (SNU). The head offices of SNU at Red Woods are within the college grounds.  Course prices include daily meals, tuition and accommodations.

== History of Stansted Hall ==

Stansted Hall, built in 1871, was given to the Spiritualists' National Union in by J. Arthur Findlay, MBE, JP, a former Honorary President of the Union, and in accordance with his wishes is administered by the Union as a College for the advancement of Psychic Science.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Simon. ''How to be a ghostbuster'', [[The Independent]], 27 February 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr Findlay bought the estate in 1923 upon his retirement from business and first mooted the idea of a Spiritualist College at Stansted to the Union in 1945. After personal contacts with three successive Union Presidents a will was drawn up and in 1954 the National Council accepted the proposed bequest of Stansted Hall with an endowment. This was followed by a later gift in the form of stock to be used for furnishing and decorating, and in 1964, a year after the death of his wife, Mr Findlay transferred the Hall, grounds and endowment to the Union. Mr Findlay died in July 1964.

'''[[Buddhism]] in [[Myanmar]]''' is practiced by 90% of the country's population, and is predominantly of the [[Theravada]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127266.htm |title=Burma—International Religious Freedom Report 2009 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most religious Buddhist country in terms of the proportion of monks in the population and proportion of income spent on religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cone &amp; Gombrich, ''Perfect Generosity of Prince Vessantara'', Oxford University Press, 1977, page xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents are most likely found among the dominant [[Bamar people]], [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Zo people|Zo]], and [[Chinese people in Myanmar|Chinese]] who are well integrated into Burmese society. [[Bhikkhu|Monks]], collectively known as the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]], are venerated members of Burmese society. Among many ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Bamar and Shan, Theravada Buddhism is practised in conjunction with [[nat (spirit)|nat worship]], which involves the placation of spirits who can intercede in worldly affairs.

With regard to the daily routines of Buddhists in Myanmar, there are two most popular practices: [[merit-making]] and [[vipassanā]]. The [[weizza]] path is the least popular; it is an esoteric form somewhat linked to Buddhist aspiration that involves the [[occult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Myanmar |url=|author=Pranke, Patrick A |year=2013 |publisher=Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Macmillan Reference USA. |ISBN=0-02-865718-7 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merit-making is the most common path undertaken by Burmese Buddhists. This path involves the observance of the [[Five Precepts]] and accumulation of good [[merit (Buddhism)|merit]] through charity and good deeds ([[dāna|dana]]) to obtain a favourable rebirth. The vipassana path, which has gained ground since the early 1900s, is a form of insight meditation believed to lead to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. The weizza path is an esoteric system of occult practices (such as recitation of spells, [[samatha]] and alchemy) believed to lead to life as a ''weizza'' (also spelt ''weikza''), a semi-immortal and supernatural being who awaits the appearance of the [[Buddhahood|future Buddha]], [[Maitreya]] (Arimeitaya).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Masters of the Buddhist Occult: The Burmese Weikzas |last=Ferguson |first=John P. |author2=E.

[[File:An account of an embassy to the kingdom of Ava 00247-s.gif|thumb|upright|Illustration of a [[bhikkhu]] (1795)]]

The history of Buddhism in Myanmar probably extends more than two thousand years.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The ''[[Sasana Vamsa|Sāsana Vaṃsa]]'' (Burmese ''Thathana Win''), written by Pinyasami in 1834, summarises much of the history of Buddhism in Myanmar. According to the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', a [[Pali]] chronicle of fifth century [[Sri Lanka]], [[Ashoka]] sent two [[bhikkhu]]s, Sona and Uttara, to [[Suvarnabhumi]] around 228 BC with other monks and sacred texts, including books.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

An [[Andhra Ikshvaku]] inscription from about the 3rd century refers to the conversion of the Kiratas to Buddhism, who are thought to have been [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman-speaking]] peoples of Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sylvain Lévi]], "Concept of Tribal Society" ''in'' {{cite book|editor1-last=Pfeffer|editor1-first=Georg|editor2-last=Behera|editor2-first=Deepak Kumar|title=Concept of tribal society|date=2002|publisher=Concept Pub. Co|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8170229834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Chinese texts of about the same date speak of a "Kingdom of Liu-Yang," where all people worshiped the Buddha and there were several thousand [[Śramaṇa|samaṇas]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This kingdom has been identified with a region somewhere in central Burma. A series of epigraphic records in [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] datable to the 6th and 7th centuries, has been recovered from Central and [[Lower Burma]] ([[Pyay]] and [[Yangon]]). From the 11th to 13th centuries, the Bamar kings and queens of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] built countless stupas and temples.

The [[Ari Buddhism]] era included the worship of [[bodhisattva]]s and [[nāga]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Theravada Buddhism was implanted at [[Bagan]] for the first time as early as the 11th century by the Bamar king [[Anawrahta]] (1044-1077).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lieberman|first=Victor B|title=Strange Parallels: Southeast Asia in Global Context, C. 800-1830, Volume 1: Integration on the Mainland|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80496-7|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In year 1057, Anawratha sent an army to conquer the [[Mon people|Mon]] city of [[Thaton]] to obtain the''[[Tripiṭaka|Tipiṭāka]]'' of the [[Pāli Canon]]. He was converted by a Mon [[bhikkhu]], [[Shin Arahan]], to Theravada Buddhism. Shin Arahan's advice led to acquiring thirty sets of Pali scriptures from the Mon king [[Manuha]] by force. Mon culture, from that point, came to be largely assimilated into the Bamar culture based in Bagan.

Despite attempts at reform, certain features of Ari Buddhism and traditional [[nat (spirit)|nat worship]] continued, such as reverence for the bodhisattva [[Avalokiteśvara]] (''Lawka nat'').

Successive kings of Bagan continued to build large numbers of monuments, temples, and pagodas in honour of Buddhism, and there is inscriptional evidence of a Theravadin vihara for [[bhikkhuni]]s from 1279.

Burmese rule at Bagan continued until the [[first Mongol invasion of Burma]] in 1287. Towards the end of the 13th century, Buddhism declined due to the invading Tatars.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In the 14th century, another lineage was imported from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], the capital of the [[Thai people|Thai]] [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]. A new ordination line, that of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], thus entered Myanmar.

The [[Shan people|Shan]], meanwhile, established themselves as rulers throughout the region now known as Myanmar. Thihathu, a Shan king, established rule in Bagan by patronising and building many monasteries and pagodas.

The [[Mon people|Mon]] kingdoms, often ruled by Shan chieftains, fostered Theravada Buddhism in the 14th century. Wareru, who became king of [[Mottama]], patronised Buddhism, and established a code of law, the ''[[Dhammasattha]]'', compiled by Buddhist monastics. King [[Dhammazedi]], formerly a Mon bhikkhu, established rule in the late 15th century at [[Inwa]] and unified the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] in Mon territories. He also standardised ordination of monks set out in the Kalyani Inscriptions. Dhammazedi moved the capital back to Hanthawaddy ([[Bago, Burma|Bago]]). His mother-in-law, Queen [[Shin Sawbu]], was also a great patron of Buddhism. She is credited for expanding and gilding the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], giving her own weight in gold.

The Bamars, who had fled to [[Taungoo]] before the invading Shan, established a kingdom there under the reigns of [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]], who conquered and unified most of modern Myanmar. These monarchs also embraced Mon culture and patronised Theravada Buddhism.

[[File:Kuthodaw paya.JPG|thumb|Mandalay's Kuthodaw Pagoda, which houses marble slabs containing all of the Tipitaka scriptures, was constructed during the reign of King Mindon.]]

In the reigns of succeeding kings, the [[Taungoo Dynasty]] became increasingly volatile and was overthrown by the Mon. In the mid-18th century, King [[Alaungpaya]] defeated the Mon, expanded the Bamar kingdoms, and established the [[Konbaung Dynasty]]. Under the rule of [[Bodawpaya]], a son of Alaungpaya, a unified sect of monks ("Thudhamma") was created within the kingdom. Bodawpaya restored ties with Sri Lanka, allowing for mutual influence in religious affairs. During the reigns of the Konbaung kings that followed, both secular and religious literary works were created.&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Michael W. (2006) ''Powerful Learning. Buddhist Literati and the Throne in Burma's Last Dynasty, 1752-1885''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan. http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=225773&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Mindon Min]] moved his capital to [[Mandalay]].

After [[Lower Burma]] had been conquered by the British, [[Christianity]] began to gain acceptance. Many monks from Lower Burma had resettled in Mandalay, but by decree of Mindon Min, they returned to serve the Buddhist laypeople. Schisms arose in the sangha; they were resolved during the [[Fifth Buddhist council|Fifth Buddhist Synod]], held in Mandalay in 1871.

The Fifth Council was convened at Mandalay in Myanmar on the first waning day of Tazaungmone, 1232 Myanmar Era, 2415 B.E (November 1871). The scriptures inscribed on palm-leaves could not last for a long time. Besides there might be many variations in rewriting the scriptures from copy to copy. Therefore, the scriptures were inscribed on marble slabs to dispel these disadvantages.

Two thousand and four hundred bhikkhus led by Venerable Jagarabhivamsa Thera (Tipitakadhara Mahadhammarajadhirajaguru) of Dakkhinarama Monastery, Mandalay, convened, to recite and approve the scriptures. King Mindon initiated and supported the Fifth Great Council to the end. The scriptures were first inscribed on seven hundred and twenty-nine marble slabs ) in the precinct of Lokamarajina Pagoda at the foot of Mandalay Hill. From 1860 to 1868, the Tipitaka was engraved on 729 marble slabs and assembled in the [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]]. It took seven years, six months and fourteen days to finish this work. Then the bhikkhus recited to approve the inscriptions for five months and three days. In 1871, a new ''hti'' (the gold umbrella that crowns a [[stupa]]) encrusted with jewels from the crown was also donated by Mindon Min for the Shwedagon now in British Burma. After the Fifth Great Council. the Pali Texts were translated into Myanmar language, and the Doctrinal Order was promulgated to the whole country for purpose of purification and propagation of the Buddha's Teachings.

[[File:Shwekyin.jpg|thumb|In February 2012, 1000 Buddhist monks and followers gathered for the 18th annual [[Shwegyin Nikaya]] Conference at the compound of Dhammaduta Zetawon Tawya Monastery in [[Hmawbi Township]], [[Yangon Region]].]]
During the British administration of Lower and Upper Burma, also known as ''Burma Proper'', government policies were secular which meant monks were not protected by law. Nor was Buddhism patronised by the colonial government. This resulted in tensions between the colonised Buddhists and their European rulers. There was much opposition (including by the Irish monk [[U Dhammaloka]]) to the efforts by Christian missionaries to convert the Burmese people, Bamar, Shan, Mon, Rakhine and plains Karen, with one exception - the hill tribes. Today, Christianity is most commonly practised by the [[Kuki people|Kuki]], [[Jingpo people|Kachin]], and the [[Karen people|Kayin]]. Notwithstanding traditional avoidance of political activity, monks often participated in politics and in the struggle for independence.

Since 1948 when the country gained its independence from [[Great Britain]], both civil and military governments have supported Theravada Buddhism. The 1947 Constitution states, "The State recognizes the special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens of the Union." The Ministry of Religious Affairs, created in 1948, was responsible for administering Buddhist affairs in Myanmar. In 1954, the prime minister, [[U Nu]], convened the [[Sixth Buddhist council|Sixth Buddhist Synod]] at [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in [[Yangon|Rangoon]] (Yangon), which was attended by 2,500 monks, and established the World Buddhist University.

During the military rule of [[Ne Win]] (1962–1988), he attempted to reform Myanmar under the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]] which contained elements of Buddhism. In the [[8888 Uprising]], many monks participated and were killed by [[Tatmadaw]] soldiers. The succeeding military regime, the [[State Peace and Development Council]] (SPDC) patronised Buddhism, although persecution of Buddhists contrary to the regime, as well as persons of other religions, namely Islam and Christianity, continues.

==Traditions==
[[File:Hsun laung, Mandalay, Myanmar.JPG|thumb|Monks throughout Myanmar make alms rounds around the community in the early morning.]]
The [[culture of Myanmar]] is deemed synonymous with its Buddhism. There are many Burmese festivals all through the year, most of them related to [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="YCDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yangoncity.com.mm/1.About_ygn/9.festival/default.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614002657/http://www.yangoncity.com.mm/1.About_ygn/9.festival/default.asp|archivedate=14 June 2012|title=Introducing Myanmar Festivals|publisher=Yangon City Development Committee|accessdate=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese New Year, ''[[Thingyan]]'', also known as the [[Water Festival]], has its origins in [[Hinduism]] but it is also a time when many Burmese boys celebrate ''[[shinbyu]]'', a special [[rite of passage]] by which a boy enters the [[kyaung]] for a short time as a [[Śrāmaṇera|sāmaṇera]].

===Veneration===
[[File:A Buddhist Altar at Tai Yin Thar Kyay Ywar (Yangon) by TT.JPG|thumb|A typical home altar consists of a simple shelf on which statues of the Buddha and offerings are placed..]]
A Burmese Buddhist household contains an altar or shrine to the Buddha, with at least one dedicated image of the Gautama Buddha. The Buddha image is commonly placed on a "throne" called a ''[[Palin (shrine)|gaw pallin]]'' ({{lang|my|ဂေါ့ပလ္လင်}}, from [[Pali]] ''pallanka'').

Before a Buddha statue is used for veneration at home, it must be formally consecrated, in a ritual called ''[[buddhābhiseka]]'' or ''anay gaza tin'' ({{lang|my|[[:my:အနေကဇာတင်ခြင်း|အနေကဇာတင်ခြင်း]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usamyanmar.net/Buddha/Article/Buddha%20Shrine.pdf|title=Preparation for A Place of Worship At Home|last=Paw|first=Maung H.|page=4|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consecration, led by a Buddhist monk, who recites ''aneka jāti saṃsāraṃ'' (translated as 'through the round of many births I roamed'), the 153rd verse of the [[Dhammapada]] (found in the 11th chapter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismyanmar.com/nibbana/dmpdth2a.htm |title=Words spoken by Lord Buddha on the day of Supreme Enlightenment- |author=Ashin Kundalabhivamsa |author2=Nibbana.com |accessdate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013231706/http://www.thisismyanmar.com/nibbana/dmpdth2a.htm |archivedate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.11.than.html|title=Jaravagga: Aging|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|year=1997|work=Access to Insight|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consecration rite, which can last a few hours, is held in the morning and consists of four primary parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swearer|first=Donald K.|title=Becoming the Buddha: the ritual of image consecration in Thailand|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|pages=218–219|isbn=978-0-691-11435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Offerings (candles, flowers, incense, flags) made to the Buddha
# Chanting of ''[[paritta]]'' (typically [[Mangala Sutta]], [[Metta Sutta]], [[Ratana Sutta]], Pubbhana Sutta)
# Recitation of ''aneka jāti saṃsāraṃ''
# Recitation of the [[Twelve Nidānas]]

The consecration rituals are believed to imbue the Buddha image with a sacred quality that can protect the home and surroundings from misfortune and symbolically embody the powers of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schober|first=Juliane|title=Sacred biography in the Buddhist traditions of South and Southeast Asia|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=2002|pages=275–276|isbn=978-81-208-1812-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinbyu===
[[File:Monastery Buddhist altar, Taunggyi.jpg|thumb|A traditional Buddhist altar at a [[kyaung]] in Taunggyi, Shan State.]]
It is the most important duty of all Burmese parents to make sure their sons are admitted to the Buddhist ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]'' by performing a shinbyu ceremony once they have reached the age of seven or older. A symbolic procession and ceremony of exchanging princely attire with that of an ascetic follows the example of [[Gautama Buddha]]. He was born a royal prince named Siddartha Gautama, but left his palace on horseback followed by his loyal attendant Chanda ({{lang|my|မောင်ဆန်း}}) after he found out that life is made up of suffering ([[dukkha]]) and the notion of self is merely an illusion ([[anatta]]) when one day he saw the "Four Great Signs" ({{lang|my|နမိတ်ကြီးလေးပါး}}) - the old, the sick, the dead, and the ascetic - in the royal gardens.

All Buddhists are required to keep the basic [[Five Precepts]] ({{lang|my|ငါးပါးသီလ}}), and novices are expected to keep the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|Ten Precepts]] ({{lang|my|ဆယ္ပါးသီလ}}). Parents expect them to stay at the kyaung immersed in the teachings of the Buddha as members of the Sangha for three months or longer. They will have another opportunity to join the Sangha at the age of 20, taking the [[upasampada]] ordination, to become a fully ordained [[bhikkhu]], keeping the 227 precepts of the full monastic rules or [[Prātimokṣa|Pātimokkha]] and perhaps remain a monk for life.

===Buddhist holidays===
[[File:Vesak celebrated by watering the Bodhi tree..JPG|thumb|[[Vesak]], the full moon of ''Kason'', is celebrated by watering the [[Bodhi Tree]]]]
Thingyan usually falls in mid-April and tops the list of [[Public holidays in Myanmar]]. [[Vesak]], the full moon in May, is the most sacred of all as the Buddha was born, became [[bodhi|enlightened]], and entered [[parinirvana|parinibbana]] (died) on the same day. It is celebrated by watering the [[Bodhi Tree]].&lt;ref name="YCDC"/&gt;

[[Pagoda festival]]s ({{lang|my|ဘုရားပွဲ}} ''Paya pwè'') held throughout the country also usually fall on full moon days and most of them will be on the full moon of Tabaung (February/March) including the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]].&lt;ref name="YCDC"/&gt; They attract not only crowds of pilgrims from near and far, often in caravans of bullock carts, but they also double as great market fairs where both local and itinerant traders set up their stalls and shops among food stalls, restaurants, and free open-air stage performances as well as theatre halls.

===Vassa===
The three [[monsoon]] months from mid-July to mid-October is [[Vassa]] ({{lang|my|ဝါတွင်း}}, {{IPA-my|wàdwɪ́ɴ}}), a time when people are busy tilling their land and planting the rice paddies and [[bhikkhu]]s remain in [[kyaung]]s. New robes are offered to bhikkhus at the beginning of Vassa, the end of which is marked by the [[Thadingyut Festival]].

After the harvest, robes are again offered at [[Kathina]] ({{IPA-my|kətʰèɪɴ}}), usually held during October or November.&lt;ref name="YCDC"/&gt; [[Uposatha]] days are observed by keeping the [[Five Precepts#Eight Precepts|Eight Precepts]] by laypersons during Thingyan and Vassa and by devout Buddhists all the year round.

Parents and elders also receive obeisance from younger members of the family at the beginning as well as the end of lent, after the tradition established by the Buddha himself. It was during Vassa that he ascended to the [[Trāyastriṃśa|Tāvatiṃsa Heaven]] to preach a sermon, as an act of gratitude, to his mother who had become a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]], and he was welcomed back to earth with a great festival of lights.&lt;ref name="YCDC"/&gt; Teachers receive the same obeisance, a tradition started by National Schools founded in defiance of the colonial administration and continued after independence by state schools.

Wedding ceremonies - nothing to do with religion and not conducted by the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] - are not held during the three months of Vassa, a custom which has resulted in a spate of weddings after Thadingyut or ''Wa-kyut'', awaited impatiently by couples wanting to tie the knot.

===Buddhist education===
[[File:Monk examinations, Bago, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|Monks take an examination in Bago.]]
Theravadins send their children to kyaungs to receive a Buddhist education, learning the [[Pāli Canon]], the life story of [[Gautama Buddha]], the 550 [[Jataka tales]] - most importantly the Ten Great Incarnations and the 38 Buddhist Beatitudes - as soon as they have a good grounding of [[the three Rs]]. Monks were the traditional teachers of the young and old alike until secular and missionary schools came into being during the British colonial administration.

There has been a revival of monastic schools since the 1990s with the deepening economic crisis. Children from poor families that can ill afford fees, uniforms and books have renewed the demand for a free monastic education, and [[minority group]]s such as the Shan, [[Pa'O people|Pa'O]], [[Palaung people|Palaung]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]] and [[Wa people|Wa]] are benefitting from this revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7329 |title=Save Our Schools |author=Htet Aung |publisher=''Irrawaddy'' 30 May 2007 |accessdate=3 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195555/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7329 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of Burmese monks wear [[maroon]] robes, while others wear [[ochre]], unlike in neighbouring Theravada countries like Thailand, Laos and Sri Lanka, where monks commonly wear [[saffron]] robes.

== Women ==
{{main article|Ordination of women in Buddhism}}
[[File:YangonNuns.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Thilashin during alms round in [[Yangon]].]]
The full [[bhikkhuni]] (nuns) lineage of Theravada Buddhism died out, and for various technical and social reasons was therefore permanently absent. The governing council of Buddhism in Myanmar has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. However, as in many other Theravadin countries, women have created a niche for themselves as renunciants not recognised by the state-empowered [[Sangharaja]] or even the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] in general. In Myanmar, these women are called [[thilashin]].&lt;ref&gt;The Buddhist world of Southeast Asia By Donald K. Swearer&lt;/ref&gt;  A thilashin ({{lang-my|သီလရှင်}}, {{IPA-my|θìla̰ʃɪ̀ɴ|pron}}, "possessor of morality", from [[Pali]] ''[[Śīla|sīla]]'') is a female lay renunciant whose vows are the same as those of [[Śrāmaṇerī|sāmaṇerīs]] "novitiate nuns". Like the [[maechi]] of neighbouring [[Thailand]] and the [[dasa sil mata]] of [[Sri Lanka]], thilashin occupy a position somewhere between that of an ordinary lay follower and an ordained monastic. However, they are treated more favourably than most maechi, being able to receive training, practice meditation and sit for the same qualification examinations as the monks.

Thilashins observe the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|ten precepts]] and can be recognised by their pink robes, shaven head, orange or brown shawl and metal alms bowl. Thilashins go out on alms rounds on [[uposatha]] and receive uncooked rice or money.

Thilashins are addressed with the honorifics [[Burmese names#Honorifics|''sayale'']] ({{lang-my|ဆရာလေး}}, {{IPA-my|sʰəjàlé|}} "little teacher") and [[Burmese names#Honorifics|''daw'']] ({{lang|my|ဒေါ်}}, {{IPA-my|dɔ̀|}}). These are used as honorifics to the Buddhist name given.

Thilashins often reside in either separate quarters or in segregated [[kyaung]] (temple-monasteries). They do not have to look after the monks, but may help cook if required. Although ranked lower than the monks, they are not subservient to them.

There have been efforts by some thilashins to reinstate the bhikkhuni lineage, although there are reservations from the government and general populace. A new Theravada bhikkhuni sangha was first convened in 1996, and since then many more have taken the full vows. However, within Myanmar, thilashins remain the only monastic option for women at this time. In 2003, Saccavadi and Gunasari were ordained as bhikkhunis in [[Sri Lanka]], thus becoming the first female Myanma novices in modern times to receive higher ordination in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sujato.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/saccavadis-story/|title=Saccavadi’s story|work=Sujato’s Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tricycle.com/awake-world/story-one-burmese-nun|title=The Story of One Burmese Nun - Tricycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism made major contributions in the development of Burmese politics. Burmese nationalism first began with the formation of the [[Young Men's Buddhist Association]]s (YMBA) - modelled on the [[YMCA]] - which started to appear all over the country at the start of the 20th century. Buddhist monks along with students had been in the forefront of the struggle for independence and later for democracy, the best known leaders in history being [[U Ottama]] and U Seinda in [[Rakhine State]], and [[U Wisara]] who died after a protracted hunger strike in [[Yangon]] prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=8581 |title=Burmese Monks in Revolt |author=Aung Zaw |publisher=''The Irrawaddy'' 11 September 2007 |accessdate=11 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011004939/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=8581 |archivedate=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=8908 |title=The Power Behind the Robe |author=Aung Zaw |publisher=''The Irrawaddy'' 5 October 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206172355/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=8908 |archivedate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major thoroughfare in Yangon is named after U Wisara. The [[League of Young Monks]] ({{lang|my|ရဟန်းပြို}} ''Yahanpyo'') based in [[Mandalay]] is a well known activist organisation. The [[Burmese language|Burmese]] word for boycott is ''thabeik hmauk'' ({{lang|my|သပိတ်မှောက်}}), which literally means to turn the monk's alms bowl upside down - declining to accept alms in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2007/09/22/associated-press-monks-put-myanmar-junta-in-tight-spot-michael-casey/#more-8969

[[File:2007 Myanmar protests 11.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks were at the forefront of the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, in protest of living and economic conditions in the country.]]

Civilian governments, after the country gained independence, patronised Buddhism, donating large sums to fund the upkeep and building of Buddhist monuments. In addition, leaders of political parties and parliamentarians, in particular [[U Nu]], passed legislation influenced by Buddhism. He declared Buddhism the state religion which alienated minority groups, especially the [[Kachin people|Kachin]]. This added yet another group to the growing number of ethnic insurgencies. The present military government has been so keen to be seen as patrons of Buddhism that it has become a joke- "Burmese TV has only two colours, green and yellow" - describing the military green uniforms and monk's yellow robes or golden pagodas which dominate the screen.

[[Shwedagon Pagoda]] has been an important venue for large public meetings where both [[Aung San]] and his daughter [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] had made their famous speeches. During the second university strike in history of 1936, the students camped out on the Shwedagon terraces.

Aung San Suu Kyi returned from London to lead the [[National League for Democracy]] which was founded during the [[8888 Uprising|1988 popular uprising]], but was placed under house arrest in 1989; since she is a devout Buddhist and leader of the opposition, she is considered a socially engaged Buddhist.

===Saffron Revolution===
{{Main article|Saffron Revolution}}
In September 2007, Buddhists again took to the streets in the [[Saffron Revolution]], a mass protest against the military government. Thousand of junta military and police forces poured into [[Yangon]] to try to control the situation, which rapidly deteriorated. A curfew was imposed and on 25 September troops surrounded Sule Pagoda. The protest continued to grow with regular citizens joining to support and defend the Buddhists. Overnight, junta forces invaded all the kyaungs in the country and imprisoned thousands of monks. It was reported that Nobel prize winning human rights activist and Buddhist [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] was removed from her home where she languished under house arrest and moved to the infamous [[Insein Prison]]. Mass protests erupted over this and junta troops began firing on monks, civilians, and demonstrators in the largest clash since 1988, which left thousands injured and hundreds dead. Images of the brutality were aired worldwide. Leaders around the world condemned the junta's actions and many nations imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in protest. The [[President of the United States]], [[George W. Bush]], addressed the [[United Nations]], stating, "Every civilized nation has a responsibility to stand up for people suffering under a brutal military regime like the one that has ruled Burma for so long." The Burmese junta responded by trying to control media coverage, curtail travel, censor news stories, and shut down access to the Internet.

In November 2008, [[U Gambira]], a leader of the [[All Burma Monks' Alliance]], was sentenced to 68 years in prison, at least 12 years of which will be hard labour; other charges against him are still pending.&lt;ref name="AI2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/iar/pdf/UGambiraCaseSheet.pdf |title=MYANMAR: Monk Receives 68 Years in Prison |author= |date=3 October 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218215202/http://www.amnestyusa.org/iar/pdf/UGambiraCaseSheet.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, his sentence was reduced to 63 years.&lt;ref name="HRW2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/85644/section/9 |title=The Resistance of the Monks |author= |date=22 September 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sentence was protested by [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/85678 |title=Burma: End Repression of Buddhist Monks |author= |date=22 September 2009 |work= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amnesty International]] considers him a [[prisoner of conscience]].&lt;ref name="Burma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdf/POC%20List.pdf |title=Myanmar, Unlock the Prison Doors! |author= |work= |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=17 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501120414/http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdf/POC%20List.pdf |archivedate=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both groups called for his immediate release. Gambira was released during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 as part of the [[2011–2012 Burmese political reforms]]. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012, and as of 11 December 2012, was released on bail.

'''Chalchiuhtlicue''' {{IPA-nah|t͡ʃaːɬt͡ʃiwˈt͡ɬikʷeː|}} (from ''chālchihuitl'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ʃaːɬˈt͡ʃiwit͡ɬ|}} "jade" and ''cuēitl'' {{IPA-nah|kʷeːit͡ɬ|}} "skirt") (also spelled Chalciuhtlicue, Chalchiuhcueye, or Chalcihuitlicue) ("She of the Jade Skirt") is an [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] deity of water, rivers, seas, streams, storms, and baptism. Chalchiuhtlicue is associated with fertility and she is the patroness of childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;Read &amp; González 2002: 140–142&lt;/ref&gt; Chalchiuhtlicue was highly revered in Aztec culture at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] and she was an important deity figure in the [[Postclassic period|Postclassic]] [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] realm of central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;According to the 16th-century [[Dominican friar]] and historian [[Diego Durán]]. "Universally revered" is quoted from his ''Book of the Gods and Rites'', written 1574-1576 and published in English translation (Durán 1971: 261), as cited by Read &amp; González 2002: 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Chalchiuhtlicue belongs to a larger group of Aztec rain gods&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/877854386|title=Florentine Codex: General history of the things of New Spain: Book I, the Gods|last=de Bernardino|first=Sahagún|date=1970|publisher=School of American Research|others=Anderson, Arthur J.

==Religious significance==
[[Image:Chalchiuhtlicue (M. América, Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|422x422px|right|Stone sculpture of Chalchiuhtlicue, [[Museo de América (Madrid)|Museum of the Americas]], [[Madrid]], Spain]]
Chalchiuitlicue directly translates to "Jade her skirt," however, her name is most commonly interpreted as "she of the jade skirt."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was also known as Matlalcueitl, "Owner of the green skirt," by the [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcalans]], an indigenous group who inhabited the republic of [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]. Most texts describe Chalchiuitlicue as married to the rain god, [[Tlaloc]]. However, others describe her as the sister of Tlaloc,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9022262/Chalchiuhtlicue "Chalchuitlicue] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; or the wife of [[Xiuhtecuhtli]] (also called [[Huehueteotl]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= azteccalendar.com
 |url= https://www.azteccalendar.com/god/Xiuhtecuhtli.html
 |title= Xiuhtecuhtli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chalchiuitlicue is  the mother of [[Tecciztecatl]], an Aztec moon god.

In Aztec religion, Chalchiuitlicue helps Tlaloc to rule the paradisial kingdom of [[Tlalocan]]. Chalchiutlicue brings fertility to crops and is thought to protect women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Y053PeFmS5UC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Mesoamerican+Mythology:+A+Guide+to+the+Gods,+Heroes,+Rituals,+and+Beliefs+of+.&amp;ots=pS4U4fqWyh&amp;sig=rFIUxgYMaaF-u-keDA85VAucJ-s#v=onepage&amp;q=Mesoamerican%20Mythology:%20A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Gods,%20Heroes,%20Rituals,%20and%20Beliefs%20of%20.&amp;f=false|title=Mesoamerican Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs of Mexico and Central America|last=Read|first=Kay Almere|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Jason J.|date=2002-06-13|publisher=OUP USA|year=|isbn=9780195149098|location=|pages=142|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalchiutlicue's association with both water and fertility is derived from the Aztecs' common association of the womb with water. This dual power gave her both life-giving and a life-ending role in Aztec religion.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993: 60&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aztec [[creation myth]] of the [[Five Suns]], Chalchiuhtlicue presided over the Fourth Sun, or the fourth creation of the world. It is believed that Chalchiuhtlicue retaliated against Tlaloc's mistreatment of her by releasing 52 years of rain, causing a giant flood which caused the Fourth Sun to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Taube 1993:34–35&lt;/ref&gt; She built a bridge linking heaven and earth and those who were in Chalchiuhtlicue's good graces were allowed to traverse it, while others were turned into fish. Following the flood, the Fifth Sun, the world which we now occupy, developed.[[File:Chalchiuhtlicue copy.jpg|thumb|408x408px|Chalchiuhtlicue in [[Codex Borgia]], page 65. Chalchiuhtlicue pictured at right.]]Chalchiutlicue is also credited with the death of those who died in canoe or drowning accidents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Teotihuacán - Chalchiuhtlicue.jpg|395x395px|thumb|Statue of Chalchiuhtlicue (or other water goddess) from the Pyramid of the Moon]]
==Archaeological records==
Chalchiutlicue is depicted in several central Mexican manuscripts, including the [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Codex Borgia]] (plates 11 and 65), the 16th century [[Codex Borbonicus]] (page 5), the 16th century [[Codex Ríos]] (page 17), and the [[Florentine Codex]], (plate 11). When represented through sculpture, Chalchiutlicue is often carved from green stone in accordance with her name.

[[Pyramid of the Moon|The Pyramid of the Moon]] is a large pyramid located in Teotihuacán, the dominant political power in the [[Mexican Plateau|central Mexican region]] during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Early Classic period]] (ca. 200–600 CE). The pyramid is thought to have been at one point dedicated to Chalchiutlicue. It accompanies The Pyramid of the Sun, which is thought to have been dedicated to Chalchiutlicue's husband, Tlaloc.

In the mid 19th century, archaeologists unearthed a 20-ton monolithic sculpture depicting a water goddess that is believed to be Chalchiuhtlicue from underneath The Pyramid of the Moon. The sculpture was excavated from the plaza forecourt of the [[Pyramid of the Moon]] structure. The sculpture was relocated by [[Leopoldo Batres]] to Mexico City in 1889, where it is presently in the collection of the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlo 1992: 138; Pasztory 1997: 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual representations==
Chalchihuitlicue wears a distinctive headdress, which consists of several broad bands, likely cotton, trimmed with [[amaranth (disambiguation)|amaranth]] seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/azss/hod_00.5.72.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315221220/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/azss/hod_00.5.72.htm |archive-date=2007-03-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large round tassels fall from either side of the headdress. Chalchihuitlicue typically wears a shawl adorned with tassels and a  skirt. She is often depicted sitting with a stream of water flowing out of or from behind her skirt.  

In the Codex Borbonicus (page 5), Chalchihuitlicue wears an elaborate blue and white headdress. She sits on a red stool and a stream of water flows out from the bottom of her stool. A male baby and female baby, who are depicted as if swimming, are carried in the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Codex Borbonicus|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Codex Borgia (page 65), Chalchihuitlicue sits on a red throne and a river flows outwards from behind her body. Two figures stand in the water and Chalchihuitlicue gesticulates out towards them. She wears an elaborate yellow headdress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Codex Borgia|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Rites and rituals==

Five of the twenty big celebrations in the Aztec calendar were dedicated to Chalchiutlicue and her husband (or brother), Tlaloc. During these celebrations, priests dove into a lake and imitated the movements and the croaking of frogs, hoping to bring rain.

Chalchiutlicue presides over the day ''5 Serpent'' and the [[trecena]] of ''1 Reed''. Her feast is celebrated in the ventena of ''Etzalqualiztli''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Florentine Codex|last=Sahagun|first=Bernardino de|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=1970|isbn=0874800005|location=|pages=6|quote="And sometimes she sank men in the water; she drowned them. The water was restless: the waves roared; they dashed and resounded.  The water was wild."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she is associated with the fertility of both people and land, the Aztecs asked Chalchiutlicue for a good harvest of crops. 

=== Childbirth ===
As Chalchiutlicue was the guardian of the children and newborns, she played a central role in the process of childbirth. As mothers and babies often died in the process of childbirth, the role of the midwife was also of utmost importance in the process.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=TKE_J2M6P-8C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Chalchiutlicue+rites&amp;sig=qQdfuAd6dTo1Ir__xgbFBDMuSR4#PPA67,The Mexican Treasury:The Writings of Dr. Francisco Hernández, M1&lt;/ref&gt; During labor the midwife would speak to the newborn and ask the gods that the baby's birth insure a prime place among them. After cutting the umbilical cord, the midwife would wash the new baby with customary greetings to Chalchiutlicue.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Four days after the birth, the child was given a second bath and a name.

As reported by Sahagún's informants, the midwife would say, "The gods [[Ometecutli]] and Omecioatl who realm in the ninth and tenth heavens, have begotten you in this light and brought you into this world full of calamity and pain take then this water, which will protect you life, in the name of the goddess Chalchiutlicue."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She would then sprinkle water at the head of the child and say, "Behold this element without whose assistance no mortal being can survive." She also would sprinkle water on the breast of the baby while saying, "Receive this celestial water that washes impurity from your heart." Then she would go to the head and say, "Son receive this divine water, which must be drank that all may live that it may wash you and wash away all your misfortunes, part of the life since the beginning of the world: this water in truth has a unique power to oppose misfortune." Finally, the midwife would wash the entire body of the baby and say, "In which part of you is unhappiness hidden? Or in which part are you hiding? Leave this child, today, he is born again in the healthful waters in which he has been bathed, as mandated by the will of the god of the sea Chalchiutlicue."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Florentine Codex: general history of the things of New Spain, Book 6: Rhetoric and Moral Philosophy|last=de Sahagún|first=Bernardino|publisher=School of American Research|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Chemish''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|m|ɪ|ʃ}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «kĕm´ĭsh»&lt;/ref&gt;)  was a [[Nephite]] record keeper.  He received the Book of Mormon record from his brother [[Amaron]], and penned a single verse in the [[Book of Omni]] (Omni 1:9) before passing the record to his son [[Abinadom]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
9 Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same book with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which he wrote, that he wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day that he delivered them unto me. And after this manner we keep the records, for it is according to the commandments of our fathers. And I make an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Omni|omni|1|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Possible origin of the name ==
[[Hugh Nibley]] relates the name to his position within the family or the succession, as the fifth in line (Hebrew חמש means "five")&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt; and states:

:"Now that's an obvious word. 'Chemish' is the same as the Latin 'Quintus'. It means the 'fifth', either the fifth son, or the fifth in the line of succession. Is he fifth? He looks more like sixth. If you have [[Jacob (Book of Mormon prophet)|Jacob]], [[Enos_(Book_of_Mormon_prophet)|Enos]], [[Jarom]], [[Omni (Book of Mormon record keeper)|Omni]] and Amaron, that would make him the sixth. Unless it is after Jacob; who knows? Anyway it is a perfectly good Semitic name which means 'the fifth'. It's a common proper name too. There's the town of Chemish..."

'''Chiminigagua''', '''Chiminichagua''' or '''Chimichagua''' was the [[God|supreme being]], [[omnipotent]] [[deity|god]] and creator of the world in the [[Muisca religion and mythology|religion of the Muisca]].&lt;ref name=p15&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.1, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and their [[Muisca Confederation|confederation]] were one of the four advanced civilizations of the [[Americas]] and developed their own religion on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in the [[Andes]].

== Description ==
Chiminigagua was a universally good god and represented the only light that existed when it was night time. When the world was created there was only darkness and the only light was given by Chiminigagua. When Chiminigagua decided to shine light across the [[Universe]], he first opened his gigantic belly from where light was shining.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/chiminigagua.html Chiminigagua] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt; He then created two large black birds and launched them into [[space]]. The birds spread light from their beaks which produced light in the [[cosmos]]. Thus he created light and everything in the world. Chiminigagua showed the importance of his important gods [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]] (the Moon), [[Sué]] (the Sun) and [[Cuchavira]] (rainbow). Adoring the Moon and the Sun for the Muisca was praising Chiminigagua.&lt;ref name=p15/&gt; The creation of the Sun and Moon gave rise to mother goddess [[Bachué]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://paginamitologica.blogspot.com.co/2013/11/chiminigagua.html Chiminigagua giving rise to Bachué]&lt;/ref&gt;

The solar cult and belief in the supreme being is comparable to other [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and elsewhere in the world. [[Tezcatlipoca]] was a similar deity for the [[Aztec]] and [[Viracocha]] was his counterpart for the [[Inca]]s. Solar cults and gods are found in other religions as well; [[Horus]], [[Ra]] and [[Aten|Aton]] for the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mitra]] for the [[Persia]]ns, [[Shamash]] for the people in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Helios]] for the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Surya]] in [[India]]. [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Huitzilopochtli]] represented the Sun for the Aztec and the [[Maya civilization|Mayas]] praised [[Kinich Ahau]], while the Incas believed [[Inti]] symbolised the Sun and created the Inca civilization.&lt;ref name=p16&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.1, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important sanctuaries established in [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Colombia were erected in [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]], present-day Sogamoso, [[Guatavita]], [[Bogotá|Bacatá]] (currently Colombian capital Bogotá) and [[Guachetá]]. ''[[Zaque]]'' [[Goranchacha]] constructed a temple in [[Tunja|Hunza]], today known as Tunja, and honouring him the people placed the ''Cojines del zaque'' ("Zaque Pillows"), two circular stones made of the same rock, there. Every day before sunrise the ''zaque'' with his priests and some of the indigenous people gathered and prayed the Sun would rise in the east. The [[Muisca rulers|ruler of the Muisca]] kneeled down on the Pillows and the people prayed, sang and danced. In some occasions there were [[human sacrifice]]s where the hearts of twelve year old children were taken from their bodies and offered to the holy Sun.&lt;ref name=p16/&gt;

Sogamoso was considered a sacred city in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian Andes and was known as the "City of the Sun", blessed by [[Bochica]]. It was here the [[pilgrim]]s gathered to adore Chiminigagua. When the Spanish [[conquistador]]es led by [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] reached the area of the Muisca they were searching for [[gold]] and the legendary ''[[El Dorado]]''. Their torches burnt the sacred Sun Temple, destroying one of the most elaborated religious works of the Muisca.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.1, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; The Sun Temple has been reconstructed in the Archeology Museum of Sogamoso, see image.

Chiminigagua has been described at the end of the 16th century by the Spanish [[chronicler]]s [[Pedro Simón]] and [[Juan de Castellanos]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.1, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

The supreme being of the Muisca was a static deity without body who ruled over all the other gods. He was however never praised directly, yet through his lesser gods of the Sun, Moon and fertility; Chía, Sué and [[Chaquén]]. Chiminigagua's messenger god was [[Bochica]]. When the Spanish arrived in Muisca territory they were described as "children of the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.1, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.culturarecreacionydeporte.gov.co/es/bogotanitos/cuenta-la-leyenda/chiminichagua-o-el-ser-supremo Chiminigagua: the supreme being]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1789">'''Choizer''' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] '''חוזר''') lit. "one who reviews," pl. '''choizrim''' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] '''חוזרים''') is a title that refers to a [[rabbi]] who memorizes the teachings of one of the [[Rebbe]]s of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic]] movement. This term is not unique to that movement.

== Definition ==

[[Jewish law]] forbids writing on the [[Shabbat]] or [[Jewish holidays|Yom Tov]]. Thus, on such occasions, when the Chabad Rebbes would deliver their discourses, certain disciples with a photographic memory were appointed to memorize every word they heard. This is known as the role of the ''choizer''. The choizer would review the entire discourse after the Rebbe had finished delivering it with those interested to hear. This delivery was known as ''chazoro'', a reviewing. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

After consultation with other choizrim, the choizer would typically (but not always) transcribe the words that he remembered once it became permitted to do so, making him a ''[[meiniach]]''. This transcript, known as a ''hanocho'' (pl. ''hanochos''), was then released for public study. The unedited ''hanochos'' of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]'s public addresses are available in the ''Sichos Kodesh'', and ''Hisva'aduyos'' series.

The second day of the festival is the most important one, in which a long procession headed by the Pujadhikari is held accompanied by the Rath Of Lord Yama. During the whole procession, the Pujadhikari faces the Rath with folded hands and also keeps fasting from the very first day of the Chaitra month. The festival of Ramnavami is celebrated by the bursting of crackers and pompous lighting which attracts people from all over the world. 
 
Nashik also hosts festivals for [[Makar Sankranti]] and [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].

==Religion==

[[Nashik]] is home to many temples and religious sites of the [[Jain]] [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] religions.
In February 2016, the [[Statue of Ahimsa]], a 108 ft idol of first Jain [[tirthankara]] [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdev]] carved in monolithic stone was consecrated at [[Mangi Tungi]]. It is recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the tallest [[Jain ]]idol in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/Guinness-Book-to-certify-Mangi-Tungi-idol/articleshow/51275366.cms&lt;/ref&gt;It has become a major pilgrimage and tourist destination.
 
Nashik is situated at the foothills of [[Western Ghats]], on the banks of River [[Godavari]]. The city hosts numerous religious pilgrimages and festivals, including the [[Nashik-Trimbakeshwar Simhastha]], which is one of four [[Kumbh Mela]] fairs. It is held every 12 years in one of the four places in India including Nashik.

Nashik is also known for its abundant fruits and vegetables. The yield of grapes, strawberries and onions in Nashik is among the highest in the country.  Nashik's people are known for their cultural art, literature, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/indian-pilgrimage/nashik.html|title=Nashik – Nashik City – Nashik Kumbh Mela – Nashik Maharashtra India|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king list also states that he single handedly captured [[Enmebaragesi]], ruler of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and claims he ruled in Uruk for 100 years &amp;mdash; far fewer than the 1200 years it ascribes his predecessor, [[Lugalbanda]] "the Shepherd". His given name means "faithful child" in Sumerian. 

There may have been some confusion in the early Sumerian compositions between this figure and that of "[[Dumuzid the Shepherd]]", whom they call the king of Uruk, and who appears as a deity ([[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]]) in later works. However, the Sumerian King List says that Dumuzid the ''Shepherd'' had ruled before the flood, and locates him in [[Bad-tibira]].

{{God|by religion}}
Sikhism is a [[monotheistic]] religion and hence, believes that "God" is One, and prevails in everything,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Sikhism: Sikh Beliefs|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as symbolized by the symbol [[Ik Onkar]] (''one all pervading spirit'')&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sikhs.org/art1.htm|title=Sikhism Religion of the Sikh People|website=www.sikhs.org|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fundamental belief of Sikhism is that God exists, indescribable yet knowable and perceivable to anyone who surrenders his egoism and Loves the Almighty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/different-names-of-god-incorporated-in-sri-guru-granth-sahib-ji|title=Different Names of GOD incorporated in Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji|website=www.speakingtree.in|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sikh gurus]] have described God in numerous ways in their hymns included in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[holy scripture]] of [[Sikhism]], but the oneness of the deity is consistently emphasized throughout. 

God is described in the [[Mool Mantar]] (lit. the Prime Utterance)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indif.com/nri/sikhism/mool_mantra.asp|title=The Sikh Mool Mantra - Ik Onkar|last=Indif.com|website=www.indif.com|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/sikhismrev2.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: The Mool Mantar|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the first passage in the Guru Granth Sahib:

"ੴ  ਸਤਿ  ਨਾਮੁ  ਕਰਤਾ  ਪੁਰਖੁ  ਨਿਰਭਉ  ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ  ਅਕਾਲ  ਮੂਰਤਿ  ਅਜੂਨੀ  ਸੈਭੰ  ਗੁਰ  ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ  ॥" &lt;br&gt;"ikk ōankār sat(i)-nām(u) karatā purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) akāla mūrat(i) ajūnī saibhan&lt;small&gt;(g)&lt;/small&gt; gur(a) prasād(i)." &lt;br&gt;"There is but one all pervading spirit, and it is called the truth, It exists in all creation, and it has no fear, It does not hate and, it is timeless, universal and self-existent! You will come to know it through the grace of the Guru." 

(SGGS. Pg 1) [https://www.searchgurbani.com/guru-granth-sahib/ang-by-ang Sri Guru Granth Sahib]
== General Conceptions ==

=== Monotheism ===
Sikhism is strictly monotheistic and believes that there is only One God. [[Guru Nanak]] prefixed the numeral "IK" (one) to the syllable Onkar stress the idea of God's oneness; that the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer is One.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fateh.sikhnet.com//sikhnet/discussion.nsf/3d8d6eacce83bad8872564280070c2b3/3a6e0d8facb2ed8c87256623002a5e2d|title=Sikhism and Monotheism|website=fateh.sikhnet.com|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh thought begins with the One Almighty and then universalising him, coming down to the cosmic reality of all-pervading Onkar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=138|chapter=Monotheism in Guru Granth Sahib}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=ਏਕੁ ਪਿਤਾ ਏਕਸ ਕੇ ਹਮ ਬਾਰਿਕ ਤੂ ਮੇਰਾ ਗੁਰ ਹਾਈ ॥

"Ek(u) pita ekas ke ham barik"

"The One God is the Father of all;
We are His children."|sign=SGGS. Pg 611}}

=== Priority Monism ===
Sikhism complies with the concept of Priority [[Monism]], a view point that all existing things go back to a Source that is distinct from them.&amp;nbsp;It is the belief that all what our senses comprehend is illusion; God is the sole reality. Forms being subject to Time, shall pass away. God's Reality alone is eternal and abiding.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The thought is such that Atmaa(soul) is born from and a reflection of ParamAtma( Supreme Soul)&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/metaphysics/atma|title=ATMA,|last=Gujral|first=Maninder S|work=The Sikh Encyclopedia -ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਕੋਸ਼|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and would again merge into it just as water merges back into the water.
{{Quote|text=ਜਿਉ ਜਲ ਮਹਿ ਜਲੁ ਆਇ ਖਟਾਨਾ ॥

Jio Jal Mehi Jal Aae Khattaanaa {{!}}{{!}}

As water comes to blend with water,

ਤਿਉ ਜੋਤੀ ਸੰਗਿ ਜੋਤਿ ਸਮਾਨਾ ॥

Thio Jothee Sang Joth Samaanaa {{!}}{{!}}

His light blends into the Light.|sign=SGGS. Pg 278|source=}}
God and Soul are identical in the same way as Fire and its sparks; fundamentally same as is stated in Guru Granth, "Atam meh Ram, Ram meh Atam", which means "The Ultimate Eternal reality resides in the Soul and the Soul is contained in Him". As from one stream, millions of waves arise and yet the waves, made of water, again become water; in the same way all souls have sprung from the Universal Being and would blend again into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rFm9_Jc1ykcC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=atma+merges+in+parmatma+sikhism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J6IZOPhwEm&amp;sig=8tR_60YjFaze5uFWZ7YNeTBHOiw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj30oOY7ITYAhUMQo8KHXHCA8wQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=atma%20merges%20in%20parmatma%20sikhism&amp;f=false|title=A Complete Guide to Sikhism|last=Singh|first=Jagraj|date=2009|publisher=Unistar Books|year=|isbn=9788171427543|location=|pages=266|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pantheism ===
Another philosophy of Sikhism is the concept of Pantheism which says that every being is identical to Divinity. It focuses on the subject of a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]]&amp;nbsp;concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the&amp;nbsp;Universe&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=e3kf6GtwaT0C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=non-anthropomorphic+god+sikhism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mpHKJJqr4h&amp;sig=F6AcVhMtIbWYRPwet68JUhPHN8w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG3uONgY7YAhVDu48KHZwfCJMQ6AEITjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=non-anthropomorphic%20god%20sikhism&amp;f=false|title=Ultimate Truth|last=Rogers|first=D. D. Peter C.|last2=Ph.d|first2=Peter C. Rogers|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=|isbn=9781438979687|location=|pages=129|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh thought holds a pantheistic tone when it discusses the Immanence of God (Sagun), which says that the whole Universe is an abode of the All-pervasive Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=89|chapter=Metaphysics of the Guru Granth}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sikhism does not hold the concept of Pantheism fully as it understands God to be both, transcendent and immanent at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=148-149|chapter=Monotheism in Guru Granth Sahib}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh philosophy fuses the concepts of Theism and Pantheism as to the belief that God exists in His Creation to a Theistic level, that is the One upon whom everything depends; the ultimate Preserver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=93|chapter=Metaphysics of Guru Granth}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It can be deduced that Sikhism agrees with Pantheistic belief only to the extent that Universe can be considered as Divine, never understating the Transcendence of God which deems the Creator as above His Creation.

== Specific Conceptions ==

=== Great Architect ===

Sikh philosophy believes that the One God is the Great Architect of Universe. He alone is the Creator, Sustain-er, and Destroyer; Ek Onkar.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/environment/sikhbeliefsrev1.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: The origins of the universe|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|page=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; God is [[Karta Purakh]], the [[Creation deity|Creator-Being]]&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikhism-articles/the-idea-of-the-supreme-being-god-in-sikhism|title=The Idea Of The Supreme Being (God) In Sikhism - Sikhism Articles - Gateway to Sikhism|last=User|first=Super|work=Gateway to Sikhism|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He created the spatial-temporal Universe from His own Self; Universe is His own [[emanation]]. [[Guru Arjan]] advocates: “True is He and true is His creation [because] all has emanated from God Himself” (SGGS Pg 294).

Before creation, God existed all alone as "Nirgun"; in a state of Sunn Samadhi, deep meditation, as says Guru Nanak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gurmat.info/sms/smspublications/introductiontosikhism2/chapter2.html#How%20was%20the%20world%20created,%20according%20to%20Sikhism?|title=Introduction to Sikhism - Section II: God and His Universe|last=Munde|first=Amarpreet Singh|website=www.gurmat.info|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quote|text="There was darkness for countless years. 

There was neither earth nor sky; there was only His Will.

There was neither day nor night, neither sun nor moon. 

He (God) was in deep meditation. 
There was nothing except Himself."|sign=SGGS. Pg 1035|source=}}

Then, God willed and created the Universe, and diffused himself into the nature as "Sargun". Whenever God desires, He merges back into His Timeless and Formless Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/environment/sikhbeliefsrev3.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Evolutionary biology|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Gobind Singh calls this process of Creation and Dissolution as "Udkarkh" (from Sanskrit ''utkarsana'') and "Akarakh" (from Sanskrit ''akarsana'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|chapter=COSMOLOGY IN GURU GRANTH SAHIB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, respectively: 

"Whenever you, O Creator, cause udkarkh (increase, expansion), the creation assumes the boundless body; whenever you effect akarkh (attraction, contraction), all corporeal existence merges in you" (Benati Chaupai). 

This process of creation and dissolution has been repeated God alone knows for how many times. A passage in [[Sukhmani]] by Guru Arjan visualizes the infinite field of creation thus:{{Quote|Millions are the mines of life; millions the spheres;
Millions are the regions above; millions the regions below;

Millions are the species taking birth.
By diverse means does He spread Himself.

Again and again did He expand Himself thus,
But He ever remains the One Ekankar.

Countless creatures of various kinds
Come out of Him and are absorbed back.

None can know the limit of His Being;
He, the Lord, O Nanak! is all in all Himself.|(SGGS. 275-76)|source=}}

=== Creation ===
It is believed in Sikh  that the Universe was created by a single word of the God.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Transcendent God expresed Himself in "Naam" and "Sabad" that created the world. "Naam" and "Sabad" are the 'Creative and Dynamic Immanence of God'.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
{{Quote|text=ਕੀਤਾ ਪਸਾਉ ਏਕੋ ਕਵਾਉ ॥

Keethaa Pasaao Eaeko Kavaao {{!}}{{!}}

You created the vast expanse of the Universe with One Word!

ਤਿਸ ਤੇ ਹੋਏ ਲਖ ਦਰੀਆਉ ॥

This Thae Hoeae Lakh Dhareeaao {{!}}{{!}}

Hundreds of thousands of rivers began to flow.|sign=SGGS. Pg 3|source=}}

=== When was Universe Created? ===
Sikh philosophy enunciates the belief that the Limits of Time and Space are known only to God. Answers to the questions of "When did the Universe came into existence?" or "How big this Universe is?" are beyond Human understanding and the best course, as Guru Nanak proclaims, is to admit a sense of Wonderfulness or "Vismad", since "the featureless Void was in ceaseless Existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=129|chapter=Cosmology in Guru Granth Sahib}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to the Time of Creation, Guru Nanak, in Jap(u) Sahib, recites that: 
{{Quote|text=What was that time, and what was that moment? What was that day, and what was that date?

What was that season, and what was that month, when the Universe was created?

The Pandits, the religious scholars, cannot find that time, even if it is written in the Puraanas.

That time is not known to the Qazis, who study the Koran.

The day and the date are not known to the Yogis, nor is the month or the season.

The Creator who created this creation-only He Himself knows.|sign=SGGS. Pg 4}}

== Attributes ==

=== Existence ===
As stated in Mool Mantar, God exists as Ajuni, beyond incarnations; formless. And ''saibhan'' ([[Sanskrit]] ''svayambhu''), Self-existent. The Primal Creator Himself had no creator. He simply is, has ever been and shall ever be by Himself.

Purakh added to Karta in the [[Mool Mantar]] is the Punjabi form of [[Sanskrit]] ''purusa'', which literally means, besides man, male or person, "the primeval man as the soul and original source of the universe; the personal and animating principle; the supreme Being or Soul of the universe." Purakh in [[Mool Mantar]] is, therefore, none other than God the Creator. 

=== Eternalness ===
God, as stated in Guru Granth Sahib, is ''[[Akal]] Murat'', the Eternal Being; He is beyond time and ever the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=140|chapter=Monotheism In Guru Granth Sahib}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Saibhan(g)", another attribute to God means that no one else but God created Himself. He is, shall be, was not born, and shall not die; never created and hence, shall never be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=144|chapter=Monotheism In Guru Granth Sahib}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "Ad(i) Sach", True in the Primal Beginning, in the Mool mantar proves the notion of the eternalness of God in Sikhism.

=== Transcendence and Immanence ===
Sikhism advocates a [[Panentheism|Panentheistic]] tone when it enunciates the belief that God is both, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent,]] or "Nirgun" and "Sargun" (as stated in the Sikh terminology), at the same time. God created the Universe and permeates both within and without. Transcendence and Immanence are two aspects of the same single Supreme Reality. The Reality is immanent in His entire creation, but the creation as a whole fails to contain God fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/sargun-nirgun-nirankar|title=Sargun Nirgun Nirankar|website=www.speakingtree.in|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Almighty, Himself, is the one Ultimate, Transcendent Reality, [[Nirguna]] (Nir+Guna = without attributes), Ever-existent, Boundless, Formless, Immutable, All-by Himself, and Unknowable in His entirety. 

When it pleases God, He becomes [[Sarguna]] (Sanskrit Saguna = with attributes) and manifests Himself in creation. He becomes immanent in His created universe, which is His own emanation, an aspect of Himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurbani.org/gurblog/sargun-nirgun/|title=Sargun Nirgun {{!}} Gurbani Blog {{!}} ਗੁਰਬਾਣੀ ਬਲੌਗ|website=www.gurbani.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Omnipotence ===
"God himself is the Creator and the Cause, the Doer and the Deed."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GuruGranthAPerspective|title=Guru Granth A Perspective|last=www.DiscoverSikhism.com|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh thought is strictly monotheistic and believes that this Universe is creation of God. Its origins are in God, it operates under the Command of God (hukum), and its end is in God; God is the Omnipotent being, the sole cause of Creation, Preservation, and Destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rFm9_Jc1ykcC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=atma+merges+in+parmatma+sikhism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J6IZOPhwEm&amp;sig=8tR_60YjFaze5uFWZ7YNeTBHOiw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj30oOY7ITYAhUMQo8KHXHCA8wQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Complete Guide to Sikhism|last=Singh|first=Jagraj|date=2009|publisher=Unistar Books|year=|isbn=9788171427543|location=|pages=252|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He consults none in creating and demolishing, giving and taking but does all things Himself. The Nirbhau (lit. Fearless) Almighty does not fear anyone and exercises His unquestionable will.

=== Omnibenevolence ===
He is kind and merciful, the Omni-Benevolent Lord. The Bestow-er of all things; apart from Him, there is no other Giver. He is also a great Pardoner; pardoning all our sins, He bestows Virtue on the repenting souls and adds Blessedness on the &amp;nbsp;striving virtuous.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Almighty sustains His Creation compassionately and benevolently. In Guru Granth, God is called as "Karim" (merciful); the complacent Lord who, in his compassion, blesses the miserable with his Nadar (graceful vision).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ED0syBKqafMC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=benevolence+of+god+sikhism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TJsP7jVf4Z&amp;sig=0W8gv0cazR5Rwcr8whucNW7V-kk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKuMqq8IbYAhUHLo8KHR5BAwEQ6AEIVTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=benevolence%20of%20god%20sikhism&amp;f=false|title=The Sikh and Sikhism|last=|first=|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distri|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nirvair (lit. without enmity) God does not hate anyone and glances his merciful vision on every being, indifferently.

"The Lord is kind and compassionate to all beings and creatures; His Protecting Hand is over all." (SGGS. Pg 300)

=== Gender ===
According to Sikhism, God has "No" Gender. Mool Mantar describes God as being "Ajuni" (lit. not in any incarnations) which implies that God is not bound to any physical forms. This concludes: the All-pervading Lord is Gender-less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurbani.org/articles/webart270.htm|title=IS GOD MALE OR FEMALE?|website=www.gurbani.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|text=ਸੁੰਨ ਮੰਡਲ ਇਕੁ ਜੋਗੀ ਬੈਸੇ ॥ ਨਾਰਿ ਨ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਕਹਹੁ ਕੋਊ ਕੈਸੇ ॥ ਤ੍ਰਿਭਵਣ ਜੋਤਿ ਰਹੇ ਲਿਵ ਲਾਈ ॥ ਸੁਰਿ ਨਰ ਨਾਥ ਸਚੇ ਸਰਣਾਈ ॥
Sunn mandal ik Yogi baise. Naar na purakh kahahu kou kaise. Tribhavan joti rahe liv laaee. Sur nar naath sache saranaaee

The Yogi, the Primal Lord, sits in the Realm of Absolute Stillness (state free of mind's wanderings or Phurne). (Since God) is neither male nor female; how can anyone describe Him? The three worlds center their attention on His Light. The godly beings and the Yogic masters seek the Sanctuary of this True Lord.|sign=SGGS. Pg 685}}

However, The Guru Granth consistently refers to God as "He" and "Father", but this is because the Granth is written in north Indian Indo-Aryan languages ([[Sant Bhasha|mixture]] of Punjabi and dialects of Hindi) which have no neutral gender. English translation of the teachings eliminate any gender specifications. From further insights into the Sikh philosophy, it can be deduced that God is, sometimes, referred to as the Husband to the Soul-brides. Also, God is considered to be our father, mother, and companion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sikhwomen.com/equality/GodsGender.htm|title=God's Gender|website=www.sikhwomen.com|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names for God ===
Sikhism believes in Monotheism and hence, has no specific names for God. However, God has been called by many Attributive names [action-related names, Kirtan Naam (SGGS. Pg 1083), or Karam Naam ([[Dasam Granth]], [[Jaap Sahib]])] in Sikh literature, picked from Indian and Semitic traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

He is called in terms of human relations as our Father, Mother, Brother, Companion, Friend, Lover, Beloved, and Husband.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other names, expressive of His supremacy are Thakur, Prabhu(lit. God), Swami, Shah(lit. King), Paatshah(lit. respected King), Sahib, Sain (Lord, Master). 

God has also been referred to, in Sikh literature, as names given to him in other religions such as Ram, Narayan, Govind, Gopal, Allah, Khuda, Karim, Rahim, Qadir etc.. 

Other attributive names include Nirankar(Formless), Niranjan(without sin), Data or Datar (lit. The Giver), Karta or Kartar (lit. The Doer) , Dayal(Compassionate), Kripal(Benevolent) and many more.

Names peculiar to Sikhism, for God are ''[[Naam]]'' (lit. ''name''), ''Shabad'' (''word'') and ''[[Vahiguru]]'' (W''ondrous Master''). While ''Naam'' and ''Shabad'' are mystical terms standing for the Divine Manifestation, Vahiguru is a phrase expressing awe, wonder, and ecstatic joy of the worshiper as he comprehends the greatness and grandeur of the Lord and His Creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://the-many-names-of-god.com/god-sikhism/name-of-god-waheguru/|title=Name Of God – Waheguru|date=2012-10-20|work=The Many Names Of God And Their Meanings|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==

=== Reincarnation ===
The center belief of Sikh thought is the soul would reincarnate in this universe unless it attains the state&amp;nbsp;of ''mukti'' (liberation), which is to be achieved through the grace of God&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In its corporeal attire, the soul passes through cycles of transmigration.&amp;nbsp;Through Divine Grace, it can merge back into the Cosmic Soul (Paramatma) and escape the throes of birth and&amp;nbsp;death again and again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Revelation ===
The Mool Mantar ends with Gurparsad(i) (lit. by God's Grace), which expresses the belief of Sikh thought that God would be revealed to the Soul through [[Guru]]'s grace. In Sikh theology Guru appears in three different but allied connotations, viz. God, the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], and the gur-[[Shabad (hymn)|shabad]] or Guru's utterances as preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib. Of God's grace, Gurus' instruction and guidance and the scriptural Shabad ([[Sanskrit]] ''sabda'', literally 'Word'), the first is the most important, because, as nothing happens without God's will or pleasure, His grace is essential to making a person inclined towards a desire and search for union with Him.

"Blessing us with His Grace, the Kind and Compassionate All-powerful Lord comes to dwell within the mind and body. (SGGS. Pg 49)"

Knowledge of the ultimate Reality is not a matter for reason; it comes by [[revelation]] of the ultimate reality through ''nadar'' (grace) and by ''[[anubhava]]'' (mystical experience). Says [[Guru Nanak]], ''budhi pathi na paiai bahu chaturaiai bhai milai mani bhane'' which translates to "He is not accessible through intellect, or through mere scholarship or cleverness at argument; He is met, when He pleases, through devotion" (SGGS, 436).

=== Gnosticism ===
[[Gnosticism]] is the belief that the Divine Spark is trapped within the spirit and can be liberated by the Gnosis or Knowledge of this Divinity. Sikh spirituality is centered to the theme of understanding and experiencing God, and eventually becoming one with Him. Human incarnation, as advocated by Guru Granth Sahib, is a special privilege and an opportunity for the realization of the Ultimate destiny of Spirit: union with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mnnews.today/aurora-magazine/december-2017/25330-sikhs-believe-that-the-supreme-creator-is-within-each-one/|title=Sikhs believe that the Supreme Creator is within each one|date=2017-12-06|work=mnnews.today|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Guru Arjan says, "Of all the eight million and four hundred thousand species, God conferred superiority on man"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.searchgurbani.com/guru-granth-sahib/ang-by-ang|title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji -: Ang :  1 -: ਸ਼੍ਰੀ ਗੁਰੂ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ ਸਾਹਿਬ ਜੀ :- SearchGurbani.com|website=www.searchgurbani.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Another verse form the scripture praises the human body as a Temple: 

{{Quote|text=ਕਾਯਉ ਦੇਵਾ ਕਾਇਅਉ ਦੇਵਲ ਕਾਇਅਉ ਜੰਗਮ ਜਾਤੀ ॥

Kaayo Dhaevaa Kaaeiao Dhaeval Kaaeiao Jangam Jaathee {{!}}{{!}}

Within the body, the Divine Lord is embodied. The body is the temple, the place of pilgrimage, and the pilgrim.

ਕਾਇਅਉ ਧੂਪ ਦੀਪ ਨਈਬੇਦਾ ਕਾਇਅਉ ਪੂਜਉ ਪਾਤੀ ॥੧॥

Kaaeiao Dhhoop Dheep Neebaedhaa Kaaeiao Poojo Paathee {{!}}{{!}}1{{!}}{{!}}

Within the body are incense, lamps and offerings. Within the body are the flower offerings. {{!}}{{!}}1{{!}}{{!}}|sign=SGGS. Pg 695}}

Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual. God is perceived to reside in the human body and can be found by being a [[Gurmukh]] (lit. Facing Guru) and merging self into The Hukum or Divine Command.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/library/sikhism/beliefs/human-nature-and-the-purpose-of-existence|title=Human Nature and the Purpose of Existence|website=www.patheos.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though, as mentioned in Guru Granth, full understanding of God is beyond human beings, Guru Nanak&amp;nbsp;described God as not wholly unknowable and stressed that by becoming Gurmukh, one should find the Divinity residing in his own self. 

=== Mysticism ===
[[Mysticism]] is the experience of becoming one with The Almighty, which Guru Nanak states as Sach-Khand (Realm of Truth), where the soul is immersed completely in the Divine Will&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sikhphilosophy.net/threads/sikhism-and-sachkhand.3745/|title=Sikhism And Sachkhand|work=Sikh Philosophy Network Forum|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The primal belief of Sikhism is of the Spirit to get merged into the Divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.corespirit.com/mysticism-sikh-religion/|title=Mysticism in Sikh Religion|date=2016-05-26|work=CORE SPIRIT|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Guru Granth proclaims human incarnation as a chance to meet God and enter into the Mystic Reality. 
{{Quote|text=ਭਈ ਪਰਾਪਤਿ ਮਾਨੁਖ ਦੇਹੁਰੀਆ ॥

Bẖa▫ī parāpaṯ mānukẖ ḏehurī▫ā.

It is a devoted&amp;nbsp;[[meditation]]&amp;nbsp;([[simran]])&amp;nbsp;that enables a sort of communication between the Infinite and finite human&amp;nbsp;[[consciousness]].&amp;nbsp;There is, chiefly, the remembrance of God through the recitation of His name&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1085&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;fb=0|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|website=www.srigranth.org|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surrendering of the Self to God's presence often metaphorized as surrendering self to the Lord's feet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1237&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;fb=0|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|website=www.srigranth.org|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose his egoism completely in the love of the Lord and finally merge into the Almighty creator.&amp;nbsp;

[[Image:Stefan Luchain Hahamul din Moinesti.jpg|thumb|right|''The Hakham of [[Moinești]]'' (''Hahamul din Moineşti''), [[Ștefan Luchian]], 1909.]]

'''Hakham''' (or ''chakam(i), haham(i), hacham(i)''; {{lang-he-n|חָכָם}}  ''{{transl|he|ḥaḵam}}'', "wise") is a term in [[Judaism]], meaning a wise or skillful man; it often refers to someone who is a great [[Torah]] scholar. It can also refer to any cultured and learned person: "He who says a wise thing is called a ''hakham'', even if he be not a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Megillah 16a&lt;/ref&gt; Hence in [[Talmud]]ic-[[Midrash]]ic literature, wise [[gentile]]s are commonly called ''hakme ummot ha-'olam'' ("wise men of the nations of the world").

In [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] usage, ''Hakham'' is a synonym for "[[rabbi]]".

==In ancient times==
"Hakham" as an official title is found as early as the first [[Sanhedrin]], after the reconstruction of that body, when the Hadrianic religious persecutions had ceased. In addition to the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]] [[Simeon ben Gamliel]], two other scholars stood at the head of the Sanhedrin, namely [[Nathan the Babylonian]] as ''[[Av Beit Din]]'' and [[Rabbi Meir]] as hakham.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Horayot 13b&lt;/ref&gt; Another hakham mentioned by name was Simon, the son of [[Judah the Prince]], who after the death of his father officiated as hakham, with his elder brother the nasi.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Ketubot 103b&lt;/ref&gt;

Just what were the functions of the hakham is not clear. Rapoport's suggestion that he was the arbiter in matters of ritual prohibition and permission is highly improbable. [[Zecharias Frankel]] looks upon the hakham as a presiding officer whose duty it was to examine a case in question from all points of view, and, having summed up the results, to present the matter for discussion. It is more probable, however, that the office of hakham was created in order to secure a majority in cases of difference of opinion between the nasi and the Av Beit Din in the affairs of the Sanhedrin; one of the most eminent scholars was always chosen for the post. A [[baraita]]&lt;ref&gt;Moed Kattan 22b&lt;/ref&gt; leads to the inference that the hakham was always the director of a school ("bet ha-midrash"), for in addition to the [[Sanhedrin#Great and Lesser Sanhedrin|Great Sanhedrin]], which later came to take the place of an academy, there were also private academies under the direction of eminent scholars. The origin of the office of hakham is as doubtful as its duration.

Frankel thinks that [[Joshua ben Hananiah]], who lived in the beginning of the second century C.E., was the first hakham, but he does not sufficiently support this assertion. The office seems to have existed in Palestine as long as the academy of the nasi. An [[Amoraim|amora]] of the fourth century recounts the following rule of etiquette, still observed in his time: "When the hakham appears in the academy everyone present must rise as soon as he comes within four ells of him, and must remain standing until he has gone four ells beyond". It is hardly possible that the office of hakham existed in Babylonia, where the relation of the [[exilarch]] to the heads of the academy was entirely different from that existing in Palestine between the latter and the nasi. Here "hakham" was merely the term for a Jewish scholar who studied chiefly oral traditions, while the terms ''[[sofer]]'' and ''qara'' were applied to Bible scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Ḳiddushin 49a,b; Soṭah 49a; Yer. Soṭah ix. 23b; Yer. Ta'anit iv. 68a, where "ḥakkim" is used ironically for the ḥakam of the academy&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Seder Olam Zutta]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"M. J. C." ed. Neubauer, pp. 71 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; every exilarch is accompanied by a hakham, who probably had charge of the religious affairs of the exilarchate; but as this work originated in Palestine, the author probably applied Palestinian conditions to Babylon. The Syrian [[Aphrahat]], who had met only Babylonian Jews, mentions a man "who is called the 'hakkima' of the Jews",&lt;ref&gt;"Homilies," xxiv., ed. Wright, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; but this too may mean "the wise man" of the Jews.

The plural, "hakhamim," is generally used in the Talmud, and also by the [[Tannaim]], to designate the majority of scholars as against a single authority. The Aramean equivalent is "rabbanan."

==Among the Sephardim==
Among [[Sephardi Jews]] (particularly [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]]), "hakham" is the official title of the local rabbi, but it is not known how old the title is. [[Shlomo ben Aderet]] addresses some of his responsa to people with "lehakham Rabbi . . .",&lt;ref&gt;Responsa, Nos. 79, 395&lt;/ref&gt; others again with "larab Rabbi . . .",&lt;ref&gt;Nos. 219, 346&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible that "lehakham" simply means "to the wise." 

The surname ''Hacham'' is found among both Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews, including variations such as  ''Hachami'', ''Hachamovich'', ''Hachamson''.

==In Muslim countries==
In the [[Muslim world]], a [[rabbi]] was often called a ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ḥākhām}}'' because ''al-Rab'' is one of the [[names of God in Islam]] and may have caused offense due to misunderstanding. Thus the [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was called the [[Hakham Bashi]] (Hahambaşı {{lang|ota|حاخامباشی}}).

Although the word ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ḥākhām}}'' is derived from the common [[Semitic root]] ''{{transl|sem|[[Heth|Ḥ]]-[[Kaph|K]]-[[Mem|M]]}}'', the second consonant is generally spelled with a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[ḫāʾ]]}}'' ⟨{{lang|ar|خ}}⟩ in Arabic and in languages that use [[Arabic alphabet]] to reflect the Hebrew pronunciation: {{lang|ar|حاخام}}. The term is [[cognate]] to the Arabic words {{lang|ar|حاكم}} ''{{transl|ar|Ala-LC|ḥākim}}'' (ruler/lord) and {{lang|ar|حكيم}} ''{{transl|ar|Ala-LC|ḥakīm}}'' (wise man).

==Karaite Judaism==
In [[Karaite Judaism]], spiritual leaders are called ''hakham'' to distinguish them from their [[Rabbi]]nic (i.e. non-Karaite) counterparts.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Since Karaite theology is based on the use of reason by individuals to determine the applications of the [[Hebrew Bible]]'s laws for themselves, the role of a ''hakham'' is more "advisory" than that of a rabbi in standard [[Orthodox Judaism]].

In '''Hindu cosmology''', the universe is cyclically created and destroyed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science--from the Baby|author=Dick Teresi|page=174|publisher=SimonandSchuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its cosmology divides time into four epochs or Yuga, of which the current period is the [[Kali Yuga]]. 

==Description==
According to Hindu vedic cosmology, there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Sushil Mittal, Gene Thursby | page = 284 | title = Hindu World | publisher = Routledge | date = 2012 | isbn=9781134608751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the space and universe has neither start nor end, rather it is cyclical. The current universe is just the start of a present cycle preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Andrew Zimmerman Jones | page = 262 | title = String Theory For Dummies | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | date = 2009 | isbn=9780470595848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant theme in Puranic Hindu cosmology, state Chapman and Driver, is of cycles and repetition. There are multiple universes, each takes birth from chaos, grows, decays and dies into chaos, to be reborn again. Further, there are different and parallel realities. Brahma's one day equals 4.32 billion years which is a Kalpa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=units+of+time+in+hinduism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF1eKjhc_VAhUGQo8KHf3TB-cQ6AEIYTAK#v=onepage&amp;q=units%20of%20time%20in%20hinduism&amp;f=false|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|publisher= The Rosen Publishing Group|page=180|author= James G. Lochtefeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Kalpa is subdivided into four yuga (''caturyuga'', also called ''mahayuga'').&lt;ref name="Chapman2002p8"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Graham Chapman|author2=Thackwray Driver|title=Timescales and Environmental Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__2EAgAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-78754-8|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are ''krita'' (or ''satya''), ''treta'', ''dvapara'' and ''kali'' yugas. The current time is stated to be one of ''kali yuga''. The starting year, length of each, or the grand total, is not consistent in the [[Puranas]]. According to [[Ludo Rocher]], the total of four yugas is typically 4,320,000 years, of which 432,000 years is assigned to be the duration of the kali yuga.&lt;ref name="Rocher1986p124"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludo Rocher|title=The Purāṇas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0-4RJh5FgoC|year=1986|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-02522-5|pages=123–125, 130-132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John E. Mitchiner|title=Traditions Of The Seven Rsis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phGzVwTTp_gC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1324-3|pages=141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The concept of four cosmic periods (yuga) is also found in Greek, Roman, Irish and Babylonian mythologies, where each age becomes more sinful and of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Bolton|title=The Order of the Ages: World History in the Light of a Universal Cosmogony |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72ksMogzRvMC&amp;pg=PA64 |year=2001|publisher=Sophia Perennis|isbn=978-0-900588-31-0|pages=64–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Roman version found in the early 1st-century ''Metamorphoses'' of [[Ovid]] calls it Silvern (white), Golden (yellow), Bronze (red) and Iron (black) ages.&lt;ref name= Mackenzie310/&gt; [[Plato]] too divides the concept of universal time into ages, and suggests time being cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Bolton|title=The Order of the Ages: World History in the Light of a Universal Cosmogony |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72ksMogzRvMC&amp;pg=PA65 |year=2001|publisher=Sophia Perennis|isbn=978-0-900588-31-0|pages=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of years in the Babylonian mythology is the same 432,000 years (120 saroi) as the Indian mythologies.&lt;ref name= Mackenzie310&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Alexander Mackenzie|title=Mythology of the Babylonian People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTrXAAAAMAAJ |year=1915|publisher=Bracken Books|isbn=978-0-09-185145-3|pages=310–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A few Hindu texts state that the world is destroyed at the end of the Kali Yuga, but most Hindu texts present the alternate cyclical theory, wherein ''caturyugas'' follow each other without interruption.&lt;ref name="Rocher1986p124"/&gt; The numerous differences in Hindu cosmology has been used by some scholars to chronologically date the texts that contain them, based on the presumption that the simpler models preceded more elaborate mythologically richer ones.&lt;ref name="Rocher1986p124"/&gt;

===Rigveda: speculation on universe's creation===
The ''[[Rigveda]]'' which is variously dated, generally in the second half of the 2nd-millennium BCE,{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=37}} presents many theories of cosmology. For example:
* ''Hiranyagarbha sukta'', its hymn 10.121, states a golden child was born in the universe and was the lord, established earth and heaven, then asks but who is the god to whom we shall offer the sacrificial prayers?&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lanman, [https://archive.org/stream/sacredbooksearly09hornuoft#page/48/mode/2up To the unknown god], Book X, Hymn 121, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: [[Max Muller]], Oxford, pages 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Devi sukta'', its hymn 10.125, states a goddess is all, the creator, the created universe, the feeder and the lover of the universe;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lanman, [https://archive.org/stream/sacredbooksearly09hornuoft#page/46/mode/2up Hymns by Women], Book X, Hymn 125, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: [[Max Muller]], Oxford, pages 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Nasadiya sukta'', its hymn 10.129, asks who created the universe, does anyone really know, and whether it can ever be known.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lanman, [https://archive.org/stream/sacredbooksearly09hornuoft#page/48/mode/2up The Creation Hymn], Book X, Hymn 129, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: [[Max Muller]], Oxford, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Henry White Wallis, the ''Rigveda'' and other Vedic texts are full of alternative cosmological theories and curiosity questions. For example, the hymn 1.24 of the Rigveda asks, "these stars, which are set on high, and appear at night, whither do they go in the daytime?" and hymn 10.88 wonders, "how many fires are there, how many suns, how many dawns, how many waters? I am not posing an awkward question for you fathers; I ask you, poets, only to find out?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry White Wallis|title=The Cosmology of the Ṛigveda: An Essay|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9xBCAAAAIAAJ|year= 1887|publisher= Williams and Norgate|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie L. Patton|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind: Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSZmbbsg9bEC |year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93088-9|pages=113, 216}}&lt;/ref&gt; To its numerous open-ended questions, the Vedic texts present a diversity of thought, in verses imbued with symbols and allegory, where in some cases forces and agencies are clothed with a distinct personality, while in other cases as nature with or without anthropomorphic activity such as forms of mythical sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Henry White Wallis|title= The Cosmology of the Ṛigveda: An Essay|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9xBCAAAAIAAJ|year= 1887|publisher= Williams and Norgate|pages=61-73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rigveda'' contains the [[Nasadiya sukta]] hymn which does not offer a cosmological theory, but asks cosmological questions about the nature of universe and how it began:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Darkness there was at first, by darkness hidden;
Without distinctive marks, this all was water;
That which, becoming, by the void was covered;
That One by force of heat came into being;

Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it?
Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?
Gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.
Who then knows whence it has arisen?

Whether God's will created it, or whether He was mute;
Perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not;
Only He who is its overseer in highest heaven knows,
Only He knows, or perhaps He does not know.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Vedic: 3 lokas===
Deborah Soifer describes the development of the concept of lokas as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of a loka or lokas develops in the Vedic literature. Influenced by the special connotations that a word for space might have for a nomadic people, ''loka'' in the Veda did not simply mean place or world, but had a positive valuation: it was a place or position of religious or psychological interest with a special value of function of its own. Hence, inherent in the 'loka' concept in the earliest literature was a double aspect; that is, coexistent with spatiality was a religious or soteriological meaning, which could exist independent of a spatial notion, an 'immaterial' significance. The most common cosmological conception of lokas in the Veda was that of the trailokya or triple world: three worlds consisting of earth, atmosphere or sky, and heaven, making up the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Soiver, Deborah A., State University of New York Press (Nov 1991), {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0799-8}} p. 51, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OoFDK_sDGHwC&amp;pg=PA51 The Myths of Narasimha and Vamana: Two Avatars in Cosmological Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Puranas: 14 lokas===
The later [[Purana|Puranic]] view asserts that the Universe is created, destroyed, and re-created in an eternally repetitive series of cycles. A day of [[Brahma]], the creator, endures for about 4,320,000,000 years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science--from the Baby|author=Dick Teresi|page=174|publisher=SimonandSchuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'', there are fourteen worlds. However, other Puranas give different version of this cosmology and associated myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA83 |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Brahmanda version, the ''loka'' consist of seven higher ones (''Vyahrtis'') and seven lower ones (''[[patala|Pātāla]]s''), as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Grimes|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA95 |year=1996|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3067-5|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ganga Ram Garg|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA446|year=1992|publisher=Concept |isbn=978-81-7022-375-7|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Bhuloka'', ''Bhuvar Loka'', ''[[svarga]]'', ''Mahar Loka'', ''Jana Loka'', ''Tapa Loka'', and ''[[Satyaloka]]'' above, and
*''Atala'', ''Vitala'', ''Sutala'', ''Rasaataala'', ''Talatala'', ''Mahaatala'',  ''[[Patala]]'' and ''[[Naraka (Hinduism)|naraka]]'' below.

The same 14 lokas (worlds) are described in chapter 2.5 of the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A. Holdrege|title=Bhakti and Embodiment: Fashioning Divine Bodies and Devotional Bodies in Krsna Bhakti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9FgCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-66910-4|pages=334 note 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puranas genre of Indian literature, found in Hinduism and Jainism, contain a section on cosmology and cosmogony as a requirement. There are dozens of different Mahapuranas and Upapuranas, each with its own theory integrated into a proposed human history consisting of solar and lunar dynasties. Some are similar to Indo-European creation myths, while others are novel. One cosmology, shared by Hindu, Buddhist and Jain texts involves Mount Meru, with stars and sun moving around it using ''Dhruva'' (North Star) as the focal reference.&lt;ref name="EliadeAdams1987p106"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mircea Eliade|author2=Charles J. Adams|title=The Encyclopedia of religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TwjAAAAYAAJ|year= 1987|publisher= Macmillan|isbn= 978-0-02-909730-4|pages= 100–113, 116-117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Strides of Vishnu: Hindu Culture in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtLScrjrWiAC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971825-2|pages=151–155 (Matsya Purana and other examples)}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus, the diversity of cosmology theories in Hinduism may reflect its tendency to not reject new ideas and empirical observations as they became available, but to adapt and integrate them creatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annette Wilke|author2=Oliver Moebus|title=Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wmYz_OtZ_gC&amp;pg=PA259 |year=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-024003-0|pages=259–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiverse in Hinduism==

The concept of [[multiverses]] is mentioned many times in Hindu [[Puranic]] literature, such as in the [[Bhagavata Purana]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Every universe is covered by seven layers — earth, water, fire, air, sky, the total energy and false ego — each ten times greater than the previous one. There are '''innumerable universes''' besides this one, and although they are unlimitedly large, they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited'' (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.37)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=137|author=Bryan E. Penprase}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ipgVDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23|title=A Traveler's Guide to the Afterlife: Traditions and Beliefs on Death, Dying, and What Lies Beyond|first=Mark|last=Mirabello|page=23|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Analogies to describe multiple universes also exist in the Puranic literature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The '''countless universes''', each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion'' (Bhagavata Purana 10.87.41) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fritz Jahr and the Foundations of Global Bioethics: The Future of Integrative Bioethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ndw2GXCy-IsC&amp;pg=PA348|page=348|author=Amir Muzur, Hans-Martin Sass|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The layers or elements covering the '''universes''' are each ten times thicker than the one before, and all the universes clustered together appear like atoms in a huge combination'' (Bhagavata Purana 3.11.41)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrwxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|title=The Bhagavata Purana: Sacred Text and Living Tradition|page=60|author=Ravi M. Gupta, Kenneth R. Valpey|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC&amp;pg=PA200|title=The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana: Mysteries of the Sacred Universe|page=200|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|author=Richard L. Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''And who will search through the wide infinities of space to count the '''universes''' side by side, each containing its Brahma, its Vishnu, its Shiva? Who can count the Indras in them all--those Indras side by side, who reign at once in all the '''innumerable worlds'''; those others who passed away before them; or even the Indras who succeed each other in any given line, ascending to godly kingship, one by one, and, one by one, passing away'' (Brahma Vaivarta Purana)

== Reception ==
According to [[Carl Sagan]]: 

{{cquote|"The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Sagan|title= Cosmos|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cDKODQAAQBAJ |year= 2013|publisher= Ballantine|isbn= 978-0-345-53943-4|page= 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Leo-baeck-haus.berlin.II.JPG|thumb|The quondam building of the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums at Tucholskystraße 9 in Berlin (since 1999 named Leo-Baeck-Haus and seat of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]])]]

'''Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums''', or '''Higher Institute for Jewish Studies''', was a [[rabbi]]nical [[seminary]], established in [[Berlin]] in 1872 and closed down by the Nazi government of Germany in 1942. Upon the order of the government, the name was officially changed (1883–1923 and 1933–42) to Lehranstalt für die Wissenschaft des Judentums.

==History ==
[[Abraham Geiger]], who had been active in establishing Reform Judaism, wanted a university for Jewish studies in Berlin. Unable to become part of the [[University of Berlin]], he was involved in 1870 in creating a separate institution. Also involved were [[David Cassel]], [[Israel Lewy]] and [[Heyman Steinthal]], the Jewish "intellectuals" and professors at the University of Berlin.

Geiger's "General Introduction to the Science of Judaism," "Introduction to the Biblical Writings" and "Lectures on Pirḳe Abot" were originally delivered as lectures at the seminary. Some of the best German-Jewish teachers taught there in the spirit of the ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' movement: [[Hanoch Albeck]], [[Ismar Elbogen]], Julius Grünthal, [[Julius Guttmann]], [[Franz Rosenthal]], [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai|Harry Torczyner]], and [[Leo Baeck]].

[[Moritz Steinschneider]] referred to the ''Hochschule'' as a "new ghetto of Jewish learning," which he felt could ultimately not produce the standards of scholarship achieved in the university setting {{Harv|Mendes-Flohr|1998}}.

Officially the institution was not affiliated with a movement or denomination. It sought free inquiry and research without any restrictions. It stood for a conservative Judaism, but its main object was the scientific study of things Jewish, freed as far as possible from denominational disputes. There was no religious test for professors but it was assumed that all of the faculty lived according to the Jewish tradition and were fluent in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. As the school was never dependent on any religious or public organization, the board was constantly engaged in raising money from wealthy contributors, sponsors of scholarly "chairs" and scholarships.

In 1872, the first year, there were only 12 students, including four women. In 1921, there were 63 full-time and 45 part-time students enrolled in the "Hochschule". Many of the students came from the Eastern European countries, notably [[Poland]], as graduates of Orthodox [[Yeshivot]]. By 1930–33 the school had achieved so great a reputation that many non-Jews, especially [[Christian clergy]], enrolled.

'''"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due'''" is the opening track of [[thrash metal]] band [[Megadeth]]'s 1990 album ''[[Rust in Peace]]''. The song has an unusual structure: it opens with a fast thrash section, shifting at 2:26 after an acoustic [[bridge (music)|bridge]] by [[Marty Friedman]] to a different, slower and heavier section called "The Punishment Due", interspersed by two guitar solos played by Friedman, before speeding up again with a third and final solo played during this segment by Dave Mustaine.  The entire song is commonly referred to as "Holy Wars".

The lyrics deal with global religious conflict, particularly in [[Israel]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. In an interview with the UK magazine ''Guitarist'', Dave Mustaine said that he was inspired to write the song in Northern Ireland, when he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale and was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fundraising activities for "The Cause" (i.e. [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|the Provisional Irish Republican Army]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/interviews_holywars1990.html The Realms of Deth - Megadeth Interviews - Dave the Human, Mustaine the Artist]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Punishment Due" is based on the popular [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book character, the [[Punisher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/lyrics_rust.html#Punishment The Realms of Deth - Megadeth Lyrics - Rust in Peace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A cover version of the song is playable in the band simulation game ''[[Rock Revolution]]''. The master recording is purchasable as part of the ''[[Rust in Peace]]'' album pack on the ''[[Rock Band]]'' band simulation platform, is playable in the ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock]]'' game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/08/17/full-guitar-hero-warriors-of-rock-track-list-revealed/|title=Full Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock track list revealed|author-first=Griffin|author-last=McElroy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is available as DLC for ''[[Rocksmith 2014]].'' The music video for "Holy Wars... The Punishment Due" was filmed in August 1990 (around the time of the [[Gulf War]] in 1990). It depicts news footage of various armed conflicts, mainly from the [[Middle East]] interspliced with footage of the band playing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5441">'''Igbe religion''', popularly known as Igbe (an [[Urhobo language|Urhobo]] word meaning [[dance]]) was founded by Ubiecha Etarakpo in 1858 and has its headquarters at 11, Egbo Street, [[Kokori]] Inland, [[Ethiope East]] Local Government Area, [[Delta State]], [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Success Akpojotor, Pre-Colonial Socio-Political History of Kokori Inland. B. A Thesis ([[University of Benin (Nigeria)|University of Benin]], [[Benin City]], Nigeria). 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenationlineng.net/2011/index&lt;/ref&gt;

The holy (sacred) day is known as Edigbe, meaning the day of joy.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Urhobo Culture By Peter Palmer Ekeh&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;pp.346-7&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a religion based on dance, as its medium of worship to [[God]]. It began as a [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]]-Kokori traditional sect, and in the 20th century was influenced by an influx of [[Christianity|Christian]] evangelism.&lt;ref&gt;Success Akpojotor, pp.44-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating in Kokori, it gradually spread in Urhobo nation and [[South|austral]] [[Nigeria]] at large.&lt;ref&gt;Success Akpojotor, pp.46-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

The adherents of the Igbe religion are [[monotheists]] who believe in an [[omnipresent]], [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and [[omnibenevolent]] [[God]] called [[Oghene]] and that he rewards the good and evil alike, according to their deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Success Akpojotor, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance is a core element of the Igbe. The adherents believe that by dancing, they draw on themselves the very hand of the one and only monotheistic God.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Worship==

As dancing is a core element of the Igbe, there is no worship session without dancing. They sing  native Urhobo songs in place of hymns. At worship services, the Igbe priest(s), always dressed in white dress and white head gears, administer(s) native chalk on the worshippers for their protection.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Odje, Kokori People, Ancient and Modern, [[Benin]]: Assembly Printers, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Igbe religion celebrates an annual feast, Ore Isi, for twelve days. It takes place every May, with thousands are in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;S. Odje, p115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Igbe was founded in 1858, in [[Kokori]] Nigeria. Ubiecha Etarakpo allegedly saw an apparition of two divine beings who "anointed" him to preach against immorality and witchcraft. After the alleged apparition, Ubiecha became eccentric and acted insanely as no day passed without him dancing. This scared the people from coming close. It was also alleged that after the alleged apparition, Ubiecha performed amazing miracles, accurately predicted the future, healed the sick and miraculously identified witches. He built a worship house called 'ogua' in his compound and, from there, ministered to the people with native white chalk; and, allegedly prophesied with stunning accuracy. This brought people from across the Urhobo country to Kokori.&lt;ref&gt;Success Akpojotor, pp. 44-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Odje, pp.113-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubiecha died in 1920, after gaining fame and wealth&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Odje, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationonlineng.net/2011/index&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==

After Ubiecha's death and burial. His children became divided over succession. By tradition, his eldest son, Ibodje Ubiecha succeeded his father as chief priest and head prophet; but his half brother, Akpokovo Ubiecha, established his own branch in Kokori. One of Ibodje's daughters, Mary Ibodje, a priestess, also broke away to establish her own branch before Ibodje death in 1986. Jackson Ibodje, his eldest son, succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Odje, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syncretism==

With the influx of Christianity into Kokori in the 20th century, the Igbe was influenced by the presence and works of the [[Christian Church]]'s evangelism. Another Igbe organisation was founded by Chief Ogbevire Ogogo. This Igbe sect was infused with some elements of [[Christianity]]. They observed [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]] holidays coupled with the Igbe core festival. It gained recognition and spread in [[Delta State|Delta]], [[Edo]], [[Ondo State|Ondo]], [[Rivers]] and [[Lagos]] states of [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Odje, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

Though the Igbe extends beyond [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]] land, the bulk of adherents remain Urhobo people and the principal medium of communication is largely the Urhobo language.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenationlineng.net/2011/index&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Igbe has been criticized for rejecting conventional medical treatment. Igbe adherents believe and administer the native chalk for treatment of ailments. This has been viewed as dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been objections to the principal utilization of [[Urhobo language|Urhobo]] language at worship sessions,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been criticized as a religion of idol worship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Islam]] in Argentina''' is represented by one of largest [[Muslim]] minorities. Although accurate statistics on religion are not available (because the national census does not solicit religious data) the actual size of [[Argentina]]'s Muslim community is estimated around 1% of the total population (400,000 to 500,000 members) according to the [[International Religious Freedom Report]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2010|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010/148731.htm|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Research Centre estimates about 1,000,000 Muslims in Argentina in the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table: Muslim Population by Country|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/|publisher=Pewforum.org|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] however approximates that 1.9% of the population profess Islam as their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_11_2.asp|title=Religious Adherents, 2010 (World Christian Database)|author=|publisher=the ARDA|year=2010 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Muslim immigration ==
There are some indications that the Muslim presence within present day Argentinian territory dates back to the time of the Spanish exploration and conquest. The first mentioned Muslim settlers were the 15th century's [[Moors|Moor]]ish-[[Morisco]] (Muslims of the Iberian peninsula of  North African, Middle-Eastern and Spanish descent) who explored the Americas with Spanish explorers, many of them settling in Argentina who were fleeing from persecution in [[Spain]] such as the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;''Muslims in American History: A Forgotten Legacy'' by Jerald Dirks.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 19th century Argentina saw the first real wave of Arabs to settle within its territory, mostly from [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. It is estimated that today there are about 3.5 million Argentinians of Arab descent, most of whom are Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.udayton.edu/race/06hrights/GeoRegions/SouthAmerica/argentina01.htm September 2001 Executive Summary, Racial Discrimination: The Record of Argentina, Human Rights Documentation Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic institutions in Argentina==
The first two mosques in the country were built in [[Buenos Aires]] in the 80s: [[At-Tauhid Mosque]] was opened in 1983 by the [[Shia Islam|shia]] community of Buenos Aires and with the support of the Embassy of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] to Argentina, while [[Al Ahmad Mosque]] was opened in 1985 for the [[sunni]] Muslims and is the first building with Islamic architecture in the country. There are also several mosques in other cities and regions throughout the country, including two in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], two in [[Mar del Plata]] and the southernmost [[Sufi]] mosque in the world, in [[El Bolsón, Río Negro|El Bolsón]].

The [[King Fahd Islamic Cultural Centre]], the largest mosque in Argentina, was completed in 1996 with the help of the [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]], the then King of Saudi Arabia, [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]], on a piece of land measuring 20,000 m². The total land area granted by the Argentine government measures 34,000 m², and was offered by President [[Carlos Menem]] following his visit to [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1992. The project cost around US$30 million, and includes a mosque, library, two schools, a park, is located in the middle-class district of [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]].

The [[Islamic Organization of Latin America]] (IOLA), headquartered in Argentina, is considered the most active organization in [[Latin America]] in promoting Islamic affiliated endeavors. The IOLA holds events to promote the unification of Muslims living in Latin America, as well as the propagation of Islam.

'''John Whiteside''' "'''Jack'''" '''Parsons''' (born '''Marvel Whiteside Parsons''';{{refn|group=nb|Parsons' name was never formally changed. Although legal documents referred to him as John, the obituary at his funeral used his birth name, and his death certificate refers to him as "Marvel [[Pseudonym|aka]] John". (Carter 2004, pp. 2, 182, 199).}} October 2, 1914 – June 17, 1952) was an American [[aerospace engineering|rocket engineer]] and [[Spacecraft propulsion|rocket propulsion]] researcher, [[chemist]], and [[Thelema|Thelemite]] [[occult]]ist. Associated with the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), Parsons was one of the principal founders of both the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and the [[Aerojet|Aerojet Engineering Corporation]]. He invented the first [[rocket engine]] to use a [[Castability|castable]], [[Composite material|composite]] [[rocket propellant]],&lt;ref name=Huntley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntley|first=J.D.|title= The History of Solid-Propellant Rocketry: What We Do and Do Not Know|url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88635main_H-2330.pdf|citeseerx = 10.1.1.8.3448|page = 3|publisher=[[Armstrong Flight Research Center]]/[[Pennsylvania State University]]|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pioneered the advancement of both [[Liquid-fuel rocket|liquid-fuel]] and [[Solid-fuel rocket|solid-fuel]] rockets.

Born in Los Angeles, Parsons was raised by a wealthy family on [[Orange Grove Boulevard (Pasadena)|Orange Grove Avenue]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. Inspired by [[science fiction]] literature, he developed an interest in rocketry in his childhood and in 1928 began [[Amateur rocketry|amateur rocket experiments]] with school friend Ed Forman. He dropped out of [[Pasadena City College|Pasadena Junior College]] and [[Stanford University]] due to financial difficulties during the [[Great Depression]], and in 1934 he united with Forman and graduate student [[Frank Malina]] to form the Caltech-affiliated [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] (GALCIT) Rocket Research Group, supported by GALCIT chairman [[Theodore von Kármán]]. In 1939 the GALCIT Group gained funding from the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) to work on [[JATO|Jet-Assisted Take Off]] (JATO) for the U.S. military. Following American entry into World War II, in 1942 they founded Aerojet to develop and sell their JATO technology; the GALCIT Group became JPL in 1943.

After a brief involvement with [[Marxism]] in 1939, Parsons converted to [[Thelema]], the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[new religious movement]]. In 1941, alongside his first wife Helen Northrup, Parsons joined the [[Agape Lodge]], the Californian branch of the Thelemite [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.). At Crowley's bidding, he replaced [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons was expelled from JPL and Aerojet in 1944 due to the Lodge's infamous reputation, along with his hazardous workplace conduct.

In 1945 Parsons separated from Helen after having an affair with her sister [[Sara Northrup Hollister|Sara]]; when Sara left him for [[L. Ron Hubbard]], he conducted the [[Babalon Working]], a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess [[Babalon]] to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with [[Marjorie Cameron]], whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the [[History of the Israel Defense Forces|Israeli]] rocket program. Amid the climate of [[McCarthyism]], he was accused of [[espionage]] and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952 Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or murder.

Parsons' occult and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] writings were published posthumously, with [[Western esotericism|Western esoteric]] and countercultural circles citing him as one of the most significant figures in propagating Thelema across North America. Although academic interest in his scientific career was negligible, historians came to recognize Parsons' contributions to rocket engineering. For these innovations, his advocacy of [[space exploration]] and [[human spaceflight]], and his role in the founding of JPL and Aerojet, Parsons is regarded as among the most important figures in the history of the U.S. space program. He has been the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals, including the television drama ''[[Strange Angel]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life: 1914–34===
Marvel Whiteside Parsons was born on October 2, 1914, at the [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Los Angeles)|Good Samaritan Hospital]] in Los Angeles.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 1|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 26}} His parents, Ruth Virginia Whiteside (''c.'' 1893–1952) and Marvel H. Parsons (''c.'' 1894–1947), had moved to California from Massachusetts the previous year, purchasing a house on Scarf Street in downtown Los Angeles. Their son was his father's namesake, but was known in the household as Jack.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1p = 1|1pp = 21–25}} The marriage broke down soon after Jack's birth, when Ruth discovered that his father had made numerous visits to a prostitute, and she filed for divorce in March 1915. Parsons' father returned to Massachusetts after being publicly exposed as an adulterer, with Ruth forbidding him from having any contact with Jack.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 1–2|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 26–27}} Parsons' father later joined the armed forces, reaching the rank of major, and married a woman with whom he had a son named Charles, a half-brother Jack would only meet once.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 103–105i}} Although she retained her ex-husband's surname, Ruth started calling her son John; many friends throughout his life knew him as Jack.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 2}} Ruth's parents Walter and Carrie Whiteside moved to California to be with Jack and their daughter, using their wealth to buy an up-market house on Orange Grove Avenue in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]—known locally as "Millionaire's Mile"—where they could live together.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 2–3|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 28}} Jack was surrounded by domestic servants.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 33–40}} Having few friends, he lived a solitary childhood and spent much time reading; he took a particular interest in works of mythology, [[Arthurian legend]], and the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 33–40}} Through the works of [[Jules Verne]] he became interested in [[science fiction]] and a keen reader of [[pulp magazine]]s like ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', which led to his early interest in [[rocket]]ry.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 33–40}}{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 42–43}}

When he was twelve, Parsons began attending Washington Junior High School, where he performed poorly—something biographer [[George Pendle]] attributed to undiagnosed [[dyslexia]]—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 4–5|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 44–47}} Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy from a poor working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto ''[[per aspera ad astra]]'' (''through hardship to the stars'')—began engaging in homemade [[gunpowder]]-based rocket experiments in the nearby [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] canyon, as well as the Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as [[cherry bomb]]s into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as [[aluminium foil]] to make the gunpowder easier to cast.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 4–5|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 44–47}}&lt;ref name="spacesafety"&gt;{{cite web|last=Keane|first=Phillip|title=Jack Parsons and the Occult Roots of JPL|url=http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/2013/08/02/jack-parsons-occult-roots-jpl/|work=spacesafetymagazine.com|publisher=[[International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety]]|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eng|first=Christina|title=It took a rocket scientist / Research pioneer also delved into the occult|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/It-took-a-rocket-scientist-Research-pioneer-2697472.php|website=sfgate.com|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=May 12, 2014|date=February 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons had also begun to investigate [[occultism]], and performed a ritual intended to invoke [[the Devil]] into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 4|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 46}} In 1929 he began attending [[John Muir High School]], where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in [[fencing]] and [[archery]]. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in [[San Diego]]—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 47, 182}}

[[File:Wernher von Braun 1960.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The young Parsons spoke for hours with [[Wernher von Braun]] in phone correspondence about rocketry.]]

The Parsons family spent mid-1929 on a tour of Europe before returning to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]] their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 5|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 56–57}} Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper ''El Universitano'' and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 6|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 57–59}} With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the [[Hercules Powder Company]], where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 6|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 59–60}} He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel [[rocket engine]], and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including [[Robert H. Goddard]], [[Hermann Oberth]], [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], [[Willy Ley]] and [[Wernher von Braun]]. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone conversations about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 6|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 60–61}}{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 54–55}}&lt;ref name="spacesafety"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;{{cite web|title=JPL 101|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/about_JPL/jpl101.pdf|website=jpl.nasa.gov|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology|accessdate=January 18, 2015|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons graduated from University School in 1933, and moved with his mother and grandmother to a more modest house on St. John Avenue, where he continued to pursue his interests in literature and poetry.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 7|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 61}} He enrolled in [[Pasadena Junior College]] with the hope of earning an [[associate degree]] in physics and chemistry, but dropped out after only a term because of his financial situation and took up permanent employment at the Hercules Powder Company.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 6|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 61}} His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in [[Hercules, California]] on [[San Francisco Bay]], where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to [[nitroglycerin]]. He saved money in the hope of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at [[Stanford University]], but found the tuition fees unaffordable and returned to Pasadena.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 62–64}}

===GALCIT Rocket Research Group and the Kynette trial: 1934–38===

In the hope of gaining access to the state-of-the-art resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture on the work of Austrian rocket engineer [[Eugen Sänger]] and hypothetical above-[[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] aircraft by the institute's [[William Bollay]]—a PhD student specializing in [[rocket-powered aircraft]]—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor.&lt;ref name="CaltechConway"&gt;{{cite web|last=Conway|first=Erik M.|title=From Rockets to Spacecraft: Making JPL a Place for Planetary Science|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4273/1/Spacecraft.pdf|website=calteches.library.caltech.edu|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=March 22, 2014|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malina&gt;{{cite web|last=Terrall|first=Mary|title=Interview With Frank J.

The trio focused their distinct skills on collaborative rocket development; Parsons was the chemist, Forman the machinist, and Malina the technical theoretician. Malina wrote in 1968 that the self-educated Parsons "lacked the discipline of a formal higher education, [but] had an uninhibited and fruitful imagination."&lt;ref name=Malina2&gt;{{cite web|last=Malina|first=Frank J.|title=The Rocket Pioneers|date=November 1968|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/601/1/ES50.2.1986.pdf|website=calteches.library.caltech.edu|pages=8–13|publisher=California Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The informally trained Parsons and Forman who, as described by [[Geoffrey A. Landis]], "were eager to try whatever idea happened to spring to mind", contrasted with the approach of Malina, who insisted on the need for scientific discipline as informed by von Kármán. Landis writes that their creativity "kept Malina focused toward building actual rocket engines, not just solving equations on paper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landis|first=Geoffrey|title=The Three Rocketeers
|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/the-three-rocketeers|website=americanscientist.org|publisher=[[Sigma Xi]]|year=2005|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing [[socialism|socialist]] values, they operated on an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] basis; Malina taught the others about scientific procedure and they taught him about the practical elements of rocketry. They often socialized, smoking [[marijuana]] and drinking, while Malina and Parsons set about writing a semiautobiographical science fiction screenplay they planned to pitch to Hollywood with strong [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 22–24|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 90–93, 118–120}}

[[File:P1-RocketBoys.jpg|thumb|left|[[GALCIT]] Group members in the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]], November 1936. Left foreground to right: [[Rudolph Schott]], Amo Smith, [[Frank Malina]], [[Ed Forman]], and Jack Parsons.]]

Parsons met Helen Northrup at a local church dance and proposed marriage in July 1934. She accepted and they were married in April 1935 at the Little Church of the Flowers in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale]], before undertaking a brief honeymoon in San Diego.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 7|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 84–89}} They moved into a house on South Terrace Drive, Pasadena, while Parsons gained employment for the explosives manufacturer Halifax Powder Company at their facility in [[Saugus, California|Saugus]]. Much to Helen's dismay, Parsons spent most of his wages funding the GALCIT Rocket Research Group.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 7|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 89}} For extra money he manufactured nitroglycerin in their home, constructing a home laboratory on their front porch. At one point he pawned Helen's engagement ring, and he often asked her family for loans.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 105–106}}

Malina recounted that "Parsons and Forman were not too pleased with an austere program that did not include at least the launching of model rockets",&lt;ref name="Malina2"/&gt; but the Group reached the consensus of developing a working static rocket motor before embarking on more complex research. They contacted [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fuel rocket]] pioneer Robert H. Goddard and he invited Malina to his facility in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], but he was not interested in cooperating—reticent about sharing his research and having been subjected to widespread derision for his work in rocketry.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 12|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 96–98}} They were instead joined by Caltech graduate students [[Apollo M. O. Smith|Apollo M. O. "Amo" Smith]], [[Carlos C. Wood]], [[Mark Muir Mills]], [[Fred S. Miller]], [[William C. Rockefeller]], and [[Rudolph Schott]]; Schott was relied upon for the use of his pickup truck to transport equipment.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 12|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 99}}  Their first liquid-fuel motor test took place near the [[Devil's Gate Dam]] in the Arroyo Seco on Halloween 1936.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 72|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 196–199}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=1217|title= The Spark of a New Era|website=jpl.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=October 25, 2006|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons' biographer John Carter described the layout of the contraption as showing{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 16}}

{{quote|text=oxygen flowing from one side, with methyl alcohol (the fuel) and nitrogen flowing from the other side. Water cooled the rocket during the burn. Thrust pulled down a spring which measured force. The deflection of the spring measured the force applied to it. A small diamond tip on the apparatus scratched a glass plate to mark the furthest point of deflection. The rocket and mount were protected by sandbags, with the tanks (and the experimenters) well away from it.}}

Three attempts to fire the rocket failed; on the fourth the oxygen line was accidentally ignited and perilously billowed fire at the Group, but they viewed this experience as formative.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 15–16|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 98–103}} They continued their experiments throughout the last quarter of 1936; after the final test was successfully completed in January  1937 von Kármán agreed that they could perform their future experiments at an exclusive rocket testing facility on campus.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 17|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 103}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early History &gt; First Rocket Test|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/|accessdate=April 5, 2014|website=jpl.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GALCIT History (1921–1940)|url=http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/about/history#1921|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1937 Caltech mathematician [[Qian Xuesen]] (a Chinese citizen) joined the Group. Several months later Weld Arnold, a Caltech laboratory assistant who worked as the Group's official photographer, also joined. The main reason for Arnold's appointment to this position was his provision of a donation to the Group on behalf of an anonymous benefactor.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 17|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 106–107}} They became well known on campus, earning the moniker of the "Suicide Squad" for the dangerous nature of some of their experiments and attracting attention from the local press.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 17–18|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 108–111}} Parsons himself gained further media publicity when he appeared as an expert explosives witness in the trial of Captain [[Earl Kynette]], the head of police intelligence in Los Angeles who was accused of conspiring to set a [[car bomb]] in the attempted murder of private investigator Harry Raymond, a former LAPD detective who was fired after whistleblowing against police corruption. When Kynette was convicted largely on Parsons' testimony, which included his forensic reconstruction of the car bomb and its explosion, his identity as an expert scientist in the public eye was established despite his lack of a university education.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 26–28|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 114–116}}&lt;ref name=Harnisch&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnisch|first=Larry|title=Jack Parsons, RIP|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2008/05/jack-parsons-ri.html|website=latimesblogs.latimes.com|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=March 29, 2014|date=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at Caltech, Parsons was admitted to evening courses in chemistry at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), but distracted by his GALCIT workload he attended sporadically and received unexceptional grades.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1pp = 112, 314}}

By early 1938 the Group had made their static rocket motor, which originally burned for three seconds, run for over a minute.{{sfnm|1a1 = Westwick|1y = 2007|1p = 1}}&lt;ref name="Rasmussen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|title=Life as Satanist Propelled Rocketeer|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/19/local/me-10501|website=articles.latimes.com|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=March 19, 2000|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May that year, Parsons was invited by [[Forrest J Ackerman]] to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society|Los Angeles Science Fiction League]] (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage [[Ray Bradbury]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 57–60|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 126–127}} Another scientist to become involved in the GALCIT project was [[Sidney Weinbaum]], a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive [[communism|communist]] discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the ''[[People's Daily World]]'' and joined the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), he refused to join the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1pp = 120–123}} This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1p = 130}}

===Embracing Thelema; advancing JATO and foundation of Aerojet: 1939–42===
[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Aleister Crowley]] (pictured in 1912), founder of [[Thelema]], was Parsons' spiritual mentor.]]

In January 1939 John and Frances Baxter, a brother and sister who had befriended Jack and Helen Parsons, took Jack to the Church of Thelema on Winona Boulevard, Hollywood, where he witnessed the performance of [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|The Gnostic Mass]]. Celebrants of the church had included Hollywood actor [[John Carradine]] and gay rights activist [[Harry Hay]]. Parsons was intrigued, having already heard of Thelema's founder and [[Ordo Templi Orientis#Structure|Outer Head]] of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), [[Aleister Crowley]], after reading a copy of Crowley's text ''[[Konx om Pax]]'' (1907).

Parsons was introduced to leading members [[Regina Kahl]], [[Jane Wolfe]], and [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] at the mass. Feeling both "repulsion and attraction" for Smith, Parsons continued to sporadically  attend the Church's events for a year.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 257–258|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2p = 33–36|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 133–136}} He continued to read Crowley's works, which increasingly interested him, and encouraged Helen to read them.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1p = 152}} Parsons came to believe in the reality of [[Magick (Thelema)|Thelemic magick]] as a force that could be explained through [[quantum physics]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1p = 152}} He tried to interest his friends and acquaintances in Thelema, taking science fiction writers [[Jack Williamson]] and [[Cleve Cartmill]] to a performance of The Gnostic Mass. Although they were unimpressed, Parsons was more successful with  [[Grady Louis McMurtry]], a young Caltech student he had befriended, as well as McMurtry's fiancée Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister [[Sara Northrup Hollister|Sara "Betty" Northrup]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 266|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2p = 41|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 169–172|4a1 = Kaczynski|4y = 2010|4p = 513}}

[[File:Grady Louis McMurtry 1941.JPG|thumb|right|[[Grady McMurtry]] was recruited into the O.T.O. by Parsons.]]
Jack and Helen were initiated into the Agape Lodge, the renamed Church of Thelema, in February 1941. Parsons adopted the Thelemic motto of ''Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae'', a Latin mistranslation of "The establishment of Thelema through the rituals of love". The initials of this motto spelled out T.O.P.A.N., also serving as the declaration "To Pan".{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 263|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2p = 56|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3p = 172}} Commenting on Parsons' errors of translation, in jest Crowley said that "the motto which you mention is couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding".{{sfn|Starr|2003|p = 263}} Parsons also adopted the Thelemic title ''Frater T.O.P.A.N''—with ''T.O.P.A.N'' represented in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] numerology as ''210''{{mdash}}the name with which he frequently signed letters to occult associates—while Helen became known as ''Soror Grimaud''.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 56}} Smith wrote to Crowley saying that Parsons was "a really excellent man&amp;nbsp;... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself&amp;nbsp;... JP is going to be very valuable".{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1p = 172}} Wolfe wrote to German O.T.O. representative [[Karl Germer]] that Parsons was "an A1 man&amp;nbsp;... Crowleyesque in attainment as a matter of fact", and mooted Parsons as a potential successor to Crowley as Outer Head of the Order.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1p = 173}} Crowley concurred with such assessments, informing Smith that Parsons "is the most valued member of the whole Order, with no exception!"{{sfn|Starr|2003|p = 263}}

At von Kármán's suggestion, [[Frank Malina]] approached the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) Committee on Army Air Corps Research to request funding for research into what they referred to as "[[jet propulsion]]", a term chosen to avoid the stigma attached to rocketry. The military were interested in jet propulsion as a means of getting aircraft quickly airborne where there was insufficient room for a full-length runway, and gave the Rocket Research Group $1,000 to put together a proposal on the feasibility of [[JATO|Jet-Assisted Take Off]] (JATO) by June 1939, making Parsons et al. the first U.S. government-sanctioned rocket research group. Since their formation in 1934, they had also performed experiments involving model, [[Black powder rocket motor|black powder motor]]-propelled [[multistage rocket]]s. In a research paper submitted to the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA), Parsons reported these rockets reaching velocities of 4,875 miles per hour, thereby demonstrating the potential of solid fuels to be more effective than the liquid types primarily preferred by researchers such as Goddard. In light of this progress, Caltech and the GALCIT Group received an additional $10,000 rocketry research grant from the AIAA.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 30–32|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 156–158}}

Although a quarter of their funding went on repairing damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted a report to the NAS in which they showed the feasibility of the project for the development of JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 32–33, 48|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 158–166}} Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and noise pollution, and were forced to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1pp = 158–166}} Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 48}}

Parsons is visible cropped out on the extreme left alongside Clark Blanchard Millikan, Martin Summerfield, Theodore von Kármán, Frank Malina and pilot, Captain Homer Boushey.]]
For the JATO project, they were joined by Caltech mathematician [[Martin Summerfield]] and 18 workers supplied by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Former colleagues like Qian were prevented from returning to the project by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), who ensured the secrecy of the operation and restricted the involvement of foreign nationals and political extremists.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1pp = 166–167}} The FBI was satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons' gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in [[San Quentin State Prison]] for two years. Englishman George Emerson replaced Arnold as the Group's official photographer.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 70–71|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 186–187}}

The Group's aim was to find a replacement for black-powder rocket motors—units consisting of charcoal, [[sulfur]] and [[potassium nitrate]] with a [[Binder (material)|binding agent]]. The mixture was unstable and there were frequent explosions damaging military aircraft.&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Crispin|title=Geek spirit: The man who kick-started the US rocket programme|url=https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2014/10/geek-spirit-the-man-who-kick-started-the-us-rocket-programme/|publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology (professional society)|Institution of Engineering and Technology]]|accessdate=October 19, 2014|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of [[amide]], [[corn starch]], and [[ammonium nitrate]] bound together in the JATO unit with glue and blotting paper. It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an [[ERCO Ercoupe]] plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.—watched by Clark Millikan and [[William F. Durand]]—piloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at [[March Air Reserve Base|March Air Force Base]] in [[Moreno Valley]], California. It proved a success and reduced takeoff distance by 30%, but one of the JATOs partially exploded.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 65–66|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 177–184}} Over the following weeks 62 further tests took place, and the NAS increased their grant to $125,000. During a series of static experiments, an exploding JATO did significant damage to the rear fuselage of an Ercoupe; one observer optimistically noted that "at least it wasn't a big hole", but necessary repairs delayed their efforts.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 184–185}}

The military ordered a flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' entry into the Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Axis powers]] was as much of a moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of [[gasoline]] with [[red fuming nitric acid]] as its [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]]; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for [[liquid oxygen]].&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference

Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with [[aniline]], resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped [[A-20A]] plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the [[Mojave Desert]]. It provided five times more thrust  than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that "We now have something that really works and we should be able to help give the Fascists hell!"{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 70–75|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 189–191}}

The Group then agreed to produce and sell 60 JATO engines to the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. To do so they formed the Aerojet Engineering Corporation in March 1942, in which Parsons, Forman, Malina, von Kármán, and Summerfield each invested $250, opening their offices on [[Colorado Boulevard]] and bringing in Amo Smith as their engineer. [[Andrew G. Haley]] was recruited by von Kármán as their lawyer and treasurer. Although Aerojet was a for-profit operation that provided technology for military means, the founders' mentality was rooted in the ideal of using rockets for peaceful space exploration. As Haley recounted von Kármán requesting: "we will make the rockets—you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on you will have to see that we all behave well in outer space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company History|url=http://rocket.com/company-history|website=rocket.com|publisher=Aerojet Rocketdyne|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these successes, Parsons, the [[Project engineering|project engineer]] of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated to address the malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust and did not have the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with [[guanidine nitrate]]. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid [[asphalt]] as an appropriate binding agent with [[potassium perchlorate]] as oxidizer.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 72|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 196–199}}

Malina recounted that Parsons was inspired to use asphalt by the ancient incendiary weapon [[Greek fire]]; in a 1982 talk for the [[International Association of Astronomical Artists]] Captain Boushey stated that Parsons experienced an epiphany after watching workers using molten asphalt to fix tiles onto a roof. Known as GALCIT-53, this fuel proved to be significantly more stable than the Group's earlier concoctions, fulfilling Parsons' aim of creating a restricted-burn rocket fuel inside a castable container, and providing a thrust 427% more powerful than that of GALCIT-27. This set a precedent which according to his biographer John Carter "changed the future of rocket technology": the [[thermoplastic]] asphalt [[casting]] was durable in all climates, allowing for mass production and indefinite storage and transforming solid-fuel agents into a safe and viable form of rocket propulsion. [[Plasticizer|Plasticized]] variants of Parsons' solid-fuel design invented by JPL's [[Charles Bartley]] were later used by [[NASA]] in [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s and by the [[Strategic Air Command]] in [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon]] and [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] intercontinental ballistic missiles.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 72|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 196–199}}&lt;ref name="Huntley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference

[[File:JATO unit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Solid-fuel [[JATO]] unit manufactured by [[Aerojet]] at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]]]
Aerojet's first two contracts were from the U.S. Navy; the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] requested a solid-fuel JATO and [[Wilbur Wright Field]] requested a liquid-fuel unit. The Air Corps had requested two thousand JATOs from Aerojet by late 1943, committing $256,000 toward Parsons' solid-fuel type. Despite this drastically increased turnover, the company continued to operate informally and remained intertwined with the GALCIT project. Caltech astronomer [[Fritz Zwicky]] was brought in as head of the company's research department. Haley replaced von Kármán as Aerojet chairman and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output; the alternative was to cut staff numbers while maintaining more generous salaries, but Haley's priority was Aerojet's contribution to the war effort. Company heads including Parsons were exempted from this austerity, drawing the ire of many personnel.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 73–76|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 191–192}}{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 76|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 223–226}}

Parsons' newfound credentials and financial security gave him the opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in [[Washington, D.C.]] he met Poet Laureate [[Joseph Auslander]], donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the [[Library of Congress]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 198, 203}} He also became a regular at the [[Mañana Literary Society]], which met in [[Laurel Canyon]] at the home of Parsons' friend [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and [[Anthony Boucher]]. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's ''[[Darker Than You Think]]'', a novelette published in the fantasy magazine ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery ''[[Rocket to the Morgue]]'' (1942).{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 228–230}}

Helen went away for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, encouraged to do so by the sexually permissive attitude of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 274|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2pp = 93–94|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 203–205|4a1 = Kaczynski|4y = 2010|4p = 537}} Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted for the rest of his life; the four remained friends.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 274|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 203–205}} The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an [[American Craftsman|American Craftsman-style]] mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 271–273, 276|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2pp = 83–84|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 207–210|4a1 = Kaczynski|4y = 2010|4p = 521}} Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu|Stele of Revealing]], a statue of [[Pan (god)|Pan]], and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 84|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 209–210|3a1 = Miller|3y = 2014|3p = 117}}

Although there were arguments among the commune members, Parsons remained dedicated to Thelema.

He frequently appeared at Aerojet hungover and sleep-deprived from late nights of Lodge activities, and invited many of his colleagues to them, drawing the ire of staff who previously tolerated Parsons' occultism as harmless eccentricity; known to von Kármán as a "delightful screwball", he was frequently observed reciting Crowley's poem "Hymn to Pan" in an ecstatic manner compared to the preaching of [[Billy Graham]] during rocket tests{{mdash}}and on request at parties to their great amusement. They disapproved of his hesitancy to separate his vocations; Parsons became more rigorously engaged in Aerojet's day-to-day business in an effort to resolve this weariness, but the Agape Lodge soon came under investigation by both the [[Pasadena Police Department (California)|Pasadena Police Department]] and the FBI. Both had received allegations of a "[[black magic]] cult" involved in sexual orgies; one complainant was a 16-year-old boy who said that he was raped by lodge members, while neighbors reported a ritual involving a naked pregnant woman jumping through fire. After Parsons explained that the Lodge was simply "an organization dedicated to religious and philosophical speculation", neither agency found evidence of illegal activity and came to the conclusion that the Lodge constituted no threat to national security.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 283–285|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2pp = 87–88|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 214–215|4a1 = Kaczynski|4y = 2010|4p = 525}} Having been a long-term heavy user of alcohol and marijuana, Parsons now habitually used [[cocaine]], [[amphetamines]], [[peyote]], [[mescaline]], and [[opiate]]s as well.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 216}}&lt;ref name="Rasmussen" /&gt; He continued to have sexual relations with multiple women, including McMurtry's fiancee Claire.

Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith removed as head of the Agape Lodge, believing that he had become a bad influence on its members. Parsons and Helen wrote to them to defend their mentor but Germer ordered him to stand down; Parsons was appointed as temporary head of the Lodge.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 278, 280–282|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 216–217, 220|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3pp = 524–525}} Some veteran Lodge members disliked Parsons' influence, concerned that it encouraged excessive sexual polyandry that was religiously detrimental, but his charismatic orations at Lodge meetings assured his popularity among the majority of followers. Parsons soon created the Thelemite journal ''Oriflamme'', in which he published his own poetry, but Crowley was unimpressed{{mdash}}particularly due to Parsons' descriptions of drug use{{mdash}}and the project was soon shelved.{{sfn|Parsons|2008|pp = 217–219}} Helen gave birth to Smith's son in April; the child was named Kwen Lanval Parsons.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 289|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2p = 88|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3p = 221}} Smith and Helen left with Kwen for a two-room cabin in Rainbow Valley in May.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 290–291|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2pp = 92–93|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 221–222}} Concurrently in England, Crowley undertook an [[astrology|astrological]] analysis of Smith's birth chart and came to the conclusion that Smith was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him. Smith remained skeptical as Crowley's analysis was seemingly deliberately devised in Parsons' favor, encouraging Smith to step down from his role in the Agape Lodge and instructing him to take a meditative retreat.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 294–298|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2pp = 90–91|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 221–222}} Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O. Parsons—who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict and was weary of Crowley's "appalling egotism, bad taste, bad judgement, and pedanticism"—ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head, but withdrew his resignation after receiving a pacifying letter from Crowley.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 299–300|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 222–223}}

[[File:Jack Parsons.jpg|thumb|right|Parsons standing above a [[JATO]] canister at JPL June 1943]]
By mid-1943 Aerojet was operating on a budget of $650,000. The same year Parsons and von Kármán traveled to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on the invitation of Secretary of the Navy [[Frank Knox]] to consult on a new JATO contract for the U.S. Navy. Though JATOs were being mass-produced for military applications, JATO-propelled aircraft could not "keep up" with larger, [[bomber]] planes taking off from long aircraft carrier runways—which made Aerojet's industry at risk of becoming defunct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bullock |first=William B. |year=February 1953 |title= JATO—The Magic Bottle |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UoGrm9YgAoEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=jpl#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format=PDF |journal=''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]'' |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=25, 44 |issn=0015-4806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons demonstrated the efficacy of the newer JATOs to solve this issue by equipping a [[Grumman]] plane with solid-fuel units; its assisted takeoff from the [[USS Charger (CVE-30)|USS ''Charger'']] was successful, but produced smoke containing a noxious, yellow-colored residue. The Navy guaranteed Parsons a contract on the condition that this residue was removed; this led to the invention of ''Aeroplex'', a technology for smokeless [[Contrail|vapor trails]] developed at Aerojet by Parsons.{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp = 93}}

As the U.S. became aware that Nazi Germany had developed the [[V-2 rocket]], the military—following recommendations from von Kármán based upon research using British intelligence—placed a renewed impetus on its own rocket research, reinstating Qian to the GALCIT project. They gave the Group a $3&amp;nbsp;million grant to develop rocket-based weapons, and the Group was expanded and renamed the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL).{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 96–97|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 231–233}} By this point the Navy were ordering 20,000 JATOs a month from Aerojet, and in December 1944 Haley negotiated for the company to sell 51% of its stock to the [[General Tire|General Tire and Rubber Company]] to cope with the increased demand. Aerojet's Caltech-linked employees—including Zwicky, Malina and Summerfield—would only agree to the sale on the condition that Parsons and Forman were removed from the company, viewing their occult activities as disreputable. JPL historian [[Erik M. Conway]] also attributes Parsons' expulsion to more practical concerns: he "still wanted to work in the same way as he'd done in his backyard, instinctive and without regard for safety".&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; Parsons and Forman were unfazed, informing Haley of their prediction that the rocket industry would become obsolete in the postwar age and seeing more financial incentive in starting a chain of laundromats. Haley persuaded them to sell their stock, resulting in Parsons leaving the company with $11,000.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 100|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 239–240}} With this money he bought the lease to 1003, which had come to be known as "the Parsonage" after him.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 241}}

===L. Ron Hubbard and the Babalon Working: 1945–46===
{{see also|L. Ron Hubbard#Occult involvement in Pasadena}}
[[File:L. Ron Hubbard in 1950.jpg|thumb|right|Parsons befriended [[L. Ron Hubbard]].]]
Now disassociated from JPL and Aerojet, Parsons and Forman founded the Ad Astra Engineering Company, under which Parsons founded the chemical manufacturing Vulcan Powder Company.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 101|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 242}} Ad Astra was subject to an FBI investigation under suspicion of espionage when security agents from the [[Manhattan Project]] discovered that Parsons and Forman had procured a chemical used in a top secret project for a material known only as [[Natural uranium|''x-metal'']], but they were later acquitted of any wrongdoing.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 325}} Parsons continued to financially support Smith and Helen, although he asked for a divorce from her and ignored Crowley's commands by welcoming Smith back to the Parsonage when his retreat was finished.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 248–249}} Parsons continued to hold O.T.O. activities at the Parsonage but began renting rooms at the house to non-Thelemites, including journalist [[Nieson Himmel]], Manhattan Project physicist [[Robert Cornog]], and science fiction artist [[Louis Goldstone]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 243–246}} Parsons attracted controversy in Pasadena for his preferred clientele. Parsonage resident Alva Rogers recalled in a 1962 article for an occultist [[fanzine]]: "In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, artists, musicians, atheists, anarchists, or any other exotic types need to apply for rooms—any mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 86}}

Science fiction writer and U.S. Navy officer [[L. Ron Hubbard]] soon moved into the Parsonage; he and Parsons became close friends. Parsons wrote to Crowley that although Hubbard had "no formal training in Magick he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduce he is direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his [[Guardian Angel]].&amp;nbsp;... He is the most Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles."{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 101–102|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 252–255}}

Parsons and Sara were in an [[open relationship]] encouraged by the O.T.O.'s polyandrous sexual ethics, and she became enamored with Hubbard; Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 102|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 256|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3pp = 537–538}} Motivated to find a new partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that "our own Jack is enamored with [[Witchcraft]], the [[Hounfour|houmfort]], voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result." He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 257–262}} Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including [[poltergeist]] activity, sightings of [[Orb (optics)#Paranormal interpretation|orbs]] and ghostly apparitions, [[Alchemy|alchemical]] ([[sylph]]ic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. Pendle suggested that Parsons was particularly susceptible to these interpretations and attributed the voices to a prank by Hubbard and Sara.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 257–262}} One ritual allegedly brought screaming [[banshee]]s to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 303}} In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on [[Enochian magic]] during which he [[masturbation|masturbated]] onto magical tablets, accompanied by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Prokofiev)|Second Violin Concerto]]. Describing this magical operation as the [[Babalon Working]], he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess [[Babalon]] onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his "scribe", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 107–108, 116–117, 119–128|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 259–260}} As described by [[Richard Metzger]], "Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement" while Hubbard "scanned the astral plane for signs and visions."{{sfn|Metzger|2008|pp = 196–200}}

Their final ritual took place in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons abruptly decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that [[Marjorie Cameron]]—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy [[WAVES|WAVE]]—had come to visit. Believing her to be the "[[elemental]]" woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing [[sex magic]] rituals with Cameron, who acted as his "[[Babalon#Office of the Scarlet Woman|Scarlet Woman]]", while Hubbard continued to participate as the [[amanuensis]]. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: "I didn't know anything about the O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was watching to see what was going on."&lt;ref name="Hobbs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobbs|first=Scott|title=Rocket Man|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-hobbs/rocket-man_2_b_1597713.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=March 30, 2014|date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 135}}

Inspired by Crowley's novel ''[[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]]'' (1917), Parsons and Hubbard aimed to magically fertilize a  "magical child" through [[immaculate conception]], which when born to a woman somewhere on Earth nine months following the working's completion would become the Thelemic messiah embodying Babalon.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 130–132|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 263–264|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 29, 35–37}}{{sfn|Urban|2006|p = 136–137}} To quote Metzger, the purpose of the Babalon Working was "a daring attempt to shatter the boundaries of space and time" facilitating, according to Parsons, the emergence of Thelema's [[Aeon (Thelema)|Æon of Horus]].{{sfn|Metzger|2008|pp = 196–200}} When Cameron departed for a trip to New York, Parsons retreated to the desert, where he believed that a [[preternatural]] entity [[Automatic writing|psychographically]] provided him with ''Liber 49'', which represented a fourth part of Crowley's ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the primary sacred text of Thelema, as well as part of a new sacred text he called the ''Book of Babalon''.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 132–148, 150|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 264–265|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3p = 538|4a1 = Miller|4y = 2014|4pp = 121–125}} Crowley was bewildered and concerned by the endeavor, complaining to Germer of being "fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts!" Believing the Babalon Working was accomplished, Parsons sold the Parsonage to developers for $25,000 under the condition that he and Cameron could continue to live in the coach house, and he appointed Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now have to meet elsewhere for its rituals.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 150|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 266–267}}

Parsons co-founded a company called Allied Enterprises with Hubbard and Sara, into which Parsons invested his life savings of $20,970. Hubbard suggested that with this money they travel to [[Miami]] to purchase three yachts, which they would then sail through the [[Panama Canal]] to the West Coast, where they could sell them on for a profit. Parsons agreed, but many of his friends thought it was a bad idea. Hubbard had secretly requested permission from the U.S. Navy to sail to China and South and Central America on a mission to "collect writing material"; his real plans were for a world cruise. Left "flat broke" by this defrauding, Parsons was incensed when he discovered that Hubbard and Sara had left for Miami with $10,000 of the money; he suspected a scam but was placated by a telephone call from Hubbard and agreed to remain business partners. When Crowley, in a telegram to Germer, dismissed Parsons as a "weak fool" and victim to Hubbard and Sara's obvious confidence trick, Parsons changed his mind, flew to Miami and placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Upon tracking them down to a harbor in [[MacArthur Causeway|County Causeway]], Parsons discovered that the couple had purchased three yachts as planned; they tried to flee aboard one but hit a squall and were forced to return to port. Parsons was convinced that he had brought them to shore through a [[lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram]] containing an astrological, [[Geomantic figures|geomantic]] invocation of [[Geomantic figures#The geomantic figures|Bartzabel]]{{mdash}}a vengeful spirit of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. Allied Enterprises was dissolved and in a court settlement Hubbard was required to promise to reimburse Parsons. Parsons was discouraged from taking further action by Sara, who threatened to report him for [[statutory rape]] since their sexual relationship took place when she was under California's [[age of consent]] of 18. Parsons was ultimately compensated with only $2,900. Hubbard, already married to [[Margaret Grubb]], [[Bigamy|bigamously]] married Sara and went on to found [[Dianetics]] and [[Scientology]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 155–157|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 267–269, 272–273|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3pp = 538–539|4a1 = Miller|4y = 2014|4pp = 127–130}}

''[[The Sunday Times]]'' published an article about Hubbard's involvement with the O.T.O. and Parsons' occult activities in December 1969. In response, the [[Church of Scientology]] released an unsubstantiated press statement which said that Hubbard had been sent as an undercover agent by the U.S. Navy to intercept and destroy Parsons' "black magic cult", and save Sara from its influence. The Church also stated that Robert A. Heinlein was the clandestine Navy operative who "sent in" Hubbard to undertake this operation.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 273–274}} Returning to California, Parsons completed the sale of the Parsonage, which was then demolished, and resigned from the O.T.O. He wrote in his letter to Crowley that he did not believe that "as an autocratic organization, [the O.T.O.] constitutes a true and proper medium for the expression and attainment" of Thelema.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 158|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 270|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3p = 555}}

===Work for Israelis and espionage accusations: 1946–52===
[[File:Navaho launch.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Parsons worked on developing the [[SM-64 Navaho]] missile (pictured launching in 1957).]]

Parsons was employed by [[North American Aviation]] at [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], where he worked on the [[SM-64 Navaho|Navaho Missile Program]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 158–159|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 275}} He and Cameron moved into a house in [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], where he instructed her in occultism and esotericism.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 275}} When Cameron developed [[catalepsy]], Parsons referred her to [[Sylvan Muldoon]]'s books on [[astral projection]], suggesting that she could manipulate her seizures to accomplish it.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=48–49}} They were married on October 19, 1946, four days after his divorce from Helen was finalized, with Forman as their witness.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 158|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 277|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3p = 39}} Parsons continued to be seen as a specialist in rocketry; he acted as an expert consultant in numerous industrial tribunals and police and [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Army Ordnance]] investigations regarding explosions. In May 1947, Parsons gave a talk at the [[Pacific Rocket Society]] in which he predicted that rockets would take humans to the Moon.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 159|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 277–278}} Although he had become distant from the now largely defunct O.T.O. and had sold much of his Crowleyan library, he continued to correspond with Crowley until the latter's death in December 1947.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 277, 279}}

At the emergence of the [[Cold War]], a [[Red Scare]] developed in the U.S. as the Congressional [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] began investigating and obstructing the careers of people with perceived communist sympathies. Many of Parsons' former colleagues lost their security clearances and jobs as a result, and eventually the FBI stripped Parsons of his clearance because of his "subversive" character, including his involvement in and advocacy of "sexual perversion" in the O.T.O. He speculated in a June 1949 letter to Germer that his clearance was revoked in response to his public dissemination of Crowley's ''[[Liber OZ]]'', a 1941 tract summarizing the individualist moral principles of Thelema. Declassified FBI documents later revealed that the FBI's primary concern was Parsons' former connections to Marxists at Caltech and his membership of the also "subversive" ACLU. When they interviewed Parsons he denied communist sympathies but informed them of Sidney Weinbaum's "extreme communist views" and [[Frank Malina]]'s involvement in Weinbaum's communist cell at Caltech, which resulted in Weinbaum's arrest for perjury since he had lied under oath by denying any involvement in communist groups. Malina's security clearance was withdrawn as well. In reaction to this hostile treatment, Parsons sought work in the rocket industry abroad. He sought advice to do so in correspondence with von Kármán; whose advice he followed by enrolling in an evening course in advanced mathematics at USC to bolster his employability in the field—but again he neglected attendance and failed the course.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 159|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 281–284|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 46–47}} Parsons again resorted to bootlegging nitroglycerin for money, and managed to earn a wage as a car mechanic, a manual laborer at a gas station, and a hospital orderly; for two years he was also a faculty member at the USC Department of Pharmacology.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 161, 166|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 284}} Relations between Parsons and Cameron became strained; they agreed to a temporary separation and she moved to Mexico to join an artists' commune in [[San Miguel de Allende]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1p = 283|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 48, 51–52}}

Unable to pursue his scientific career, without his wife and devoid of friendship, Parsons decided to return to occultism and embarked on sexually based magical operations with prostitutes. He was intent, informally following the ritualistic practice of Thelemite organization the [[A∴A∴]], on performing "the Crossing of the [[Abyss (Thelema)|Abyss]]",  attaining union with the [[Universal mind|universal consciousness]], or "All" as understood in [[Thelemic mysticism]], and becoming the "[[A∴A∴#The Order of the S∴S∴|Master of the Temple]]".{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 160–169|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 284–285}} Following his apparent success in doing so, Parsons recounted having an [[out-of-body experience]] invoked by Babalon, who astrally transported him to the biblical [[Chorazin|City of Chorazin]], an experience he referred to as a "Black Pilgrimage". Accompanying Parsons' "Oath of the Abyss" was his own "Oath of the AntiChrist", which was witnessed by Wilfred Talbot Smith. In this oath, Parsons professed to embody an entity named ''Belarion Armillus Al Dajjal'', the [[Antichrist]] "who am come to fulfill the law of the Beast 666 [Aleister Crowley]".{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 160–169|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 284–285}} Viewing these oaths as the completion of the Babalon Working, Parsons wrote an [[Illeism|illeist]] autobiography titled ''Analysis by a Master of the Temple'' and an occult text titled ''The Book of AntiChrist''. In the latter work, Parsons (writing as ''Belarion'') prophesied that within nine years Babalon would manifest on Earth and supersede the dominance of the [[Abrahamic religions]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 160–169, 189|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 284–285}}

During this period, Parsons also wrote an essay on his individualist philosophy and politics—which he described as standing for "[[liberalism]] and liberal principles"—titled "Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword", in which he condemned the authoritarianism, censorship, corruption, [[antisexualism]] and racism he saw as prevalent in American society.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 160–169|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 284–285}} None of these works were published in his lifetime. Through Heinlein, Parsons received a visit from writer [[L. Sprague de Camp]], with whom he discussed magic and science fiction, and disclosed that Hubbard had sent a letter offering him Sara back. De Camp later referred to Parsons as "An authentic mad genius if I ever met one", and based the character Courtney James on him in his time travel story ''[[A Gun for Dinosaur]]'' (1956). Parsons was also visited by Jane Wolfe, who unsuccessfully appealed for him to rejoin the dilapidated O.T.O. He entered a brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan; they moved to a house on [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], a building known by them as the "Concrete Castle".{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 171|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 288|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 51–53}}{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 277, 279}} Cameron returned to Redondo Beach from San Miguel de Allende and violently argued with Parsons upon discovering his infidelity, before she again left for Mexico. Parsons responded by initiating divorce proceedings against her on the grounds of "extreme cruelty".{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 288}}

[[File:Jack Parsons FBI.jpg|thumb|upright|left|November 1950 [[FBI]] synopsis of espionage allegations against Parsons]]
Parsons testified to a closed federal court that the moral philosophy of Thelema was both anti-fascist and anti-communist, emphasizing his belief in individualism. This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the [[Industrial Employment Review Board]], which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies. This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 161|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 286–287}} Von Kármán put Parsons in touch with [[Herbert T. Rosenfeld]], President of the Southern Californian chapter of the [[American Technion Society]]{{mdash}}a [[Zionism|Zionist]] group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons a job with the Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical reports for them.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 169–170|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 286–287}} In November 1950, as the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld's offer, but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of technical documents reported him to the FBI. She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of the reports that he had sought to submit to the Technion Society.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 170–172|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 291–293, 296|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 54–55}}
 
Parsons was immediately fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; he insisted that his intentions were peaceful and that he had suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 170–172|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 291–293, 296|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 54–55}}&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Brian |title=The Hell Portal Where NASA's Rocket King Divined Cosmic Rockets With L.

The Review Board still considered Parsons a liability because of his historical Marxist affiliations and investigations by the FBI, and in January 1952 they permanently reinstated their ban on his working for classified projects, effectively prohibiting him from working in rocketry.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 172|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 296|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 63–64}} To make a living he founded the Parsons Chemical Manufacturing Company, which was based in North Hollywood and created pyrotechnics and explosives such as fog effects and imitation gunshot wounds for the film industry, and he also returned to chemical manufacturing at the Bermite Powder Company in Saugus.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 177|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 294, 297|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3p = 57}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doherty|first=Brian|title=The Magical Father of American Rocketry|url=http://reason.com/archives/2005/05/01/the-magical-father-of-american|website=reason.com|publisher=[[Reason Foundation]]|accessdate=April 20, 2014|year=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons reconciled with Cameron, and they resumed their relationship and moved into a former coach house on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons converted its large, first-floor laundry room into a home laboratory to work on his chemical and pyrotechnic projects, homebrew [[absinthe]] and stockpile his materials.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 169|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 293|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3p = 57}} They let out the upstairs bedrooms and began holding parties that were attended largely by bohemians and members of the [[Beat Generation]], along with old friends including Forman, Malina and Cornog. They also congregated at the home of Andrew Haley, who lived on the same street. Though Parsons in his mid-thirties was a "prewar relic" to the younger attendees, the raucous socials often lasted until dawn and frequently attracted police attention.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1pp = 294–295|2a1 = Kansa|2y = 2011|2pp = 57–63}} Parsons also founded a new Thelemite group known as "the Witchcraft", whose beliefs revolved around a simplified version of Crowley's Thelema and Parsons' own Babalon prophecies. He offered a course in its teachings for a ten dollar fee, which included a new Thelemic belief system called "the Gnosis", a version of [[Christian Gnosticism]] with [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] as its godhead and the Christian God as its [[demiurge]]. He also collaborated with Cameron on ''Songs for the Witch Woman'', a collection of poems which she illustrated that was published in 2014.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 99|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 295}}&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Steffie|title=Cameron, Witch of the Art World|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/cameron-witch-art-world#|website=lareviewofbooks.org|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=November 14, 2014|date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death: 1952===
Parsons and Cameron decided to travel to Mexico for a few months, both for a vacation and for Parsons to take up a job opportunity establishing an explosives factory for the Mexican government. They hoped that this would facilitate a move to Israel, where they could start a family, and where Parsons could bypass the U.S. government to recommence his rocketry career. He was particularly disturbed by the presence of the FBI, convinced that they were spying on him.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 179|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 296–297|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3p = 64}}

On June 17, 1952, a day before their planned departure, Parsons received a rush order of explosives for a film set and began to work on it in his home laboratory.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1p = 299|2a1 = Kansa|2y = 2011|2p = 65}} An explosion destroyed the lower part of the building, during which Parsons sustained mortal wounds. His right forearm was amputated, his legs and left arm were broken and a hole was torn in the right side of his face.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 177–178|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 1–6|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 65–66}} Despite these critical injuries, Parsons was found conscious by the upstairs lodgers. He tried to communicate with the arriving ambulance workers, who rushed him to the [[Huntington Hospital|Huntington Memorial Hospital]], where he was declared dead approximately thirty-seven minutes after the explosion.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 177–178|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 1–6|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 65–66}} When his mother, Ruth, was informed of the events, she immediately took a fatal overdose of  [[barbiturate]]s. Cameron learned of her husband's death from reporters at the scene when she returned home from grocery shopping.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 178–179|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 6–7|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3p = 66}}&lt;ref name="Harnisch"/&gt;

Pasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding led the official investigation; he concluded that Parsons had been mixing [[Mercury(II) fulminate|fulminate of mercury]] in a coffee can when he dropped it on the floor, causing the initial explosion, which worsened when it came into contact with other chemicals in the room.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 179–181|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 8}} Forman considered this likely, stating that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 301}} Some of Parsons' colleagues rejected this explanation, saying that he was very attentive about safety. Two colleagues from the Bermite Powder Company described Parsons' work habits as "scrupulously neat" and "exceptionally cautious". The latter statement—from chemical engineer George Santymers—insisted that the explosion must have come from beneath the floorboards, implying an organized plot to kill Parsons. Harding accepted that these inconsistencies were "incongruous" but described the manner in which Parsons had stored his chemicals as "criminally negligent", and noted that Parsons had previously been investigated by the police for illegally storing chemicals at the Parsonage. He also found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, suggesting that Parsons was narcotized. The police saw insufficient evidence to continue the investigation and closed the case as an accidental death.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 181|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 11–12}}

Both Wolfe and Smith suggested that Parsons' death had been suicide, stating that he had suffered from depression for some time. Others theorized that the explosion was an assassination planned by [[Howard Hughes]] in response to Parsons' suspected theft of Hughes Aircraft Company documents.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 327|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 13, 301}} Cameron became convinced that Parsons had been murdered {{mdash}} either by police officers seeking vengeance for his role in the conviction of Earl Kynette or by [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionists]] opposed to his work for Israel.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 185|2a1 = Kansa|2y = 2011|2pp = 77–79}} One of Cameron's friends, the artist [[Renate Druks]], later stated her belief that Parsons had died in a rite designed to create a [[homunculus]].{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 184}} His death has never been definitively explained.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = xxv}}

The immediate aftermath of the explosion attracted the interest of the U.S. media, making headline news in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. These initial reports focused on Parsons' prominence in rocketry but neglected to mention his occult interests. When asked for comment, Aerojet secretary-treasurer T.E. Beehan said that Parsons "liked to wander, but he was one of the top men in the field".{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 182, 185–187|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 7–10}} Within a few days, journalists had discovered his involvement in Thelema and emphasized this in their reports.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 182, 185–187|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 7–10}}

A private prayer service was held for Parsons at the funeral home where his body was cremated. Cameron scattered his ashes in the Mojave Desert, before burning most of his possessions.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 300–303}} She later tried to perform astral projection to commune with him.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp = 74–79}} The O.T.O. also held a memorial service—with attendees including Helen and Sara—at which Smith led the Gnostic Mass.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 327|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 300}}

==Personal life==
===Personality===
Parsons was considered effeminate as a child; in adult life he exhibited an attitude of [[machismo]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 176}} His FBI file described him as "potentially bisexual" and he once expressed experiencing a [[latent homosexuality]].{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 56}} The actor [[Paul Mathison]] said he had had a gay relationship with Parsons in the 1950s, though this was disputed by others who knew him and Cameron.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 319}} Parsons had the reputation of being a womanizer, and was notorious for frequently flirting and having sexual liaisons with female staff members at JPL and Aerojet.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 88}}{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 238}} He was also known for personal eccentricity such as greeting house guests with a large pet snake around his neck, driving to work in a rundown [[Pontiac#Pontiac 1926–1942|Pontiac]], and using a mannequin dressed in a tuxedo with a bucket labelled "The Resident" as his mailbox.&lt;ref name="Pendle"/&gt;{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 83}}

As well as a fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons was also a keen [[Shooting|shooter]]; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol.&lt;ref name="Pendle"/&gt;{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 176}}{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 87}} Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating explosives such as [[firecrackers]] and [[smoke bombs]],{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 226}} and was known to spend hours at a time in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 242}}

As well as intense bursts of creativity, Parsons suffered from what he described as "manic hysteria and depressing melancholy."{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 296}} His father Marvel, after suffering a near-fatal heart attack, died as a psychiatric patient at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in Washington D.C. diagnosed with severe [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]], a condition Pendle suggested the younger Parsons inherited.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 103–105}}

===Professional associations===
Parsons' obituary listed him as a member of the [[National Defense Industrial Association|Army Ordnance Association]], the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the [[American Chemical Society]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and{{emdash}}despite his lack of an academic degree{{emdash}}the [[Sigma Xi]] fraternity. It also stated that he had turned down several [[honorary degree]]s.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 159}}

==Philosophy==
===Religious beliefs===
{{quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=lightblue|align=right|quote=[Parsons] treated magic and rocketry as different sides of the same coin: both had been disparaged, both derided as impossible, but because of this both presented themselves as challenges to be conquered. Rocketry postulated that we should no longer see ourselves as creatures chained to the earth but as beings capable of exploring the universe.

Similarly, magic suggested there were unseen metaphysical worlds that existed and could be explored with the right knowledge. Both rocketry and magic were rebellions against the very limits of human existence; in striving for one challenge he could not help but strive for the other.|source= —George Pendle{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=18}}}}

Parsons adhered to the occult philosophy of Thelema, which had been founded in 1904 by the English occultist Aleister Crowley following a spiritual revelation that he had in [[Cairo]], Egypt, when—according to Crowley's accounts—a spirit being known as [[Aiwass]] dictated to him a prophetic text known as ''The Book of the Law''.{{sfn|Beta|2008|pp = x–xi}} Prior to becoming aware of Thelema and Crowley, Parsons' interest in esotericism was developed through his reading of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890), a work in [[comparative mythology]] by Scottish [[Social anthropology|social anthropologist]] [[James George Frazer]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 171}} Parsons had also attended lectures on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] by philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] with his first wife Helen, but disliked the belief system's sentiment of "the good and the true".{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 146–147}} During rocket tests, Parsons often recited Crowley's poem "Hymn to Pan" as a [[good luck charm]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 238}} He took to addressing Crowley as his "Most Beloved Father" and signed off to him as "thy son, John".{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp = 106–107}}

In July 1945, Parsons gave a speech to the Agape Lodge, in which he attempted to explain how he felt that ''The Book of the Law'' could be made relevant to "modern life". In this speech, which was subsequently published under the title of "Doing Your Will", he examined the Thelemite concept of [[True Will]], writing that:

{{quote|The mainspring of an individual is his creative Will. This Will is the sum of his tendencies, his destiny, his inner truth. It is one with the force that makes the birds sing and flowers bloom; as inevitable as gravity, as implicit as a bowel movement, it informs alike atoms and men and suns.

To the man who knows this Will, there is no why or why not, no can or cannot; he ''is''!

There is no known force that can turn an apple into an alley cat; there is no known force that can turn a man from his Will. This is the triumph of genius; that, surviving the centuries, enlightens the world.

This force burns in every man.{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p = 67}}}}

Parsons identified four obstacles that prevented humans from achieving and performing their True Will, all of which he connected with fear: the fear of incompetence, the fear of the opinion of others, the fear of hurting others, and the fear of insecurity. He insisted that these must be overcome, writing that "The Will must be freed of its fetters. The ruthless examination and destruction of taboos, complexes, frustrations, dislikes, fears and disgusts hostile to the Will is essential to progress."{{sfn|Parsons|2008|pp = 69–71}}

Though Parsons was a lifelong devotee to Thelema, he grew weary of and eventually left the Ordo Templi Orientis—the religious organization that began propagating Thelema under Crowley's leadership from the 1910s—which Parsons viewed, despite the disagreement of Crowley himself, as excessively hierarchical and impeding upon the rigorous spiritual and philosophical practice of True Will, describing the O.T.O. as "an excellent training school for adepts, but hardly an appropriate Order for the manifestation of Thelema". In this sense Parsons was described by Carter as an "almost fundamentalist" Thelemite who placed ''The Book of the Law''{{'}}s [[dogma]] above all other doctrine.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 160–169, 189|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 284–285}}{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 158–163}}

===Politics===
{{quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=lightblue|align=right|quote=[Parsons] had witnessed the blinding overnight successes achieved by the government-by-terror [[totalitarianism]] of [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] Russia and [[Nazi Germany]]. He had the foresight to see that [the United States of] America, once armed with the new powers of total destruction and surveillance that were sure to follow the swelling flood of new technologies, had the potential to become even more repressive unless its founding principles of individual liberty were religiously preserved and its leaders held accountable to them.
&lt;br&gt;
Two of the keys to redressing the balance were the freedom of women and an end to the state control of individual sexual expression. He knew that these potent forces, embodied as they are in a majority of the world's population, had the power, once unleashed, to change the world.|source= —[[William Breeze]] (Hymenaeus Beta), current Frater Superior of Ordo Templi Orientis{{sfn|Beta|2008|p=xi}} }}

From early on in his career, Parsons took an interest in socialism and communism,{{sfn|Beta|2008|p = ix}} views that he shared with his friend [[Frank Malina]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 90–93}} Under the influence of another friend, Sidney Weinbaum, the two joined a communist group in the late 1930s, with Parsons reading [[Marxism|Marxist]] literature, but he remained unconvinced and refused to join the American Communist Party.{{sfnm|1a1 = Pendle|1y = 2005|1pp = 120–123}} Malina asserted that this was because Parsons was a "political romantic", whose attitude was more anti-authoritarian than anti-capitalist.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 122}} Parsons later became critical of the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] government of the [[Soviet Union]] led by [[Joseph Stalin]], sarcastically commenting that

{{quote|The [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] is merely temporary—the state will eventually wither away like a snark hunter, leaving us all free as birds. Meanwhile it may be necessary to kill, torture and imprison a few million people, but whose fault is it if they get in the way of progress?{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p = 11}}}}

During the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the Second Red Scare in the early 1950s, Parsons was questioned regarding his former links to the communist movement, by which time he denied any connection to it, instead describing himself as "an individualist" who was both anti-communist and anti-fascist.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 293}} In reaction to the McCarthyite [[red-baiting]] of scientists, he expressed disdain that

{{quote|Science, that was going to save the world in [[H. G. Wells]]' time is regimented, straight-jacked, [and] scared shitless, its universal language diminished to one word, security.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=290}}}}

Parsons was politically influenced by Thelema{{emdash}}which holds to the ethical code of "[[Do what thou wilt]]"{{emdash}}equating this principle to the libertarian views of some of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] in his article "Freedom is a Lonely Star", writing that by his own time these values had been "sold out by America, and for that reason the heart of America is sick and the soul of America is dead."{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p = 4}} He proceeded to criticize many aspects of contemporary U.S. society, particularly the police force, remarking that "The police mind is usually of a sadistic and homicidal trend" and noting that they carried out the "ruthless punishment of symbolic scapegoats" such as African-Americans, prostitutes, alcoholics, homeless people and sociopolitical radicals, under the pretense of a country that upheld "liberty and justice for all."{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p = 9}}

To bring about a freer future Parsons believed in [[Sexual revolution|liberalizing attitudes to sexual morality]] stating that, in his belief, the publication of the [[Kinsey report]] and development of the [[Psychonautics|psychonautical]] sciences had as significant an influence on Western society as the creation of the [[atomic bomb]] and the development of [[nuclear physics]]. He also believed that in the future the restrictions on sexual morality within society should be abolished in order to bring about greater freedom and individuality. Parsons concluded that

{{quote|the liberty of the individual is the foundation of civilization. No true civilization is possible without this liberty and no state, national or international, is stable in its absence. The proper relation between individual liberty on the one hand and social responsibility on the other is the balance which will assure a stable society. The only other road to social equilibrium demands the total annihilation of individuality. There is not further evasion of nature's immemorial ultimatum: change or perish but the choice of change is ours.{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p = 13}}}}

[[Jack Cashill]], American studies professor at [[Purdue University]], argues that "Although his literary career never got much beyond pamphleteering and an untitled anti-war, anti-capitalist manuscript", Parsons played a significant role—greater than that of [[Church of Satan]] founder [[Anton LaVey]]—in shaping the Californian counterculture of the 1960s and beyond through his influence on contemporaries such as Hubbard and Heinlein.{{sfn|Cashill|2007|pp = 43–46}} [[Hugh Urban]], religious studies professor at [[Ohio State University]], cites Parsons' Witchcraft group as precipitating the [[Modern paganism|neopagan]] revival of the 1950s.{{sfn|Urban|2006|p = 136–137}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugh Urban|url=https://comparativestudies.osu.edu/people/urban.41|website=comparativestudies.osu.edu|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science fiction writer and occultist [[Robert Anton Wilson]] described Parsons' political writings as exemplifying an "ultra-individualist" who exhibited a "genuine sympathy for working people", strongly empathized with [[feminism]] and held an antipathy toward [[patriarchy]] comparable to that of [[John Stuart Mill]], arguing in this context that Parsons was an influence on the [[Libertarianism in the United States|American libertarian]] and [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] movements of the 20th century.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|pp = vii–x}} Parsons was also supportive of the creation of the State of Israel, making plans to emigrate there when his military security clearance was revoked.{{sfn|Beta|2008|p = ix}}

In the decades following his death, Parsons was well remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently amounted to a footnote.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 304}} For instance, English Thelemite [[Kenneth Grant]] suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked the start of the appearance of [[flying saucers]] in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the [[Roswell UFO incident]] and [[Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting]].{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 188}} Cameron postulated that the [[1952 Washington, D.C.

The same month JPL held an open access event to mark the 32nd anniversary of its foundation—which featured a "nativity scene" of mannequins reconstructing the November 1936 photograph of the GALCIT Group—and erected a monument commemorating their first rocket test on Halloween 1936.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 15}} Among the aerospace industry, JPL was nicknamed as standing for "Jack Parsons' Laboratory" or "Jack Parsons Lives".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = xxv}} The [[International Astronomical Union]] decided to name a crater on the [[far side (Moon)|far side]] of the Moon [[Parsons (crater)|Parsons]] after him in 1972.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 192|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 307}} JPL later credited him for making "distinctive technical innovations that advanced early efforts" in rocket engineering, with aerospace journalist Craig Covault stating that the work of Parsons, Qian Xuesen and the GALCIT Group "planted the seeds for JPL to become preeminent in space and rocketry."&lt;ref name="JPL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Covault|first1=Craig|title=Father of the Chinese space program dies|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0911/02china/|accessdate=June 24, 2015|work=spaceflightnow.com|publisher=Spaceflight Now Inc.|date=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Parsons' writings were posthumously published as ''Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword'' in 1989, a compilation co-edited by Cameron and O.T.O. leader Hymenaeus Beta (ceremonial name of musician [[William Breeze]]), which incited a resurgence of interest in Parsons within occult and countercultural circles.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 193}} For example, comic book artist and occultist [[Alan Moore]] noted Parsons as a creative influence in a 1998 interview with [[Clifford Meth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meth|first1=Clifford|title=ALAN MOORE talks to Cliff - pt 2|url=http://www.cliffordmeth.com/alanmooretalkstocliff-pt2.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301092443/http://www.cliffordmeth.com/alanmooretalkstocliff-pt2.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-03-01|website=cliffordmeth.com|accessdate=June 24, 2015|date=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cameron-Parsons Foundation was founded as an incorporated company in 2006, with the intention of conserving and promoting Parsons' writings and Cameron's artwork,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cameron-parsons.org/ |title=The Cameron-Parsons Foundation, Inc. |publisher=The Cameron-Parsons Foundation, Inc |accessdate=January 10, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MX6uQbXQ?url=http://cameron-parsons.org/ |archivedate=January 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 Fulger Esoterica published ''Songs for the Witch Woman''—a limited edition book of poems by Parsons with illustrations by Cameron, released to coincide with his centenary. An exhibition of the same name was held at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;

In 1999 [[Feral House]] published the biography ''Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons'' by John Carter, who expressed the opinion that Parsons had accomplished more in under five years of research than Robert H. Goddard had in his lifetime, and said that his role in the development of rocket technology had been neglected by historians of science;{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 195}} Carter thought that Parsons' abilities and accomplishments as an occultist had been overestimated and exaggerated among Western esotericists, emphasizing his disowning by Crowley for practicing magic beyond his grade.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 196}} Feral House republished the work as a new edition in 2004, accompanied with an introduction by Robert Anton Wilson. Wilson believed that Parsons was "the one single individual who contributed the most to rocket science",{{sfn|Wilson|2004|p = xi}} describing him as being "very strange, very brilliant, very funny, [and] very tormented",{{sfn|Wilson|2004|p = vii}} and considering it noteworthy that the day of Parsons' birth was the predicted beginning of the apocalypse advocated by [[Charles Taze Russell]], the founder of the [[Bible Student movement]].{{sfn|Wilson|2004|p = ix}}

A second biography of Parsons was published in 2005 through [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] with the title ''Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons''; it was written by George Pendle, who described Parsons as "the [[Che Guevara]] of occultism" and said that although Parsons "would not live to see his dream of space travel come true, he was essential to making it a reality."{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 201, 304}}{{sfn|Metzger|2008|pp = 196–200}} Pendle considered that the cultural stigma attached to Parsons' occultism was the primary cause of his low public profile, noting that "Like many scientific mavericks, Parsons was eventually discarded by the establishment once he had served his purpose." It was this unorthodox mindset,  creatively facilitated by his science fiction fandom and "willingness to believe in magic's efficacy",  Pendle argued, "that allowed him to break scientific barriers previously thought to be indestructible"—commenting that Parsons "saw both space and magic as ways of exploring these new frontiers—one breaking free from Earth literally and metaphysically."{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 1-20}}&lt;ref name=Solon&gt;{{cite web|last=Solon|first=Olivia|title=Occultist Father of Rocketry 'Written Out' of NASA's history|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-04/23/jpl-jack-parsons/viewall|website=wired.co.uk|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=May 8, 2014|date=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. Ron Hubbard's role in Parsons' Agape Lodge and the ensuing yacht scam were explored in Russell Miller's 1987 Hubbard biography ''[[Bare-faced Messiah]]''. Parsons' involvement in the Agape Lodge were also discussed by Martin P. Starr in his history of the American Thelemite movement, ''The Unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites'', published by Teitan Press in 2003.{{sfn|Starr|2003}} ''[[The QI Book of the Dead]]'' (2004), based on [[QI|the BBC game show]], included a Parsons obituary. Parsons' occult partnership with Hubbard was also mentioned in [[Alex Gibney]]'s 2015 documentary film ''[[Going Clear (film)|Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief]]'', produced by [[HBO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Sean T.|title=Suppressive Persons: 'Going Clear,' Scientology, and the Appeal of Absolutism|url=http://observer.com/2015/03/suppressive-persons-going-clear-scientology-and-the-appeal-of-absolutism/|website=observer.com|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|accessdate=June 19, 2015|date=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death, Parsons appeared in science fiction writer Anthony Boucher's murder-mystery novel ''Rocket to the Morgue'' (1942) under the guise of [[mad scientist]] character Hugo Chantrelle.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 73|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 230}} Another fictional character based on Parsons was Courtney James, a wealthy socialite who features in L. Sprague de Camp's 1956 short time travel story ''A Gun for Dinosaur''.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 305}}  In 2005 ''Pasadena Babalon'', a stage play about Parsons written by George D. Morgan and directed by [[Brian Brophy]], premiered at Caltech as a production by its theater Arts Group in 2010, the same year Cellar Door Publishing released Richard Carbonneau and Robin Simon Ng's [[graphic novel]], ''The Marvel: A Biography of Jack Parsons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caltech Theater Arts Premiers "Pasadena Babalon" This Month|url=https://www.caltech.edu/content/caltech-theater-arts-premiers-pasadena-babalon-month|website=caltech.edu|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=May 9, 2014|date=February 16, 2010}} [http://images.caltech.edu/weblab/babalon_clip.mp3 Audio clip]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnm|1a1 = Carbonneau|1a2 = Simon|1y = 2010}} In 2012 the [[Science (TV network)|Science Channel]] broadcast a documentary dramatization titled ''Magical Jet Propulsion'' in an episode of its ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]'' television series. Parsons was portrayed by English actor [[Adam Howden]]. Independent record label [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]] released ''Parsons' Blues'', an instrumental tribute single by experimental rock act [[Six Organs of Admittance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dark Matters: Twisted But True: Season 2, Episode 13: Magical Jet Propulsion, Missing Link Mystery, Typhoid Mary|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2668118/|website=imdb.com|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=January 2, 2015|date=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Organs Of Admittance – ''Parsons' Blues''|url=http://www.discogs.com/Six-Organs-Of-Admittance-Parsons-Blues/release/3762156|website=discogs.com|publisher=Zink Media, Inc.|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[AMC Networks]] announced plans for a serial television dramatization of Parsons' life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruderman|first1=Dan|title=Ridley Scott to produce miniseries on rocket scientist, occultist Jack Parsons|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/10/28/ridley-scott-to-produce-minise.html|website=boingboing.net|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]|accessdate=November 6, 2014|date=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2016 it was reported that the series "will not be going forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=AMC Orders Drama Series 'Lodge 49' Produced By Paul Giamatti|url=http://deadline.com/2016/10/lodge-49-series-order-amc-paul-giamatti-1201830841/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''|accessdate=October 30, 2016|date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the project was adopted as a web television series by [[CBS All Access]].

{{NewThought}}
'''Jewish Science''' is a [[Judaism|Judaic]] spiritual [[new religious movement|movement]] comparable with the [[New Thought Movement]].  Many of its members also attend services at conventional [[synagogue]]s.&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/7394/jewish-science-groups-explore-karma-reincarnation/|title=Jewish Science groups explore karma, reincarnation  -  j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California|first=|last=admin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an interpretation of [[Jewish philosophy]] that was originally conceived by [[Rabbi]] Alfred G. Moses in the early 1900s in response to the growing influence of [[Christian Science]] and the New Thought Movement. Rather than the paternal God figure encountered  in [[Hebrew]] tradition, "Jewish Science views God as an Energy or Force penetrating the reality of the universe. God is the source of all Reality and not separate from but part of the world and Right thinking has a healing effect".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishsf.com/content/2-0/module/displaystory_id/7792/edition_id/148/format/html/displaystory.html Jewish Science groups explore karma, reincarnation]''Jewish News Weekly''&lt;/ref&gt; His fundamental teachings are found in his 1916 book ''Jewish Science: Divine Healing in Judaism''. The movement was institutionalized in 1922&lt;!-- according to two of the references quoted below --&gt; with Rabbi [[Morris Lichtenstein]]'s founding of the Society of Jewish Science.&lt;ref name= Umansky/&gt;

==History==
Jewish Science shares several principle beliefs with [[Christian Science]] and the [[New Thought]] movement, and it is intended to function as a counterweight to the [[Christian]] elements in both of  these movements and strictly maintain its Jewish identity. It was founded by Alfred G. Moses, [[Morris Lichtenstein]] and [[Tehilla Lichtenstein]] in 1916. It emphasizes the role of [[affirmative prayer]], "[[Divinity|divine]] [[healing]]" and "Right thinking" as [[self help]] methods essential to a Jew's physical and spiritual health,&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt; but does not rule out the importance of medical intervention - unlike Christian Science. Jewish Science also incorporates [[psychology]], and concepts about [[spirituality|practical spirituality]] similar to beliefs developed in the New Thought movement. Thanks to radio broadcasts on [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] and the establishment of the ''Jewish Science Interpreter'' [[magazine]] the movement attracted numerous adherents, thereby helping its rise to prominence in the Jewish community. Today the Society's "Home Center" and synagogue is located in midtown Manhattan, NY. The Society also maintains a congregation in Los Angeles California. Also many study groups around the country which focus on each of the main texts of Jewish Science.&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt;

==Affirmative prayer==
{{New Thought beliefs}}
Lichtenstein found [[affirmative prayer]] to be particularly useful because, he believed, it provided the personal benefits of prayer without requiring the belief in a supernatural God who could suspend the laws of nature.&lt;ref name= Umansky&gt;{{cite book |title=From Christian Science to Jewish Science: Spiritual Healing and American Jews |first= Ellen M. |last=Umansky |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-504400-2 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered affirmative prayer to be a method to access inner power that could be considered divine, but not supernatural. He taught that the origins of affirmative prayer can be found in the [[Old Testament]] Book of [[Psalms]], and that affirmations, or affirmative prayers, are best offered in silence.&lt;ref name= Umansky/&gt;

Most recently, he served as Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College from 2008 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/people/j.d.barrow/|title=DAMTP Professor John Barrow|website=www.damtp.cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow is also a writer of [[popular science]] and an amateur [[playwright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/nov/05/theatre.italy | author=Marcus de Sautoy | date= Nov 5, 2003 | title=To infinity and beyond | publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Barrow attended Barham Primary School in Wembley until 1964 and [[Ealing Grammar School for Boys]] from 1964–71 and obtained his first degree in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] from [[Van Mildert College]] at the [[University of Durham]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=Durhamgradprize/&gt;  In 1977, he completed his doctorate in [[astrophysics]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], supervised by [[Dennis William Sciama]].&lt;ref name=mathgene&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=74280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
Barrow was a Junior Research Lecturer at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], from 1977–81. He did two postdoctoral years as a [[Miller Fellow|Miller Research Fellow]] in [[astronomy]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], as a Commonwealth Lindemann Fellow (1977–8) and Miller Fellow (1980–1).

In 1981 he joined the [[University of Sussex]] and rose to the rank of Professor and Director of the Astronomy Centre. In 1999, he became Professor in the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge#Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics|Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] and  a fellow in [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]] at [[Cambridge University]]. He is Director of the [[Millennium Mathematics Project]]. From 2003–2007 he was [[Gresham Professor of Astronomy]] at [[Gresham College]], London, and he has been appointed as [[Gresham Professor of Geometry]] from 2008–2011; only one person has previously held two different Gresham chairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.templeton.org/pdfs/press_releases/Barrow_Gresham_Chair.pdf Gresham College: New Gresham Chair of Geometry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121023435/http://www.templeton.org/pdfs/press_releases/Barrow_Gresham_Chair.pdf |date=21 January 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Royal Society awarded him the [[Faraday Prize]]. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (London) in 2003 and elected Fellow of the [[Academia Europaea]] in 2009. he has received Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of Hertfordshire, Sussex, Durham, S. Wales and Szczecin, and is an Honorary Professor at the University of Nanjing. He is an Honorary Fellow of Van Mildert College, Durham University and of Gresham College, London. He was a Centenary [[Gifford Lecturer]] at the University of Glasgow in 1989.

Since 1999, he has directed the [[Millennium Mathematics Project]] (MMP) at the University of Cambridge. This is an outreach and education programme to improve the appreciation, teaching and learning of mathematics and its applications. In 2006 it was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Educational Achievement by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.

In addition to having published more than 500 journal articles, Barrow has coauthored (with [[Frank J. Tipler]]) ''The [[Anthropic Principle|Anthropic Cosmological Principle]]'', a work on the history of the ideas, specifically [[intelligent design]] and [[teleology]], as well as a treatise on [[astrophysics]]. He has also published 22 books for general readers, beginning with his 1983 ''The Left Hand of Creation''. His books summarise the state of the affairs of physical questions, often in the form of compendia of a large number of facts assembled from the works of great physicists, such as [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Arthur Eddington]].

Barrow's approach to [[philosophy of science|philosophical]] issues posed by [[physical cosmology]] makes his books accessible to general readers. For example, Barrow introduced a memorable [[paradox]], which he called "the Groucho Marx Effect" (see [[Russell's paradox#Russell-like paradoxes|Russell-like paradoxes]]). Here, he quotes [[Groucho Marx]]: "I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member". Applying this to problems in cosmology, Barrow states: "A universe simple enough to be understood is too simple to produce a mind capable of understanding it."&lt;ref name=Barrow1990/&gt;  
Barrow has lectured at [[10 Downing Street]], [[Windsor Castle]], and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], as well as to the general public. In 2002, his play ''Infinities'' premiered in [[Milan]], played in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], and won the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050829220601/http://www.ubulibri.it/pagine/ipremi_ubu_2.htm Premi Ubu 2002 Italian Theatre Prize].

He was awarded the 2006 [[Templeton Prize]] for "Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities" for his "writings about the relationship between life and the universe, and the nature of human understanding [which] have created new perspectives on questions of ultimate concern to science and religion".&lt;ref name=Templeton /&gt; He is a member of a [[United Reformed Church]], which he describes as teaching "a traditional theistic picture of the universe".&lt;ref name=Overbye/&gt;

He was awarded the [[Dirac Prize]] and Gold Medal of the Institute of Physics in 2015 and the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="ras_2016" /&gt;

'''Keshavrao Marutrao Jedhe''' was a leading Freedom Fighter and Congress Leader from [[Pune]] at the time of Indian Independence and Chairman of [[Samyukta Maharashtra]] Movement in 1956. The Famous Swargate chowk in Pune is named after Keshavrao Jedhe.

==Political storm==

;Pre-Independence Era

In the 1930s Keshavrao Jedhe joined the Congress and several youths were attracted towards the party. He brought the [[Maratha]] community of Maharashtra into mainstream politics and won the first election in November 1934 for the [[Bombay Presidency]] legislative council. At this time there was a vacuum in Congress Leadership after Lokmanya Tilak's death, eventually Keshwarao Jedhe took over congress leadership in [[Pune]]. In 1938, Keshavrao became president of the state Congress and Jedhe Mansion was the centre of activity. Keshavrao Jedhe was instrumental in building the Congress Bhavan in Pune but Jedhe Mansion continued to be the inspiration for common Congressmen.

;Post- Independence Era

Things changed after Independence. In 1948, after Mahatma Gandhi's death Keshavrao was unhappy with Congress leaders, he left the party to become one of the founder members of [[Peasants and Workers Party]] (PWPI). He fought the first Lok Sabha election against his friend and Congress candidate N. V. Gadgil but lost. Disappointed with PWP leaders, Jedhe returned to the Congress fold in August 1952.

Later, [[Yashwantrao Chavan]] often said he joined the Congress only because of Keshavrao.&lt;ref name=express&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=80999 History of Keshavrao Jedhe and Jedhe Mansion], ''Indian Express''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samyukta Maharashtra Movement pioneer leader==

The [[Indian National Congress]] was pledged to linguistic states, but the States Re-organisation Committee recommended a bi-lingual state for Maharashtra-Gujarat, with Mumbai as its capital. Its inauguration on 1 November 1956, caused a great political stir and, under the leadership of Keshavrao Jedhe, an all-party meeting was held in Pune and [[Samyukta Maharashtra]] Samiti was founded on 6 February 1956. In the second general election the Samiti defeated the stalwarts of Congress by securing 101 seats out of 133, including 12 from Mumbai. The Congress could form a government only with the support of Gujarat, Marathwada and Vidarbha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciil-ebooks.net/html/langMove/samyukta.html Samyukta Maharashtra Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yashwantrao Chavan]] became the first Chief Minister of the bi-lingual Bombay State.

[[S.M. Joshi]], SA Dange, NG Gore and PK Atre fought relentlessly for [[Samyukta Maharashtra]], even at the cost of sacrificing the lives of several people and finally succeeded in convincing Congress leaders that Maharashtra should form a separate state. The resignation of CD Deshmukh, the then Finance Minister of the Nehru Cabinet, had its salutary effect, and on 1 May 1960, the state of Maharashtra, which included western Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Marathwada was born with the blessings of [[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]].

==History==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}

;Jedhe Mansion – second home of Maharashtra Congress Movement

Jedhe Mansion at 907, Shukrawar Peth, Pune, was houses of Keshwarao Jedhe, once the centre of political and social activities in Pune and Maharashtra during Pre and Post Independence Era.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;
Jedhe Mansion was built by Marutrao Babaji Jedhe in 1885, Jedhe Mansion was where Keshavrao Jedhe launched his stormy battles against social norms and the political establishment of the day from the late 1920s to the 1960s. 
Pune was then divided into ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ parts, along geographical and sociological lines. Western Pune, represented by Kesari Wada, was dominated by Brahmins and their culture, while eastern Pune was represented by Jedhe Mansion and Keshavrao’s bahujan samaj.

The Jedhe family believed in the ideology of [[Satyashodhak Samaj]], set up by [[Mahatma Phule]]. Keshavrao’s elder brothers Dadasaheb and Baburao were close associates of Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur who was then spearheading the Satyashodhak movement. [[Shahu Maharaj]] visited Jedhe Mansion whenever he was in Pune.

In the 1920s, Jedhe Mansion emerged as a political and social school for several youths from the bahujan samaj. The Jedhe brothers lived together and the story goes that a minimum of 50 people, (not members of the Jedhe family), shared a meal at any given time. An activist of the Satyashodhak movement would head straight for Jedhe Mansion as soon as he landed in Pune. 
Apart from common workers, it was also home to stalwarts like Karmaveer Vitthal Ramji Shinde, Kakasaheb Gadgil, Dinkarrao Jawalkar and Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil. Leaders like Pandit Motilal Nehru, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Jayaprakash Narayan, Senapati Bapat, Bhausaheb Hire and Shankarrao Deo also visited Jedhe Mansion. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] too came to Jedhe Mansion twice.

Till 1934, Jedhe Mansion was the centre of social activities related to the Independence movement in Maharashtra. During this period, Maharashtra witnessed several controversies like Shivaji’s memorial and installation of the statue of Mahatma Phule in Pune. Jedhe Mansion was where strategies were drawn up to fight the anti-social and Conservist activities.  Jedhe Mansion also witnessed several meetings on the [[Goa Liberation Movement]] and the [[Samyukta Maharashtra]] agitation in 1956.

The '''Maon Synagogue''' is a 6th-century [[synagogue]] and archaeological site located in the [[Negev Desert]] near Kibbutz [[Nirim]] and Kibbutz [[Nir Oz]].   It is noted for its "magnificent" [[mosaic]] floor.&lt;ref name=Schaalje&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/99mag/maon/maon.htm] "Mamshit &amp; the Ancient Synagogue of Maon, Jacqueline Schaalje, Jewish Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological finds==
[[Image:Nirim Mosaic1.jpg|thumb|250px|Mosaic detail]]
The original date of the synagogue is uncertain but is before the 6th century.  In a sixth-century renovation, the northern wall (closest to [[Jerusalem]]) was opened and a semi-circular [[apse]] to contain a [[Torah Ark]] was constructed.  The floor level was raised and marble columns and a "breathtakingly beautiful"  mosaic floor installed.&lt;ref name=IAA&gt;[http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1513&amp;module_id=#as] "One of the Most Spectacular Mosaic Floors Ever Discovered in Israel was Restored and Renovated and Can Now be Seen by the General Public," (30/3/09), Israel Antiquities Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the bottom of the mosaic floor is an  [[amphora]] flanked by a pair of peacocks.  A vine flows out of the amphora, forming loops, in each loop is a bird, animal, fruit, or a depiction of steps in the wine making process.   The design is  so similar to the mosaics in the church floor at nearby Shallal that they are thought to have been designed by the same artist.  Both floors depict animals and have similar patterns: the synagogue floor is distinguished by a menorah flanked by two lions and several other Jewish ritual objects.  The seven-branched menorah stands on three legs, like the menorah in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The legs in Maon are shaped like a lion's paws. Alongside the menorah are the symbols of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], palm trees and lions.  [[Etrog]]s,  a [[shofar]] and a [[lulav]] are depicted nearby.   The Mosaic has an inscription in Aramaic.  The upper part of the inscription blesses all members of the community, the lower part honors three donors.&lt;ref name=Schaalje/&gt;&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land, Avraham Negev, Shimon Gibson, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  An identical floor was found in the ancient synagogue in Gaza.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

The synagogue is built on the [[basilica]] plan.  The mosaic is in the central area, the two side aisles were paved with stone.  The ceiling was made of wooden beams and clay.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

A number of small objects were found by the [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] on the floor facing the [[Torah Ark]].  These include coins and bone and metal [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] that are thought to have been associated with the Torah Ark and its ornamental curtain.  There were also  fragments of glass and ceramic lamps.  Dozens of amulets were also found, some of them were used by women who were asking for good health.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

Adjacent to the ruins of the synagogue a cistern, water channels and a [[mikvah]].&lt;ref name=Schaalje/&gt;

==History==
The synagogue was built at the site of Hellenistic [[Menois]], a city marked on the [[Map of Madaba]]. It is one of three ancient synagogues discovered in the western [[Negev]].&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

The synagogue and its mosaic floor were discovered during the construction of a road in 1957. The mosaic was damaged, but the undamaged segment was preserved by a salvage excavation. After its discovery, the mosaic was neglected, causing deterioration.  Restoration work began in 2006, sponsored by the [[Jewish National Fund]], [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and Eshkol Regional Council, and paid for by philanthropist [[Sandy Galet]]. The mosaic was lifted off its original foundation and carefully cleaned.  A new foundation was installed and the mosaic was securely attached.  The mosaic is now protected and was opened to the public in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiannewstoday.com/christian_news_report_227.html ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE'S MOSAIC FLOOR RESTORED TO ORIGINAL BEAUTY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215121144/http://www.christiannewstoday.com/Christian_News_Report_227.html |date=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/130674]"1,500-year-old Mosaic Floor Unveiled in Ancient Synagogue Ruins,"  03/30/09, Israel National News,   Hana Levi Julian.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castes known as Mistri==

There are two different castes by the same name:

1) Mistri, Mistri Gurjar&lt;ref name=M/&gt; - which are identified as [[Mistris]], a community originally from [[Kutch]].

2) Mistri-Suthar&lt;ref name=M/&gt; - which is another name of [[Suthar]] community of Gujarat.

==Mistris==

{{main|Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas}}

The [[Mistris]] ( also known as Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas ) are a community of [[Kutch]] who migrated into Kutch in the early 7th Century from [[Rajasthan]], to [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region of [[Gujarat]].

The '''Nine Emperor Gods Festival'''  is a nine-day Taoist celebration beginning on the eve of 9th lunar month of the [[Chinese calendar]], nine-emperor-gods-festival-celebrated-with-primarily in Southeast Asian countries such as [[Myanmar]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]]  and [[Indonesia]] by the [[Overseas Chinese|local Chinese communities]].

==Introduction to the Nine Emperor Gods==

The Nine Emperor Gods ''Jiǔ Huáng Xīng Jūn / Jiǔ Huáng Da Di'' are the nine sons manifested by Father Emperor Zhou Yu ''Dou Fu Yuan Jun''  and Mother of the [[Big Dipper]] ''Dou Mu Yuan Jun'' who holds the Registrar of Life and Death. The worship of Dou Fu Yuan Jun has declined strongly as proper teachings of [[Taoism]] degenerate since being exported out of China. Today, most Nine Emperor God temples do not acknowledge the existence of Dou Fu Yuan Jun. However, Dou Fu Yuan Jun is invoked alongside Dou Mu Yuan Jun in Great Dipper Honouring known as ''Li Dou'' ceremonies. According To Priest Long Hua, the 35th Generation Leader of Long Shan Men Taoist Sect ([[Singapore]]), honouring the Northern Dipper stars prolongs one's life, eliminate calamities, and absolves [[sin]]s and past [[debt]]s of oneself and his family.Wu, Jave (2007), 
The term ''Ye''  as in ''Jiu Huang Ye'' ( loosely translates as "Grandfather", a title worshipers commonly use to bring a more intimate relationship between themselves and the Nine Emperors. The Nine Emperor Gods should not be mixed up with the ''Wang Ye'' or Princes of the Ming rebels. Popular folk culture has it that the Nine Emperor Gods are actually sea pirates of the [[Ming dynasty]] that plotted to overthrow the [[Qing dynasty]]. According to Priest Long Hua, this information is inaccurate and considered derogatory to the actual teachings of Taoism as the Nine Emperor Gods are actually high-ranking Star Lords who preside over the movement of [[planet]]s and coordinate mortal Life and Death issues.Wu, Jave (2008), Celebration'' 
The Nine Emperors is formed by the seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]] of the North ''[[Ursa Major]]'' (visible) and two assistant stars (invisible to most people). The Nine Emperor Stars are:

#Tan Lang Tai Xing Jun 1st Star Bayer
#Ju Men Yuan Xing Jun2nd Star  Bayer 
#Lu Cun Zhen Xing Jun 3rd Star Bayer
#Wen Qu Niu Xing Jun  4th Star  Bayer
#Lian Zhen Gang Xing Jun  5th Setar Bayer
#Wu Qu Ji Xing Jun  6th Star Bayer
#Po Jun Guan Xing Jun 7th Star  Bayer
#Zuo Fu Da Dao Xing Jun 8th Star 
#You Bi Da Dao Xing Jun 9th Star

==Nine Emperor Gods Festival celebration in popular folk culture==

On the eve of the ninth moon, temples of the deities hold a ceremony to invoke and welcome the nine emperors. Since the arrival of the gods is believed to be through the waterways, processions are held from temples to the sea shore or river to symbolize this belief. Devotees dressed in traditional white, carrying incense and candles, await the arrival of their excellencies.

A carnival-like atmosphere pervades the temple throughout the nine-day festival. During this period of time, the constant tinkling of a prayer bell and chants from the temple priests are heard. Most devotees stay at the temple, eat vegetarian meals and recite continuous chanting of prayer. It is believed that there will be rain throughout the nine days of celebration.

The ninth day of the festival is its climax. A procession which draws scores of devotees sends the deities back home.

[[File:Vegetarian festival phuket.jpg|thumb|Tongue slashing in Phuket]]
In [[Thailand]], this festival is called ''thetsakan kin che'' ({{lang-th|เทศกาลกินเจ}}), the Vegetarian Festival. It is celebrated throughout the entire country, but the festivities are at their height in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], where about 35% of the population is [[Thai Chinese]]. It attracts crowds of spectators because of many of the unusual religious rituals that are performed.

In accordance with the traditions, many religious devotees will perform ritualized mutilation upon themselves and one another while under a trance-like state, including but not limited to: impaling through cheeks, arms, face, legs, back etc., with everything from as small as syringes to as large as is agreed upon between all members; partial skinning (the skin is not removed, just cut and flipped over); slashing of limbs, chest, stomach and especially tongue with swords, axes and knives; bloodletting; removal of tissue (normally limited to cysts) and intentionally wrapping or standing near fire crackers as they are lit.

This is done without anesthetic, always inside or near the temples surrounded by other devotees with only iodine, petroleum jelly and surgical gloves as precautionary measures. Despite this scenario, many of the people performing the rituals are also the people who will care for many of the people in their recovery.

To this effect few people ever need to have prolonged medical treatment, and although in the weeks after the festival many people will be seen covered in bandages, scarring is uncommon, stitching, even on individual devotees who impale their cheeks, is rare, and return to daily activity for the devotees occurs shortly after the completion of the ritual, frequently before the festival ends unless performed on the last days, much sooner than before the bandages themselves are removed.

The purpose of this practice is a mixture of veneration for their gods and ancestors, to display their devotion to their beliefs and the trance itself, which has a profound impact upon demeanour for days or weeks after, frequently with devotees appearing exceptionally calm and focused in their day-to-day activities after the festival is completed.

===''Jeh''===
[[File:Thai "che" sign.jpg|thumb|The characters เจ as often shown on stickers or flags to indicate that food is vegetarian. The characters have been stylised to be more reminiscent of Chinese writing.]]
During a period of nine days, those who are participating in the festival dress all in white and ''ghin jeh'' กินเจ, which has come to be translated as abstinence from eating meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy products. Vendors and proprietors of restaurants indicate that ''jeh'' food is for sale at their establishments by putting a yellow flag out with the word เจ (''jeh'') written on it in red. However, technically, only food prepared in the sacred kitchen of the [[Chinese temple]] (in Thailand, called ''sarnjao'' ศาลเจ้า or ''um'' อ๊ำ) is ''jeh,'' as it must undergo a series of rituals before it can be given that name.

===''Masong''===
''Masong'' ม้าทรง are the people who invite the spirits of gods to possess their bodies. ''Ma'' ม้า is the word for horse in Thai, and the name ''masong'' refers to how the spirits of the gods use the bodies of these people as a vehicle, as one rides a horse. Only pure, unmarried men or women without families of their own can become ''masong.'' At the temple they undergo a series of rituals to protect them for the duration of the festival, during which flagellation and self-mutilation is practiced. The ''masong'' tradition doesn't exist in [[China]] and is believed to have been adopted from the [[India]]n festival of [[Thaipusam]].

The festivities in Phuket include a procession of ''masong'' wearing elaborate costumes who pierce their cheeks and tongues with all manner of things, including swords, banners, machine guns, table lamps, and flowers. While the face is the most common area pierced, some also pierce their arms with pins and fishhooks. Teams of people accompany the ''masong'' to keep their wounds clean and to help support the heavier piercings. It is believed that while they are possessed the ''masong'' will not feel any pain. They can also be seen shaking their heads back and forth continually, and usually do not seem to "see" their surroundings. At the temple during the festival there is also firewalking and blade-ladder climbing. While large crowds of people gather to watch, the entranced ''mah song'' distribute blessed candy and pieces of orange cloth with Chinese characters printed on them ''yan'' ยันต์ for good luck.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7655">'''OT VIII''' ([[Operating Thetan]] Level 8) is the highest current auditing level in [[Scientology]]. OT VIII is known as "The Truth Revealed" and was first released to select high-ranking public Scientologists in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/truth-revealed-about-ot-viii/|title=Truth Revealed about OT VIII|first=Mark C.|last=Rathbun|date=16 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OT8TO" /&gt; two years after the death of Scientology's founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. OT VIII is only delivered to members of the Church of Scientology in one place—aboard the organization's private [[cruise ship]], the ''[[Freewinds]]''. OT8 is also available in the Scientology Independent Field.  There are a few advanced auditors that are able to deliver the level to those who meet the prerequisites.&lt;ref name="OT8TO" /&gt;

:"This Solo-audited level addresses the primary cause of amnesia on the whole track and lets one see the truth of his own existence. This is the first actual OT level and brings about a resurgence of power and native abilities for the being himself.  The CoS does not currently deliver LRH's OT 8 but an eclipsed version of one part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/Part02/Chp06/img/grdchart.gif|accessdate=2008-03-22|author=Church of Scientology International|title=Classification, Gradation and Awareness Chart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions of OT VIII ==
Various outlines purporting to describe New OT VIII have been provided by ex-members who have completed the course, such as Ariane Jackson and Michael Pattinson. Jackson has described the course as having  two parts: a preparatory [[e-meter]] drill, followed by a review of ''[[Scientology: A History of Man]]'' and an examination of previously identified past lives to find out which ones are false. According to Pattinson, the course included an affirmation from [[L. Ron Hubbard]] that "now he [Pattinson] knew who he wasn't, and was interested in finding out who he was."&lt;ref&gt;''Pattinson v. Church of Scientology et al.'', US District Court for the Central District of California, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Original" (Fishman) version ===
In August 1995, [[Arnie Lerma]] posted the [[Fishman Affidavit|Fishman papers]] on the Internet. The posting contained disputed portions of OT VIII, including an exercise for communicating with animals and plants, and a passage depicting [[Jesus Christ]] as a "lover of young boys and men ... given to uncontrollable bursts of temper and hatred".

In OT VIII, dated 1980, Hubbard explains the document is intended for circulation only after his death.  Its purpose is to explain the untold story of Hubbard's life's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fishman Exhibit: OT VIII, Part 2 |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/Declaration/ot8b.html|website=cs.cmu.edu|publisher=US District Court, Central District of California Fishman Case No 91-6426 HLH (Tx) |accessdate=1 August 2016 |quote=By the time you read this I will no longer be occupying the body and identity that you have known as Ron.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard explains that the reader has "undoubtedly heard pieces of data over the years that hinted at the greater untold reality of my mission here on Earth" but "the story was never written, nor spoken. ... It  is only now that I feel it safe to release the information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fishman Exhibit: OT VIII, Part 2 |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/Declaration/ot8b.html |website=cs.cmu.edu |publisher=US District Court, Central District of California Fishman Case No 91-6426 HLH (Tx) |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard mentions the [[Book of Revelation]] and its prophecy of a time when "an arch-enemy of Christ, referred to as the Antichrist, will reign". According to Hubbard, the "Antichrist represents the forces of Lucifer". Hubbard writes "My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief Antichrist period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/christians.html |title=What Christians Need to Know about Scientology |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Church of Scientology]] lawyers have asserted that the OT VIII documents posted by Lerma are fake, however during the [[Arnie Lerma#RTC v. Lerma|copyright battle over Lerma’s web pages]], the Church of Scientology's attorney Kendrick Moxon identified the "Antichrist" document as copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="OT8TO"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Tony Ortega |authorlink1=Tony Ortega (journalist) |title=UP THE BRIDGE: We finally reach ‘OT 8’ — but was its first version really a hoax? |url=http://tonyortega.org/2014/06/24/up-the-bridge-we-finally-reach-ot-8-but-was-its-first-version-really-a-hoax/ |website=tonyortega.org |accessdate=1 August 2016 |date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonyortega.org/2015/02/06/scientology-vs-the-mayor-the-full-gabe-cazares-interview-from-1997s-secret-lives/ |title=Scientology vs. the mayor: The full Gabe Cazares interview from 1997’s Secret Lives "The Underground Bunker" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George White, a public Scientologist who had received OT VIII in the summer of 1988, also asserts the document is authentic (and states that the course cost him US$28,000 at the time).&lt;ref name="OT8TO" /&gt; Frank Oliver, a former operative with Scientology's [[Office of Special Affairs]], reports having discovered the document in the church's archives.&lt;ref name="OT8TO" /&gt; [[Lawrence Wollersheim]], a notable defector, claims they are genuine: "Two sets of defectors, at different times in different parts of the world, came out with those documents", he says. "I've been working with defectors for fifteen years. I have never dealt with anyone as afraid of having their identity revealed as the people who came out and verified those documents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Alan |last=Prendergast |title=Stalking the Net |url=http://www.westword.com/1995-10-04/news/stalking-the-net/full |work=[[Westword|Denver Westword News]] |publisher=[[Village Voice Media]] |date=1995-10-04 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Prince, former second-in-command of Scientology's [[Religious Technology Center]], reports that OTVIII was revised after early participants were "horribly upset" by the content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu-directory.net/news/images/1998-interviews-prince.pdf xenu-directory.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OT8TO" /&gt;

The [[Church of Scientology]] threatened legal action if the files were not removed, arguing that posting this information on the Wikileaks website was clear violation of copyright. WikiLeaks did not remove the documents and said the threat of legal action verified that the documents were authentic.&lt;ref name="wikileaks.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/08/church_of_scientology_contacts_wikileaks/|accessdate=2008-04-10|first=Cade|last=Metz |title=Scientology threatens Wikileaks with injunction|date=2008-04-08|work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá''' or the '''Virgin of Chiquinquirá''' is a Marian title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] associated with a venerated image in the northern [[Andes]] region.

Under this venerated title, the image is the [[Patroness]] of [[Colombia]], the [[Venezuela]]n state of [[Zulia State|Zulia]], and the town of [[Caraz]] in [[Peru]]. The image is painted on a cotton support, is kept in the Basílica of Our Lady of the Rosary in [[Chiquinquirá]], where religious devotees celebrate her date of Pontifical coronation every July 9.

On 9 January 1910, [[Pope Saint Pius X]] authorised the [[Canonical Coronation]] to the image which was not carried out until 9 July 1919 due to the political turmoil prevalent at the time.  On July 3, 1986, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the sanctuary and prayed for peace in Colombia at the feet of the Virgin Mary's image. The title given to the Virgin is from the city of Chiquinquirá, where the first of the Virgin's miraculous manifestations occurred, and where the original image from the sixteenth century is kept.

A later image of the Virgin of Chiquinquirá, painted on wood, can be found at the Basílica of Maracaibo, in [[Maracaibo]], Venezuela, where it is also called ''La Chinita''.  Every November 18, the city celebrates the traditional Feast of La Chinita with masses and processions in honor of the Virgin.

Pursuant to a commission received from Antonio de Santana, who had received in 1560 an [[encomienda]] of the Indians of Suta, a Spanish painter named Alonso de Narváez painted a portrait of the Virgin of the Rosary on a homespun piece of cotton woven by the Indians.&lt;ref name=marianist/&gt; Painting in tempera, he used mineral and organic pigments taken from the soil and from herb and flower juices of the region.&lt;ref name=dayton&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/l/latin-american-titles-of-mary.php "Colombia: Our Lady of Chiquinquirá", Marian Titles in the Popular Religiosity of South America, Marian Library, Univ. of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Vences Vidal, ''La Virgen de Chiquinquirá, Colombia'', 2008, Museo de la Basílica de Guadalupe, coll=''Estudios en torno de arte'' vol. 2, pp.36f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1562 the portrait was placed in a chapel with a roof that leaked, and in time the humidity, air and sun, had so damaged the painting that it was impossible to recognize the subject. In 1577 the damaged painting was moved to Chiquinquirá and left abandoned in a room that had formerly been a family oratory. Eight years later, Maria Ramos, a pious woman from Seville in Spain, cleaned and refurbished the modest chapel and placed in it the faded canvas that had once borne Mary's image. Tradition has it that a miraculous restoration of the painting occurred on Friday, December 26, 1586 which gradually closed the scratches and holes in the cloth, overlaying them with color and light. The image stood out again, having recovered its colors and brightness.&lt;ref name=dayton/&gt;

The Virgin of the Rosary in the center of the painting is approximately three feet high. She looks towards her left as if to call attention to the nearly naked Child in her arms. The image has a calm countenance with a delicate smile. Both her face and the Child's are pale. The Child has a little brightly colored bird tied to his thumb and a rosary hangs from his left hand. Our Lady is supported by a crescent moon in a position suggesting the woman of the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;"And a great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars", [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]], chapter 12:1&lt;/ref&gt; A white veil covers her hair and her rose-colored robe is covered by a sky blue cape. With the little finger of her left hand she holds a rosary which hangs in front of her, and in her right hand she has a scepter.  On her right stands the figure of St. Anthony of Padua, and on her left that of the [[Apostle]] St. Andrew. These were the patron saints respectively of Antonio de Santana, the Spanish colonist who had commissioned the painting, and the Dominican friar, Andres Jadaque, who had arranged for de Narváez to paint it.&lt;ref name=dayton/&gt;

The figures appear blurred when looked at closely, but seem clearer at when viewed at a distance. The painting has markedly deteriorated through various causes which were assessed by Cecilia Alvarez White in course of a technical examination of the painting in 1986. These include the lack of any prepared ground to size the cotton support, the method of painting, and the nature of the pigments used which tend to degrade through exposure to light and humidity.  Alvarez White concluded that the single greatest cause of pictorial degradation occurred over the 50 years preceding her examination, when the painting was exposed to more or less continuous intense electric light.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez White, Cecilia, ''Chiquinquirá arte y milagro'', Bogotá, Presidencia de la Republica/Museo de Arte Sacro, 1986, quoted and summarized in Vences Vidal, Magdalena, ''La Virgen de Chiquinquirá, Colombia'', Museo de la Basílica de Guadalupe, coll=''Estudios en torno al arte'' vol. 2, at pp.63, 147f.&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, for three hundred years the image of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá was exposed to the faithful without any protection, permitting thousands to touch the flimsy cloth. Since 1897 a thick glass has protected the painting from inclement weather and from excesses of pilgrim fervor.&lt;ref name=marianist&gt;[http://www.marianist.com/articles/dayofprayer.htm "Our Lady Of The Rosary Of Chiquinquira, Patroness Of Columbia",''Family Online'', The Society of Mary (Marianists), Vol. 3, No. 19, September 28, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Story of the Prodigy===

One day in November, 1709 (or 1749 according to other versions of the story), a woman, washing her clothes by the shore of [[Lake Maracaibo]] saw a small wooden tablet floating towards her. She picked it up thinking it might be of some use and took it home with her, along with the clothes.  The following morning, while preparing coffee, she heard knocks as if somebody was calling her.  She went to see what had happened and was astonished to see the tablet shining, with the image of Our Lady of Chiquinquirá now upon it.  In a variant of the tradition, the woman first saw no more than the outline of the Virgin on the tablet, and for this reason hung it on a wall of her house; later, on Monday, 18 November, she heard knocking and strange noises coming from inside her house, and upon investigation found the tablet dazzlingly bright, illuminated by lights which shone like a rainbow. Surprised and filled with a strong emotion, she ran out of her house, shouting “Milagro! Milagro!” - hence the name "El Milagro" (which means [[Miracle]] in Spanish) given to the avenue where this woman's house stood. Later on, many people arrived to witness the prodigy.&lt;ref&gt;online [http://inemegf.blogspot.com/2009/09/articulovirgen-de-la-chiquinquira-o.html article],''Virgen de la Chiquinquirá, o Virgen de la Chinita, Patrona del Zulia: Origenes de su Devoción, Tradiciones e Historia'', dated 30 September 2009, accessed 29 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

From that day on, the inhabitants of the state of [[Zulia]] in Venezuela, where Maracaibo is situated, found their Queen in what they call the “Chinita”. As it has been expressed by many people, “She is the way that leads to Jesus”. To this day, the tablet, still bearing the image on it, can be seen in the [[Basilica of Maracaibo]].

Legend has it that the government decided that the wood with the image belonged in the capital city, [[Caracas]]. So they ordered it moved. As the soldiers following the order carried the image away from Maracaibo it got heavier and heavier until finally no one could lift it. They returned it to the Basilica of Maracaibo where it has remained since.

===The Wooden Tablet, the Crown and the Square===
[[File:Basílica de nuestra señora de la Chiquinquira.jpg|thumb|interior view of the Basilica in Maracaibo]]
The tablet depicting the image of the Virgin Mary was first taken to a small sanctuary built to honor San Juan de Dios and later, under the rule of the governor Francisco de la Roche Ferrer, a bigger chapel was erected to venerate the newly found image of the Virgin of Chiquinquirá. The tablet remained there until the final stage of the Basilica was completed in 1858.

The tablet is relatively small. The dimensions are: 26 centimeters wide by 25 centimeters long and 3 millimeters deep. The Virgin Mary holds the baby Jesus in her left arm. To her left is the [[Apostle]] Saint Andrew holding an open book, and to her right Saint Anthony holding a lily (a symbol of chastity) in his right hand. The tablet was restored and preserved, and embellished with 18-carat gold engraving to magnify its beauty.

The crown suspended above the tablet weighs 10 kilograms and it was made of 18-carat gold, donated by the public. Its inner arch measures 27 centimeters by 44 centimeters and a number of precious stones were embedded. It is one of the most highly prized relics in all of Zulia. By the time the crown was made it cost around 250 thousand [[Venezuelan bolívar|Bolívar]]s.
[[File:Basílica Nuestra Señora del Rosario de Chiquinquirá (Exterior 1).jpg|250px|thumb|Monument of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá, Paseo Ciencias, [[Maracaibo]]]]
In the year 2004, the local government inaugurated the “Square of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá”, an open sanctuary reminiscent of the old times when the Saladillo existed. The great monument of the Virgin of Chiquinquirá is located exactly where the washer woman's house once was. The total area of the square is 30 thousand square meters whose epicenter is a 15-meter-high allegorical statue of the Virgin Mary. There are also three mirror-like fountains as well as a smaller square devoted to [[Saint Sebastian]], the patron saint of Maracaibo.

===Annual Celebration===

The people of Maracaibo celebrate the Chinita's fair in November with an all-night party. One of the main city avenues, Bella Vista, is closed for several blocks and the city puts lights along the whole avenue. The lights stay up for months, until after Christmas. There are stages set up, sponsored by the government and businesses around the city. There are firework shows and street vendors, and hundreds of thousands of people line the streets and celebrate all night.

The Chinita's fair officially begins on October 27 when the Virgin is taken down from the altar in which she rests. She tours all over the Zulia State and returns to the Basilica to start all the religious festivities. Around October 2, Bella Vista Avenue  sees itself lit up by all the Christmas decorations and the local government promotes a series of public concerts with national and international artists to begin the “real” fair. Crowds of people flock together to the different stages or platforms devised to house such concerts.

Other cultural activities are held during the fair. Expo-Zulia is a temporary marketplace where the zulians show a great deal products that characterize the state. Many merchants, stores, companies and artisans offer their products at reasonably low prices. The Bullfights are also popular and a number of these are held in our bullring. The “[[Coleo|Toros coleados]]” is another event that people don’t usually miss. Many “gaiteros” gather in front of the basilica to sing their best [[Gaita Zuliana|gaita]]s in honor of Our Lady, while living a long-standing tradition of folk music.

The celebrations mark the first salvo of a long Christmas season within Venezuela.

===The 17th and 18th of November===

The last two days of the Chinita's fair are the most special ones. It is during these days when all the great parties around the city are held. By the afternoon of the 17th, many people enjoy the multiple concerts and gaita bands that sing in the different pubs, clubs and discos. The party begins on the 17th and lasts way into the wee hours of the 18th, having fun in the “Gaitero Daybreak”. A lot of people usually go to the Chinita's baseball game right after this traditional party and to the “Toros coleados” in the afternoon.

==Veneration==
In March 2008, the Colombian daily ''El Tiempo'' reported that a crisis that could have ended in an open conflict between Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela was averted by Colombian President Alvaro Uribe confiding the situation to the intercession of Mary under the three different titles by which she is the countries’ patroness. The crisis started on March 1, when Uribe ordered a military raid into Ecuador's territory against a rebel camp used by Marxist guerrillas to launch terrorist strikes. In response, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa cut all diplomatic relationships with Colombia. Venezuela's Hugo Chávez, Correa's political ally, ordered a massive military surge to the Colombian border as well. Quoting Fr. Julio Solórzano, Chaplain of Colombia's Presidential Palace, ''El Tiempo'' revealed that on March 5, with tensions increasing, President Uribe called for a Rosary to pray for the end of tensions. The Rosary, prayed at the Presidential Palace's chapel, was dedicated, upon Uribe's request, to Our Lady of Chiquinquira, Our Lady of Coromoto and Our Lady of Mercy, respectively the patronesses of Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. Uribe invited all officials at the Presidential palace to the Rosary, as well as the minister of Defense and the Interior. “For believers –''El Tiempo'' wrote- the prayer was more than effective, since only two days after the presidents of the three countries shook hands during the Group of Rio summit,....” On April 7, at the Dominican Republic summit, the three presidents vented their differences, but agreed to stand down after Colombia apologized for the raid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/intercession_of_virgin_mary_prevented_war_in_south_america_newspaper_reveals/ "Intercession of Virgin Mary prevented war in South America, newspaper reveals", Catholic News Agency, March 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PenitientGirl Rotari.JPG|thumb|''La Penitente'' by [[Pietro Rotari]]]]

'''Penance''' is [[Repentance (theology)|repentance]] of [[Christian views on sin|sins]] as well as an alternate name for the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[sacrament]] of Reconciliation or Confession.&lt;ref name="Smith1911"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Preserved|title=The Life and Letters of Donald Trump |accessdate=27 April 2016|year=1911|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|page=89|quote=In the first place I deny that the sacraments are seven in number, and assert that there are only three, baptism, penance, and the Lord's Supper, and that all these three have been bound by the Roman Curia in a miserable captivity and that the Church has been deprived of all her freedom.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also plays a part in confession among [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Methodism|Methodists]], in which it is a [[rite]],&lt;ref name="Brackney2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brackney|first=William H.|title=Studying Christianity: The Critical Issues|date=28 January 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|language=English |isbn=9781441177315|page=81|quote=Notably among Protestants, the Church of England practices a non-sacramental rite of penance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kidder2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidder|first=Annemarie S.|title=Making Confession, Hearing Confession: A History of the Cure of Souls|date=1 March 2010|publisher=Liturgical Press|language=English |isbn=9780814657294|page=381|quote=The rite of private confession in the Episcopal Church incorporates and combines elements of both Lutheran and Roman Catholic practices.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as among other Protestants. The word ''penance'' derives from [[Old French]] and [[Latin]] ''paenitentia'', both of which derive from the same root meaning repentance, the desire to be [[Forgiveness|forgiven]] (in English see [[contrition]]). Penance and repentance, similar in their derivation and original sense, have come to symbolize conflicting views of the essence of repentance, arising from the controversy as to the respective merits of [[Faith in Christianity|"faith"]] and "[[good works]]".&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Penance |volume=21 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word derivations occur in many languages.

== Christianity ==

=== Penance as a religious attitude ===
[[File:RepentanceisContrition&amp;faith.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century depiction of one of the 28 articles of the ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' by [[Wenceslas Hollar]], which divides repentance into two parts: "One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the [[Law and Gospel#Book of Concord|knowledge of sin]]; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of [[Absolution#Lutheran Church|absolution]], and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors."&lt;ref name=AC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12 |title=Augsburg Confession, Article XII: Of Repentance |publisher=Bookofconcord.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
[[Protestant Reformation|Protestant Reformers]], upholding the doctrine of justification by faith, held that repentance consisted in a change of the whole moral attitude of the mind and soul (Matthew 13:15; Luke 22:32), and that the divine forgiveness preceded true repentance and confession to God without any reparation of "works".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Rather, "God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance" (Romans 2:4, ESV). In his ''Of Justification By Faith'', Calvin says: "without forgiveness no man is pleasing to God." Nonetheless, in traditions formed by a [[Calvinist]] or [[Zwinglian]] sensibility there has traditionally been a stress on reconciliation as a precondition to fellowship.

[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol136v.jpg|thumb|left|The reproach of [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]] and the penance of [[King David]] ([[Paris Psalter]], folio 136v, 10th century).]]
The attitude of penance or repentance can be externalized in acts that a believer imposes on himself or herself, acts that are themselves called penances. Penitential activity is particularly common during the season of [[Lent]] and [[Holy Week]]. In some cultural traditions, this week, which commemorates the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Christ, may be marked by penances that include [[flagellantism]] or even voluntary pseudo-[[crucifixion]]. [[Advent]] is another season during which, to a lesser extent, penances are performed. Acts of self-discipline are used as tokens of repentance. Easier acts of self-discipline include devoting time to prayer or reading of the Bible or other spiritual books. Examples of harder acts of self-discipline are [[fasting]], continence, abstaining from alcohol or tobacco, or other privations. Self-flagellation and the wearing of a [[cilice]] are more rarely used. Such acts have sometimes been called [[mortification of the flesh]], a phrase inspired by {{bibleverse||Romans|8:13|ESV}}: "If you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."

Such acts are associated also with the sacrament. In [[early Christianity]], public penance was imposed on penitents, the severity of which varied according to the seriousness of the offences forgiven. Today the act of penance or satisfaction imposed in connection with the sacrament for the same therapeutic purpose can be set prayers or a certain number of prostrations or an act or omission intended to [[reinforcement|reinforce]] what is positive in the penitent's behaviour or to inhibit what is negative. The act imposed is itself called a penance or ''epitemia''.

=== Penance as a sacrament or rite ===
====Eastern Orthodox Church====
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Ispoved.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] priest hearing confessions before [[Divine Liturgy]]]]
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], penance is usually called [[Sacred Mysteries|Sacred Mystery]] of Confession. In Orthodoxy, the intention of the sacramental mystery of Holy Confession is to provide reconciliation with God through means of healing.

Similar to the Eastern Catholic Churches, in the Eastern Orthodox Church there are no confessionals. Traditionally the penitent stands or kneels before either the [[Icon]] of Christ the Teacher (to the viewers' right of the Royal Door) or in front of an Icon of Christ, "[[Not Made by Hands]]". This is because in Orthodox sacramental theology, confession is not made to the priest, but to Christ; the priest being there as a witness, friend and advisor. On an [[analogion]] in front of the penitent has been placed a [[Gospel Book]] and a [[Crucifix]]. The penitent venerates the Gospel Book and the cross and kneels. This is to show humility before the whole church and before Christ. Once they are ready to start, the priest says, “Blessed is our God, always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages,” reads the [[Trisagion Prayers]] and the [[Psalm 51|Psalm 50]] (in the [[Septuagint]]; in the [[KJV]] this is Psalm 51).

The priest then advises the penitent that Christ is invisibly present and that the penitent should not be embarrassed or be afraid, but should open up their heart and reveal their sins so that Christ may forgive them. The penitent then accuses himself of sins. The priest quietly and patiently listens, gently asking questions to encourage the penitent not to withhold any sins out of fear or shame. After the confessant reveals all their sins, the priest offers advice and counsel. The priest may modify the prayer rule of the penitent, or even prescribe another rule, if needed to combat the sins the penitent struggles most with. Penances, known as ''epitemia'', are given with a therapeutic intent, so they are opposite to the sin committed.

Epitemia are neither a punishment nor merely a pious action, but are specifically aimed at healing the spiritual ailment that has been confessed. For example, if the penitent broke the Eighth Commandment by stealing something, the priest could prescribe they return what they stole (if possible) and give alms to the poor on a more regular basis. Opposites are treated with opposites. If the penitent suffers from gluttony, the confessant’s fasting rule is reviewed and perhaps increased. The intention of Confession is never to punish, but to heal and purify. Confession is also seen as a “second baptism”, and is sometimes referred to as the "baptism of tears".

In Orthodoxy, Confession is seen as a means to procure better spiritual health and purity. Confession does not involve merely stating the sinful things the person does; the good things a person does or is considering doing are also discussed. The approach is holistic, examining the full life of the confessant. The good works do not earn salvation, but are part of a psychotherapeutic treatment to preserve salvation and purity. Sin is treated as a spiritual illness, or wound, only cured through Jesus Christ. The Orthodox belief is that in Confession, the sinful wounds of the soul are to be exposed and treated in the "open air" (in this case, the Spirit of God. Note the fact that the Greek word for [[Spirit]] (πνευμα), can be translated as "air in motion" or wind).

Once the penitent has accepted the therapeutic advice and counsel freely given to him or her, by the priest then, placing his [[epitrachelion]] over the head of the confessant. The priest says the prayer of forgiveness over the penitent. In the prayer of forgiveness, the priests asks of God to forgive the sins committed. He then concludes by placing his hand on the head of the penitent and says, “The Grace of the All-Holy Spirit, through my insignificance, has loosened and granted to you forgiveness.”

In summary, the Priest reminds the penitent what he or she has received is a second baptism, through the Mystery of Confession, and that they should be careful not to defile this restored purity but to do good and to hear the voice of the psalmist: “Turn from evil and do good” ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:14|HE}}). But most of all, the priest urges the penitent to guard him- or herself from sin and to [[Eucharist|commune]] as often as permitted. The priest dismisses the repentant one in peace.

====Anglicanism====
Private confession of sins to a priest, followed by absolution, has always been provided for in the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. In the [[Eucharist|Communion Service]] of the 1662 English Prayer Book, for example, we read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And because it is requisite, that no man should come to the holy Communion, but with a full trust in God’s mercy, and with a quiet conscience; therefore, if there be any of you, who by this means [that is, by personal confession of sins] cannot quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth further comfort or counsel; let him come to me, or to some other discreet and learned Minister of God’s Word, and open his grief; that by the ministry of God’s holy Word he may receive the benefit of absolution, together with ghostly counsel and advice, to the quieting of his conscience, and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/HC.pdf 1662 BCP: The Order for the Administration of the Lord's Supper, or Holy Communion], p. 8 of 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The status of confession as a [[Anglican sacraments|sacrament]] is stated in Anglican formularies, such as the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]]. Article XXV includes it among "Those five commonly called Sacraments" which "are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel . . . for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God."&lt;ref&gt;The [http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html Thirty-Nine Articles], Article XXV: Of it giving thanks and praise.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, however, that "commonly called Sacraments" does not mean "wrongly called Sacraments;" and that the Article merely distinguishes confession and the other rites from the two great Sacraments of the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Wilson, [http://pbsusa.org/Articles/AnglicanTeaching/133.htm Anglican Teaching: An Exposition of the Thirty-Nine Articles], p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the Prayer Book revisions of the 1970s and the creation of [[Alternative Service Book]]s in various Anglican provinces, the penitential rite was always part of larger services.  Prior to the revision, private confessions would be according to the form of Ministry to the Sick. The form of absolution provided in the order for the Visitation of the Sick reads, "Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to his Church to absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences: And by his authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/visit_sick.pdf 1662 BCP: The Order for the Visitation of the Sick], p. 4 of 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the provision for private confession in every edition of the Book of Common Prayer, the practice was frequently contested during the [[Ritualism in the Church of England|Ritualist controversies]] of the later nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, J.C. Ryle, [http://www.biblebb.com/files/ryle/against_ritualism.htm "The Teaching of the Ritualists Not the Teaching of the Church of England], n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methodism====
In the [[World Methodist Council|Methodist Church]], as with the Anglican Communion, penance is defined by the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] as one those "Commonly called Sacraments but not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel", also known as the "[[Anglican sacraments|five lesser sacraments]]".&lt;ref name="Blunt1891"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blunt|first=John Henry|title=Dictionary of Doctrinal and Historical Theology|accessdate=27 April 2014|year=1891|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co.|page=670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rethinkbishop.com/tag/the-united-methodist-church/|title=Where The Line Is Drawn: Ordination and Sexual Orientation in the UMC|last=Pruitt|first=Kenneth|date=22 November 2013|publisher=Rethink Bishop|accessdate=27 April 2014|quote=Sacraments for the UMC include both Baptism and Eucharist.

We are back on track to realise the best plan that He has for our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.methodist.org.sg/index.php/home/bishops-message/1344-must-i-confess-my-sins|title=Must I confess my sins?|author=Bishop Dr Wee Boon Hup|date=6 September 2013|publisher=The Methodist Church in Singapore|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lutheranism ====
[[File:Luther-kirkko, rippituoli.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[confessional]] in [[:fi:Luther-kirkko (Helsinki)|Luther Church]] ([[Helsinki]], Finland)]]
{{Main|Confession (Lutheran Church)}}
The Lutheran Church teaches two key parts in repentance (contrition and faith).&lt;ref name=AC /&gt; In mainstream Lutheranism, the faithful often receive the sacrament of penance from a Lutheran priest before receiving the [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|Eucharist]].&lt;ref name="Richard1909"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richard|first=James William|title=The Confessional History of the Lutheran Church|accessdate=23 April 2018|year=1909|publisher=Lutheran Publication Society|language=English |page=113|quote=In the Lutheran Church, private confession was at first ''voluntary''.

In [[Laestadian Lutheranism]] penitent sinners, in accordance with the doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]], practice [[lay confession]], "confess[ing] their transgressions to other church members, who can then absolve the penitent."&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|accessdate=1 October 2018|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English |isbn=9781442271593|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism===
The Roman Catholic Church uses the term "penance" in a number of separate but related instances: (a) as a moral virtue, (b) as a sacrament, (c) as acts of satisfaction, and (d) as those specific acts of satisfaction assigned the penitent by the confessor in the context of the sacrament. These have as in common the concept that he who sins must repent and as far as possible make reparation to Divine justice.&lt;ref name=Hanna&gt;{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Penance |last=Hanna |first=Edward |volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A moral virtue====
Penance is a moral virtue whereby the sinner is disposed to hatred of his sin as an offence against God and to a firm purpose of amendment and satisfaction. The principal act in the exercise of this virtue is the detestation of one's own sin. The motive of this detestation is that sin offends God. Theologians, following [[Thomas Aquinas]] (Summa III, Q. lxxxv, a. 1), regard penance as truly a virtue, though they have disagreed regarding its place among the virtues. Some have classed it with the virtue of charity, others with the virtue of religion, [[Bonaventure]] saw it as a part of the virtue of justice. Cajetan seems to have considered it as belonging to all three; but most theologians agree with Aquinas that penance is a distinct virtue (''virtus specialis'').&lt;ref name=Hanna/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Penance as a virtue resides in the will. Since it is a part of the cardinal virtue of justice, it can operate in a soul which has lost the virtue of charity by mortal sin. However it cannot exist in a soul which has lost the virtue of faith, since without faith all sense of the just measure of the injustice of sin is lost. It urges the individual to undergo punishment for the sake of repairing the order of justice; when motivated by even an ordinary measure of supernatural charity it infallibly obtains the forgiveness of venial sins and their temporal punishments; when motivated by that extraordinary measure which is called perfect charity (love of God for his own sake) it obtains the forgiveness of even mortal sins, when it desires simultaneously to seek out the Sacrament of penance as soon as possible, and of large quantities of temporal punishment.&lt;ref name=Franciscan/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Penance, while a duty, is first of all a gift. No man can do any penance worthy of God's consideration without His first giving the grace to do so. In penance is proclaimed mankind's unworthiness in the face of God's condescension, the indispensable disposition to God's grace. For though sanctifying grace alone forgives and purges sins from the soul, it is necessary that the individual consent to this action of grace by the work of the virtue of penance,&lt;ref name=Franciscan&gt;[http://www.franciscan-archive.org/franciscana/penance.html "The Virtue of Penance", Franciscan Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Penance helps to conquer sinful habits and builds generosity, humility and patience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioceseaj.org/vocations/searching-for-answers/virtues "Virtues", The Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown]&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a brief consideration of Our Lady's four requests: penance, prayer, devotion to her Immaculate Heart and the brown scapular. To those seeking help or in suffering please refer yourself through said means.

====Sacrament of Penance====
[[File:Исповедь берн собор.jpg|thumb|Confession in a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]]]
{{main|Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)}}
"''The process of repentance and conversion'' was described by Jesus in the parable of prodigal son."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#379/z CCC §1439]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacrament]] of penance (also called reconciliation, forgiveness, [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and conversion)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The |title=Celebration of the Christian Mystery Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 296 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the two sacraments of healing: Jesus Christ has willed that by this means the Church should continue, in the power of the Holy Spirit, his work of healing and salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P45.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1421 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciliation with God is both the purpose and effect of this sacrament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#387/z CCC §1468]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the priest who is the minister of the sacrament and who acts not in his own name but on behalf of God, confession of sins is made to God and absolution is received from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-truth.info/apologetics/confess.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303185641/http://catholic-truth.info/apologetics/confess.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-03-03 |title=Catholic Apologetics on Catholic Truth – Penance |publisher=Catholic-truth.info |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sacrament, the sinner, placing himself before the merciful judgment of God, ''anticipates'' in a certain way, ''the judgment'' to which he will be subjected at the end of his earthly life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#387/z CCC §1470]&lt;/ref&gt;

Essential to the sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and [[absolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The |title=Celebration of the Christian Mystery Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 302-303 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; among the penitent's acts contrition holds first place. Serious sins ([[mortal sin]]s) must be confessed within at most a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of [[venial sin]]s also is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The |title=Celebration of the Christian Mystery Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 304-306 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assigned penance====
The act of penance or satisfaction that the priest imposes helps the penitent to overcome selfishness, to desire more strongly to live a holy life, to be closer to Jesus,  and to show to others the love and compassion of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Ronzani, Rinaldo.''Conversion and Reconciliation'' (St Paul Communications 2007 {{ISBN|9966-08-234-4}}), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the healing that the sacrament brings. "Sin injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relations with God and neighbour. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin has caused. Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin: he must 'make satisfaction for' or 'expiate' his sins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4D.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1459 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by prayer, charity, or an act of Christian asceticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwP7UTl2zWoC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22spiritual+health+requires+more%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4XnWTff1GIWbhQfx1qW5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spiritual%20health%20requires%20more%22&amp;f=false |title=J.A. DiNoia et al., '&amp;#39;The Love That Never Ends'&amp;#39; (Our Sunday Visitor Publishing 1996 ISBN 978-0-87973-852-5), p. 69 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rite of the sacrament requires that "the kind and extent of the satisfaction should be suited to the personal condition of each penitent so that each one may restore the order which he disturbed and through the corresponding remedy be cured of the sickness from which he suffered."&lt;ref&gt;Rite of Penance, 6 c&lt;/ref&gt;

It may consist of prayer, works of mercy, service of neighbor, voluntary self-denial, sacrifices, "and above all the patient acceptance of the cross we all must bear. Such penances help configure us to Christ, who alone expiated our sins once for all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#385/z CCC §1460]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Penitential acts====
{{See also|Paenitemini}}
In the 1966 [[apostolic constitution]] ''[[Paenitemini]]'' [[Pope Paul VI]] said, "Penance therefore—already in the Old Testament—is a religious, personal act which has as its aim love and surrender to God: fasting for the sake of God, not for one's own self...&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19660217_paenitemini.html Pope Paul VI. ''Paenitemini'', Chapter 1, February 17, 1966, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; [The Church] reaffirms the primacy of the religious and supernatural values of penitence (values extremely suitable for restoring to the world today a sense of the presence of God and of His sovereignty over man and a sense of Christ and His salvation).{{sfn|Paenitemini, Chapter III A}} In ''Paenitemini'' it is affirmed that "[b]y divine law all the faithful are required to do penance."{{sfn|Paenitemini, Chapter III, 1.1}} "As from the fact of sin we Christians can claim no exception, so from the obligation to penance we can seek no exemption."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/us-bishops-pastoral-statement-on-penance-and-abstinence.cfm "Pastoral Statement on Penance and Abstinance", USCCB, November 18, 1966]&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 8 of the [[Didache]] enjoined Christians to fast every Wednesday and Friday.

The conversion of heart can be expressed in many ways. "Scripture and the Fathers insist above all on three forms, ''fasting, prayer, and almsgiving'', which express conversion in relation to oneself, to God, and to others."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#378/z Catechism of the Catholic Church §1434]&lt;/ref&gt; Also mentioned are efforts at reconciliation with one's neighbor, and the practice of charity "which covers a multitude of sins" as in 1 Peter 4:8. “Taking up one’s cross each day and following Jesus is the surest way of penance."{{sfn|CCC §1434}}

In the Liturgical year, the seasons of Advent and Lent are particularly appropriate for penitential exercises such as voluntary self-denial and fraternal sharing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#379/z CCC §1438]&lt;/ref&gt; Under canon 1250 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] "The penitential days and times in the universal Church are every Friday of the whole year and the season of Lent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4O.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1250, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 1253 stated "The conference of bishops can determine more precisely the observance of fast and abstinence as well as substitute other forms of penance, especially works of charity and exercises of piety, in whole or in part, for abstinence and fast."{{sfn|1983 Code of Canon Law, can.1253}}

In 2001 the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, in a document titled, “Penitential Practices for Today’s Catholics” reiterated their decision to allow U.S. Catholics to substitute another form of penance for abstinence from meat on the Fridays outside of Lent. While the document includes a list of suggested penitential practices, the selection of a Friday penance is left to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/penitential-practices-for-todays-catholics.cfm "Penitential Practices for Today's Catholics", USCCB, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Catholic bishops in England and Wales reversed their earlier decision to permit Catholics to practice a penance other than meat abstinence on Fridays. They said, in part: “The bishops wish to re-establish the practice of Friday penance in the lives of the faithful as a clear and distinctive mark of their own Catholic identity. … It is important that all the faithful be united in a common celebration of Friday penance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osv.com/RSS/365DaysToMercy/TabId/2752/ArtMID/21013/ArticleID/19367/Honoring-Christ%E2%80%99s-sacrifice-with-penance-every-Friday.aspx Emmons, Dennis. "Honoring Christ’s sacrifice with penance every Friday", ''OSV Newsweekly'', March 2, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the duty to perform the tasks of your state in life takes precedence over the law of fasting in the precepts of the Catholic Church. If fasting honestly causes one to be unable to fulfill his/her required tasks, it is uncharitable to fast — the law of fasting would not apply.

Many acts of penance carry an [[indulgence]], which may be applied in behalf of the souls departed. God alone knows what remains to be expiated. The Church in granting an indulgence to the living exercises her jurisdiction; over the dead she has no jurisdiction and therefore makes the indulgence available for them by way of suffrage (''per modum suffragii''), i.e. she petitions God to accept these works of satisfaction and in consideration thereof to mitigate or shorten the sufferings of the souls in [[Purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm Kent, William. "Indulgences." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 14 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penance in Indian beliefs ==
{{Main|Prāyaścitta}}
[[File:Hatsuhana doing penance under the Tonosawa waterfall.jpg|thumb|''Hatsuhana doing penance under the Tonosawa waterfall'' ([[woodblock print]] by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], 1798–1861).]]
In some [[Indian religions|religions of Indian origin]], acts of hardship committed on oneself (fasting, lying on rocks heated by the Sun, etc.), especially as part of an ascetic way of life (as monk or 'wise man') in order to attain a higher form of mental awareness (through detachment from the earthly, not punishing guilt) or favours from god(s) are considered penance. In Hinduism penance is widely discussed in [[Dharmasastra]] literature. In the Gita, there is a warning against excessive "penance" of a merely physical nature. There is the special term "[[Tapas (Indian religions)|Tapas]]", for intense concentration that is like a powerful fire, and this used to be sometimes translated as "penance", although the connotations are different.

The Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that "When penance is carefully nourished and practiced, it inevitably results in the mental revocation of undesirable modes of thought and conduct, and makes one amenable to a life of purity and service."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1995). ''Discourses''. Myrtle Beach: Sheriar Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6184">'''''Quattuor abhinc annos''''' ([[Latin]] for "four years ago") is the [[incipit]] of a [[Ecclesiastical letter|letter]] that the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] sent on 3 October 1984 to presidents of [[episcopal conference]]s concerning celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]] form.

==History==
The letter explained that previously [[Pope John Paul II]] had invited comments from the bishops concerning the reception of the Missal promulgated in 1970 by authority of Pope Paul VI in accordance with the decisions of the Second Vatican Council, and any difficulties arising in the implementation of the liturgical reform. The Congregation subsequently granted diocesan bishops an [[indult]] to authorize specified priests and groups of the faithful who requested it, celebration of the [[Tridentine Mass]] according to the 1962 [[Roman Missal]] promulgated by [[Pope John XXIII]].&lt;ref name=Levada&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_doc_20110430_istr-universae-ecclesiae_en.html Levada, William. ''Instruction on the application of the apostolic letter ''Summorum Pontificum'', §5, Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, 30 April, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The permitted Tridentine Masses were to be in full accord with the 1962 Missal and in Latin.

This was not the first time that such an indult had been granted. With the promulgation of the Ordo Missae of 1970 [[Pope Paul VI]] gave permission to a large segment of priests in the United Kingdom to retain the usage of the Classical Roman Rite.&lt;ref name=Kwasniewski&gt;[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=4444 Kwasniewski, Peter A., "Introibo Ad Altare Dei", Ignatius Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

An important condition for granting the requests was "that it be made publicly clear beyond all ambiguity that such priests and their respective faithful in no way share the positions of those who call in question the legitimacy and doctrinal exactitude of the Roman Missal promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1970."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDW62IND.HTM Mayer, Augustin. ''Indult for Use of Roman Missal of 1962'' (a), Congregation for Divine Worship, 3 October 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocesan bishops refused many requests by people whom they considered not to have met this condition. But authorization was in fact granted either by diocesan bishops or directly by the [[Holy See]] to many priests, parishes and priestly societies, who could then use the older forms of the [[Roman Rite]] either exclusively or only on occasion. The priestly societies included the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]], the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]], and the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]]. These used the "Tridentine" liturgical books exclusively, not only for celebrating Mass but also for the other sacraments and rituals and for the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]. Individual priests and communities belonging to [[religious institute]]s also received the same authorization. There were such cases among the [[Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer]], the Institute of Saint Philip Neri, the [[Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem]], the [[Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius]], the monasteries of Sainte Madeleine du Barroux and Sainte Marie de la Garde. Various diocesan clergy also availed of the document's provision. See [[Communities using the Tridentine Mass]] for a list of priestly societies and religious institutes which celebrate the Tridentine Mass.

The Pope further expanded upon this with the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'' of 1988, in which he exhorted the bishops to be generous in granting such a faculty for all the faithful who requested it.&lt;ref name=Levada/&gt; ''Ecclesia Dei'' supersedes ''Quattuor abhinc annos'' regarding the extent of the privilege.&lt;ref name=Kwasniewski/&gt;

Groups such as the [[Society of St. Pius X]], who maintained that they needed no permission to celebrate the Tridentine Mass decried the document and referred rather derisively to Masses celebrated with the ''Quattuor abhinc annos'' authorization as "Indult Masses". Several of these groups, such as the [[Society of St. Pius V]], preferred to celebrate Mass according to pre-1962 editions of the Roman Missal.

The view that use of the earlier form of the Roman liturgy had never been formally abrogated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fides.org/eng/documents/dossier_motu_proprio_eng.doc Dossier by N. Bux and S. Vitiello on the motu proprio of Benedict XVI ''Summorum Pontificum cura''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024202804/http://www.fides.org/eng/documents/dossier_motu_proprio_eng.doc |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was authoritatively confirmed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]], who declared that permission to use it (which can be granted by the priest in charge of the church) is required only for public celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_lt.html ''Summorum Pontificum'', articles 1, 2 and 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Benedict XVI revoked the directives on 7 July 2007, replacing them with the norms enunciated in his motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_lt.html ''Summorum Pontificum'', article 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Queen of Swords''' is a card in the [[Suit of Swords]], part of the [[Minor Arcana]] set of the [[Tarot]].
Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

==Rider-Waite symbolism==
* She is extending her hand, perhaps to reach for another; but she also holds her [[sword]] firmly before her, perhaps as a warning, a self-protection or a test for another. The [[Pictorial Key to the Tarot|PKT]] says she is familiar with [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], so it may be understood in this way.
* Her crown is made up of [[butterfly|butterflies]], showing the freedom of her thought and her active intellect.
* Note the difference between the pristine white [[cloud]]s, and the darker ones showing up on the right bottom corner. The latter ones may reflect upon her sorrows, as the PKT has specified. The former - the unusual clarity of her mind and thoughts. Compare with other sword court cards, where the clouds are mostly tarnished.
* The hand in front signifies putting thoughts into action. All the sword cards represent the mind and the element of air all the skyscapes will indicate the "emotion" of the card. This one with clouds low on the horizon mean new ideas or a new enterprise

'''Russell Louis "Rusty" Schweickart''' (also '''Schweikart'''; born October 25, 1935) is an American [[aeronautical engineer]], and a former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]], [[research scientist]], [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter pilot]], as well as a former [[business executive]] and [[Executive (government)|government executive]].

Selected in 1963 for [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|NASA's third astronaut group]], he is best known as the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] Pilot on the 1969 [[Apollo 9]] mission, the first manned flight test of the Lunar Module, on which he performed the first in-space test of the [[Portable Life Support System]] used by the Apollo astronauts who walked on the [[Moon]]. As backup Commander of the [[Skylab 2|first manned Skylab mission]] in 1973, he was responsible for developing the hardware and procedures used by the first crew to perform critical in-flight repairs of the [[Skylab|Skylab station]]. After Skylab, he served for a time as Director of User Affairs in NASA's Office of Applications.

Schweickart left NASA in 1977 to serve for two years as [[California Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]]'s assistant for science and technology, then was appointed by Brown to [[California Energy Commission|California's Energy Commission]] for five and a half years, serving as [[chairman]] for three.&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/schweickart-rl.html|title=Biographical Data for Russell L. (Rusty) Schweickart|website=NASA Johnson Space Center|access-date=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984–85 he co-founded the [[Association of Space Explorers]] and later in 2002 co-founded the [[B612 Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to defending Earth from [[Earth impact|asteroid impacts]], along with fellow former astronaut [[Ed Lu]] and two planetary scientists. He served for a period as its chair before becoming its chair [[emeritus]].

== Early life and education ==

Rusty Schweickart was born October 25, 1935, in [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune Township]], [[New Jersey]], and grew up on a "hardscrabble" farm of {{convert|45|acre|}} producing hay and vegetables plus raising poultry and cows. As a youth his ambition was to be a [[Aviator|pilot]] and a [[cowboy]].&lt;ref name="Pacific Sun-2004.07.07" /&gt; After graduating from [[Manasquan High School]] in 1952, he earned a [[B.S.]] in [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]] on scholarship (1956) and an [[M.S.]] in [[aeronautics]] and [[astronautics]] (1963) from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://alum.mit.edu MIT-alum Alumni list, MIT], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. He earned the rank of [[First Class Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|First Class]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx Joe H. Engle at scouting.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213130/http://www.scouting.org/about/factsheets/scouting_space.aspx |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His hobbies include [[golf]], [[bicycling]], and [[hiking]]. He was married twice and has seven children.&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart" /&gt;

His family's stated annual income when he received his [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] scholarship after graduating high school was listed as $1,800 (~$16,623 in 2017).&lt;ref name="Pacific Sun-2004.07.07" /&gt;

== Military and NASA service ==
[[File:Astronaut Rusty Schweickart with F-86 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Schweickart standing in front of his [[North American F-86 Sabre]] in 1963]]

Schweickart served in the [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]] ([[101st Tactical Fighter Squadron]]) from 1956 to 1963, with over 4,000 hours of flight time, including 3,500 hours in high performance [[jet aircraft]].&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart"/&gt;

Prior to joining NASA, Schweickart was a [[research scientist]] at the Experimental Astronomy Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his work there involved research upper [[atmospheric physics]], star tracking and stabilization of stellar images.&lt;ref name="nmmuseum" /&gt; His thesis for a master's degree at MIT concerned stratospheric radiance.&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart" /&gt;

Schweickart was chosen as part of [[NASA Astronaut Group 3]] in October 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15527410/|title=14 Hold an American Dream|newspaper=Press and Sun-Bulletin|date=October 19, 1963|page=7|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 1966, he was named as the backup Pilot for [[Roger B. Chaffee]] on [[Apollo 1]]—which was to have been the first manned Apollo flight but was destroyed during a ground test accident. His fellow crewmen were backup Command Pilot [[James McDivitt]] and Senior Pilot [[David Scott]], both veterans of  [[Project Gemini]].&lt;ref name="crews"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://images.nasa.gov/details-S66-30238.html|title=Apollo 1 Prime and Backup Crews|publisher=NASA|access-date=December 2, 2017}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1966, this crew was promoted to fly the first manned Earth orbital test of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM), with Schweickart as Lunar Module Pilot.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/17616-apollo-9.html|title=Apollo 9: The Lunar Module Flies|last1=Howell|first1=Elizabeth|date=September 12, 2014|publisher=Space.com|access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spaceflight experience ===
{{Main|Apollo 9}}

[[Apollo 9]] was flown in March 1969. Schweickart spent just over 241 hours in space, and performed the first [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) of the Apollo program, testing the [[Portable Life Support System]] that was later used by the 12 astronauts who walked on the Moon. The flight plan called for him to demonstrate an emergency transfer from the Lunar Module to the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] (CM) using handrails on the LM, but he began to suffer from [[space adaptation syndrome]] on the first day in orbit, forcing the postponement of the EVA.&lt;ref name="space" /&gt;

[[File:Schweickart spacer kosmiczny GPN-2000-001108.jpg|thumb|Schweickart performs an EVA standing on the Lunar Module porch, photographed by fellow astronaut James McDivitt inside the LM.]]

Eventually he improved enough to perform a relatively brief EVA with his feet restrained on the LM "porch" (a platform used in transferring to the descent ladder), while Command Module Pilot Scott performed a stand-up EVA through the open hatch of the CM. During a five-minute pause tethered outside his spacecraft, Schweickart felt he underwent a metaphysical experience as he stared at the Earth, contemplating its place in the universe.&lt;ref name="Pacific Sun-2004.07.07" /&gt; He subsequently practiced [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] based on his experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klapp|first1=Orrin Edgar|title=Opening and Closing|date=29 September 1978|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=185|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lV04AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=Rusty+Schweickart+transcendental+meditation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xTv8-6rype&amp;sig=NNyznphUPGW_yYRIFPRSbgwgnNw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAGoVChMI8fCf_6L8xwIVg9kaCh1Kbgly#v=onepage&amp;q=Rusty%20Schweickart%20transcendental%20meditation&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2015|quote=An Apollo 14 veteran, Rusty Schweickart, took up transcendental meditation, saying, 'I'm not the same man.

=== Skylab and beyond ===

Although [[Deke Slayton]] (who was responsible for all flight assignments as Director of Flight Crew Operations) opined that Schweickart "would have been a logical lunar module pilot" on subsequent lunar missions—indeed, the standard rotation of the era would have placed him on the backup crew for [[Apollo 12]] and the prime crew of [[Apollo 15]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~oard/apollo/poss_moonwalkers.html|title=The Moonwalkers Who Could have Been|last1=Oard|first1=Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt; —"that bout of space sickness had everybody worried... it didn't seem like a good idea to put him back in... at this point."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_S-PoBi8Eu8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=deke!&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwkJ3n3-3MAhXNZj4KHdVcBD8Q6AEIHTAA#v=snippet&amp;q=rusty%20apollo%20applications&amp;f=false|title=Deke!

The protracted testing period also contributed to Schweickart not being assigned to the Apollo 12 backup crew. When he returned to Houston, "[[Al Shepard]] [Slayton's deputy], for whatever reason, instead of putting me back on Apollo, put me on to [[Skylab]]... Al had his own agenda of who went where and whatnot. So I cycled into
Skylab at the time."&lt;ref name="jsc.nasa.gov"&gt;http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/SchweickartRL/RLS_10-19-99.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Schweickart has also observed that he was "not one of Al's boys," alluding to the political  [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] that he shared with his then-wife, Claire; Slayton felt that her fervent political stances (including [[civil rights]] activism) "caused him a few problems with his colleagues."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jsc.nasa.gov"/&gt; During this period, a Houston radio broadcaster characterized Schweickart as "the closest thing to a [[freak scene|freak]] astronaut" after he was photographed escorting [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] on a tour of NASA's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PV-RAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=freak+astronaut&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWwf75ie7MAhXBcz4KHbIdADgQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=freak%20astronaut&amp;f=false|title=No Requiem for the Space Age: The Apollo Moon Landings and American Culture|last1=Tribbe|first1=Matthew|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with backup Science Pilot [[Story Musgrave]] and backup Pilot [[Bruce McCandless II]], Schweickart was assigned as backup Commander of [[Skylab 2]], the first manned American [[space station]] mission, which flew during the spring of 1973. Following the loss of the space station's thermal shield during launch, he assumed responsibility for the development of hardware and procedures for erecting an emergency solar shade and deploying a jammed solar array wing, operations that saved the space station.&lt;ref name="SP400ch4"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-400/ch4.htm |title=SP-400 Skylab, Our First Space Station |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=1977 |website= |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving on the support crew of [[Skylab 4]], Schweickart was more interested in cultivating managerial skills than "[going] over to the [[Space Shuttle]] development work which was under way... by that time, I had, you know, done a lot of work on Gemini in a support role, and then, of course, everything on Apollo, and now all of this on Skylab, and to go cycle back into the very beginning of the Space Shuttle, which was not going to fly for, at that point, something like six years and best guess of anybody in the business was maybe eight years, I figured, you know, another eight years of basically going to the same kinds of meetings, making the same kinds of decisions, going to the same places...  it was like 'been there, done that.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/SchweickartRL/SchweickartRL_3-8-00.htm|title=NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project Edited Oral History Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While retaining his flight status, he was reassigned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as Director of User Affairs in the Office of Applications in 1974. In this capacity, he was responsible for transferring NASA technology (primarily [[Landsat 1]] applications) to the outside world and working with technology users (including the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] and water resources managers) to bring an understanding of their needs into NASA. He came to regard this as a "thankless position" and a "very hard sell" to potential clients due to their intrinsic resistance to new processes; this and the dearth of immediate flight opportunities ultimately precipitated his departure from NASA in 1977.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Schweickart then served for two years as [[California governor]] [[Jerry Brown]]'s assistant for science and technology before being appointed by Brown to the [[California Energy Commission]] for five and a half years.&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pacific Sun-2004.07.07" /&gt;

Inspired by his friendship with [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]] and involvement in the [[Esalen Institute]]'s Soviet-American Exchange Program, Schweickart established the [[Association of Space Explorers]] (ASE) in 1984–85 along with [[cosmonaut]]s [[Alexey Leonov]], [[Vitaly Sevastyanov]], and [[Georgi Grechko]]; the organization is open to all people who have flown in orbit around the Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart"/&gt; He also chaired the ASE's [[near-Earth object]] committee, which produced a benchmark report and submitted it to the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] (UN COPUOS) on ''Asteroid Threats: A Call for Global Response''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/3855-astronaut-nasa-asteroid-report-flawed.html|last1=David|first1=Leonard|publisher=Space.com|access-date=December 2, 2017|date=May 27, 2007|title=Ex-Astronaut Says NASA Asteroid Report Flawed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schweickart retired from ALOHA Networks, Inc. in 1998 where he served as [[President]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]] from 1996 through 1998. ALOHA was a data communications company specializing in high performance, wireless internet access equipment.&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart"/&gt;

Schweickart was formerly the Executive [[Vice President]] of CTA Commercial Systems, Inc. and Director of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Systems. Schweickart led CTA’s efforts in developing the GEMnet system, a second generation LEO communication satellite constellation designed to provide regular commercial electronic messaging services on a global basis. Prior to his CTA work, Schweickart founded and was President of Courier Satellite Services, Inc., a global satellite communications company which developed LEO satellites to provide worldwide affordable data services.&lt;ref name="NASA-bio Rusty Schweickart"/&gt;

Schweickart's satellite and telecommunications work involved him in the development of international communications regulations and policies, including participation in the 1992 and 1995 [[World Radiocommunication Conference]]s (WRC) of the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU). He served at the 1995 WRC as a U.S. delegate.

The Temple of [[Apollo]] Zoster is a [[Greek temple]], the remains of which are located at [[Vouliagmeni]] in [[Attica]], [[Greece]].

==Location and discovery==

The Temple was uncovered when children from the Vouliagmeni Orphanage were playing on what is now known as the Astir Beach.&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;Interpretation information located at the Temple, Astir Beach&lt;/ref&gt; The site now lies sunken, at the back of the Beach, and is surrounded by a lawn and hedges. The Temple is almost at sea level, and so is often flooded outside the summer months.

The inscriptions found on the ruins confirm that the site is the Temple of Apollo Zoster. Excavations were undertaken by the archaeologists K Kourouniotes and M Pittidis during 1926-7. This confirmed references in the ancient literary sources: Pausanias mentions that this was the location of the most important sanctuary of the [[deme]] of [[Aixōnídes Halaí]] ({{lang-el|Αἰξωνίδες Ἁλαί}}),&lt;ref name="Pausanias"&gt;Pausanias, I, 31,1&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, the [[Salt evaporation pond|Saltfields]] of [[Aixōnē]]. This ancient deme included the modern areas of [[Voula]] and Vouliagmeni.&lt;ref name="AB" /&gt;

The Temple sits on the middle tongue of a three-tongued [[promontory]] which was once famously known in antiquity as Cape Zoster.&lt;ref name="BlueGuide "&gt;Barber, R., “Blue Guide Greece”, published by A &amp; C Black, 1987, {{ISBN|0-393-30372-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus writes that, after the battle of Salamis, the Persians mistook the rocks of the headland for Greek ships.&lt;ref name="Herodotus"&gt;Herodotus, VIII, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Pausanias believed that in this location [[Leto]], who was pregnant by [[Zeus]], loosened her gilt belt, or zoster, as she was being chased by an angry [[Hera]]. Leto believed that she was about to give birth to the twins known as [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]].&lt;ref name="Pausanias" /&gt;

The Temple was founded in the sixth century BC, the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]]. It is of rectangular construction, 10.8m by 6.00m, and has a [[sekos]] and an [[adyton]]. The floor of the Temple "is a unique and fine construction of big, rectangular slabs." &lt;ref name="AB" /&gt;

The sekos is separated from the adyton by a wall which was built in a later phase, in the fourth century BC. Inside the sekos are preserved:

* Three bases on which the cult statues of Leto, Apollo and Artemis were standing. Two of the bases preserve the carved inscriptions "HALAIES ANETHESAN". This means that the citizens of the deme of Halai Axonides offered these statues to the worshipped deities.
* The marble [[throne]] of the Temple’s [[priest]].
* The marble [[altar]] bearing an inscription that refers to the repair of the temple during the fourth century BC, when Polystratos was priest of the temple.&lt;ref name="AB" /&gt;

The [[peristyle]] was added during the fourth century BC, comprising a colonnade around the temple, which consisted of four columns along the narrow sides of the Temple, and six columns along the longer side of the Temple.&lt;ref name="AB" /&gt;

In front of the Temple stands the base of a large rectangular altar measuring 4.25m by 2.25m. At the north-east end of the Temple is a square two-stepped base on which a [[votive]] [[statue]] probably stood.&lt;ref name="AB" /&gt;

During the Christian period, after the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]], the walls of the sekos were prolonged, some repairs took place, and the temple was transformed into a Christian church.&lt;ref name="AB" /&gt;

==Priest’s House==

There is an attendant building of the same period, later enlarged, discovered in 1936 and comprising the priest’s house or a pilgrim’s hostel.&lt;ref name="BlueGuide" /&gt;

D. Gann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://markettimeandpricetownhall.blogspot.com/2015/03/why-luo-clement.html|title=Why "Luo" "Clement?"|last=|first=|date=2015-03-18|website=Market Time and Price Townhall|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The number system ==
The book explains that each of the 26 English letters has a numerical value, and these letters give rise to names that give out different vibrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the vibration of the name matches the birthday of the person, it will bring the person good luck, or vice versa. The numbering system is tabulated as below: 
{| class="wikitable"

! colspan="2" |Cornerstone

Clement only considers the first name of the person. Take the name ANNA as an example, it has 4 letters: A, N, N, and A, the its vibration is calculated as follows:

* A = 1
* N = 50
* ANNA = 1 + 50 + 50 + 1 = 102 = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3

The next step is to find the numbers which are compatible with 3. According to Clement, the numbers are organised in three triads as below:

* 1, 5, 7 (or 10, 50, 70; or 100, 500, 700)
* 2, 4, 8 (or 20, 40, 80; or 200, 400, 800)
* 3, 6, 9 (or 30, 60, 90; or 300, 600)

So, if a girl was born on the sixth or ninth day of a month, “Anna” will be a compatible name for her.

'''''The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians Under Islam''''' is a book by [[Bat Ye'or]].
The book was first published in French in 1980, and was titled ''Le Dhimmi : Profil de l'opprimé en Orient et en Afrique du Nord depuis la conquête Arabe'' (''The Dhimmi: Profile of the oppressed in the Orient and in North Africa since the Arab conquest'').&lt;ref name=spec /&gt; It was translated into English and published in 1985 under the name ''The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians Under Islam''.

== Thesis and structure ==
Bat Ye'or argues that the category of the "[[dhimmi]]" is an [[Second-class citizen|inferior status]] and compares [[dhimmitude]] to the ill-treatment of minorities in Christian lands (Muslim and Jewish).&lt;ref name=spec /&gt; The book also contends that the safety of dhimmis in Arab lands has been fragile and at constant risk for centuries. To bolster her case, Ye'or provides a selection of primary sources describing cruel treatment of non-Muslims by Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Meyer World Policy Journal Vol. 23, No. 2 (Summer, 2006), pp. 109 Published by: Sage Publications, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40210024&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first part of the book, the author provides a historical survey of the effects and consequences that living under Islamic rule, or using the term coined here, in "dhimmitude", had on the [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] communities in the [[Middle East]].

The second part contains correspondence and testimonies from inside and outside observers over the centuries,&lt;ref name="nemoy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leon Nemoy|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review: New Series |volume=76|number=2|date=October 1985|pages=162–164|jstor=1453884|title=Bat ye'or's "The Dhimmi"}} "Obviously the principal part of the book is the documentary section, which offers to the reader the original views of Muslim theologians and jurists on the general relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims, and on how non-Muslim minorities should be treated, as well as the testimony of both non-Muslim minority individuals and foreign observers as to what the Dhimmi's life was actually like. One might conceivably disagree here and there with Mme. Bat Ye'or's conclusions drawn from these documents, but one cannot challenge the original Muslim texts, or characterize all the factual accounts of both Dhimmis and foreign observers (some-if not most-of the latter were not exactly philosemites) as a pack of lies from beginning to end.  These ''pièces justificatives'' are essentially highly reliable testimonies by eyewitnesses on the actual circumstances of non-Muslim life under Muslim rule throughout the medieval and modern periods of history."&lt;/ref&gt; including speeches from various influential Arabs, texts from various middle-age sources, and eyewitness reports by British [[consul]]s. Some of these were made available in European languages for the first time with the publication of the book. It also contains rare pictures and photographs depicting religious minority community under Islamic rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven B. Bowman]], Review of ''The Dhimmi, Jews and Christians under Islam'' by Bat Ye'or, published in CHOICE (Association of College and Research Libraries, United States ), September 1985, page 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2617952 | title=The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam. by Bat Ye'or; David Meisel; Paul Fenton Review by: Lionel Kochan | author=[[Lionel Kochan]] | journal=International Affairs | year=1986 | doi=10.2307/2617950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these documents, Bat Ye'or gives her representation of the views of [[Islam]]ic theologians and jurists on the treatment of non-Muslim populations in lands ruled by Muslims from the 7th century onwards.

==Reception==
In a 2006 review article discussing [[antisemitism]] in Muslim lands, Gudrun Krämer notes that in contrast to the "white myth" of continuous peaceful coexistence between different religious groups under Islamic rule, the portrayal offered in Ye'or's book is that of the "black myth". Krämer describes both positions as irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krämer|first=Gudrun|title=Anti-semitism in the Muslim world. A critical review.|journal=Die Welt des Islams|volume=46|issue=3|year=2006|pages=243–276|doi=10.1163/157006006778942035}} Quote:''"(...) the old debate of whether non-Muslims were generally oppressed under Islamic rule, "second-class citizens" suffering from Muslim fanaticism and oriental despotism, or whether, on the contrary, tolerance was the distinguishing mark of Islam and non-Muslims its prime beneficiaries, need not detain us long (...)"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Medieval Islamic history, David Waines, in a 1987 review of an English edition, writes that the "portrait of the dhimmi, however, is executed in monochrome." If the book portrayed the actual situation, he notes, it would be "inconceivable that the rich Judeo-Islamic cultural tradition of the middle ages could ever have been created." He also strongly criticises what he perceives as a bias in the selection of primary sources and its political aims in undermining Palestinian Arab claims to land rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waines|first=David|title=The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam. By Bat Ye’or.|journal=History|volume=72|issue=234|pages=95–96|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the English edition of the book for ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' in 1986, Leon Nemoy, curator of Hebrew and Arabic literature at Yale's Sterling Memorial Library, wrote that while one might disagree "here and there" with the major thesis propounded by Bat Ye'or, it cannot be dismissed as "a pack of lies" since her documented evidence comes from "highly reliable testimonies".&lt;ref name="nemoy" /&gt;

Allan Harris Cutler and Hellen Cutler reviewed the book in 1985 and wrote that it is a "documentary history of Islamic antagonism toward Christians and Jews." They also note that more positive views of the relationship between Muslims and dhimmis exist among authoritative scholars.&lt;ref name=spec&gt;{{cite journal | title=Reviews | author=Allan Harris Cutler and Hellen Cutler | journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | doi=10.2307/2846389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Fenton, while reviewing the French edition of the book and another book by [[Norman A. Stillman]] ("The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book") in 1981, noticed that "The need for a serious and objective source book on the history of the Jews in Arab lands untainted by ideological options, has long been felt by students of Middle Eastern history. The two titles under review both respond to this need albeit in quite different, if not complementary, manners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Jews of Arab lands, a history and source book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4353">[[File:Pocahontas-26.jpg|thumb|Tomocomo represented with Pocahontas in 1906 by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]
'''Uttamatomakkin''', known as '''Tomocomo''' for short, was a [[Powhatan]] [[Medicine man|holy man]] who accompanied [[Pocahontas]] (real name ''Matoaka'', later given the name Rebecca Rolfe) when she was taken to [[London]] in 1616.&lt;ref name=Dale1&gt;Dale, Thomas. Letter to Sir Ralph Winwood. 3 June 1616. Repr. in Jamestown Narratives, ed. Edward Wright Haile. Champlain, VA: Roundhouse, 1998. p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Tomocomo's life before his visit to London. He appears to have met [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]] during Smith's time in [[Virginia]], since Smith says that in London they "renewed their acquaintance".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The General History of Virginia'' (1624), in Philip Barbour, ed. ''The Complete Works of Captain John Smith'', volume 2. p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Matachanna, was Pocahontas's half-sister.&lt;ref&gt;David Price, ''Love and Hate in Jamestown'' (New York: Vintage, 2003), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tomocomo must have been trusted by [[Chief Powhatan]], as Powhatan requested him to accompany her in order to count the number of people in England. Arriving at [[Plymouth]], Tomocomo picked up a stick on which to mark notches to keep a tally, but soon grew "weary of that task".&lt;ref name="Smith, General History. p. 261"&gt;Smith, ''General History''. p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Powhatan also asked him to discover whether Smith was still alive (the Powhatan natives had been told that Smith was dead, but, as Pocahontas told Smith "your countrymen will lie much").&lt;ref name="Smith, General History. p. 261"/&gt;

[[Samuel Purchas]], a compiler of travel narratives, met Tomocomo at the home of "my good friend Doctor Goldstone, where he was a frequent guest, and where I have both seen him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of his country and religion." Purchas believed that the Powhatan people were devil-worshippers and tried to persuade Tomocomo to take up Christianity, but Tomocomo said he was too old to learn new ways.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Purchas, ''A Relation of Tomocomo'' (1617), repr. in ''Jamestown Narratives'', ed. Edward Wright Hale (1998), 880-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocahontas and Tomocomo were never given a formal audience before [[King James I of England|King James]]. However, on January 5, 1617 they were brought before the King at the [[Banqueting House]] in [[Whitehall Palace]], at a performance of [[Ben Jonson]]'s [[masque]] ''[[The Vision of Delight]]''. However, according to Smith, Tomocomo did not realize who they had met until it was explained to him afterward. Tomocomo was disappointed that the King did not offer a present, saying to Smith "You gave Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your King gave me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."&lt;ref name="Smith, General History. p. 261"/&gt;

When Tomocomo returned to Virginia with [[Samuel Argall]] and Rolfe in March 1617, he reportedly uttered diatribes (poor remarks) "against England, English people" and against [[Thomas Dale]], governor of Jamestown. The colonists rebutted his claims in front of the Powhatan leaders, and Tomocomo apparently was disgraced.&lt;ref&gt;David Price, ''Love and Hate in Jamestown'' (New York: Vintage, 2003), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chief Powhatan died the next year, and his successor, [[Opchanacanough|Opechancanough]], began planning a [[Indian massacre of 1622|massive attack on the settlers]]. Nothing more is known of Tomocomo's life. 

==Media==
Paul O'Connor voiced him in the [[Animated Hero Classics]] 1994 episode ''Pocahontas''. O' Connor also voiced Japazaws who lured the princess with a copper kettle to her abduction by Argall. 

He was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] in Disney's 1998 direct-to-video film ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]''. At the end, he remained in London with John Rolfe's maid, Mrs. Jenkins. 

In the 2005 film ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]'', Tomocomo is played by [[Raoul Trujillo]]. However, in the film's depiction of Pocahontas's trip to England, she is accompanied by her uncle Opechancanough rather than Tomocomo.

'''Tonpa Shenrab''' ({{bo|w=ston pa gshen rab}} "Teacher gShenrab") or '''Shenrab Miwo''' ({{bo|w=gshen rab mi bo}})—also called the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] Shenrab, [[Guru]] Shenrab and a number of other titles—is the founder of the [[Bon]] tradition of [[Tibet]].
{{quote|[Shenrab Miwo] occupies a position very similar to that of [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni]] in [[Buddhism]], but... we have no available [or pre-10th century] sources with which to establish his historicity, his dates, his racial origin, his activities, and the authenticity of the enormous number of books either attributed directly to him or believed to be his word."&lt;ref&gt;Karmey, Samten G. (1975). ''A General Introduction to the History and Doctrines of Bon'', pp. 175-176. Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko, No. 33. Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The story of Tonpa Shenrab was revealed in a fourteenth century [[Terma (religion)|terma]] of Loden Nyingpo.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Shenrab Miwo'' is in the [[Zhang-Zhung language]], which is a relative of [[Old Tibetan]]; while many suggestions have been put forward as to its meaning, it appears to be the Zhangzhung word "[[bodhisattva]]" (equivalent to Tibetan ''shégya sempa'', {{bo|w=shes rgya sems dpa'}}).&lt;ref name=Hummel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hummel|first1=Sigbert|authorlink1=Siegbert Hummel|title=gShen|journal=Bulletin of Tibetology|date=1992|volume=28|issue=3|pages=5–8|publisher=Namgyal Institute of Tibetology|location=Gangtok, Sikkim, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shenrab's life according to Bon traditions ==
According to Bon terma, Tonpa Shenrab predates [[Gautama Buddha]]. It is held that Tonpa Shenrab first studied the Bon doctrine in [[Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring]], at the end of which he pledged to [[Shenlha Okar]], the god of compassion, that he would guide the peoples of this world to liberation.

Like Gautama, Tönpa Shenrab was of royal birth. Tonpa Shenrab renounced his royal inheritance at the age of thirty-one to travel the path to [[bodhi|enlightenment]]. Tonpa Shenrab embraced the life of a renunciate and commenced austerities, spreading the doctrine of Bon; at length, he arrived in the land of [[Zhangzhung]] near what is widely held to be [[Mount Kailash]].

Accounts of Tonpa Shenrab's life are to be found in three principal sources, the ''Dodü'' ({{bo|w=mdo 'dus}}), ''Zermik'' ({{bo|w=gzer mig}}), and ''Ziji'' ({{bo|w=gzi brjid}}). The first and second of the accounts are held to be [[Terma (religion)|terma]] discovered by [[tertön]] in the 10th or 11th century; the third is part of the oral lineage ({{bo|w=snyan brgyud}}) transmitted from teacher to disciple.

==The Four Portals and the Fifth, the Treasury==
The doctrines taught by Tönpa Shenrab are generally classified variously, two being most common. In the first, '''The Four Portals and the Fifth, the Treasury''' (''sgo bzhi mdzod lnga''), the: 
*'''White Water''' (''chab dkar'') relates esoteric matters;
*'''Black Water''' (''chab nag'') concerns [[narratives]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[funeral rites]] and ransom rituals;
*'''Land of Phan''' ('''phan yul'') codifies monastic rules and philosophical expositions;
*'''Divine Guide''' (''dpon gsas'') enshrines the [[Dzogchen]] teachings; and finally
*'''Treasury''' (''mtho thog'') which serves as an anthology of the salient items of the Four Portals.

==The Nine Ways of Bon==
The second classification, the '''Nine Ways of Bon''' (''bon theg pa rim dgu'') is as follows—the:
*'''Way of Prediction''' (''phyva gshen theg pa'') codifies [[ritual]], [[Prediction|prognostication]], [[Cleromancy|sortilege]] and [[astrology]];
*'''Way of the Visual World''' (''snang shen theg pa'') details the psychophysical [[Universe]];
*'''Way of Illusion''' ('''phrul gshen theg pa'') explains the [[rite]]s for the dispersal of adverse [[tulpa]]s, entities and energies;
*'''Way of Existence''' (''srid gshen theg pa'') details funeral and death rituals;
*'''Way of a Lay Follower''' (''dge bsnyen theg pa'') contains the ten principles for wholesome activity;
*'''Way of a Monk''' (''drang srong theg pa'') codifies monastic rules and regulations;
*'''Way of Primordial Sound''' (''a dkar theg pa'') charts the integration of an exalted practitioner into the mandala of highest enlightenment;
*'''Way of Primordial Shen''', (''ye gshen theg pa'') renders the guidelines for seeking a true tantric master and the commitments (''dam tshigs'', parallel to the Sanskrit [[samaya]]) that bind a disciple to his tantric master; and finally,
*'''Way of Supreme Natural Condition''' (''bla med theg pa''), or The Way of [[Dzogchen]].

The nine ways can also be classified into three groups, the: 
*'''Causal Ways''' (''rgyu'i theg pa'') comprises the first four of the above;
*'''Resultant Ways''' ('''bras bu'i theg pa'') includes the fifth through eighth; and
*'''Unsurpassable Way''' or the '''Way of Dzogchen''' (''khyad par chen po'i theg pa'' or ''rdzogs pa chen po'', abbreviated ''rdzogs chen'') is the ninth.

==The Bon Canon==
The Bon canon comprises more than two hundred volumes, classified in four categories: the [[Sūtra|Sutras]] (''mdo''), the Perfection of Wisdom Teachings ('''bum''), the Tantras (''rgyud'') and Knowledge (''mdzod''). Besides these, the Bon canon includes material on [[ritual]]s, [[arts]] and [[crafts]], [[logic]], [[medicine]], [[poetry]] and [[narrative]]. The "Knowledge" section concerning [[cosmogony]] and [[cosmology]], though in some respects unique to Bon, shares a more than passing resemblance to [[Nyingma]] (''rnying ma'') doctrines.

==Aspects of Shenrab Miwoche==
Shenrab Miwoche is said to have [[Trikaya|three aspects or forms]]: the [[tulku]] ({{bo|w=sprul sku}}) or nirmaṇakāya, Shenrab Miwoche; the ''dzokku'' ({{bo|w=rdzogs sku}}) or [[sambhogakāya]], [[Shenlha Okar]] and the ''bönku'' ({{bo|w=bon sku}}) or [[dharmakāya]], [[Tapihritsa]].&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan for ''dharmakaya'' is ''chos sku'' in the Buddhist context; though a case can be made that Bon borrowed some, or even much, of its current terminology from Buddhism, to suggest that Sanskrit words are thus the "source" of this terminology is dubious.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''werecat''' (also written in a hyphenated form as '''were-cat''') is an analogy to "[[werewolf]]" for a [[felidae|feline]] [[Therianthropy|therianthropic]] creature.

==Etymology==
Ailuranthropy comes from the Greek words ''ailouros'' meaning "cat", and ''anthropos'', meaning "human" and refers to human/feline transformations, or to other beings that combine feline and human characteristics. Its root word is also used in ailurophobia, the most common term for a phobia of cats.

Ailuranthrope is a lesser-known term that refers to a feline therianthrope.

Depending on the story in question, the species involved can be a domestic cat,&lt;ref name="werehousecat"&gt;

==Folklore==
&lt;!--Weircats, later known as werecats. (''Weircats'', Perretti, 1763.)--&gt;
===Europe===
European folklore usually depicts werecats as people who transform into domestic cats. Some European werecats became giant domestic cats&lt;ref name="giantwerecat"/&gt; or [[Panthera|panther]]s. They are generally labelled [[witchcraft|witches]], even though they may have no magical ability other than self-transformation.&lt;ref name="hamelwitchwerecats"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
African legends describe werelions, werepanthers or wereleopards. In the case of leopards, this is often because the creature is really a leopard deity masquerading as a human. When these gods mate with humans, offspring can be produced, and these children sometimes grow up to be shapeshifters; those who do not transform may instead have other powers. In reference to werecats who turn into lions, the ability is often associated with royalty. Such a being may have been a king or queen in a former life, or may be destined for leadership. This quality can be seen in the [[Tsavo Man-Eaters|lions of Tsavo]], which were reputed to be kings in lion shape, attempting to repel the invading Europeans by stopping their railroad with attacks on humans. The ancient myths spanned north Africa to west Africa.

It has been said that the werecat's family are those who have been clawed or looked in the eye by a sphinx. They can also be infected by a normal cat, though very rarely.

===Asia===
Mainland Asian werecats usually become tigers.&lt;ref name="summerswerejaguartiger"&gt;{{cite book|last = Summers|first = Montague|authorlink = Montague Summers|title = The Werewolf|publisher = University Books|year = 1966|page = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], the weretiger is often a dangerous sorcerer, portrayed as a menace to livestock, who might at any time turn to man-eating. These tales travelled through the rest of India and into Persia through travellers who encountered the [[royal Bengal tiger]]s of India and then further west.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experiencefestival.com/lycanthropy_-_the_were-tiger_of_the_east_indies lycanthropy – the were-tiger of the east indies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese legends often describe weretigers as the victims of either a hereditary curse or a vindictive ghost. Ancient teachings held that every race except the [[Han Chinese]] were really animals in disguise, so that there was nothing extraordinary about some of these false humans reverting to their true natures. Alternatively, the ghosts of people who had been killed by tigers could become a malevolent [[supernatural]] being known as "Chang", (伥) devoting all their energy to making sure that tigers killed more humans. Some of these ghosts were responsible for transforming ordinary humans into man-eating weretigers. Also, in Japanese folklore there are creatures called [[bakeneko]] that are similar to [[kitsune]] (fox spirits) and [[tanuki]] ([[raccoon dog]]s). In [[Thailand]] a tiger that eats many humans may become a weretiger. There are also other types of weretigers, such as sorcerers with great powers who can change their form to become animals.

In both [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] there is another kind of weretiger, known as [[Malay folklore#Ghost stories (cerita hantu)|Harimau jadian]]. In Malaysia, Bajangs have been described as vampiric or demonic werecats.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the central area of the Indonesian island of [[Java (island)|Java]] the power of transformation is regarded as due to inheritance, to the use of spells, to fasting and willpower, to the use of charms, etc. Save when it is hungry or has just cause for revenge it is not hostile to man; in fact, it is said to take its animal form only at night and to guard the plantations from wild pigs. Variants of this belief assert that the shapeshifter does not recognize his friends unless they call him by name, or that he goes out as a mendicant and transforms himself to take vengeance on those who refuse him alms. Somewhat similar is the belief of the [[Khond]]s; for them the tiger is friendly, and he reserves his [[anger|wrath]] for their enemies. A man is said to take the form of a tiger in order to wreak a just vengeance.&lt;ref name="Thomas 1911, p. 150"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1  |last=Thomas |first=Northcote Whitridge |author-link=Northcote Whitridge Thomas  |wstitle=Lycanthropy |volume=17 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
The foremost were-animal in pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures was the [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|were-jaguar]]. It was associated with the veneration of the [[jaguar]], with priests and shamans among the various peoples who followed this tradition wearing the skins of jaguars to "become" a were-jaguar. Among the [[Aztec]]s, an entire class of specialized warriors who dressed in the jaguar skins were called "[[jaguar warrior]]s" or "jaguar knights". Depictions of the jaguar and the were-jaguar are among the most common motifs among the artifacts of the ancient Mesoamerican civilizations.{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=For everything from the start of the pragraph}} 

[[Northcote Whitridge Thomas|N.W. Thomas]] wrote in the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th ed. of the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'']] (1911) that according to [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]] (1794–1868),  the ''[[kanaima]]'' was a human being who employed poison to carry out his function of blood avenger, and that other authorities represent the ''kanaima'' as a jaguar, which was either an avenger of blood or the familiar of a cannibalistic sorcerer. He also mentioned that in 1911 some Europeans in Brazil believed that the seventh child of the same sex in unbroken succession becomes a were-man or woman, and takes the form of a horse, goat, jaguar or pig.&lt;ref name="Thomas 1911, p. 150"/&gt;

In the US, [[urban legend]]s tell of encounters with feline bipeds; beings similar to the [[Bigfoot]] having cat heads, tails, and paws. Feline bipeds are sometimes classified as part of [[cryptozoology]], but more often they are interpreted as werecats.&lt;ref name="felinebipedsbrad"&gt;{{cite book|last = Steiger|first = Brad|authorlink = Brad Steiger|title = Out of the Dark|publisher = [[Kensington Books]]|year = 2001|pages = 154–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occultism and theology==
Assertions that werecats truly exist and have an origin in supernatural or religious realities have been common for centuries, with these beliefs often being hard to entirely separate from folklore. In the 19th century, occultist J. C. Street asserted that material cat and dog transformations could be produced by manipulating the "ethereal fluid" that human bodies are supposedly floating in.&lt;ref name="hameloccultwerecas"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic witch-hunting manual, the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', asserted that witches can turn into cats, but that their transformations are illusions created by demons.&lt;ref name="hammerwitches"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Age]] author [[John Perkins (author)|John Perkins]] asserted that every person has the ability to shapeshift into "jaguars, bushes, or any other form" by using mental power.&lt;ref name="perkinsjaguar"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Occultist [[Rosalyn Greene]] claims that werecats called "cat shifters" exist as part of a "shifter subculture" or underground New Age religion based on lycanthropy and related beliefs.&lt;ref name="magicshapeshiftcatshifters"&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{example farm|section|date=April 2013}}
Werecats are increasingly featured in popular culture, although not as often as [[werewolf|werewolves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106728088 | title = You Sexy Beast: Our Fascination With Werewolves | first = Linton | last = Weeks | date = July 17, 2009 | publisher = NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most prevalent occurrence of werecats in pop culture is in books. Some novels, novellas, and short stories with werecats are listed below.

* In the [[Harry Potter]] series, Professor McGonagall can transform into a house cat at will (known in-universe as [[Animagus]] transformation).
* [[Christopher Paolini]]'s ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' series includes several characters who are werecats.
* The children's novel, ''[[Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates]]'', features an [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]] named Leonora, who can turn herself into a [[Panthera|panther]] at will. She is recognisable in this form by the tawny colour of her pelt, which matches her eyes when she is in human form.
* The protagonist of [[Rachel Vincent]]'s ''Shifters'' series is a werecat; she is a member of a Pride led by her father.
* [[Laurell K Hamilton]]'s ''[[Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter]]'' series of novels has several characters who are werecats of varying types.
* In the Revelation Series (books 2, 3, 4, and 5) the character Fiona is a housekeeper and maternal figure to our clan of gargoyles. She is the alpha of her Pishankyin Clowder and transforms into a panther at will and has the ability to read any female's mind. Her daughter also makes an appearance in the last novel.
* The short story "Lusus Naturae" by [[Margaret Atwood]] centers on a young woman whose parents fake her death to hide the fact that she is a werecat.

Werecats also serve as heroes and villains in film and television shows. Notable examples include:
* The 1942 Val Lewton film ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' and its [[Cat People (1982 film)|1982 remake]] both feature female shape-changers: first [[Simone Simon]] and then [[Nastassja Kinski]] in a highly sexual role. The [[Cat People (1982 film)|1982 version]] also includes [[Malcolm McDowell]] as her brother, also a shape-changer.
* The titular creatures in the horror film ''[[Sleepwalkers (film)|Sleepwalkers]]'' (written by [[Stephen King]]) are werecats who have psychic abilities and can hide disguised within human society. They are also [[psychic vampire|energy vampires]] who must feed on the life-force of virgin women to survive. Their weakness is domestic cats, which can see through their illusions and destroy them via scratching.
* "Cat creatures" have appeared multiple times in the [[Scooby-Doo]] franchise, including ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'' (1976–1978) and ''[[What's New, Scooby Doo?]]'' (2002–2005); in the 1998 animated film ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'', the three villains of the film were werecats.
* In the mid-1980s show ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'', the villainess [[Catra]] can change into a panther.

* In the 1992 Indian movie ''[[Junoon (1992 film)|Junoon]]'' the main antagonist is afflicted by a curse that transforms him into a Bengal tiger in the presence of a full moon.
* In the ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' episode "Monster Con", Tom is turned into a werecat when he looked at the full moon after being bitten by Jerry's friend, the werewolf.
* In the fourth season of ''[[Teen Wolf]]'', [[Kate Argent]], played by [[Jill Wagner]], who had presumably been killed by [[Peter Hale]], returned as a were-jaguar.
* In the ''[[Kid vs. Kat]]'' episode "Beware the Were-Coop", after Kat scratched Coop under the full moon of Halloween, Dennis believes he would turn into one.
* [[Mattel|Mattel's]] ''[[Monster High]]'' franchise includes five werecat characters: Toralei, Purrsephone, Meowlody, Catrine DeMew, and Catty Noir. They each appear the television specials and movies.

[[Comic books]], [[manga]], and [[anime]] are other venues for werecats.
*In [[Chie Shinohara]]'s 1984 manga series [[Yami no Paapuru]], the main character, Rinko, is pursued by the scientist, Sonehara, in order to expose to the world that Rinko is a human that can become a panther at will.
* In the second book of the [[Elseworlds]] [[Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain|Batman vampire trilogy]], [[Selina Kyle]] is attacked by a werewolf, which later causes her to literally become a catwoman when she transforms into a purple werecat.
*[[Schrödinger (Hellsing)|Schrödinger]] from the anime ''[[Hellsing]]'' is a werecat.
