}}The '''1892 Sack of Salaga''' was a [[Gonja people|Gonja]] civil war for the control of the town of [[Salaga]] that occurred on December 5, 1892. A rebellion led by [[Kabachewura Isifa]] and assisted by his Dagomba and Nanumba allies overthrew [[Kpembewura Napo]] who died in exile in the same year.

{{History of Yemen}}
The '''Aden Trade Union Congress''' (ATUC or TUC) was a trade union in the [[Aden Colony]], a [[British protectorate]] in [[Yemen]]. 
==History==
The ATUC was founded in 1956 during serious labour unrest in the area. Its organ was [[Al-'Amal (1957)]].

The Secretary General of the trade union was [[Abdullah Asnag]], a pro-independence [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] and admirer of [[Nasser]] who also advocated union with Yemen. Supported by the [[UAR]] the ATUC rose in importance when the political disturbances and the violence reached a head and political parties ceased to function. By 1959 it was the only entity representing nationalist aspirations in [[Aden]] and it used its leverage to boycott elections as the main grouping of the People's Union. In November 1960 the ATUC boycotted the Aden municipal elections.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Oron, Ed., ''Middle East Record'' Volume 1, 1960, pg. 385&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Aden Colony became part of the [[Federation of South Arabia]] as the [[State of Aden]] the unrest continued. In the federation the ATUC had a large influence in the new assembly and to prevent it seizing control of the federation in 1962 the former Colony of Aden had joined the Federation of South Arabia so that Aden's pro-British assembly members could counter the ATUC's influence.&lt;ref name= "Kitchen"&gt;Kitchen, Martin (1994). ''Empire and after: a short history of the British Empire and Commonwealth ''(1994 ed.) Centre for Distance Education, Simon Fraser University. {{ISBN|978-0-86491-142-1}} p. 126-27&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 30 November 1967 the State of Aden became part of the independent [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], also known as South Yemen, and the ATUC became the main trade union of that state. 

When South Yemen united with the [[Yemen Arab Republic]], also known as North Yemen, on 22 May 1990, the Aden Trade Union Congress merged with the [[General Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions]] in order to form the [[Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">The '''African National Party''' ({{lang-fr|Parti national africain}}, PNA) was a [[political party]] in [[Chad]]. PNA was founded on January 30, 1960, through the merger of remnants of four parties based in the Muslim-dominated northern Chad; [[African Socialist Movement]], [[Chadian Social Action]], [[Independent Democratic Union of Chad]] and [[Grouping of Rural and Independent Chadians]]. Initially, PNA held 25 seats in the National Assembly, but the party suffered from defections to the [[Chadian Progressive Party]], first the number of MPs went down to 17 and then to ten. In April 1961 PNA merged with the Chadian Progressive Party at a Unity Congress in [[Abéché]], forming the [[Union for the Progress of Chad]] (UPT).&lt;ref name="dec"&gt;Decalo, Samuel.

This alliance became short-lived, as PNA issued their own candidate lists for elections. In 1961, PNA leaders were arrested and in January 1962 the party was banned.&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, Michael. ''The Politics of Terrorism. Public administration and public policy''.

'''''Au jus''''' ({{IPA-fr|o ʒy|lang}}) is a [[French language|French]] culinary term meaning "with juice". It refers to meat dishes prepared or served together with a light [[gravy]], or broth, made from the juices given off by the meat as it is cooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |contribution=au jus, ''adj., adv.,'' and ''n.'' }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[French cuisine]], cooking ''au jus'' is a natural way to enhance the flavour of dishes, mainly chicken, [[veal]], and lamb. In [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]], the term is mostly used to refer to a light [[sauce]] for beef recipes, which may be served with the food or placed on the side for dipping.&lt;ref&gt;"Justin Quek: Passion &amp; Inspiration", Justin Quek with Tan Su-Lyn, Bon Vivant Publishing Pte Ltd, 2006, Page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients and preparation==
In order to prepare a natural ''jus'', the cook may simply skim off the fat from the juices left after cooking and bring the remaining meat stock and water to a boil. ''Jus'' can be frozen for six months or longer, but the flavor may suffer after this time.&lt;ref&gt;Labensky and Hause (1999), ''On Cooking'', Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

American recipes ''au jus'' often use [[soy sauce]], [[Worcestershire sauce]], [[edible salt|salt]], [[black pepper|pepper]], white or [[brown sugar]], [[garlic]], [[Onions (surname)|beets, carrots, onion]], or other ingredients to make something more like a [[gravy]]. The American ''jus'' is sometimes prepared separately, rather  than being produced naturally by the food being cooked. An example could be a beef ''jus'' made by reducing beef stock to a concentrated form, (also known as ''Glace de Viande'') to accompany a meat dish. It is typically served with the [[French dip sandwich]].

''Jus'' can also be made by extracting the juice from the original meat and combining it with another liquid e.g. red wine (thus forming a red wine ''jus'').

A powdered product described as ''jus'' is also sold, and is rubbed into the meat before cooking or added afterwards. Powdered forms generally use a combination of [[salt]], dried [[onion]], and sometimes [[sugar]] as primary flavoring agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Au Jus Mix|url=http://www.americanspice.com/catalog/20083/search/Au_Jus_Mix.html?SEARCH=3&amp;WORDS=Au%2Bjus%2Bmix%2Bingredients&amp;orig=30&amp;PAGE=0&amp;_ssess_=39a41c5c1f61c6791bc73af54c25f271|publisher=American Spice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misuse as noun==
In the United States, the phrase ''au jus'' is often misused as a noun, owing to its having been corrupted in culinary references into the noun form:&lt;ref name="Garner2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A. |title=The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_VmtjAU01YC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=2013-01-06|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513508-4|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a "sandwich au jus", the menu may read "sandwich with au jus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/bubbas-english/2009/11/dont_put_a_la_mode_on_your_apple_pie.html|title=Don't put a la mode on your apple pie|work=[[The Birmingham News|Al.com]]|date=November 1, 2009|accessdate=August 24, 2016|author=Owens, Gene}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/talk/2008/10/food-name-redundancies.html | title=Food Name Redundancies|work=[[Serious Eats]]|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bench Philippines is not affiliated with Bench UK as Bench Philippines is the original and was founded earlier than its British counterpart.

{{History of Wales}}
'''Cambro-Normans''' were [[Anglo-Normans]] who settled in [[South Wales|southern Wales]] after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066. Some Irish historians prefer to use this term instead of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] because many of the Anglo-Norman knights who invaded Ireland in 1170 originated in modern-day Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=John|author2=Francis X. Martin|title=Settlement and society in medieval Ireland: studies presented to F.X. Martin|publisher=Boethius Press|year=1988|series=Studies in Irish archaeology and history|volume=2 of Irish studies|pages=193|isbn=978-0-86314-143-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJRnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Cambro-Norman%22&amp;dq=%22Cambro-Norman%22|access-date=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is worth noting that south Wales was under English control at this point in history and the Anglo-Normans living in south Wales owed their allegiance to the king of England, not a native Welsh prince. Contemporary Irish accounts of this period simply called the incomers ''Saxain'', which means "Saxon", i.e. "English".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Flanagan |first=M.T. |contribution=Anglo-Norman Invasion |title=Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia |editor1-last=Duffy |editor1-first=S. |year=2005 |editor2-last=MacShamhráin |editor2-first=A. |editor3-last=Moynes |editor3-first=J. |publication-place=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-94052-4 |pages=17&amp;ndash;19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Cambro-Norman is rarely used even in Ireland. The Normans who invaded Ireland are commonly described as Anglo-Normans by modern historians or simply [[English people| English]].

[[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke| Richard de Clare]], better known as Strongbow, has been described by some Irish historians as a Cambro-Norman rather than an Anglo-Norman. The de Clares held lands in [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Glamorgan]], but their base was in Chepstow, which, although is now a border settlement in Wales, was part of the English county of [[Herefordshire]] at the time. Strongbow also held lands in [[Gloucestershire]], [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Suffolk]] and is believed to have retreated to his English holdings when the Welsh began to attack his territory in Netherwent. Strongbow was living in England when he was contacted by Diarmaid MacMurrough, the king of Leinster. 

In addition to such Cambro-Norman lords, some of Ireland's most common names, including Walsh and [[Griffith (surname)|Griffith]], came from indigenous Welsh families who came with the Norman invasion. (The surname "Walsh" itself, or in Irish ''Breathnach'', "Briton", means "Welshman", and was applied by the Irish to Welsh who didn't have a surname). Other indigenous Welsh surnames, such as [[Viscount Taaffe|Taaffe]] which came at this time, became very important families within [[the Pale]].

Probably the best known Cambro-Norman surname, also called [[Hiberno-Norman]], is [[Costello (surname)|Costello]] (see also [[Gilbert de Angulo]]). Other Cambro-Norman families include the [[Butler dynasty|Butlers]], the [[Joyce (name)|Joyce]]s&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Alan. 'Gentleman Rider: A Life of Joyce Cary'. Joseph, 1988.

In the religion of [[Haitian Vodou]], '''Captain Debas''' (also '''Debard''', '''Deebat''') is a [[loa]] of the [[ghede]].

According to "Secrets of voodoo"{{clarify|date=April 2014}} Captain Debas is part of the [[Rada loa|rada]] nation, not ghede, and should be served in rada rites rather than ghede rite.  Is a family loa and can be combined with any other loa of any nation who allows families. Originates from [[Africa]] and is originally from [[Vodoun]].

[[File:Corona Prusia-mj2.jpg|300px|thumb]]
The '''Crown of William II''', also known as the '''Hohenzollern Crown''', is the 1888 [[crown (headgear)|crown]] made for [[William II, German Emperor]], in his role as King of [[Prussia]]. It was only used for heraldic purposes. A [[German State Crown|Crown of the German Empire]] was never made.

==Design==
The crown is surmounted by a [[diamond]]-studded cross which rests on a large [[sapphire]].  These rest on eight half-arches rising from the base that are adorned with 142 rose-cut diamonds and 18 diamonds.  Eight large [[pearl]]s are mounted between the arches.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web| title=Regaling about Regalia| url=https://europeanroyalhistory.wordpress.com/tag/hohenzollern-crown/| publisher=European Royal History| date=25 July 2012| accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the establishment of the Republic==
When William [[abdicate]]d in 1918 he was permitted to retain the jewels, which included the Hohenzollern crown. To protect it from theft and destruction during [[World War II]], it was hidden in a wall in the crypt of a [[Church (building)|church]]. After the war it was returned to the [[Hohenzollern]] family and is now kept at the family residence of the [[Burg Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern Castle]].

The '''Grand Orient of the Netherlands''' or '''Grand East of the Netherlands''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Orde van Vrijmetselaren onder het Grootoosten der Nederlanden'') is a [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] [[Grand Lodge]] in the Netherlands.  It falls within the mainstream Anglo-American tradition of Freemasonry, being recognized by The [[United Grand Lodge of England]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugle.org.uk/provinces/olodges/euro.htm Foreign Grand Lodges Recognised by The United Grand Lodge of England - Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040221181010/http://www.ugle.org.uk/provinces/olodges/euro.htm |date=2004-02-21 }}  Accessed 10 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the 51 Grand Lodges in the United States.  In addition to its jurisdiction over nine districts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vrijmetselarij.nl/Organisatie/Regios/tabid/619/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in the Netherlands, it also administers three Lodges in Suriname through the Provincial Grand Lodge of Suriname,&lt;ref name="vrijmetselarij.nl"&gt;http://www.vrijmetselarij.nl/Organisatie/Provincialegrootloges/tabid/593/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; three lodges in [[Curaçao]], one in [[South Africa]], one in [[Thailand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vrijmetselarij.nl/Organisatie/Regios/BuitenNederland/tabid/1189/Default.aspx?regio=BN |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025154438/http://www.vrijmetselarij.nl/Organisatie/Regios/BuitenNederland/tabid/1189/Default.aspx?regio=BN |archivedate=2008-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Caribbean, three lodges in Aruba and one in St. Maarten.&lt;ref name="vrijmetselarij.nl"/&gt;  In the Netherlands it claims to have 145 lodges with 5,792 members.&lt;ref name="stichtingargus.nl"&gt;[http://www.stichtingargus.nl/vrijmetselarij/ovo_en.html Orde van Vrijmetselaren onder het Grootoosten der Nederlanden], English language version&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in either 1756&lt;ref name="stichtingargus.nl"/&gt; or 1757&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/europe_grand_lodges.html The Builder magazine], 1924&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic Grand Lodges under the Grand Orient==

The Grand Orient of the Netherlands used to have provincial Grand Lodges under its jurisdiction, including the Grand Lodge of South Africa and the Grand Lodge of the Transvaal.&lt;ref&gt;Africa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lU5e-E6wBeEC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;ots=v1fwrlJIsa&amp;dq=Grand+orient+of+the+Netherlands page 37], Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Part 1 By Albert G. Mackey&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the Lodges that was subservient to the Grand Lodge hosted the early legislative assemblies of the [[Cape Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewcusack.com/2009/11/03/die-parlementsgebou/ The Houses of Parliament, Cape Town], Andrew Cusack&lt;/ref&gt;  

Active [[Freemasonry in Indonesia|freemasonry]] existed throughout the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now: [[Indonesia]]). In 1922 a Dutch Provincial Grand Lodge, under the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, at Weltevreden ([[Jakarta|Batavia]]) controlled twenty Lodges in the colony: fourteen in [[Java]], three in [[Sumatra]] and others in [[Makassar]] and [[Salatiga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/mackeys_encyclopedia/j.htm Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Italian nationalism''' seeks to preserve and foster the [[national identity]] of [[Italy]]. The [[romantic nationalism|romantic (or soft)]] version of Italian nationalism is known as [[culture of Italy|Italian patriotism]]. The [[integral nationalism|integral (or hard)]] version of  Italian nationalism is known as [[Italian fascism]]. 

Italian nationalism traces [[Roman Italy|its origins]] to [[ancient Rome]] and the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Trafford R. Cole 1995. Pp. 15"&gt;Trafford R. Cole. ''Italian Genealogical Records: How to Use Italian Civil, Ecclesiastical &amp; Other Records in Family History Research''. Salt Lake City, Utah, USA: Ancestry Incorporated, 1995. Pp. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian nationalism first arose as a potent political force in the 1830s in the Italian peninsula under the leadership of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]].&lt;ref&gt;J. P. T. Bury, ed. ''The new Cambridge modern history: The zenith of European power 1830–70'' 1964. Pp. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; It served as a cause for ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' in the 1860s to 1870s. Italian nationalism became strong again in [[World War I]] with [[Italian irredentism|Italian irredentist]] claims to territories held by [[Austria-Hungary]], and during the era of [[Italian Fascism]].

===Renaissance to 19th century===
[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]]]
The origins of Italian nationalism have been traced to [[the Renaissance]] where Italy led a European revival of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] style of culture, philosophy, and art.&lt;ref name="Trafford R. Cole 1995. Pp. 15"/&gt; Renaissance-era diplomat and political theorist [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] in his work ''[[The Prince]]'' (1532) appealed to Italian patriotism urging Italians "to seize Italy and free her from the [[Barbarian]]s", the "Barbarians" he referred to were foreign powers occupying the Italian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Mikael Hörnqvist. Machiavelli and Empire. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. Pp. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

When France started to annex [[Corsica]] in the 18th century (and then incorporated during [[Napoleon]]'s empire the regions of [[Piemonte]], [[Liguria]], [[Toscana]] and [[Lazio]]), the first movements to defend Italy's existence aroused with [[Pasquale Paoli|Paoli]] revolt and were later followed by the birth of the so-called "irredentism".
[[File:Pascal Paoli01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to [[Pasquale Paoli]], the Corsican hero who made Italian the official language of his Corsican Republic in 1755]]
 
Paoli was sympathetic to [[Italian culture]] and regarded his own native language as an Italian dialect (Corsican is an [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian tongue]] closely related to [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]). He was considered by [[Niccolò Tommaseo]], who collected his ''Lettere'' (Letters), as one of the precursors of the [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentism]]. The so-called ''Babbu di a Patria'' ("Father of the fatherland"), as Pasquale Paoli was nicknamed by the [[Corsican Italians]], wrote in his Letters&lt;ref&gt;N. Tommaseo. "Lettere di Pasquale de Paoli" (in Archivio storico italiano, 1st series, vol. XI).&lt;/ref&gt; the following appeal in 1768 against the French:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''We are Corsicans by birth and sentiment, but first of all we feel Italian by language, origins, customs, traditions; and Italians are all brothers and united in the face of history and in the face of God ... As Corsicans we wish to be neither slaves nor "rebels" and as Italians we have the right to deal as equals with the other Italian brothers ... Either we shall be free or we shall be nothing... Either we shall win or we shall die (against the French), weapons in hand ... The war against France is right and holy as the name of God is holy and right, and here on our mountains will appear for Italy the sun of liberty....''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1830s to 1848===
[[File:Giuseppe Mazzini.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]]]]
The initial important figure in the development of Italian nationalism was Giuseppe Mazzini, who became a nationalist in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="Vincent P. Pecora 2001. Pp. 156"&gt;Vincent P. Pecora. ''Nations and identities: classic readings''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, USA: Blackwell Publishers, Inc, 2001. Pp. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; In his political career, Mazzini held as objectives the liberation of Italy from the Austrian occupation, indirect control by Austria, princely despotism, aristocratic privilege, and clerical authority.&lt;ref name="John Gooch 2001. Pp. 5"&gt;John Gooch. ''The Unification of Italy''. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library, 2001. Pp. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Mazzini was captivated by [[ancient Rome]] that he considered the "temple of [[human]]ity" and sought to establish a united Italy as a "[[Third Rome]]" that emphasized Roman spiritual values that Italian nationalists claimed were preserved by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2003. Pp. 17"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. 2nd edition. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2003. Pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Mazzini and Italian nationalists in general promoted the concept of ''[[Romanità]]'' (the Roman-ness), which claimed that Roman culture made invaluable contributions to the Italian and [[Western world|Western]] [[civilization]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2003. Pp. 17"/&gt; Since the 1820s, Mazzini supported a revolution to create a utopia of an ideal Italian [[republic]] based in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Vincent P. Pecora 2001. Pp. 156"/&gt; Mazzini formed revolutionary patriotic [[Young Italy]] society in 1832.&lt;ref name="John Gooch 2001. Pp. 5"/&gt; Upon Young Italy breaking apart in the 1830s, Mazzini reconstituted it in 1839 with the intention to gain the support of workers' groups.&lt;ref name="John Gooch 2001. Pp. 5"/&gt; However, at the time Mazzini was hostile to [[socialism]] due to his belief that all classes needed to be united in the cause of creating a united Italy rather than divided against each other.&lt;ref name="John Gooch 2001. Pp. 6"&gt;John Gooch. ''The Unification of Italy''. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library, 2001. Pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi portrait2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the prominent Italian nationalist leader during the [[Risorgimento]].]]
[[Vincenzo Gioberti]] in 1843 in his book ''On the Civil and Moral Primacy of the Italians'', advocated a federal state of Italy led by the [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber. ''The European revolutions, 1848-1851''. Second Edition. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 2005. Pp. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Camillo Benso]], the future Prime Minister of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and afterwards the Kingdom of Italy, worked as an editor for the nationalist Italian newspaper ''Il Risorgimento'' in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Lucy Riall 1994. Pp. 69"&gt;Lucy Riall. ''The Italian Risorgimento: State, society and national unification''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 1994. Pp. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavour was a clear example of [[civic nationalism]] with a high consideration for values including [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]] compatible with a sober nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/nazionalismo_(Enciclopedia_delle_scienze_sociali) Nationalism (Cavour)]. treccani.it/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic nationalism]] influenced businessmen and government authorities to promote a united Italy.&lt;ref name="John Gooch 2001. Pp. 6"/&gt; Prior to unification, tariff walls held between the Italian states and the disorganized railway system prevented economic development of the peninsula.&lt;ref name="John Gooch 2001. Pp. 6"/&gt; Prior to the revolutions of 1848, [[Carlo Cattaneo]] advocated an economic federation of Italy.&lt;ref name="Lucy Riall 1994. Pp. 69"/&gt;

===Revolutions of 1848 to ''Risorgimento'' (1859 to 1870)===
[[File:Daniele Manin.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Daniele Manin]], founder of the [[Italian National Society]].]]
Supporters of Italian nationalism ranged from across the political spectrum: it appealed to both [[Conservatism|conservatives]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;J. P. T. Bury. The new Cambridge modern history: The zenith of European power 1830–70. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 1964. Pp. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The Revolutions of 1848 resulted in a major development of the Italian nationalist movement. Liberalization of press laws in [[Piedmont]] allowed nationalist activity to flourish.&lt;ref name="Lucy Riall 1994. Pp. 69"/&gt;

Following the Revolutions of 1848 and the liberalization of press laws, the Italian nationalist organization, called the [[Italian National Society]], was created in 1857 by [[Daniele Manin]] and [[Giorgio Pallevicino]].&lt;ref name="Lucy Riall 1994. Pp. 69"/&gt; The National Society was created to promote and spread nationalism to political moderates in Piedmont and raised money, held public meetings, and produced newspapers.&lt;ref name="Lucy Riall 1994. Pp. 69"/&gt; The National Society helped to establish a base for Italian nationalism amongst the educated [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="Lucy Riall 1994. Pp. 69"/&gt; By 1860, the National Society influenced dominant liberal circles in Italy and won over middle class support for the union of Piedmont and [[Lombardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Riall. ''The Italian Risorgimento: State, society and national unification''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 1994. Pp. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statesman [[Daniele Manin]] seems to have believed in Italian unification years before [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour|Camillo Benso of Cavour]], who actually unified the country with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] through diplomatic and military actions. During the 1856 [[Congress of Paris]], Manin talked with Cavour about several plans and strategies to achieve the [[unification of Italy]]; Cavour clearly considered those plans vain things, and after the meeting wrote that Manin had talked about "''l'unità d'Italia ed altre corbellerie''" ("the unity of Italy and other nonsense").&lt;ref&gt;Holt, ''The Making of Italy: 1815–1870'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Risorgimento was an ideological movement that helped incite the feelings of brotherhood and nationalism in the imagined Italian community, which called for the unification of Italy and the pushing out of foreign powers. Literature, music, and other outlets of expression frequently alluded back to the glorious past of Rome and the miraculous feats their ancestors had accomplished in defending their homeland and kicking out the foreign occupants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/event/Risorgimento ''Risorgimento'', Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Post-''Risorgimento'', World War I and aftermath (1870 to 1922)===
[[File:Francesco Crispi crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Francesco Crispi]]]]
After the unification of Italy was completed in 1870, the Italian government faced domestic political paralysis and internal tensions, resulting in it resorting to embarking on a colonial policy to divert the Italian public's attention from internal issues.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}}

In these years, one of the most prominent political figures was [[Francesco Crispi]], whose actions as prime minister were characterised by a nationalism that often appeared as a form of obsession for the national unity and defence from hostile foreign countries.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-82803451.html Nation-building in 19th-century Italy: the case of Francesco Crispi], Christopher Duggan, History Today, February 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Italy managed to colonize the East African coast of [[Eritrea]] and [[Somalia]], but failed to conquer [[Ethiopia]] with 15,000 Italians dying in the war and being forced to retreat.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}} Then, Italy waged war with the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1911 to 1912 and gained [[Libya]] and the [[Dodecanese Islands]] from Turkey.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}} However, these attempts to gain popular support from the public failed, and rebellions and violent protests became so intense that many observers believed that the young Kingdom of Italy would not survive.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}}

Tired of the internal conflicts in Italy, a movement of bourgeois intellectuals led by [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], [[Gaetano Mosca]], and [[Vilfredo Pareto]] declared war on the parliamentary system, and their position gained respect among Italians.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}} D'Annunzio called upon young Italians to seek fulfillment in violent action and put an end to the politically maneuvering parliamentary government.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}} The [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (''ANI'') was founded in [[Florence]] in 1910 by the jingoist nationalist [[Enrico Corradini]] who emphasized the need for martial heroism, of total sacrifice of individualism and equality to one's nation, the need of discipline and obedience in society, the grandeur and power of ancient Rome, and the need for people to live dangerously.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}} Corradini's ANI's extremist appeals were enthusiastically supported by many Italians.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}}
[[File:Gabriele D'Anunnzio.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]]]
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Italy initially maintained neutrality, despite its official alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary since 1882 on the grounds that Germany and Austria-Hungary were waging an aggressive war that it refused to take part in.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}} In 1915, Italy eventually decided to enter the war on the British and French side against Austria-Hungary and Germany.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}}

Nationalist pride soared in Italy after the end of hostilities in November 1918, with the victory of Italy and Allied forces over Austria-Hungary and the seizure by Italy of former Austro-Hungarian territories. Italian nationalism became a major force at both elite and popular levels until 1945, when popular democracy became a much more important force.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Salvadori, "Nationalism in Modern Italy-1915 and after." ''Orbis-A Journal of World Affairs'' 10.4 (1967): 1157-1175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freemasonry]] was an influential semi-secret force in Italian politics with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, as well as among the leadership in parliament, public administration, and the army. The two main organisation were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had 25,000 members in 500 or more lodges. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, public opinion. and the leading political parties in support of Italy’s joining the Allies. traditionally, Italian nationalism focused on unification, and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. In 1914-15 they dropped the traditional pacifistic rhetoric and used instead the powerful language of [[Italian nationalism]]. Freemasonry had always promoted cosmopolitan universal values, and by 1917 onwards they demanded a [[League of Nations]] to promote a new post-war universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations.&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio Conti, "From Universalism to Nationalism: Italian Freemasonry and the Great War." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 20.5 (2015): 640-662.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Italy's demands in the Paris peace settlement of 1919 were not fully achieved: Italy did attain Trentino, Trieste, the Istrian peninsula, and South Tyrol from Austria-Hungary, though other territories previously promised to Italy were not given to it.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=248}}
[[File:Mussolini biografia.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Benito Mussolini]]]]
In particular, Italian nationalists were enraged by the Allies denying Italy the right to annex [[Fiume]], that had a slight majority Italian population but was not included in Italy's demands agreed with the Allies in 1915, and a larger part of [[Dalmatia]] which had a vast majority Slavic population and an Italian minority, claiming that Italian annexation of large part of Dalmatia would violate [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds Mathewson Salerno 1940. Pp. 4"&gt;Reynolds Mathewson Salerno. Vital crossroads: Mediterranean origins of the Second World War, 1935-1940. Ithaca, New York, USA: Cornell University Press, 2002. Pp. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Annunzio responded to this by mobilizing two thousand veterans of the war who seized Fiume by force; this action was met with international condemnation of d'Annunzio's actions but was supported by a majority of Italians.&lt;ref name="Reynolds Mathewson Salerno 1940. Pp. 4"/&gt; Though d'Annunzio's government in Fiume was forced from power, Italy annexed Fiume a few years later.&lt;ref name="Reynolds Mathewson Salerno 1940. Pp. 4"/&gt;

===Fascism and World War II (1922 to 1945)===
The seizure of power by the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]] as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] in 1922 and his development of a [[Fascism|fascist]] totalitarian state in Italy involved appeal to Italian nationalism, advocating a Roman-like [[Italian Empire]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds Mathewson Salerno 1940. Pp. 4"/&gt; Mussolini sought to build closer relations with Germany and the United Kingdom while showing hostility towards France and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds Mathewson Salerno. Vital crossroads: Mediterranean origins of the Second World War, 1935-1940. Ithaca, New York, USA: Cornell University Press, 2002. Pp. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post–World War II and current situation===
[[File:Ciampi ritratto.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]]]]
After the fall of Fascism and following the birth of the [[Italian Republic|Republic]], the interest in Italian nationalism by scholars, politicians and the masses was relatively low, mainly because of its close relation with Fascism and consequently with bad memories of [[World War II]]. The only notable and active political party who clearly declared Italian nationalism as its main ideology was the [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] [[Italian Social Movement]] (''MSI''), which became the fourth largest party in Italy by the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=sea&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8k4rEPvq_8C&amp;dq=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of modern worldwide extremists and extremist groups|first=Stephen E.|last=Atkins|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=151–152|isbn=978-0-313-32485-7|chapter=Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano) (MSI) (Italy)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these years, Italian nationalism was considered an ideology linked to right-wing political parties and organisations. Nevertheless, two significant events seemed to revitalise Italian nationalism among [[Italians]], the first one in 1953 with the [[Free Territory of Trieste|Question of Trieste]] when the claim of Italy on the full control of the city of [[Trieste]] was largely endorsed by most of the Italian society with patriotic demonstrations,&lt;ref&gt;PIGLIUCCI M., ''Gli ultimi martiri del Risorgimento. Gli incidenti per Trieste italiana del novembre 1953'', Ed. Mosetti, Trieste 2013. {{ISBN|978-88-9026-741-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second one in 1985 during the [[Bettino Craxi#The Sigonella crisis|Sigonella crisis]] between Italy and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/online/esteri/abbas/sigonella/sigonella.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Firenze, serata tricolore, palazzo vecchio 02.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] during the celebrations of the ''150th Anniversary of Italian Unification''.]]
In the 2000s, Italian nationalism seemed to gain a moderate support by the society, in particular during important days such as the [[National Day]] [[Festa della Repubblica]] (Republic day) and the [[Liberation Day (Italy)|Anniversary of the Liberation]]. The [[President of Italy|President of the Republic]] [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] has often praised patriotism among [[Italians]] by mentioning in his speeches national events, including the [[Risorgimento]] or the [[Resistenza]], and national symbols like the [[Flag of Italy]] and the [[Il Canto degli Italiani|National Anthem]], although he seems to want to stress self-confidence rather than plain nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2008/07/sezioni/politica/giustizia-8/ciampi-bossi/ciampi-bossi.html Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]. La Repubblica.it&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Italian unification#Anniversary of Risorgimento|150th Anniversary of Italian Unification]] showed a moderately renewed interest in Italian nationalism among the society.&lt;ref name="150th Anniversary"&gt;http://www.italia150.it/150-Anniversario&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist ideologies are often present during Italian anti-globalisation protests. Today, Italian nationalism is still mainly supported by right-wing political parties like [[Brothers of Italy]] and minor far-right political parties like [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]], [[CasaPound]], [[Forza Nuova]] and [[Tricolour Flame]]. Nonetheless, in recent times Italian nationalism has been occasionally embraced as a form of [[banal nationalism]] by [[Liberalism|liberal]] parties like [[Forza Italia]], centrist parties like the [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre]] or even by centre-left parties like the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Miklós Sukosd, Karol Jakubovicz (2011).

Place and Politics in Modern Italy .1st .Chicago :The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian nationalism has also faced a great deal of opposition from within Italy itself. [[Regionalism (politics)|Regionalism]] and municipal identities have challenged the concept of a unified Italian identity, like those in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Naples]], [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]] and [[Veneto]].&lt;ref name="Peter Wagstaff 1999"&gt;Peter Wagstaff. ''Regionalism in the European Union''. Intellect Books, 1999. P; 141&lt;/ref&gt; Such regional identities evoked strong opposition after the Piedmontese-led unification of Italy to plans for "Piedmontization" of Italy.&lt;ref name="Peter Wagstaff 1999"/&gt; Italian identity has also been long strained by an ever growing North-South divide that developed partly from the economic differences of a highly industrialized North and a highly agricultural South.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Tambini. ''Nationalism in Italian Politics: The Stories of the Northern League, 1980-2000''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. P. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"L'amore è un attimo"''' ("Love is a moment") was the [[Italy|Italian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971]], performed in [[Italian language|Italian]] by [[Massimo Ranieri]].

The song is a ballad, in which Ranieri attempts to write a letter to his lover ending their relationship. He repeats the phrase "You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born" and also tells her that "life is a storm, stronger than us" in his attempts to rationalise the breakup. It appears that he is as despondent about the end of the relationship as he believes she will be, but no reason for it is offered.

The song was performed eleventh on the night (following [[Belgium]]'s [[Jacques Raymond]] &amp; [[Lily Castel]] with [[Goeiemorgen, morgen]] and preceding [[Sweden]]'s [[Family Four]] with [[Vita vidder]]). At the close of voting, it had received 91 points, placing 5th in a field of 18.

It was succeeded as [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest|Italian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972 Contest]] by [[Nicola di Bari]] with "[[I giorni dell'arcobaleno]]".

Also, this was the first year that the ESC decided to have preview videos promoting the songs competing in the contest. Apparently, Massimo's video was filmed in color, but the location of the shoot is pretty sketchy, since the Italian TV network, RAI didn't convert to color TV until 1977. Plus Massimo's appearance looks a lot different from his appearance at the ESC. Apparently the song and preview video were both recorded in 1970. In the video, he demonstrates all of his emotions in the song very well.

In conclusion, it was rumored that he was favored to win the contest, since he was asked to record the song in Spanish, French, German and English. However, only the French and Spanish versions have been heard.

[[File:Pollack Mihaly ter 5.jpg|thumb|right|216px|The headquarters of the Hungarian Radio in [[Budapest]]]]
'''Magyar Rádió''' ('''MR''', ''The Hungarian Radio Corporation'', also known internationally as ''Radio Budapest'') is [[Hungary]]'s publicly funded radio broadcasting organization. It is also the country's official [[international broadcasting]] station.

MR is managed and primarily funded by the [[MTVA (Hungary)|Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund]] ({{lang-hu|Médiaszolgáltatás-támogató és Vagyonkezelő Alap}}, abbreviated MTVA).&lt;ref name=ceu.hu&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Law in Hungary|url=http://medialaws.ceu.hu/public_service_media_more.html|publisher=Center for Media and Communication Studies (CMCS)|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[government agency|government organization]], formed in 2011, also manages the public service broadcasters [[Magyar Televízió]] and [[Duna TV|Duna Televízió]] as well as the Hungarian [[news agency]] [[Magyar Távirati Iroda]].&lt;ref name=mtva.hu&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT MTVA - MTVA|url=http://mtva.info/|publisher=Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA)|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825023339/http://mtva.info/|archivedate=25 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2015, Magyar Rádió as well as the three other public media organizations managed by the MTVA were merged into a single organization called [[Duna Media Service]] ({{lang-hu|Duna Médiaszolgáltató}}).&lt;ref name="MTVA/Duna Media Service Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian public service media companies merge - MTVA|url=http://media-akademia.hu/mtva-press-news/212-hungarian-public-service-media-companies-merge|publisher=Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA)|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222144948/http://media-akademia.hu/mtva-press-news/212-hungarian-public-service-media-companies-merge|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization is the legal successor to Magyar Rádió and is an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].&lt;ref name="Duna Media Service"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polyák|first1=Gábor|title=Hungary : New Amendment to the Media Act|journal=IRIS Legal Observations of the European Audiovisual Observatory|date=2015|issue=2|url=http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2015/2/article22.en.html|accessdate=23 August 2015|publisher=European Audiovisual Observatory|location=Strasbourg, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ebu.ch&gt;{{cite web|title=EBU - Active Members|url=http://www3.ebu.ch/members|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domestic networks ==
With its headquarters in [[Budapest]] and several regional offices around the country, MR is responsible for [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]] throughout the [[Hungarian Republic]]. As well as maintaining nine regional studios, the corporation produces three nationwide [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] radio channels (''Kossuth'', ''Petőfi'', and ''Bartók'') covering the full range of public-service radio provision, and a fourth channel (''MR4'') aimed at the country's linguistic minorities.

===Kossuth Rádió===

{{main|Kossuth Rádió}}
Named after [[Lajos Kossuth]], the channel is the official radio station of [[Hungary]]. It is the flagship channel of the Hungarian Radio. Created in 1925, the station has over 3 million listeners per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=127 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825141744/http://www.radio.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=127 |archivedate=2010-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily broadcasts news, including interviews, discussions, reports and other speech-based programmes.

=== Petőfi Rádió ===

Named after the poet [[Sándor Petőfi]], the station is aimed at the younger generation and broadcasts [[pop music]].

=== Bartók Rádió ===

Named after the composer [[Béla Bartók]], this is a dedicated classical music station. It hosts high culture talk programmes in addition to orchestral and opera music. Supposedly, only a few thousand people listen to this station and proposals to terminate Rádió Bartók have been made several times, but never enacted.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

=== Nemzetiségi Adások ===

This radio channel airs programmes in languages of national minorities of Hungary.

=== Parlamenti Adások ===

Parliamentarian broadcasts.

=== Dankó Rádió ===
Named after [[Pista Dankó]], this radio station airs regional content throughout Hungary, plays folk music and broadcasts [[operetta]] shows. It is available round the clock on the internet and FM. Also it broadcasts via [[medium frequency|mediumwave]] on weekdays from 4:30am to 9:05pm and on weekends from 5:00am to 9:05pm. Then the station's frequencies are handed over to [[Kossuth Rádió]] for the rest of the night.

== History and profile ==
Ever since its foundation, the Hungarian Radio P.L.C. has been a "citadel" of domestic information, and cultural life. Since December 1, 1925, the institution has had a decisive role in forming the Hungarian public opinion, and general taste.

It is true in spite of the fact that regular television broadcasts were launched in [[Hungary]] in 1958. Forty years later, in 1998, the dual media system was formed. Owing to that a regular competition started between the different mass media channels. Since commercial television and radio stations flooded the market primarily with entertainment industry products, the value-centered approach and program structure of the public service radio makes it, if possible, even more important to preserve its culture creating and broadcasting functions.

Hungarian Radio is a partner to the domestic audience and a link with the Hungarians over the borders, a chance for them to retain their national identity. Hungarian Radio could use the slogan often heard in radio commercials: "From clear source only". The buildings and studios of the Radio are located in [[Budapest]], in the block between Bródy Sándor Street and Pollack Mihály Square. There are also two beautiful palaces in this area, one of them was owned earlier by the Eszterházy’s and the other one by the Károlyi family. The construction of Studio No. 6, the big orchestra studio, is linked with [[Georg von Békésy]]’s name, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his acoustic researches in 1961.

On July 1, 2007 Radio Budapest cancelled the programming in foreign languages.

The main theatrical director of Magyar Rádió is [[Otto Solymosi]].

==In popular culture==
In 1974, [[Locomotiv GT]]'s  [[Locomotiv GT (UK and US release)|Locomotiv GT (Dunhill Records 811)]] was released with the slogan "Radio Budapest Loves You !"

The PAG was led by Joseph Triay, a former member of the "''[[Doves (Gibraltar)|Doves]]''" in the 1960s and independent candidate in [[Elections in Gibraltar#1976 election|1976 election]].

The '''Peace Implementation Council''' ('''PIC''') is an international body charged with implementing the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]] for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  The Council was established at an implementation conference held in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] on December 8 and 9, 1995, subsequent to the completion of the negotiations of the accord the preceding month.&lt;ref&gt;For details see United Security Council, document symbol: S/1995/1029&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council is, in effect, the realization, through the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]], of the international community's governance of Bosnia and Herzegovina after signature of the Dayton Agreement. This international control over Bosnia and Herzegovina is to last until the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustainable. 

The PIC comprises 55 countries and agencies that support the peace process in many different ways - by assisting it financially, providing troops for [[SFOR]], or directly running operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is also a fluctuating number of observers.

Since the London conference, the PIC has come together at the ministerial level another six times to review progress and define the goals of peace implementation for the coming period: in June 1996 in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]; in December 1996 for a second time in London; in December 1997 in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]; in December 1998 in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], in May 2000 and February 2007 in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. 

The PIC clarifies the responsibilities of the High Representative as the main implementing body of the civilian part of the Dayton Agreement, as set out in Annex 10 the Dayton Agreement. For example, the 1997 Bonn session provided the Office of the High Representative with the so-called "Bonn authority" to dismiss elected and non-elected officials who obstruct the implementation of the Dayton Agreement. The High Representative from 2006-2007, [[Christian Schwarz-Schilling]], used this power sparingly, to promote confidence in elected domestic government. This strategy was reversed by the new appointee to that post, [[Miroslav Lajčák]], who imposed several decisions on his first day at work.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Steering Board==
The London peace implementation conference established the '''Steering Board of the PIC''' to work under the chairmanship of the High Representative as the executive arm of the PIC.

The Steering Board members are [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], United Kingdom, [[United States]], Presidency of the [[European Union]], [[European Commission]], and [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], represented by [[Turkey]].

The Steering Board provides the High Representative with political guidance. In [[Sarajevo]], the High Representative chairs bi-weekly meetings of the Ambassadors to BiH of the Steering Board members. In addition, the Steering Board meets at the level of political directors every six months.

The '''[[Central African Republic]]''' has been issuing stamps since 1959. Before this, it was called  [[Ubangi-Shari]].&lt;ref name="Gibbons"&gt;{{cite book|title=Stamps of the World|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|date=2004|page=603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20170805000732/http://www.stampworldhistory.com:80/country-profiles-2/africa/central-african-republic/ Retrieved 12 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ubangi-Shari became an autonomous state within the [[French Community]] and was renamed the Central African Republic on 1 December 1958. The Republic became fully independent on 13 August 1960. 

From December 4, 1976 to 1979, the country was renamed the [[Central African Empire]] when President [[Bokassa]] crowned himself emperor. It issued stamps labelled ''Empire Centrafricaine'' in 1977.&lt;ref name="Gibbons"/&gt;

In 1979 the name of the country was restored to the Central African Republic.

'''Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership''' ('''RCEP''') is a proposed [[Free Trade Agreement|free trade agreement]] (FTA) between the ten member states of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) ([[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]]) and the six Asia-Pacific states with which ASEAN has existing free trade agreements ([[Australia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[New Zealand]]). It is reported that a broad agreement is likely to be reached in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2162395/japans-relations-china-back-normal-track-says-shinzo-abe|title=US trade war and Japan push raise prospects for China-backed Asia free-trade deal|author=South China Morning Post|date=Sep 3, 2018|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RCEP negotiations were formally launched in November 2012 at the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia.&lt;ref name=Challenges&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsis.edu.sg/publications/Perspective/RSIS1402013.pdf|title=RCEP: Challenges and Opportunities for India, 25 July 2013, RSIS, Singapore|author=|date=|website=rsis.edu.sg|access-date=24 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233448/http://www.rsis.edu.sg/publications/Perspective/RSIS1402013.pdf#|archive-date=30 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The free trade agreement is scheduled and expected to be signed in November 2018 during the ASEAN Summit and Related Summit in Singapore, after the first RCEP summit was held on 14 November 2017 in [[Manila]], Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RCEP likely to be signed in November 2018: PM|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/11/15/rcep-likely-be-signed-november-2018-pm|work=www.thesundaily.my|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCEP is viewed as an alternative to the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP), a proposed trade agreement which includes several Asian and American nations but excludes China and India.&lt;ref name=TPP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/14/tpp-deal-pressures-rcep-trade-talks-in-busan-china-keen-for-progress.html|title=RCEP: The next trade deal you need to know about|first=See Kit|last=Tang|date=14 October 2015|website=cnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, prospective RCEP member states accounted for a population of 3.4 billion people with a total [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP, PPP) of $49.5 trillion, approximately 39 percent of the world's GDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/07/rcep-talks-speed-up-amid-tpp-failure.html |title=RCEP talks speed up amid TPP failure |author=Stefani Ribka/Linda Yulisman |date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the combined GDPs of China and India making up more than half that amount.

RCEP is the world's largest [[Trade bloc|economic bloc]], covering nearly half of the global economy.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Najib: RCEP likely to be signed in Nov 2018|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/najib-rcep-likely-to-be-signed-in-nov-2018#kLhIUr0450ITuVJx.97|date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of countries by past and projected GDP (PPP)#Long term GDP estimates|According to estimates by PwC]], the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP, PPP) of RCEP member states is likely to amount to nearly $250 trillion by 2050, or a quarter of a [[quadrillion]] dollars, with the combined GDPs of China and India making up more than 75% of the amount. RCEP's share of the global economy could account for half of the estimated $0.5 quadrillion global GDP (PPP) by 2050.

Continued growth, particularly in [[China]], [[India]] and [[Indonesia]] could see total GDP in RCEP grow to over $100 trillion by 2050, roughly double the project size of TPP economies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eaber.org/node/25601|title=Understanding and applying long-term GDP projections {{!}} EABER|website=www.eaber.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Satmex''' ('''Satélites Mexicanos''') was a company set up in [[Mexico]] in the mid-1990s through 2014 that operated space [[communication satellite]]s that provide services to the Americas.

In 2014, it was acquired by [[Eutelsat]], and Eutelsat now operates the three satellites formerly operated by Satmex.

==History==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}&lt;!-- who formed the company?  how was the venture funded? for what stated purpose at the time of formation?  what was the role of the government of Mexico in the formation? --&gt;
SATMEX existed as a company from approximately 1997 until 2014, when it was [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquired]] by [[Eutelsat]].  At the time of the acquisition in 2014, SATMEX had three operating satellites prior to the sale to Eutelsat: [[Satmex 8]], [[Satmex 6]], [[Satmex 5]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}	
The three [[commsat|communication satellites]] provide local, regional and continental coverage in [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and {{Ku band}}.

===Timeline===
{{Prose|section|date=March 2015}}
&lt;!-- much of this timeline appears to be about Mexican government bureaus that preceded Satmex, the company;  as well, most of it appears to be a [[WP:COPYVIO]] and needs a LOT of cleanup. --&gt;

Eutelsat 115 West B (former SATMEX 7) was ordered by Satmex but after the acquisition by Eutelsat was renamed. It was built on [[Boeing 702SP]] [[satellite bus]] that was launched in a pair with the similar ABS 3A satellite. The first pair was launched on [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9 v1.1|Falcon 9]] launch vehicle on March 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krebs|first=Gunter|title=Satmex 7|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/satmex-7-2.htm |accessdate=2014-05-10 |newspaper=Gunter's Space Page|date=2012-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krebs|first=Gunter|title=Satmex 9|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/satmex-9.htm|accessdate=2014-05-10|newspaper=Gunter's Space Page|date=2014-05-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530015529/http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/satmex-9.htm|archivedate=2014-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 7 Satmex was renamed Eutelsat Americas.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

On January 2 [[Eutelsat|Eutelsat Communications]] announced closure of the transaction to acquire 100% of the share capital of Satélites Mexicanos, S.A. de C.V. (“Satmex”) having obtained all required government and regulatory approvals. As previously communicated, the transaction amounts to 831 million$.

==Ground infrastructure==
SATMEX has two different types of Control Centers. The ''Satellite Control Centers'' are responsible for the operation of Satmex's satellite fleet, and they are located in [[Mexico City]] and in [[Hermosillo]], [[Sonora]].

The ''Communications Control Centers (CCC)'' monitor the signals sent through Satmex's satellites and verify that users are operating within the assigned parameters. Satmex has Communications Control Centers in its corporate offices and in the both Satellite Control Centers.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Early life==
Krak was born in Copenhagen to navigator Hans Andersen Krak (1789–1844) and Karen Sophie Lind (1800–77). His last name comes from his ancestors estate Krakkegården on the island of [[Bornholm]]. Thorvald Krak used the spelling "Krack" until 1890 as a result of an error in the church records. He went to school in [[Maribo]] and later received a military education in Copenhagen where he became a lieutenant in the engineering troops in 1850 and a [[senior lieutenant]] in 1853.

==Work for Copenhagen Municipality==
In 1858, just 28 years old, he was appointed to ''stadskonduktør'' in Copenhagen and resigned from the army with status of captain. In 1859 he instigated systematic address numbering and in 1860–66  he surveyed all taxable properties in the city.

Krak resigned from his position as ''stadskonduktør'' in Copenhagen in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Myndigheder_og_politisk_styre/Embedsmand/T._Krak|title=T, Krak|language=Danish|website=[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Krak's City Directory==
In 1862, Krak was awarded a license to publish a [[city directory]] for the Greater Copenhagen area.  The work had been instigated by Hans Holck in 1770 but had only been sparsely updated for decades.  He completely reorganized and modernized the publication with inspiration from foreign capitals before publishing his first city directory in 1863. In 1902 he passed the publication of Kraks Vejviser (Krak's Road Ditectory) on to his son Ove Krak.

==Personal life==
Krak married Charlotte Henriette an. der Recke (27 November 1828 - 30 May1897) on 16 November 1858 in the [[Garrison Church, Copenhagen|Garrison Church]] in Copenhagen. She was the daughter of senior lieutenant and later Road Inspector Gengeal on [[Funen]] Peter Blankenborg Prydz van der Recke (1793–1847) and his wife Caroline Cecilie Petersen (1795–1868).

Krak is buried in the [[Garnisons Cemetery|Garrison Cemetery]] in Copenhagen.
