      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20360">The '''Paris–Marseille–Paris''' race was the first competitive 'city to city' motor race, where the first car across the line was the winner, prior events having selected the winner by various forms of classification and judging.  The race was won by [[Émile Mayade]] who completed the ten-day, 1,710&amp;nbsp;km, event over unsurfaced roads in 67 hours driving a [[Panhard|Panhard et Levassor]].&lt;ref name="Team Dan 1896"&gt;[http://www.teamdan.com/archive/gen/upto1903/1896.html TeamDan Early results database - 1896]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite book

The event was organised by the [[French Automobile Club|Automobile Club de France (ACF)]] and was sometimes retrospectively known as the ''II Grand Prix de l'A.C.F.''. It was run in 10 stages from Paris via Auxerre; Dijon; Lyon; Avignon; Marseille; Avignon; Lyon; Dijon; Sens and return to Paris.

==History==
The first competitive 'city to city' motoring event had been the [[Paris–Rouen (motor race)|1894 Paris–Rouen]] where the Count [[Jules-Albert de Dion]] was first into Rouen but steam-powered vehicles were ineligible for the main prize. Likewise, in 1895 the nascent [[French Automobile Club|Automobile Club de France) (ACF)]] organised its first event, the [[Paris–Bordeaux–Paris]] race, but excluded two-seater cars such that their official winner, a four-seater, finished 11 hours after [[Émile Levassor]]. The outcry resulting from the 1895 result lead the ''A.C.F.'' to organise the Paris–Marseille–Paris Trail as the first fully competitive motor race, where the first car across the line was the winner.&lt;ref name="Team Dan 1896"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Team Dan 1895"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Team Dan 1894"&gt;[http://www.teamdan.com/archive/gen/upto1903/1894.html TeamDan Early results database - 1894]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 1896 the race was announced in ''La France Automobile'', the second edition of the ''A.C.F.'s'' official magazine.&lt;ref name="Histomobile"&gt;[http://histomobile.com/dvd2.php?lien2=fr/histoire/17-1.htm Histomobile, profile of 1896 - Paris-Marseille-Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles and entrants==
The entry list included : seven [[De Dion-Bouton]]s (5 gasoline powered tricycles and 2 steam powered cars); five [[Léon Bollée|Bollée]]s (comprising  four [[Léon Bollée|Léon Bollée tricycles and tandems]] plus an [[Amédée Bollée]]); four [[Panhard et Levassor]]s; three [[Peugeot]]s; two [[Delahaye]]s; two [[Société Parisienne]]s and two [[Triouleyres]]. There were also single car entries from [[Fisson (automobile)|Fisson]]; [[Landry et Beyroux]] (or poss. Landoy); [[Lebrun (automobile)|Lebrun]]; [[Rochet-Schneider]]; [[Rossel (automobile)|Rossel]] and [[Tissandier]].&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;

* Amédée Bollée drove his own 4 seater 'face to face' (''vis-a-vis'') model, equipped with a 2.3 litre, two-cylinder, air-cooled, petrol engine, which produced about 6&amp;nbsp;hp. It retired after completing the first stage to Auxerre but was notable for being the only entry with a [[steering wheel]] rather than a [[tiller]].&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* De Dion-Bouton entered five petrol-powered tricycles plus and two steam powered cars. Viet finished in third place overall on his tricycle and won Class B, while Collomb (No. 51) and Delieuvin (No.15) rode their tricycles to finished fifth and ninth respectively. The tricycles of Chevalier (No. 52) and Boiron both retired on the second day. Neither of the steam powered cars driven by Comté [[Jules-Albert de Dion]] and Comté Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat (No. 14)completed the first stage.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* The [[Delahaye]] Group entered two petrol powered 4-seater vehicles which used two-cylinder, water-cooled, 2,513 cc engines rated at 6&amp;nbsp;hp. They were driven by [[Émile Delahaye]] and sporting pioneer [[Ernest Archdeacon]] who finished tenth and seventh respectively.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* Fisson entered a 4-seater car powered by a 4.5&amp;nbsp;hp [[Benz &amp; Cie.|Benz]] petrol engine and driven by Ferté, but it did not complete the first stage.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* [[Landry et Beyroux]] ([[:de:M.L.B.]])(''Cie des Moteurs et Autos M.L.B.'') entered a single car for Justin Landry  with a rear-mounted, 5.5&amp;nbsp;hp, single cylinder engine. They had begun producing automobiles in 1894 at their works in [[Hondouville]], [[Eure]], France, and went on to trade as ''Cie des Moteurs et Autos M &amp; B.'' from [[Passy-sur-Seine]], but ceased production in 1902. Landry completed the race in 119 hours to finish in thirteenth place, 52 hours behind the overall winner.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* [[Lebrun (car)|Lebrun]] entered a single car that Lebrun built himself, powered by a rear-mounted 4&amp;nbsp;hp Daimler petrol engine with twin cylinders in 'V' configuration. He completed 5 stages to reach Marseille before retiring.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* [[Léon Bollée]] entered four tricycle tandems fitted with a single cylinder, 641 cc delivering about 3 HP. To reduce weight and lower the centre of gravity the vehicle had no springs or suspension other than the Michelin tyres. Lejane's tricycle was the fastest participant, winning stage 1 at 31.9&amp;nbsp;km/hour, but then retiring on stage 2. Pary persevered to finish fourteenth (last) in 141 hours, 74 hours behind the winning Panhard et Levassor of Émile Mayade. The other two Bollée tricycles of Camille Bollée and a.n.other also retired after stage 1.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* Four [[Panhard et Levassor]]s were entered, two (race No. 5 of Émile Levassor and No. 8 of Merkel) were fitted with the 1895 Daimler Phoenix 4 HP (two-cylinder, 1206 cc) engines, whilst the other two had Panhard et Levassor's new design of 8&amp;nbsp;hp, 4-cylinder 2.4-litre engine. Car number 7 of P. Dubois was a 6-seater omnibus, and number 6 was a 4-seater driven by Émile Mayade to overall victory.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* Two [[Société Parisienne]]s (Parisienne Benz) were entered by Guyonnet and Charles Labouré and completed the course in 102 hours to record eleventh and twelfth places respectively. The cars were reportedly slightly modified [[Benz Viktoria]]s, using a single cylinder, 2.9-litre, 4.5&amp;nbsp;hp petrol engine.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DriverDB"&gt;[http://www.driverdb.com/standings/2556-1896/cars/ Driver Database, II Grand Prix de l'ACF 1896]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three petrol powered [[Peugeot]]s were entered. Auguste Doriot drove No 44, a 4&amp;nbsp;hp, lightweight 2 seater phaeton shod with Michelin tyres, possibly a [[Peugeot Type 7|Type 7]] or [[Peugeot Type 8|Type 8]], using a new 2 cylinder 1,396 engine, and was classified eighth when he reached Paris after 81 hours and 23 minutes.  Likewise Louis Rigoulot drove number 45, a similar chassis  and engine but bodied as a 2-seater 'break', but retired after the first stage. The third Peugeot driven by Berlet (number 46), a heavy 5 seater "Wagonette" equipped with solid tires and an older Daimler engine, reached Paris in sixth position after 75 hours 26 minutes.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* [[Gaston Tissandier]], chemist and adventurer, drove his own design of car with a petrol powered 4&amp;nbsp;hp engine. He retired after the first stage.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;
* Two [[Triouleyre]]s were entered by the ''Compagnie Générale des Automobiles'' of Paris. The cars used a rear-mounted Benz  single-cylinder petrol engine delivering 4.5&amp;nbsp;hp. Valentin retired after 2 stages whilst Estève failed to complete a single stage.&lt;ref name="Witalia"/&gt;

==Prologue - pre-selection==
[[File:1896 Panhard Levassor of Emile Mayade - Winner of Paris Marseilles Paris - GG.jpg|thumb|1896 - Panhard et Levassor of Émile Mayade - Winner of Paris-Marseilles-Paris.&lt;br&gt;This new 4 cylinder model won seven of the ten stages in the hands of 3 different drivers.]]

On 20 September, the weekend prior to the start of the race, a selection trial (''prologue'') was run from Paris-Mantes-Paris for bicycles and tricycles of less than 150 kilograms.  The eight successful machines were classified as either engine powered or engine and pedal powered. The two self-powered machines were the single seat, petrol-powered '[[Wolfmüller]]' motorcycle (No 31) ridden by D'Ofraiville; and the Hurtu-Léon Bollée tricycle No. 50 of C. Chauveau. The pedal machines (mopeds) were all De Dion-Bouton tricycles ridden by Chevalier (No. 52); Delieuvin (No. 15);  Clere (No. 51); Fernand Charron (No. 13); and Comte Laubat Gaston De Chasseloup (No. 14).

==The race==
The race covered 1,710&amp;nbsp;km from Paris to Marseilles and return from 24 September-3 October 1896.

===Daily itinerary===
The race was scheduled to be run over 10 daily stages without rest days.&lt;ref name="Team Dan 1896"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Witalia"&gt;[[:it:Storia dell'automobilismo (1896)|Wiki Italy Motoring in 1896]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the road==
The 32 entrants started the first stage from under the [[Place Charles de Gaulle|Place de l'Étoile]] in Paris and raced 177&amp;nbsp;km to [[Auxerre]] where the winner was  Lejane who had driven his Bollée at over 31&amp;nbsp;km/hour. Unfortunately his glory was short lived as he retired the following day. The first of the Panhard et Levassors came to the fore on the second stage from Auxere to Dijon, when Émile Levassor covered the 150.95&amp;nbsp;km over unsurfaced roads in 6 hours 51 minutes, thus taking the overall lead.  Levassor increased his lead by also winning the third stage into Lyon, but his race was ruined when he suffered an accident on the fourth stage into Avignon. Although he persevered until the end of the stage, he then handed over the driving to his [[riding mechanic]] Charles d'Hostingue and they continued steadily until the finishing fourth overall in Paris. Levassor would never fully recover from the accident and the stress of driving another 36 hours, and died early in 1897. The stage was won by Merkel driving another one of Émile Levassor's cars. The fifth stage into the halfway point at Marseille was won by Viet riding on a gasoline powered De Dion tricycle, and he also won the next stage leaving Marseille back to Avignon. In a remarkable piece of symmetry Merkel again won the stage between Avignon and Lyon, a move that started Panhard et Levassor's dominant performance as Emile Mayade dominated the final three stages back to Paris and overall victory. Panhard et Levassor had won seven of the ten stages.

The winning 8&amp;nbsp;hp Panhard et Levassor of Mayade had been extensively upgraded for 1896, using their first four-cylinder engine, doubling the horsepower from the 1895 model. It was equipped with tiller steering and candle lamps. The brakes were a spoon-lever pressing on the solid rubber back tyre plus a belt that tightened onto a drum on the transmission.&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;[http://www.genesis2scale.com/__museum/_europe/_1800panhard/_1896panhard/1896panhardmain.htm Genesis2Scale LLC Museum - 1896 Panhard-Levassor Vehicle]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''15 August 1984 PKK attacks''', which were led by [[Mahsum Korkmaz]] (known as "Agit"),&lt;ref name="kicadem"/&gt; marked the start of the last phase of [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]].&lt;ref name="rferl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kicadem"/&gt;

Since the PKK's second party Congress, which was held from 20 to 25 August 1982 in [[Daraa]], Syria, it was decided that the PKK would start preparing for an insurgency inside Turkey. Training camps were opened in Syria and in [[Lebanon]]'s [[Beqaa Valley]] and propaganda teams were sent across the border to make contact with the local  populations. After years of preparation, the PKK launched its first major attacks on 15 August 1984.&lt;ref name="rferl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kicadem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronoloy"/&gt; The attack was led by the founder of the PKK's military wing.&lt;ref name="kicadem"/&gt;

PKK forces attacked the gendarmerie station in [[Eruh]] in [[Siirt Province|Siirt]] and killed one gendarmerie soldier and injured six soldiers and three civilians. Simultaneously, PKK forces attacked a gendarmerie open-air facility, officer housings and a gendarmerie station in [[Şemdinli]], [[Hakkâri Province|Hakkâri]]&lt;ref name="chronoloy"/&gt; and killed two police officers&lt;ref name="rferl"/&gt; and injured one police officer and a soldier.&lt;ref name="chronoloy"/&gt;

Initially, Turkish authorities did not take the attacks seriously,&lt;ref name="conflict"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuQBdYSc4d8C&amp;pg=PA16 |title=The Kurdish Conflict: International Humanitarian Law and Post-Conflict |publisher=Books.google.nl |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the attack was followed up by a raid on a police station in Siirt on 17 August,&lt;ref name="chronoloy"/&gt; which was soon followed by an attack that killed three of General [[Kenan Evren]]'s Presidential Guards in [[Yüksekova]] and an ambush which killed 8 Turkish soldiers in [[Çukurca]], in Hakkâri province.&lt;ref name="conflict"/&gt;

Insurgent violence in the predominantly [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] South-East of Turkey escalated heavily after the attacks.&lt;ref name="kicadem"/&gt; Around 2,500 people were killed during the conflict between the 15 August 1984 and 1991. This number rose to 17,500 between 1991 and 1992&lt;ref name="casualty years"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/asmp/profiles/turkey_background_kurds.htm The Kurds in Turkey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018011530/http://www.fas.org/asmp/profiles/turkey_background_kurds.htm |date=18 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Turkish state puts the number of people killed by the insurgency at 44,000 as of September 2008.&lt;ref name=hurriyet9914612&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/9914612.asp?gid=0&amp;srid=0&amp;oid=0&amp;l=1 |accessdate=17 September 2008 |title=Bir dönemin acı bilançosu |work=[[Hürriyet]] |date=16 September 2008 |language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''469 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Priscus and Caeliomontanus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 285 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 469 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{Battles involving Assyria}}

The '''Battle of Diyala River''' took place in 693 BC between the forces of the [[Assyria|Assyrian empire]] and the Elamites of southern [[Iran]]. 

==Assyrian expansion==
From the 9th century BC onwards, the Assyrians had been expanding their domain from northern [[Mesopotamia]] into [[Judea]] and [[Babylon]]. After defeating the Babylonians in 689 BC, King Sennacherib sought to punish the Kingdom of Elam for its support towards [[Babylonia]].

==Battle==
Prior to the battle, Sennacherib had sacked a number of Elamite settlements in 694 BC in an attempt to assert his authority over the region. Despite this, the Elamites, with their [[Chaldea]]n allies from Babylon, managed to raise an army and met the Assyrian forces of Sennacherib in 693 BC at the Diyala river. According to the Assyrian account of the battle, the Elamites were heavily defeated. However, many historians believe that the Assyrians suffered heavy casualties as they failed to launch any invasions in 692 BC. In 647 BC, the Assyrians returned and this time destroyed the Kingdom of Elam.

'''Cameroon Airlines Flight 786''' was a [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-2H7C]], registration TJ-CBD, operating as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from [[Douala Airport]], [[Cameroon]] ([[ICAO]]: FKKD), to [[Garoua]] via [[Yaoundé]]. On 30 August 1984, as the aircraft was taxiing out for takeoff with 109 passengers and a crew of 7 on board, its number two engine suffered an [[Turbine engine failure#Contained versus uncontained failures|uncontained compressor failure]], which started a fire. All occupants were able to evacuate the aircraft, but two passengers died due to fire outside the cabin.&lt;ref name=caa/&gt; The aircraft burned to the ground and was declared a total loss.&lt;ref name=asn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19840830-0|title=ASN accident record|publisher=ASN|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident sequence==
As the aircraft was taxiing out in preparation for takeoff, a high-pressure compressor disk in the number two (right side) [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D|Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-15]] engine failed and disintegrated, with fragments damaging the right wing and perforating the fuel tank.&lt;ref name=caa/&gt; The fuel began leaking from the ruptured tank onto the ground below the aircraft, and a fire was ignited. All occupants were able to evacuate the aircraft, but two passengers died due to the fire outside.&lt;ref name=caa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fire.tc.faa.gov/pdf/CAPAP2002_4.PDF|title=A Benefit Analysis for Cabin Water Spray Systems and Enhanced Fuselage Burnthrough Protection|publisher=CAA (UK)|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane was completely destroyed.&lt;ref name=asn/&gt;

==Aftermath==
According to Cameroon Airline's Chief Pilot (ret.) Jean Louis Angounou, interviewed in May 2009 on ''Le Jour Quotidien'', the exact cause of the accident has never been determined because "in Cameroon, some inquiries begin but never come to an end."&lt;ref name=lejour&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lejourquotidien.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4558&amp;Itemid=60|language=French|title=Jean Louis Angounou : Le président Ahidjo m'a dit ...|publisher=Le Jour Quotidien, Cameroon|date=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commemoration Day''' or '''Martyrs' Day''' (Arabic: &lt;span lang="ar" dir="ltr"&gt;يوم الشهيد&lt;/span&gt; ''yawm ash-shahiid'') is marked annually on November 30 in the [[United Arab Emirates]], recognising the sacrifices and dedication of Emirati martyrs who have given their life in the UAE and abroad in the field of civil, military and humanitarian service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/government/martyrs-day-holiday-announced-in-uae-1.1569526|title=Martyrs’ Day holiday announced in UAE|work=GulfNews|date=19 August 2015|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Emirati soldier to die in the line of duty was Salem Suhail bin Khamis, on November 30, 1971, during the "battle of the Greater Tunb” against Iranian forces shortly before the UAE’s formation. Bin Khamis led a six-member police force on Greater Tunb, invaded by Iran on the eve of Federation. He refused to lower the flag of Ras Al Khaimah, and the invaders killed him for his defiance.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/20150819/martyrs-day-a-source-of-pride-for-mothers-uaes-of-fallen-soldiers|title=Martyrs’ Day a source of pride for mothers UAE’s of fallen soldiers|work=thenational.ae|date=19 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 2015, it was announced that 30 November would be observed as Martyrs Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/08/20/UAE-announces-Martyr-s-day-but-why-November-30-.html|title=UAE announces Martyr’s day, but why November 30?|work=Al Arabiya News Middle East english.alarabiya.net|date=20 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martyrs timeline==
The soldiers who fell during the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]] (1990-1991) while liberating Kuwait will also be remembered along with martyrs such as Saif Ghubash, the government minister who was assassinated in 1977, and Khalifa Al Mubarak, an Emirati ambassador who was assassinated in 1984. Others who have died in the line of duty will always be honoured.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/martyrs-day-a-fitting-tribute-to-uaes-heroes#full|title=Martyrs’ Day a fitting tribute to UAE’s heroes|work=thenational.ae|date=10 September 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Operation Restoring Hope" in Yemen===
UAE armed forces joined "[[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen#Operation Restoring Hope|Operation Restoring Hope]]" under the Saudi Arabia-led Arab alliance in 2015 to support the Aden-based government recognized by the Gulf states. The number of UAE soldiers martyred in Yemen rose to 45. The UAE government announced a three-day mourning period from September 5, 2015, with flags to be flown at half-mast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/emergencies/3-days-of-mourning-declared-in-uae-for-martyrs-in-yemen-1.1578501|title=

==Observance==
Commemorative and national ceremonies and events will be organised nationwide on November 30. All state institutions, nationals and non-nationals will be engaged to promote, mark and remember the values of sacrifice, dedication and loyalty, of the UAE citizens who sacrificed their lives in battles of heroism, dedication and national duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/government/khalifa-declares-martyr-s-day-november-30-to-be-public-holiday-2015-08-19-1.600775|title=Khalifa declares Martyr's Day; November 30 to be public holiday|work=emirates247.ae|date=19 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday will honour the heroes with nationwide remembrance to those who gave their souls for their homeland.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Tributes dedicating the Martyrs==
Commemorating the UAE’s fallen heroes on November 30 every year from 2015 will be a tribute to UAE's heroes.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt;

Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, the Ruler of Sharjah, ordered that a square be dedicated in honour of the servicemen. Building of a monument is proposed to honour those who died in the line of duty is to be inaugurated on Martyrs’ Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/square-in-sharjah-to-be-dedicated-to-the-uaes-fallen-soldiers|title=Square in Sharjah to be dedicated to the UAE’s fallen soldiers|work=thenational.ae|date=19 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharjah will be installing a martyrs’ monument on Maliha Road, near the Sharjah Centre for Space and Astronomy, and a road in Sharjah University City will be renamed Martyr’s Road.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt;

A martyrs’ square and memorial will be built in Al Alam Park in Ajman.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt;

The road linking the emirates of Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, has been renamed as 'Martyrs Street' or 'Shuhada Street' in Arabic, in memory of the martyrs as a tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/martyrs-street-launched-between-fujairah-and-ras-al-khaimah-2015-09-14-1.603446|title='Martyrs Street' launched between Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah|work=emirates247.com|date=14 September 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to save endangered species may, paradoxically, lead to '''conservation-induced extinction''' of other species. This mostly threatens the parasite and pathogen species that are highly host-specific to critically endangered hosts. When the last individuals of a host species are captured for the purpose of captive breeding and reintroduction programs, they typically undergo anti-parasitic treatments to increase survival and reproductive success. This practice may unintentionally result in the extinction of the species antagonistic to the target species, such as certain parasites. It has been proposed that the parasites should be reintroduced to the endangered population. A few cases of conservation-induced extinction have occurred in parasitic [[lice]].&lt;ref name="Rózsa2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rózsa | first=Lajos | last2=Vas | first2=Zoltán | title=Co-extinct and critically co-endangered species of parasitic lice, and conservation-induced extinction: should lice be reintroduced to their hosts? | journal=Oryx | volume=49 | issue=01 | date=2014-08-22| doi=10.1017/s0030605313000628 | pages=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* Parasite: ''[[Colpocephalum californici]]'' – host: [[California condor]]&lt;ref name = Dunn&gt;Dunn RR 2009. Coextinction: anecdotes, models, and speculation. In Holocene Extinctions (ed. S.T. Turvey), pp. 167–180. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The parasite most probably became extinct when the last individuals of its only host species were captured for a captive-breeding program; all parasites found were deliberately killed in an attempt to assist the host's survival.&lt;ref name="Stringer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stringer |first1=Andrew Paul |last2=Linklater |first2=Wayne |title=Everything in Moderation: Principles of Parasite Control for Wildlife Conservation |journal=BioScience |date=2014 |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=932–937 |doi=10.1093/biosci/biu135 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parasite: ''Rallicola (Aptericola) pilgrimi'' – host: [[little spotted kiwi]]&lt;ref name = Buckley&gt;Buckley TR, Palma RL, Johns PM, Gleeson DM, Heath ACG, Hitchmough RA, Stringer IAN 2012. The conservation status of small or less well known groups of New Zealand terrestrial invertebrates. ''New Zealand Entomologist'' '''35:''' 137–143.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The parasite most probably became extinct when the last individuals of its only host species were captured and, after routine veterinary antiparasitic treatments, re-introduced into predator-free islands.
* Parasite: ''Rallicola (Rallicola) guami'' – host: [[Guam rail]]
:The only known host species of this parasite exists exclusively in captivity and kept under veterinary control. No information about the fate of the parasite, likely extinct.
* Parasite: ''Linognathus petasmatus'' – host: [[scimitar-horned oryx]]
:The host specificity of this parasite is uncertain. Either it was specific to the scimitar-horned oryx and became extinct during captive breeding of the host, or – alternatively – it may be specific to the [[addax]] and possibly still surviving in the wild.

==Erroneous example==

* “The Trichodectid lice of the [[black-footed ferret]]” has been mentioned in the literature several times&lt;ref name = Gompper&gt;Gompper ME, Williams ES 1998. Parasite conservation and the black-footed ferret recovery program. ''Conservation Biology'' '''12:''' 730–732.&lt;/ref&gt; as a parasite that became extinct during the captive breeding program of the host. However, this parasite most probably never existed as a separate species.&lt;ref name="Rózsa2014"/&gt;

==Current example==

Parasite species that are specific to a single host species are endangered whenever the host is to be saved by captive breeding programs. A current example is the louse ''Felicola isidoroi'', a louse parasitizing the [[Iberian lynx]].&lt;ref name = Felicola&gt;Pérez, J.M.; Sánchez, I. &amp; Palma, R.L. (2013). The dilemma of conserving parasites: the case of ''Felicola (Lorisicola) isidoroi'' (Phthiraptera: Trichodectidae) and its host, the endangered Iberian lynx (''Lynx pardinus''). ''Insect Conservation and Diversity'' '''6:''' 680–686.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Durrës''' ({{IPA-sq|ˈdu:rəs}}; {{lang-it|Durazzo}}, {{IPA-it|duˈrattso}}), historically known as '''Epidamnos''' and '''Dyrrachium''', is the [[List of cities in Albania|second most populous city]] of the [[Republic of Albania]]. The city is the capital of the surrounding [[Durrës County]], one of 12 constituent [[Counties of Albania|counties]] of the country. By air, it is {{convert|165|km|abbr=off}} northwest of [[Sarandë]], {{convert|31|km|abbr=off}} west of [[Tirana]], {{convert|83|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Shkodër]] and {{convert|579|km|abbr=off}} east of [[Rome]]. Located on the [[Adriatic Sea]], it is the country's most ancient and economic and historic center.

Founded by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonists from Corinth and Corfu under the name of [[Epidamnos]] ({{lang-el|Επίδαμνος}}) around the 7th century BC, the city essentially developed to become significant as it became an integral part of the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Via Egnatia]], the continuation of the [[Via Appia]], started in the city and led across the interior of the Balkan Peninsula to [[Constantinople]] in the east. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was contested between [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]], [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominions.
 
Following the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]], the city served as the capital of the [[Principality of Albania]] for a short period of time. Subsequently, it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[interwar period]]. Moreover, the city experienced a strong expansion in its demography and economic activity during the [[Communism in Albania]].

Durrës is served by the [[Port of Durrës]], one of the largest on the Adriatic Sea, which connects the city to Italy and other neighbouring countries. Its most considerable attraction is the [[Durrës Amphitheatre|Amphitheatre of Durrës]] that is included on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania#Tentative list|tentative list]] of Albania for designation as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]. Once having a capacity for 20,000 people, it is the largest amphitheatre in the [[List of Roman amphitheatres|Balkan Peninsula]].

==Names==

In antiquity, the city was named ''Epidamnos'' (Ἐπίδαμνος) and ''Dyrrhachion'' (Δυρράχιον) in [[Greek language|Greek]], corresponding to Latin ''Epidamnus'' and ''Dyrrachium''. The name ''Dyrrhachion'' is usually explained as a Greek compound from {{lang|grc|δυσ-}} 'bad' and {{lang|grc|ῥαχία}} 'rocky shore, flood, roaring waves',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Hans|last=Krahe|title=Vom Illyrischen zum Alteuropäischen|journal=Indogermanische Forschungen|volume=69|year=1964|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; an explanation already hinted at in antiquity by Cassius Dio, who writes it referred to the difficulties of the rocky coastline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cassius Dio|title=Roman History|chapter=41:49|publisher=Loeb Classical Library|year=1916|volume=IV|page=85|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/41*.html#note12}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also reporting that other Roman authors linked it to the name of an [[eponymous]] hero ''Dyrrachius''. The modern names of the city in Albanian (''Durrës'') and Italian (''Durazzo'') are derived from ''Dyrrachium'' through the Medieval Slavic form ''Дърачь'' (Dŭračĭ) (modern Serbian: ''Драч/Drač'' (Dratch)),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Guillaume|last=Bonnet|title=Les mots latins de l'albanais|location=Paris|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=1998|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote needed|date=August 2015}} from the era when the city was held by the Bulgarian and Serbian empires. This is also the root of the Ottoman Turkish name ''Dıraç''.

In English usage, the Italian form ''Durazzo'' used to be widespread, but the local Albanian name ''Durrës'' has gradually replaced it in recent decades.

Though surviving remains are minimal,&lt;ref&gt;A selection of modern travelers' accounts and references in ancient literature are given in P. Cabanes and F. Drini, eds, ''Inscription d'Épidamne-Dyrrhachion et d'Apollonia'', vol. I (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|oldest cities]] in Albania, the city was founded as ''[[Epidamnos]]'' in the ancient region of [[Illyria]] in 627 BC by [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 96,"From Bouthoe to Epidamnus, a Greek city, the ..."&lt;/ref&gt; colonists from [[Corinth]] and Corcyra, modern-day [[Corfu]]. The Romans replaced the rule of Teuta with that of [[Demetrius of Pharos]], one of her generals.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. ''The Illyrians'', 1992, p. 120, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 161, "... Gulf of Kotor. The Romans decided that enough had been achieved and hostilities ceased. The consuls handed over Illyria to Demetrius and withdrew the fleet and army to Epidamnus, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; He lost his kingdom, including Epidamnus, to the Romans in 219 BC at the [[Second Illyrian War]]. In the [[Third Illyrian War]] Epidamnus was attacked by [[Gentius]] but he was defeated by the Romans&lt;ref&gt;John Drogo Montagu, ''Battles of the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Chronological Compendium of 667 Battles to 31BC'', (series Historians of the Ancient World (Greenhill Historic Series), 2000:47 {{ISBN|1-85367-389-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; at the same year.

For [[Catullus]], the city was ''Durrachium Hadriae tabernam'', "the ''[[taberna]]'' of the Adriatic", one of the stopping places for a Roman traveling up the [[Adriatic]], as Catullus had done himself in the sailing season of 56.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gwyn Morgan, "Catullus and the 'Annales Volusi'" ''Quaderni Urbinati di Cultura Classica'', New Series, '''4''' (1980):59–67).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Illyrian Wars]] with the [[Roman Republic]] in 229 BC ended in a decisive defeat for the Illyrians, the city passed to Roman rule, under which it was developed as a major military and naval base. The Romans renamed it ''Dyrrachium'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Δυρράχιον / ''Dyrrhachion''). They considered the name ''Epidamnos'' to be inauspicious because of its wholly coincidental similarities with the Latin word ''damnum'', meaning "loss" or "harm". The meaning of ''Dyrrachium'' ("bad spine" or "difficult ridge" in Greek) is unclear, but it has been suggested that it refers to the imposing cliffs near the city. [[Julius Caesar]]'s rival [[Pompey]] made a stand there in 48 BC before fleeing south to [[Greece]]. Under Roman rule, Dyrrachium prospered; it became the western end of the ''[[Via Egnatia]]'', the great [[Roman road]] that led to [[Thessalonica]] and on to [[Constantinople]]. Another lesser road led south to the city of ''Buthrotum'', the modern [[Butrint]]. The Roman emperor [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] made the city a colony for veterans of his [[Roman legion|legions]] following the [[Battle of Actium]], proclaiming it a ''[[civitas libera]]'' (free town).

In the 4th century, Dyrrachium was made the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Epirus nova]]. It was the birthplace of the emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] in c. 430. Sometime later that century, Dyrrachium was struck by a powerful earthquake which destroyed the city's defences. Anastasius I rebuilt and strengthened the city walls, thus creating the strongest fortifications in the western Balkans. The {{convert|12|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} walls were so thick that, according to the Byzantine historian [[Anna Komnene]], four horsemen could ride abreast on them. Significant portions of the ancient city defences still remain, although they have been much reduced over the centuries.

Like much of the rest of the [[Balkans]], Dyrrachium and the surrounding ''Dyrraciensis provinciae'' suffered considerably from [[barbarian]] incursions during the [[Migrations Period]]. It was besieged in 481 by [[Theodoric the Great]], king of the [[Ostrogoth]]s, and in subsequent centuries had to fend off frequent attacks by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]]. Unaffected by the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the city continued under the [[Byzantine Empire]] as an important port and a major link between the Empire and western Europe.

[[File:Semissis-Anastasius I-sb0007.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The Eastern Roman Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] was born into an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] family in Durrës.]]

=== Middle Ages ===
{{see|Battle of Dyrrhachium (1018)|Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)}}

The city and the surrounding coast became a Byzantine province, the [[Theme of Dyrrhachium]], probably in the first decade of the 9th century.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}} The city remained in Byzantine hands until the late 10th century, when [[Samuel of Bulgaria]]  gained control of the city, possibly through his marriage with [[Agatha, wife of Samuel of Bulgaria|Agatha]], daughter of the local magnate [[John Chryselios]]. Samuel made his son-in-law [[Ashot Taronites]], a Byzantine captive who had married his daughter [[Miroslava of Bulgaria|Miroslava]], governor of the city. In circa 1005, however, Ashot and Miroslava, with the connivance of Chryselios, fled to [[Constantinople]], where they notified Emperor [[Basil II]] of their intention to surrender the city to him. Soon, a Byzantine squadron appeared off the city under [[Eustathios Daphnomeles]], and the city returned to Byzantine rule.{{sfn|Stephenson|2003|pp=17–18, 34–35}}{{sfn|Holmes|2005|pp=103–104, 497–498}}

In the 11th–12th centuries, the city was important as a military stronghold and a [[metropolitan see]] rather than as a major economic center, and never recovered its late antique prosperity; [[Anna Komnene]] makes clear that medieval Dyrrhachium occupied only a portion of the ancient city.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}} In the 1070s, two of its governors, [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder]] and [[Nikephoros Basilakes]], led unsuccessful rebellions trying to seize the Byzantine throne.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}} Dyrrachium was lost in February 1082 when [[Alexios I Komnenos]] was defeated by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund]] in the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]. Byzantine control was restored a few years later, but the Normans under Bohemund returned to besiege it in 1107–08, and sacked it again in 1185 under King [[William II of Sicily]].{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}} In 1205, after the [[Fourth Crusade]], the city was transferred to the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]], which formed the "Duchy of Durazzo". This Duchy was conquered in 1213 and the city taken by the [[Despotate of Epirus]] under [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]]. In 1257, Durrës was briefly occupied by the King of Sicily, [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred of Hohenstaufen]]. It was re-occupied by the Despot of Epirus [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]] until 1259, when the Despotate was defeated by the Byzantine [[Empire of Nicaea]] in the [[Battle of Pelagonia]]. In the 1270s, Durrës was again controlled by Epirus under [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]], the son of Michael II, who in 1278 was forced to yield the city to Charles d' Anjou ([[Charles I of Sicily]]). In c. 1273, it was wrecked by a devastating [[earthquake]] (according to [[George Pachymeres]]; R. Elsie, ''Early Albania'' (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;12) but soon recovered. It was briefly occupied by King [[Stephen Uroš II Milutin of Serbia|Milutin]] of Serbia in 1296.

[[File:Durrës, Pinargenti.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The city of Durrës in 1573]]

In the early 14th century, the city was ruled by a coalition of Anjous, Hungarians, and Albanians of the Thopia family. In 1317 or 1318, the area was taken by the Serbs and remained under their rule until the 1350s. At that time the Popes, supported by the Anjous, increased their diplomatic and political activity in the area, by using the Latin bishops, including the archbishop of Durrës. The city had been a religious center of Catholicism after the Anjou were installed in Durrës. In 1272, a Catholic archbishop was installed, and until the mid-14th century there were both Catholic and Orthodox archbishops of Durrës.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf Etleva Lala (2008) Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Irish pilgrims who visited Albania on their way to Jerusalem in 1322, reported that Durrës was "inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians".&lt;ref&gt;''Itinerarium Symonis Simeonis et Hugonis Illuminatoris ad Terram Sanctam'', edited by J. Nasmith, 1778, cited in:

:"''Inhabitatur enim Latinis, Grecis,  Judeis perfidis, et  barbaris Albanensibus''" (Translation in R. Elsie: ''For it is inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians'').&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Serbian Tsar [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Dušan]] died in 1355, the city passed into the hands of the Albanian family of [[Thopia family|Thopias]]. In 1376 the [[Navarrese Company]] [[Louis of Évreux, Duke of Durazzo]], who had gained the rights on the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]] from his second wife, attacked and conquered the city, but in 1383 [[Karl Topia]] regained control of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1994), p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Venice]] regained control in 1392 and retained the city, known as ''Durazzo'' in those years, as part of the ''[[Albania Veneta]]''. It fended off a siege by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1466 but fell to Ottoman forces in 1501.

Durrës became a [[Christianity|Christian]] city quite early on; its [[Diocese|bishopric]] was created around 58 and was raised to the status of an [[archbishopric]] in 449. It was also the seat of a [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[metropolitan bishop]]. Under Turkish rule, many of its inhabitants converted to [[Islam]] and many [[mosque]]s were erected. This city was renamed as Dıraç but did not prosper under the Ottomans and its importance declined greatly. By the mid-19th century, its population was said to have been only about 1,000 people living in some 200 households. In the late nineteenth century, Durrës contained 1,200 Orthodox [[Aromanians]] (130 families) who lived among the larger population of Muslim Albanians alongside a significant number of Catholic Albanians.&lt;ref name="Koukoudis358"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koukoudis|first=Asterios|title=The Vlachs: Metropolis and Diaspora|year=2003|location=Thessaloniki|publisher=Zitros Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=01JoAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The+Vlachs%3A+Metropolis+and+Diaspora&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Berat|isbn=9789607760869|pages=358|ref=harv}} "Durrës... At the end of the nineteenth century, there were more than 130 Vlach families, some 1,200 Vlachs, who constituted the nucleus of the local Greek Orthodox community, amid the much more numerous Moslem Albanians and quite a number of Roman Catholics, also of Albanian stock."&lt;/ref&gt; The decrepitude of Durrës was noted by foreign observers in the early 20th century: "The walls are dilapidated; plane-trees grow on the gigantic ruins of its old Byzantine citadel; and its harbour, once equally commodious and safe, is gradually becoming silted up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Durazzo |volume=8 |page=695}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durrës was a main centre in [[Scutari Province, Ottoman Empire|İşkodra Vilayet]] before 1912.

Durrës was an active city in the [[Albanian National Awakening|Albanian national liberation movement]] in the periods 1878–1881 and 1910–1912. [[Ismail Qemali]] raised the [[Flag of Albania|Albanian flag]] on 26 November 1912 but the city was occupied by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] three days later during the [[First Balkan War]]. On 29 November 1912 Durrës became the county town of the [[Durrës County (Kingdom of Serbia)|Durrës County]] ({{lang-sr|Драчки округ}}) one of the counties of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] established on the part of the territory of [[Albania (toponym)|Albania]] occupied from [[Ottoman Empire]]. 
The Durrës County had four districts ({{lang-sr|срез}}): Durrës, [[Lezha]], [[Elbasan]] and [[Tirana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogdanović|first=Dimitrije|title=Knjiga o Kosovu: razgovori o Kosovu|year=1990|publisher=Književne novine|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FbpBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7+%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD&amp;dq=%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7+%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD|author2=Radovan Samardžić|accessdate=2 August 2011|page=208|quote=На освојеном подручју су одмах успостављене грађанске власти и албанска територија је Де Факто анектирана Србији : 29. новембра је основан драчки округ са четири среза (Драч, Љеш, Елбасан, Тирана)....On conquered territory of Albania was established civil government and territory of Albania was de facto annexed by Serbia: On November 29 was established Durrës County with four srez (Durrës, Lezha, Elbasan and Tirana)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army of the Kingdom of Serbia retreated from Durrës in April 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antić|first=Čedomir|title=Kratko slavlje u Draču|journal=[[Večernje novosti]]|date=January 2, 2010|url=http://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:280057-Kratko-slavlje-u-Dracu|accessdate=5 August 2011|trans-title=Short celebration in Durrës|language=Serbian|quote=VeĆ u aprilu 1913. postalo je izvesno da je kraj "albanske operacije" blizu.

During the [[First World War]], the city was occupied by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in 1915 and by [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1916–1918. On 29 December 1915, [[Battle of Durazzo (1915)|a Naval Battle]] was fought off Durazzo. 
On 2 October 1918, several allied ships [[Battle of Durazzo (1918)#Battle|bombarded Durazzo]] and attacked the few Austrian ships in the harbour. Although civilians started to flee the city at the start of the bombardment, many casualties were inflicted on the innocent and neutral population.  The Old City being adjacent to the harbour was largely destroyed, including the [[Royal Palace of Durrës]] and other primary public buildings. 
It was captured by Italian troops on 16 October 1918. 
Restored to Albanian sovereignty, Durrës became the country's temporary capital between 1918 and March 1920. It experienced an economic boom due to Italian investments and developed into a major seaport under the rule of King [[Zog of Albania|Zog]], with a modern harbour being constructed in 1927. It was at this time the [[Royal Villa of Durrës]] was built by Zog as a summer palace, that still dominates the skyline from a hill close to the old city. 

An earthquake in 1926 damaged some of the city and the rebuilding that followed gave the city its more modern appearance. During the 1930s, the [[Bank of Athens]] had a branch in the city. &lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Durazzo, Albania, April 1939, Italian soldiers entering the city.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian soldiers]] entering the city on 7 April 1939 after facing fierce resistance from [[Mujo Ulqinaku]] and the [[Royal Albanian Army]].]] --&gt;

Durrës (called ''Durazzo'' again in Italian) and the rest of Albania were [[Italian invasion of Albania|occupied in April 1939]] and annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] until 1943, then occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] until [[Belgrade Offensive|autumn 1944]]. Durrës's strategic value as a seaport made it a high-profile military target for both sides. It was the site of the [[Italian invasion of Albania|initial Italian landings]] on 7 April 1939 (and was fiercely defended by [[Mujo Ulqinaku]]) as well as the launch point for the ill-fated [[Greco-Italian War|Italian invasion of Greece]]. The city was heavily damaged by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing during the war and the port installations were blown up by retreating German soldiers in autumn 1944.

[[File:Durres 2016-2017.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Street in Durrës.]]

The [[Communist]] regime of [[Enver Hoxha]] rapidly rebuilt the city following the war, establishing a variety of heavy industries in the area and expanding the port. It became the terminus of Albania's first [[railway]], begun in 1947 ([[Durrës–Tiranë railway]]). In the late 1980s, the city was briefly renamed Durrës-Enver Hoxha. The city was and continues to remain the center of Albanian mass beach tourism.
Following the collapse of communist rule in 1990, Durrës became the focus of mass emigrations from Albania with ships being hijacked in the harbour and sailed at gunpoint to Italy. In one month alone, August 1991, over 20,000 people migrated to Italy in this fashion. Italy intervened militarily, putting the port area under its control, and the city became the center of the [[European Community]]'s "[[Operation Pelican]]", a food-aid program.
In 1997, [[1997 rebellion in Albania|Albania slid into anarchy]] following the collapse of a massive [[pyramid scheme]] which devastated the national economy. An Italian-led peacekeeping force was controversially deployed to Durrës and other Albanian cities to restore order, although there were widespread suggestions that the real purpose of "[[Operation Alba]]" was to prevent economic refugees continuing to use Albania's ports as a route to migrate to Italy.

Following the start of the 21st century, Durrës has been revitalized as many streets were repaved, while parks and façades experienced a face lift.

===Religion===

[[Christianity in Albania|Christianity]] in Albania has a presence dating back to [[classical antiquity]]. Christian traditions relate that the archbishopric of Durrës was founded by the [[apostle Paul]] while preaching in Illyria and Epirus and that there were possibly about seventy Christian families in Durrës as early as the time of the Apostles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/10-3_242.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reformation.edu/albania/pages/early-christianity-albania.htm|title=Early Christianity – Albania – Reformation Christian Ministries – Albania  &amp; Kosovo|author=|date=|work=reformation.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orthodox Church of Albania]], which has been autocephalous since 1923 was divided into the [[Archbishop of Tirana|archbishopric of Tirana – Durrës]], headed by the Metropolitan and sub-divided into the local church districts of [[Tirana]], Durrës, [[Shkodër]] and [[Elbasan]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The religious composition of Durrës consists of [[Muslim]]s, both (Sunni and [[Bektashi]]) alongside Christians (Catholic and Orthodox) who form a significant part of the urban population.

===Education===
[[File:Albanian College of Durres.jpg|thumb|The Albanian College of Durrës]]

Durrës has a long tradition of education since the beginning of civil life from antiquity until today. After the fall of communism in [[Albania]], a reorganization plan was announced in 1990, that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, major economic and political crisis in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Later, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed, to improve learning conditions especially in larger cities of the country. Durrës is host to academic institutions such as the [[University of Durrës]], Albanian College of Durrës, [[Vëllezërit Kajtazi Educational Institute|Kajtazi Brothers Educational Institute]], Gjergj Kastrioti High School, Naim Frashëri High School, Sports mastery school Benardina Qerraxhiu and Jani Kukuzeli Artistic Lycee.

[[File:Panorama of Durres Port.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Its highly advantageous geographical location puts the [[Port of Durrës]] among the largest in the [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian sea]]s.]]

Durrës is an important link to [[Western Europe]] due to its port and its proximity to the Italian port cities, notably Bari, to which daily ferries run. As well as the dockyard, it also possesses an important shipyard and manufacturing industries, notably producing leather, plastic and tobacco products.
The southern coastal stretch of Golem is renowned for its traditional mass beach tourism having experienced uncontrolled urban development. The city's beaches are also a popular destination for many foreign and local tourists, with an estimated 800,000 tourists visiting annually. Many Albanians from Tirana and elsewhere spend their summer vacations on the beaches of Durrës. 
In 2012, new water sanitation systems are being installed to completely eliminate sea water pollution. In contrast, the northern coastal stretch of Lalzit Bay is mostly unspoiled and set to become an elite tourism destination as a number of beach resorts are being built since 2009. Neighboring districts are known for the production of good wine and a variety of foodstuffs.

According to the World Bank, Durrës has made significant steps of starting a business in 2016. Durrës ranks 9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/Rankings/south-east-europe|title=Subnational Economy Rankings – South East Europe – Subnational Doing Business – World Bank Group|author=|date=|work=doingbusiness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; among 22 cities in [[Southeastern Europe]] before the capital [[Tirana]], [[Belgrade]], Serbia and [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Major roads and railways pass through the city of Durrës thank to its significant location and connect the northern part of the country to the south and the west with the east. Durrës is the starting point of [[Pan-European Corridor VIII]], national roads SH2 and SH4, and serves as the main railway station of the Albanian Railways (HSH).

The [[Pan-European Corridor VIII]] is one of the [[Pan-European corridor]]s. It runs between Durrës, at the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, and [[Varna]], at the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Bulgarian Black Sea coast]].

As most tourists come through Kosovo, the laying of the highway make it easier to travel to Durrës.

The line connects to the [[Shkodër–Vorë railway]] halfway in [[Vorë]], and to the Durrës-Vlorë railway in Durrës. In 2015, some rail stations and rolling stock along the Durrës-Tiranë line are being upgraded and latter colored red and white.

The bulk of the museum consists of artifacts found in the nearby ancient site of Dyrrhachium and includes an extensive collection from the Illyrian, Ancient Greek, Hellenistic and Roman periods. Items of major note include Roman funeral steles and stone sarcophagi, an elliptical colourful mosaic measuring 17 by 10 feet, referred to as [[The Beauty of Durrës]], and a collection of miniature busts of Venus, testament to the time when Durrës was a centre of worship of the goddess.

"'''Fantastic Easter Special'''" is the fifth episode of the [[South Park (season 11)|eleventh season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 158th episode of the series overall. It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on April 4, 2007. The episode parodies ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''. The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA]] in the United States.

Determined to get the real story behind why he has to decorate eggs for Easter, Stan starts asking his Dad some tough questions. The answers lead to an ancient and mysterious secret society created in the Middle Ages to protect the secret of the Easter Bunny. Threats to the sanctity of Easter are imminent from [[William Anthony Donohue|Bill Donohue]] and the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]].

==Plot==
{{plot|date=September 2015}}
As [[List of South Park families#The Marshes|the Marsh family]] colors [[Easter egg|eggs]] for [[Easter]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] questions what it has to do with [[Jesus]]. Not satisfied by his father [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]]'s vague response, Stan storms off and asks the same question to a mall [[Easter Bunny]]. The mall bunny tells Stan that it is "just Easter", and to "just go with it", then makes a mysterious phone call.

Stan soon finds himself being chased by men in bunny suits. When he gets home, he finds that Randy is part of the plot. Randy calls the men off, and tells Stan that he is in a society called "[[Hair Club|The Hare Club for Men]]", who have guarded the secret of Easter for generations. Randy takes Stan to the headquarters of the Hare Club, where he is to be initiated into the group, which reveres a [[rabbit]] named Snowball. The Hare Club for Men's building resembles a [[Freemasonry|Masonic Hall]]. Much of the ritual borrows from the practice of Freemasons. Just as he is about to learn the secret of Easter, Stan's initiation is interrupted as the club is ambushed by a group of [[ninja]]s. The Hare Club members rush to protect Snowball, and Randy gives the rabbit to Stan, telling him to run. He escapes with Snowball, and witnesses the ninjas and their leader, [[William Anthony Donohue]], executing a resisting hare and interrogating Randy. Stan runs off to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s house and tries to extract any knowledge Kyle has of Easter. Kyle, who is Jewish and says he knows nothing about Easter, does not want to be involved in something so dangerous, but Stan persuades him to help.

Stan and Kyle manage to track down a man named Professor Teabag (spoof of Professor [[Sir Leigh Teabing|Teabing]]), who supposedly knows the secret of the Hare Club. Teabag lets them in his mansion and explains that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was actually a member of the Hare Club and that [[Saint Peter]] was not a man, but a [[rabbit]] ([[Peter Rabbit]]), and reveals that da Vinci originally portrayed Saint Peter as a rabbit instead of as a man in his painting of [[the Last Supper]]. Teabag explains that Jesus knew that no human could speak for all Christianity without any acts of corruption, and that rabbits were pure, tolerant, and incorruptible. This is why the Pope's [[mitre]] is shaped to accommodate a rabbit's ears. He also explained that the Church decided to bury the secret and put a man in charge. Ever since, "The Hare Club for Men" society members have decorated eggs for generations to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive. He further explains that Snowball is actually a direct descendant from St. Peter, and that Stan's father and the members of the Hare Club have been kidnapped by the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]], who wish to cover up this secret, viewing it as [[blasphemy]]. Donohue's ninja minions then attack again and kill Teabag's butler, but Teabag helps the two boys escape by putting [[Peeps|marshmallow Peeps]] in the microwave. It causes an explosion that destroys the mansion, killing both Teabag and the ninjas.

Stan and Kyle go to the Vatican where Stan turns the rabbit over to the Donohue's men, on the condition that the Hare Club members must all be set free and that Snowball remain unharmed. However, Donohue reveals he had actually made the promise on two separate [[crucifix]]es, a "[[double cross (betrayal)|double cross]]", and plans to make an example of the Hare Club. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] opposes this, saying that double-crossing is not considered to be "very Christian," something which Donohue responds by saying that it is what [[Jesus]] would have wanted. Jesus himself (after resurrecting from being [[Red Sleigh Down|killed in Iraq]]) then arrives to intervene, answering the prayer of one of the Hare Club members. He tells them that he actually did plan for the popes to be rabbits, citing the current corruption of Donohue. Benedict and his clergy are willing to listen and agree with Jesus, but Donohue refuses to listen and orders Benedict to execute Jesus for 'going against the Church'. Outraged to see how arrogant Donohue is, Benedict angrily refuses, saying that killing Jesus is not "very Christian." Enraged, Donohue seizes the Pope's [[mitre]], and orders his ninjas to capture everyone including Benedict and Jesus. Donohue declares himself the new Pope. With the clergy unable to stop him, Donohue orders his minions to lock up Kyle and Jesus, whom he calls the "two Jews", and Benedict to deal with later. Donohue then leads Randy, Stan, and the surviving Hare Club members to the block where there is a gigantic pot for Snowball's execution.

In the cell, Benedict apologizes to Jesus for his actions, pleading for forgiveness. Jesus tells Kyle that his "superpowers" only work when he is dead, and the only way to escape is for Kyle to kill him so he can return to life outside the cell. Kyle is hesitant to kill Jesus, but does so after Jesus promises that "[[Eric Cartman]] can never know about this". As Donohue is about to execute Snowball in front of Randy, Stan, and the Hare Club members, the resurrected Jesus appears in the crowd. Jesus then kills Donohue and everyone cheers for Jesus and Snowball is elected Pope. Because he is a rabbit, Snowball cannot speak or tell people how they should lead their lives, just as "Jesus intended". Stan reveals that he has learned his lesson through all of his adventures: do not ask questions; just dye the eggs and keep his mouth shut, and Randy is proud of him.

==Production==
In the commentary, the creators called it their ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' episode, emphasizing the conspiracy and searching for clues in the eggs. Bill Donohue had been quoted by several news outlets during coverage of previous Southpark episodes [[Bloody Mary (South Park)|Bloody Mary]] and [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]], but "Bill Donohue is not the emperor of Catholics."&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2008 |title=South Park: The Complete Eleventh Season: "Fantastic Easter Special"|format=Audio commentary |url=http://southpark.cc.com/clips/i48dcq/creator-commentary-night-of-the-living-homeless |medium=DVD Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus then kills Donohue by throwing a five bladed sword similar to the one featured in the movie [[Krull (film)|Krull]].&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;

==Reaction==
[[IGN]] gave the episode a rating of 10, citing it a "masterpiece" and "controlled comic chaos that only South Park seems able to manage on such a consistent basis.".&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/05/south-park-fantastic-easter-special-review IGN Episode Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine listed the episode as #10 on their list of Top 10 Jesus Films, praising the conspiracy story and its resemblance to The Da Vinci Code and 
the lyrics of “Peter Cottontail” in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.time.com/2009/04/10/top-10-jesus-films/slide/south-park-fantastic-easter-special-2007/&lt;/ref&gt;

Erik Hinton of ''[[PopMatters]]'' praised the episode saying, "they do like killing Jesus, but it’s in the service of a profound message of religious tolerance and even-handed treatment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.popmatters.com/south-park-the-complete-eleventh-season-2496125884.html PopMatters, South Park Season 11 Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donohue's reaction===
The real Donohue has a still of himself wearing the papal mitre from this episode displayed in his office. He sums up the plot as "In the episode, they have me overthrow the pope because the pope is a wimp, and then I take over the church and give it some guts. ... But in the end, Jesus kills me".&lt;ref name="Donohue NYT story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vitello|first=Paul|title=A 'Marine' for Catholics Sees a Time of Battle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/nyregion/15donohue.html|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 2009|accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]  of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[Emperor of India|Emperor of]] [[British Raj|India]] occurred on Friday, 20 May 1910.

The funeral was the largest gathering of [[European royalty]] ever to take place, with representatives of 70 states, and the last before many royal families were deposed in [[World War I]] and its aftermath.{{sfn|Tuchman|2014|p=1}}

==Organisation==
King Edward VII had died on 6 May, and the funeral was held two weeks later.  Huge crowds gathered to watch the procession, which passed from [[Buckingham Palace]] to [[Westminster Hall]], where a small ceremony was conducted by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Randall Davidson]], before a small group of official mourners – the late King's widow, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], his son [[George V|King George V]], his daughter [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|The Princess Victoria]], his brother the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]], and his nephew the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]]. The remainder of the [[funeral|funeral party]] waited outside the Hall, consisting of thousands of people. Then the whole procession proceeded via [[Whitehall]] and [[The Mall, London|the Mall]], from [[Hyde Park Corner]] up to the [[Marble Arch]], and thence to [[Paddington Station]]. From there, a train conveyed the mourners to [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. The procession then continued on to [[Windsor Castle]], and a full funeral ceremony was held in [[St George's Chapel]].

'''HMS ''Friday''''' is an [[urban myth]] concerning a disastrous attempt by the [[Royal Navy]] to dispel the [[Friday#Folklore|superstition against sailing on a Friday]]. While widely circulated, the story is in fact untrue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top 10 Superstitions About Boating|url=http://www.popyachts.com/Page/Site-Post-List/111/The-Top-10-Superstitions-About-Boating.html | accessdate = 2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, there was never even a ship named HMS ''Friday''.&lt;ref&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of the story vary, but it usually follows this form:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sometime in the 19th century, the Royal Navy attempted to finally dispel the old superstition among sailors that beginning a voyage on a Friday was certain to bring bad luck. To demonstrate the falseness of this belief, they decided to commission a ship named HMS ''Friday''. Her keel was laid on a Friday, she was launched on a Friday, and she set sail on her [[maiden voyage]] on [[Friday the 13th]], under the command of a Captain James Friday. She was never seen or heard from again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This story, in numerous variations, is frequently recounted, often as fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geekswithblogs.net/mtreadwell/archive/2004/04/16/3995.aspx |title=Nautical Folklore: Superstition of Friday |accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lennox&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lennox |first=Doug |title=Now You Know: The Book of Answers |page=110 |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd. |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ea_2cNCGmfIC&amp;pg=PA109-IA1&amp;dq=hms+friday |isbn=1-55002-461-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/friday_the_13th_3.htm |title=Why Friday the 13th Is Unlucky |publisher=about.com |accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/friday13th.html |title=Friday the 13th |publisher=Infoplease |accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vigor&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vigor |first=John |title=The Practical Encyclopedia of Boating |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLg6Lx5yRP0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA258&amp;lpg=RA1-PA258&amp;dq=hms+friday |isbn=0-07-137885-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared as a small "filler" item in the magazine "Reader's Digest", its format giving the impression of having been historically researched.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A competition was won by a team of architects from [[Vienna]], [[Ferdinand Fellner]] and [[Hermann Helmer]]. They erected the building from 1892 to 1894 in [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque Revival style]], following models in [[Prague]] and [[Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.structurae.info/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0023189 |title=Hessisches Staatstheater |year=2006 |publisher=structurae.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inauguration was on 16 October 1894 in the presence of the emperor. The [[Foyer]] was built in 1902 by architect [[Felix Genzmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bauwerk-weimar.de/referenzen/projekte/2004_hesstheat.php |title=Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden |year=2004 |publisher=bauwerk-weimar.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905033012/http://www.bauwerk-weimar.de/referenzen/projekte/2004_hesstheat.php |archivedate=2011-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves three stages.

After [[World War I]] the theatre was renamed "Preußisches Staatstheater" (Prussian State Theatre). Since 1932 the city of Wiesbaden was responsible for the theatre, therefore it was renamed "Nassauisches Landestheater" (Theater of the Province [[Hesse-Nassau|Nassau]]).

The building was seriously damaged in [[World War II]] by a bomb on 3 February 1945. The front was restored in a simplified way and the ceiling of the hall was decorated with a contemporary painting.

In 1946 the State of Hesse took over the operation of the theatre. In 1947 it was used again and called "Großhessisches Staatstheater" (State Theater of Great Hesse), later "Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden".

From 1975 to 1978 the auditorium was restored according to the historic model. The technical equipment was modernized.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebn24.com/index.php?id=32249 |title=Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden |language=German |author=Achim Thorwald |accessdate=27 April 2011 |publisher=European Business Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new tract was built, designed by [[Hardt-Waltherr Hämer]], for rehearsal rooms, workshops and administration.

== Performance facilities ==

[[File:Staatstheater Wiesbaden Zuschauersaa012.JPG|thumb|''Großes Haus'']]
The theatre has four stages, three of them in the historic house: 
* Großes Haus (Great House) with 1,041 seats.
* Kleines Haus (Small House) with 328 seats.
* Studio with 89 seats. 
* Wartburg, from 2003, is an additional small separate stage.

The staff consist of about 600 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deu.archinform.net/projekte/6990.htm |title=Hessisches Staatstheater |language=German |year=2011 |publisher=archinform.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually more than 25 new operas, plays and ballets have been produced.&lt;ref name="AT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturpur.de/de/deutschland/buehnen/buehne/hessisches+staatstheater+wiesbaden/beschreibung/ |title=Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden |language=German |year=2011 |publisher=Kultur in Deutschland Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is especially dedicated to a young audience, collaborating with schools for "Schultheatertage". A professional ensemble, "Junges Staatstheater" (Young State Theater) is dedicated to children's and youth theater.&lt;ref name="AT" /&gt;

In addition to the annual [[Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden|Internationale Maifestspiele]] in May, since 2004 a biennial festival "Neue Stücke aus Europa" (New European Plays) is organized in collaboration with the [[Staatstheater Mainz]], presenting in ten days new plays in the original language with simultaneous translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesbaden.de/en/culture/theatre/hessian_state_theatre/hessian_state_theatre.php |title=Hessian State Theatre |year=2011 |publisher=Wiesbaden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5125">'''Hippo Eats Dwarf''' is the title of a [[hoax]] news article which claims that a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] was accidentally eaten by a [[hippopotamus]]. The [[urban legend]] has been circulating via the internet since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/weblog/comments/2523/ |title=Hippo Eats Dwarf (Comments) |publisher=Museumofhoaxes.com |date=2005-02-23 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many print newspapers have been fooled into publishing the story as fact.

==Story==
The story goes that a freak accident occurred at a circus during an act involving a dwarf bouncing on a trampoline.  The dwarf jumped sideways off the trampoline just at the moment a hippopotamus had decided to yawn.  The dwarf landed in the hippo's yawning mouth and was abruptly, and accidentally, swallowed whole.  The audience applauded until they realised this was not part of the show and the true horror set in.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

Euan Ferguson writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2003 said the story is a marvelous metaphor for the reality that "Life is not safe. You can't plan for disaster.  The hippo can get you at any time."&lt;ref name="Qjabout"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ewan |first1=Ferguson |title=Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.  Further reproduction prohibited without permission. Isn't there something a little Qjabout all this? |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/478367853/fulltextPDF/42EA64C94D894E5DPQ/3?accountid=10226 |accessdate=29 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |date=25 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to ''[[Snopes]]'', the hoax news story began circulating on the internet with a [[Usenet]] post in 1994.  The story was allegedly taken from the [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'' magazine]] which in turn, again according to ''Snopes'', attributed it to the ''Las Vegas Sun''.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/hippoeatsdwarf.asp |title=Hippo Eats Dwarf |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to Alex Boese, the story cannot be found in back issues of either the ''Sun'' or ''National Lampoon''.&lt;ref name=Boese&gt;Alex Boese, ''Hippo Eats Dwarf!'', p. 1, Pan Macmillan, 2010 {{ISBN|0330521306}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original story was set in an Austrian circus, the hippo was named Hilda, and the dwarf was named Franz Dasch.  In 1999, a new version of the story appeared in the ''Pattaya Mail'' in Thailand.  The setting had changed to northern Thailand and the hippo was called Od.  The ''Pattaya Mail'' story was republihed by several Australian papers including the [[Daily Telegraph (Australia)|''Daily Telegraph'']], the [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|''Advertiser'']], and the [[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|''Sunday Mail'']]&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; The story reached the UK in the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]''.&lt;ref name=Boese/&gt;

==In comedy==
[[Karl Pilkington]], of ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'', once told the story in a segment called "Educating Ricky" in which Karl believed the story to be true. This led to both [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]] laughing hysterically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfSa7u6KnWY |title=karl Pilkington talks about a hippo |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Lewis Black]] references it in a joke during a stand-up appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/df7aez/stand-up-hippo-eats-dwarf&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedy site [[Funny or Die]] published a comedic version of the story in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.funnyordie.com/2009/4/17/17737020/hippo-eats-dwarf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
A book entitled ''Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S.'', written by Alex Boese, takes its name from the popular hoax. It was published in 2006.&lt;ref name="HarmonReview"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harmon |first1=Rick |title=Hippo Eats Dwarf puts some rumors to rest (book review |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/412866396/fulltext/A45A4A6F208B43AAPQ/6?accountid=10226 |accessdate=29 October 2018 |publisher=[[Montgomery Advertiser]] |date=11 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MapesReview"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mapes |first1=Terry |title=Book shows you really can fool all of the people some of the time (book review) |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/441394972/fulltext/A45A4A6F208B43AAPQ/7?accountid=10226 |accessdate=29 October 2018 |publisher=[[News Journal (Ohio)|News Journal]] |date=11 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PWReview"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S. |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-15-603083-0 |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BorrowsonReview"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Borrowson |first1=Warren |title=Book about hoaxes is short on research (book review) |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/439344307/807D907C0BF340D0PQ/25?accountid=10226 |accessdate=29 October 2018 |publisher=[[Daily Record (Morristown)|Daily Record]] |date=18 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jesus|expanded=in Islam}}
The issue of the [[crucifixion]], death and resurrection of [[Jesus]] (''[[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]'') is rejected by most [[Muslim]]s, but similar to Christians they believe that Jesus will return before the [[Islamic eschatology|end of time]]. Most Muslims believe [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus was not crucified]], but was raised bodily to [[heaven]] by [[God in Islam|God]]. A similar belief is found in the [[Gospel of Basilides]], the text of which is lost save for reports of it by other early scholars like [[Origen]] (c. 185 – c. 254). [[Basilides]], a theologian of [[Gnostic]] tendencies, taught in Alexandria in the second quarter of the second century. However, this view is disregarded by mainstream Christianity which only accepts the four gospels contained in the [[New Testament]] as genuine. The general Islamic view supporting the denial of crucifixion was probably influenced by [[Manichaenism]] ([[Docetism]]), which holds that someone else was crucified instead of Jesus, while concluding that Jesus will return during the end-times.&lt;ref&gt;Joel L. Kraemer ''Israel Oriental Studies XII'' BRILL 1992 {{ISBN|9789004095847}} p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the interpretation of the following verse, Muslim scholars have abstracted different opinions. Some believe that in the Biblical account, Jesus's crucifixion did not last long enough for him to die, while others opine that God gave someone Jesus's appearance or someone else replaced Jesus and the executioners thought the victim was Jesus, causing everyone to believe that Jesus was crucified. A third explanation could be that Jesus was nailed to a cross, but as his body is immortal he did not "die" or was not "crucified" [to death]; it only appeared so (this view is rare). In opposition to the second and third foregoing proposals, yet others maintain that God does not use deceit and therefore they contend that crucifixion just did not occur. The basis of all of these beliefs is the interpretation of this verse in the [[Qur'an]]:

{{quote|That they said (in boast), "We killed [[Christ]] Jesus the son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the [[Messengers of Islam|Messenger]] of [[Allah]]";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:-&lt;br&gt;Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise;-|Qur'an, [[sura]] 4 ([[An-Nisa]]) [[ayah|ayat]] 157–158&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Todd|date=1 March 2009|title=The Crucifixion and the Quran: A Study in the History of Muslim Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|location=|publisher=Oneworld Publications|page=12|isbn=1851686355}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Earliest reports==
{{POV section|date=February 2018}}
Most Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died,&lt;ref name="Toward An Islamic Christology II"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|author-link=Mahmoud M. Ayoub|last2=|first2=|date=April 1980|title=TOWARDS AN ISLAMIC CHRISTOLOGY II: THE DEATH OF JESUS, REALITY OR DELUSION (A Study of the Death of Jesus in Tafsir Literature)|url=|journal=The Muslim World|publisher=Hartford Seminary|volume=70|issue=2|pages=106|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1980.tb03405.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir have elaborated an argument in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.

Professor and scholar [[Mahmoud M. Ayoub]] sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments:

{{quote|The Quran, as we have already argued, does not deny the death of Christ. Rather, it challenges human beings who in their folly have deluded themselves into believing that they would vanquish the divine Word, Jesus Christ the Messenger of God. The death of Jesus is asserted several times and in various contexts.|3:55; 5:117; 19:33.&lt;ref name="Toward An Islamic Christology II"/&gt;}}

Some disagreement and discord can be seen beginning with Ibn Ishaq's (d. 761 CE/130 AH) report of a brief accounting of events leading up to the crucifixion, firstly stating that Jesus was replaced by someone named Sergius, while secondly reporting an account of Jesus' tomb being located at Medina and thirdly citing the places in the Qur'an (3:55; 4:158) that God took Jesus up to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watt |first=William Montgomery |author-link=W.

An early interpretation of verse 3:55 (specifically "I will cause you to die and raise you to myself"), [[Al-Tabari]] (d. 923 CE/310 AH) records an interpretation attributed to [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Ibn 'Abbas]], who used the literal ''"I will cause you to die"'' (mumayyitu-ka) in place of the metaphorical mutawaffi-ka ''"Jesus died"'', while [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]], an early Jewish convert, is reported to have said "''God caused Jesus, son of Mary, to die for three hours during the day, then took him up to himself."''

[[Al-Masudi]] (d. 956 CE/343 AH) reported the death of Christ under [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 47"&gt;Watt 1991, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Qur'anic commentators seem to have concluded the denial of the crucifixion of Jesus by following material interpreted in Tafsir that relied upon [[Apocrypha|extra-biblical sources]], venturing away from the message conveyed in the Qur'an,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; with the earliest textual evidence having originated from a non-Muslim source; a misreading of the Christian writings of [[John of Damascus]] regarding the literal understandings of [[Docetism]] (exegetical doctrine describing spiritual and physical realities of Jesus as understood by men in logical terms) as opposed to their figurative explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 page 7].&lt;/ref&gt; John of Damascus highlighted the Qur'an's assertion that the Jews did not crucify Jesus being very different from saying that Jesus was not crucified, explaining that it is the varied Quranic exegetes in Tafsir, and not the Qur'an itself, that denies the crucifixion, further stating that the message in the 4:157 verse simply affirms the historicity of the event.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lawson 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 page 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Book of the Sage and Disciple|Ja'far ibn Mansur al-Yaman]] (d. 347 AH/958 CE), [[Abu Hatim Ahmad ibn Hamdan al-Razi]] (d. 322 AH/935 CE), [[Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani]] (d. 358 AH/971 CE), [[Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi]] (d. 470 AH/1078 CE ) and the group [[Ikhwan al-Safa]] also affirm the historicity of the Crucifixion, reporting Jesus was crucified and not substituted by another man as maintained by many other popular Qur'anic commentators and Tafsir.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In reference to the Quranic quote "We have surely killed Jesus the Christ, son of Mary, the apostle of God", Muslim scholar Mahmoud Ayoub asserts this boast not as the repeating of a historical lie or the perpetuating of a false report, but an example of human arrogance and folly with an attitude of contempt towards God and His messenger(s). Ayoub furthers what modern scholars of Islam interpret regarding the historical death of Jesus, the man, as man's inability to kill off God's Word and the Spirit of God, which the Quran testifies were embodied in Jesus Christ. Ayoub continues highlighting the denial of the killing of Jesus as God denying men such power to vanquish and destroy the divine Word. The words, "they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him" speaks to the profound events of ephemeral human history, exposing mankind's heart and conscience towards God's will. The claim of humanity to have this power against God is illusory. "They did not slay him...but it seemed so to them" speaks to the imaginations of mankind, not the denial of the actual event of Jesus dying physically on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub 1980, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesus lives==
Discussing the interpretation of those scholars who deny the crucifixion, the [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} writes:

{{Quote|The denial, furthermore, is in perfect agreement with the logic of the Quran. The Biblical stories reproduced in it (e.g., [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]], [[Moses]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], etc.) and the episodes relating to the history of the beginning of [[Islam]] demonstrate that it is "God's practice" (''[[sunnat Allah]]'') to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. "So truly with hardship comes ease", (XCIV, 5, 6). For Jesus to die on the cross would have meant the triumph of his executioners; but the Quran asserts that they undoubtedly failed: "Assuredly God will defend those who believe"; (XXII, 49). He confounds the plots of the enemies of Christ (III, 54).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}}}

===Jesus lives after having died===
In regard to the interpretation of the Muslims who accept the crucifixion, [[Mahmoud M. Ayoud|Mahmoud Ayoub]] states:

{{Quote|The Qur'an is not here speaking about a man, righteous and wronged though he may be, but about the Word of God who was sent to earth and returned to God. Thus the denial of killing of Jesus is a denial of the power of men to vanquish and destroy the divine Word, which is for ever victorious.&lt;ref&gt;The death of Jesus: Reality or Delusion. ''Muslim World'' 70 (1980) pp. 91–121&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Substitution interpretation===
{{Death of Jesus}}
{{see also|Gospel of Basilides|Gospel of Barnabas|Substitution hypothesis|Swoon hypothesis|
Unknown years of Jesus|
}}
Unlike the Christian view of the death of Jesus, most Muslims believe he was raised to Heaven without being put on the cross and God created a resemblance to appear exactly like Jesus who was crucified instead of Jesus. Muslims believe Jesus ascended bodily to Heaven, there to remain until his [[Second Coming of Christ|Second coming]] in the [[End time|End days]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Gabriel Said. "The Muslim Jesus: Dead or alive?" Bulletin of SOAS, 72(2) (2009), 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the substitute has been a source of great interest among Muslims. One proposal is that God used one of Jesus' enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Gabriel Said. "The Muslim Jesus: Dead or alive?" Bulletin of SOAS, 72(2) (2009), 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judas Iscariot]], Jesus' betrayer, is often cited, and is mentioned in the [[Gospel of Barnabas]]. The second proposal is that Jesus asked for someone to volunteer to be crucified instead of him.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Gabriel Said. "The Muslim Jesus: Dead or alive?" Bulletin of SOAS, 72(2) (2009), 242.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon of Cyrene]] is the person most commonly accepted to have done it, perhaps because according to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] he was compelled by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to carry Jesus' cross for him (there is no indication in the Gospels that he volunteered).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} [[Baidawi|Al-Baidawi]] writes that Jesus told his [[Disciples of Jesus in Islam|disciples]] in advance that whoever volunteered would go to [[Jannah|heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman ''The Meaning and Explanation of the Glorious Qur'an (Vol 10)'' MSA Publication Limited 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-861-79670-7}} page 93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tabari's versions of events====
[[Tabari]] (d. 839–923/ 224–310 AH) divided the early reports regarding Jesus crucifixion into two groups. According to the first, one of Jesus disciples volunteers to take the form of his master and is crucified. According to the other, the Jew mistakenly carried only an empty resemblance to the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson Christ in Islam and Christianity SUNY Press 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} p 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabari narrated the first strand as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Jesus went into a house together with seventeen of his companions. The Jew surrounded them but when they burst in God made all the disciples look like Jesus. The pursuers, supposing that they had bewitched them, threatened to kill them all if they did not expose him. Then Jesus asked his companions which of them would purchase paradise for himself thath day. One man volunteered and went out saying that he was Jesus and as God had made him look like Jesus they took him, killed him and crucified him. Thereupon "a semblance was made to them" and they thought that they had killed Jesus. The Christians likewise thought that it was Jesus who had been killed. And God raised Jesus right away.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson Christ in Islam and Christianity SUNY Press 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} p 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second strand is narrated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Jews were looking for Jesus. They took hold of Simon, one of the disciples, and they said, "This is one of his companions." And he denied it and said, "I am not one of his disciples." So they left him. Others took hold of him and he likewise denied it. Then he heard the sound of the cock and he wept and it grieved him. 'On the morning of the next day one of his disciples went to the Jew and said, "What will you give me if I lead you to the Messiah?" He accepted their offer of thirty dirhams and led them to him. And a semblance had been made for them before that, and they took him and made certain of him and bound him with a cord and began to lead him and to say to him "You used to bring the dead to life and to drive away [[Satan#Islam|Satan]] and heal the [[Exorcism in Islam|jinn-possessed]] so why not deliver yourself from this cord?" And they spat on him and cast thorns on him until they brought him to the wood upon which they wanted to crucify him. And God raised Jesus to Himself. And they crucified the semblance which was made to them. And [Jesus] tarried seven [hours]. 'Then his mother, and the woman whom God had freed from jinn-possession when Jesus treated her, came weeping to where the crucified [semblance] was. And Jesus came to them both and said, "Why are you weeping?" They said, "Because of You." He said, "God raised me to Himself and I came to no harm. This [corpse] is something which was "made a semblance to them". Order the disciples to meet me at such and such place." Eleven met him at the place. Jesus missed the one who had sold him. They said, "Because he regretted what he had done he commited suicide by strangling himself." Jesus replied, "If he had turned towards God, God would have turned toward him".&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson Christ in Islam and Christianity SUNY Press 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} p 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Ibn Kathir's version of events====
[[Ibn Kathir]] (d. 1373 CE/760 AH) follows traditions which suggest that a crucifixion did occur, but not with Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; After the event, Ibn Kathir reports the people were divided into three groups following three different narratives; The [[Jacob Baradaeus|Jacobites]] believing 'God remained with us as long as He willed and then He ascended to Heaven;' The [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]] believing 'The son of God was with us as long as he willed until God raised him to heaven;' and the third group of Christians who believing; 'The servant and messenger of God, Jesus, remained with us as long as God willed until God raised him to Himself.'&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Hadith|narration]] recorded in the Qur'anic [[Tafsir|exegesis]] of [[Ibn Kathir]] verse is related to the substitution of Jesus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[['Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] said, "Just before God raised Jesus to the Heavens, Jesus went to his disciples, who were twelve inside the house. When he arrived, his hair was dripping with water (as if he had just had a bath) and he said, 'There are those among you who will disbelieve in me twelve times after you had believed in me.' He then asked, 'Who among you will volunteer for his appearance to be transformed into mine, and be killed in my place. Whoever volunteers for that, he will be with me (in [[Paradise]]).' One of the youngest ones among them volunteered, but Jesus asked him to sit down. Jesus asked again for a volunteer, and the same young man volunteered and Jesus asked him to sit down again. Then the young man volunteered a third time and Jesus said, 'You will be that man,' and the resemblance of Jesus was cast over that man while Jesus ascended to Heaven from a hole in the roof of the house. When the Jews came looking for Jesus, they found that young man and crucified him. Some of Jesus' followers disbelieved in him twelve times after they had believed in him. They then divided into three groups. One group, the [[Jacob Baradaeus|Jacobites]], said, 'God remained with us as long as He willed and then ascended to Heaven.' Another group, the [[Church of the East|Nestorians]], said, 'The son of God was with us as long as he willed and God took him to Heaven.' Another group of Christians who said, 'The servant and Messenger of God remained with us as long as God willed, and God then took him to Him.' The two disbelieving groups cooperated against that third Christian group and they killed them. Ever since that happened, Islam was then veiled until God sent Muhammad." - [[Al-Nasa'i]]|''Al-Kubra'', 6:489{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At another place in his Quranic exegesis, Ibn Kathir narrates the story as follows: 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;(The people conspiring against Jesus) envied him because of his prophethood and obvious miracles; curing the blind and leprous and bringing the dead back to life, by God's leave. He also used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow in it, and it became a bird by God's leave and flew. 'Jesus performed other miracles that God honored him with, yet some defied and belied him and tried their best to harm him. God's Prophet 'Jesus could not live in any one city for long and he had to travel often with his mother, peace be upon them. Even so, some of the Jews were not satisfied, and they went to the king of Damascus at that time, a Greek polytheist who worshipped the stars. They told him that there was a man in Bayt Al-Maqdis misguiding and dividing the people in Jerusalem and stirring unrest among the king's subjects. The king became angry and wrote to his deputy in Jerusalem to arrest the rebel leader, stop him from causing unrest, crucify him and make him wear a crown of thorns. When the king's deputy in Jerusalem received these orders, he went with some Jews to the house that 'Jesus was residing in, and he was then with twelve, thirteen or seventeen of his companions. That day was a Friday, in the evening. They surrounded 'Jesus in the house, and when he felt that they would soon enter the house or that he would sooner or later have to leave it, he said to his companions, “Who volunteers to be made to look like me, for which he will be my companion in Paradise.”' A young man volunteered, but 'Jesus thought that he was too young. He asked the question a second and third time, each time the young man volunteering, prompting 'Jesus to say, “Well then, you will be that man.” God made the young man look exactly like 'Jesus, while a hole opened in the roof of the house, and 'Jesus was made to sleep and ascended to heaven while asleep. God said, “O 'Jesus! I will take you and raise you to myself.” When 'Jesus ascended, those who were in the house came out. When those surrounding the house saw the man who looked like Jesus, they thought that he was Jesus. So they took him at night, crucified him and placed a crown of thorns on his head. They then boasted that they killed Jesus'. Some Christians accepted their false claim, due to their ignorance and lack of reason. As for those who were in the house with Jesus, witnessed his ascension to heaven, while the rest thought that the Jews killed 'Jesus by crucifixion. They even said that Marry sat under the corpse of the crucified man and cried, and they say that the dead man spoke to her. All this was a test from God for His servants out of His wisdom. God explained this matter in the Glorious Quran which He sent to His honorable Messenger, whom He supported with miracles and clear, unequivocal evidence. God is the Most Truthful, and He is the Lord of the worlds Who knows the secrets, what the hearts conceal, the hidden matters in heaven and earth, what has occurred, what will occur, and what would occur if it was decreed. - Kathir I. , Tafsir Ibn Kathir{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Barnabas' version of events====
The [[Gospel of Barnabas]] (dated to the late 16th or early 17th centuries), also promotes a non-death narrative. The Gospel of Barnabas has been considered to be pseudo-biographical, or a false work, to the majority of western scholars. However, some academics suggest that it may contain some remnants of an earlier work (perhaps Gnostic, Ebionite or Diatessaronic), redacted to bring it more in line with Islamic doctrine.

According to the Gospel of Barnabas it was Judas, not Jesus, who was crucified on the cross. This work states that Judas' appearance was transformed to that of Jesus', when the former, out of betrayal, led the Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus who by then had already ascended to the heavens. The narrative states this transformation of appearance was unnoticed by the followers of Christ and his mother Mary. The Gospel of Barnabas then mentions that after three days since burial, Judas' body was stolen from his grave with rumors spreading of Jesus being risen from the dead. In following with Islamic lore, when Jesus was informed in the third heaven about what happened he prayed to God to be sent back to the earth, and later descended and gathered his mother, disciples, and followers and told them the truth of what happened. He then ascended back to the heavens, with the narrative continuing Islamic legend mirroring Christian doctrine of returning at the end of times as a just king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Īsā|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Brill Online|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/isa-COM_0378|accessdate=5 Aug 2018|last=Anawati|first=G.C.|date=5 Aug 2018|origyear=2012|editor=P.

===Docetism theory===
A less common opinion among Islamic scholars hold that the crucifixion of Jesus was just an illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 871&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Jesus' body was really put on the cross, but his spirit did not die, but ascended to heaven. Thus the Jew erred because they did not recognized the "Messiah", the spiritual form of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Union européenne des arabisants et islamisants. Congress ''Authority, Privacy and Public Order in Islam: Proceedings of the 22nd Congress of L'Union Européenne Des Arabisants Et Islamisants'' Peeters Publishers 2006 {{ISBN|978-9-042-91736-1}} page 97&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Docetism|Docetist]]s were some sects of early Christians who believed that Jesus' physical body was an illusion, as was his crucifixion; that is, Jesus only seemed to have a physical body and to physically die, but in reality he was incorporeal, a pure spirit, and hence could not physically die.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
 
The [[Gospel of Peter]] is a docetic gospel. F. F. Bruce writes in a commentary of this gospel (Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament, p.&amp;nbsp;93):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The docetic note in this narrative appears in the statement that Jesus, while being crucified, 'remained silent, as though he felt no pain', and in the account of his death. It carefully avoids saying that he died, preferring to say that he 'was taken up', as though he - or at least his soul or spiritual self - was 'assumed' direct from the cross to the presence of God. (We shall see an echo of this idea in the Qur'an.) Then the cry of dereliction is reproduced in a form which suggests that, at that moment, his divine power left the bodily shell in which it had taken up temporary residence."''{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another scholar, Leirvik, believes that Quran and Hadith to have been influenced by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

{{quote|"If the substitutionist interpretation (Christ replaced on the cross) is taken as a valid reading of the Qur'anic text, the question arises of whether this idea is represented in Christian sources. According to [[Irenaeus]]' ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'', the Egyptian Gnostic Christian [[Basilides]] (2nd century) held the view that Christ (the divine ''[[nous]]'', intelligence) was not crucified, but was replaced by Simon of Cyrene. However, both [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] denied that Basilides held this view. But the substitutionist idea in general form is quite clearly expressed in the Gnostic [[Nag Hammadi]] documents ''[[Gnostic Apocalypse of Peter]]'' and ''[[Second Treatise of the Great Seth|The Second Treatise of the Great Seth]]''."''&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 39-40"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 Watt 1991, p. 39-40.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Acts of John]] is also a docetic gospel. It is a collection of narratives and traditions ascribed to [[John the Apostle]], who was the author of the [[Gospel of John]]. It is long known in fragmentary form. Together with the [[Acts of Paul]] it is considered one of the most significant of the apostolic Acts in the [[New Testament apocrypha]]. It was condemned as a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] heresy by the Church.
 
Chapter 101 of this work continues with phrases like "Therefore I have suffered none of the things which they will say of me", "You hear that I have suffered, yet I have suffered not," and "(they say) that I was pierced, but I was not wounded; that I was hanged, but I was not hanged; that blood flowed from me, yet it did not flow; and, in a word, those things that they say of me I did not endure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Swoon theory===
Some modern Muslim scholars believe that Jesus was actually crucified on the cross but didn't die, instead pretending to be dead, or that he fell unconscious ("swooned") and was later revived in the tomb in the same mortal body. Accordingly, His appearances after three days in the tomb were merely perceived to be resurrection appearances. These types of theories are also known as [[swoon theory]]. These theories were first proposed by 17th or 18th century western scholars.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Muslim preacher [[Ahmed Deedat]] of South Africa wrote several books, one particularly entitled ''Crucifixion or Cruci-fiction'' along with many video lectures widely printed and distributed all over the Muslim World. He takes a critical look at the events from the canonial four Gospels and theorizes an alternative scenario of what really happened, a scenario very similar to the swoon theory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
  
Another Muslim Scholar [[Zakir Naik]] also uses these theories in a debate with Pastor Ruknuddin Henry Pio.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
 
===Japanese Christian claims===
There are some Christian sects in Japan who believe in a similar substitution though this theory contradicts with other Muslim beliefs about Jesus. According to  local Japanese Christian sects, Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead his younger brother, Isukiri,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060825022848/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyotravel/tokyojapantravel/3523/tokyojapantravelinc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; took his place on the cross, while Jesus fled across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan. Once in Japan, he became a rice farmer, married, and raised a family with three daughters near what is now Shingō. While in Japan, it is asserted that he traveled, learned, and eventually died at the age of 106. His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years. According to the customs of the time, Jesus' bones were collected, bundled, and buried in the mound purported to be the grave of Jesus Christ&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/5326614.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070310200846/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/110_japson.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;.There is also a museum in Japan which has "evidence" of these claims.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-little-known-legend-of-jesus-in-japan-165354242/&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[Shingō, Aomori]]

==The Islamic interpretation of the events at the end of Jesus' earthly life==
{{Islam}}
Some Islamic scholars like [[Sheikh]] [[Mohammed al-Ghazali]] (not [[Imam]] [[Ghazali|al-Ghazali]]) and [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] argue that Jesus was rescued but was given death by God before he was ascended bodily as God never allows His messengers to be dishonored, even their dead bodies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Thomas McElwain states that the context of the verse is clearly within the discussion of [[Judaism|Jewish]] ridicule of Christians, not in context of whether or not Jesus died. He continues that the text could be interpreted as denying the death of Jesus at the hands of [[Jews]] rather than denying his death. He adds, however, "the expressions against the crucifixion are strong, so that to interpret the meaning for Romans rather than Jews to have committed the act is also suspect" and that if this meaning is correct, "it would have been more effective to state that the Romans killed Jesus, rather than to emphasise that the Jews were not in possession of the facts."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

According to some translations, Jesus says in the Qur'an:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness. - Qur'an, sura 5 ([[Al-Ma'ida]]) ayah 117&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majority of Muslims translate the verb "mutawafik" (متوفيك) "to terminate after a period of time" while others translate it "to die of natural causes".{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Islamic scholars like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi consider it as the physical death of Jesus, and hence question the return of Jesus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] discusses different interpretations of the Qur'anic chapter 19, verse 33 and writes in his conclusion that "the cumulative effect of the Qur'anic verse is strongly in favor of a real death".&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Parrinder]], ''Jesus in the Quran'', p.121, Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 1996. {{ISBN|1-85168-094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This verse could also refer to the Second Coming of Jesus.

The following minority of translations or translators translate "to die":

* [[George Sale]]
* Mohamed Ahmed{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* [[Maulana Muhammad Ali]]
* Free Minds Muslims{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* [[Ghulam Ahmed Pervez]]

However, the majority of Qur'anic translators,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} including [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], [[Muhammad Habib Shakir]] and [[Marmaduke Pickthall]], do not translate as "to die".

[[Ibn Babawayh]] (d.991 CE) in ''Ikhmal ad Din'' recounts that Jesus went to a far country. This was adapted by the [[Ahmadiyya]] as the basis of their [[Lost years of Jesus|Jesus in India theory]]&lt;ref name="ShaeferCohen"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schäfer|first=Peter|last2=Cohen|first2=Mark R.|title=Toward the Millennium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco|year=1998|location=Leiden/Princeton|publisher=Brill/Princeton UP|isbn=90-04-11037-2|page=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is promoted also by writers such as [[Holger Kersten]] (1981). They claim Jesus is buried at the [[Roza Bal]] shrine in Srinagar. However, the Sunni Muslim authorities at the shrine deny this as heretical and say that it is a Muslim saint buried there. The claims of the theory have been examined in documentaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/did-jesus-die-interview.shtml|title=BBC iPlayer - Error|website=BBC iPlayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generated tourist visits to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8587838.stm|title=Tourists flock to 'Jesus's tomb' in Kashmir|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 November 2010|first=Sam|last=Miller|date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly reception has consistently dismissed the theories, such as Norbert Klatt (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Klatt, ''Lebte Jesus in Indien?'', Göttingen: Wallstein 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and labelled speculation by Indologist [[Günter Grönbold]] (1985).

[[David Marshall Lang]] stated in his 1957 book ''The Wisdom of Balahvar'' that confusion in [[Diacritic|diacritical markings]] in Arabic documents resulted in confusing Kashmir and [[Kushinagar|Kushinara]] (the place of Buddha's death) with the place of the death of Jesus.&lt;ref name=DMLang/&gt; Lang has stated that the term Budhasaf (Buddha-to-be) became Yudasaf, Iodasaph, and then Yuzasaf, and resulted in the assertions of Jesus being buried in Srinagar.&lt;ref name=DMLang&gt;In ''[[The Journal of Ecclesiastical History]]'' Volume 18, Issue 02, October 1967, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7804863 pp 247-248], John Rippon summarizes the work of [[David Marshall Lang]] on the subject as follows: "In ''The Wisdom of Balahvar'' Professor Lang assembled the evidence for the Buddhist origins of the legends of the Christian saints Barlaam and Josephat. He suggested the importance of Arabic intermediaries, showing that confusion of diacritical markings turned Budhasaf (Bodhisattva, the Buddha-to-be) into Yudasaf, Iodasaph, Yuzasaf and Josaphat. By a curious roundabout journey this error reappears in once Buddhist Kashmir where the modern Ahmadiyya Muslims, well known for their Woking mosque, claim that a tomb of Yus Asad was the tomb of Jesus who died in Kashmir, after having been taken down live from the cross; though the Bombay Arabic edition of the book Balahvar makes its hero die in Kashmir, by confusion with Kushinara the traditional place of the Buddha's death."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 (in ''Jesus i Kashmir: Historien om en legend'') and then in 2011, [[Per Beskow]] also stated that confusion about the traditions regarding [[Gautama Buddha]] in the [[Bilawhar wa-Yudasaf]] legend had resulted in the confused assumption that Jesus was Yuzasaf and was buried in [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Per Beskow]] in ''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus'' ed. Delbert Burkett 2011 {{ISBN|140519362X}} "During the transmission of the legend, this name underwent several changes: to Budhasaf, Yudasaf, and finally Yuzasaf. In Greek, his name is Ioasaph; in Latin, Josaphat, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadiyya view===
{{Main|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}
Similar to mainstream Islamic views, the [[Ahmadiyya Movement]] consider Jesus was a mortal man, but go a step further to describe Jesus as a mortal man who died a natural death in [[India]] as opposed to having been raised alive to Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alislam.org/library/articles/death-of-hazrat-jesus/&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of Jesus having migrated to India had also been researched in the literature of authors independent of and predating the foundation of the movement but has almost universally been dismissed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8023">'''The Killer in the Backseat''' (also known as '''[[Headlamp|High Beams]]''') is a common, car-crime [[urban legend]] well known mostly in the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brunvand |first= Jan Harold |authorlink= Jan Harold Brunvand |title= Encyclopedia of Urban Legends, Updated and Expanded Edition |location= Santa Barbara, California |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2012 |page= 361 |volume= Vol. 1 |ISBN= 978-1-59884-720-8 |quote= Although other car-crime legends are well known abroad, 'The Killer in the Backseat' does not seem to have taken root very strongly outside North America.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first noted by folklorist Carlos Drake in 1968 in texts collected by Indiana University students.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Carlos. "The Killer in the Backseat." ''Indiana Folklore'' 1 (1968), 107-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The legend involves a woman who is driving and being followed by a car or truck. The mysterious pursuer flashes his [[headlamp|high beams]], [[tailgating|tailgates]] her, and sometimes even rams her vehicle. When she finally makes it home, she realizes that the driver was trying to warn her that there was a man (a [[murderer]], or escaped [[mental patient]]) hiding in her back seat. Each time the man sat up to attack her, the driver behind had used his high beams to scare the killer, causing him to duck back down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bronner |first= Simon J. |title= American Children's Folklore |authorlink= Simon J. Bronner |location= Little Rock |publisher= August House Publishers |year= 1988 |page= 149 |ISBN= 978-08748-306-8-2 |quote= ... Suddenly, I realized what was happening and did the first thing I could think of. I flashed my brights to warn her. I saw the figure quickly disappear. I followed the car home and flashed my brights each time I saw the figure. After she ran in the house, I told her to call the police...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some versions, the woman stops for gas, and the attendant asks her to come inside to sort out a problem with her [[credit card]]. Inside the station, he asks if she knows there's a man in her back seat. (An example of this rendition can be seen in the 1998 episode of ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', "[[The Pest House]]".) In another, she sees a doll on the road in the moors, stops, and then the man gets in the back.

In another version, the woman gets into her car and then a crazed person leaps out from nowhere and starts shouting gibberish and slamming their hands on the car. The woman quickly manages to escape from them but no matter how far or which direction she drives, every time she stops, the same crazed person appears and attacks the car. The woman then arrives at a police station and tells the police about the crazed person. The police calm her down and offer to drive her back to her house (or a safe place in other versions). But when they go with her to get her things from the car, they find the killer hiding behind the driver's seat. As it turns out, the crazed person that was chasing the woman was the ghost of one of the killer's victims, trying to either warn the woman or get at the killer.

==Interpretations==

The story is often told with a moral. The attendant is often a [[lumberjack]], a [[truck driver|trucker]], or a scary-looking man: someone the driver mistrusts without reason. She assumes it is the attendant who wants to do her harm, when in reality it is he who saves her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Barden |first= Thomas E. |title= Virginia Folk Legends |location= Charlottesville, VA |publisher= University Press of Virginia |year= 1991 |page= 324 |ISBN= 978-08139-133-5-3 |quote= The story structure of a suspected harmer turning out to be a savior appears in such modern legends as that of the truck driver following a woman home flashing his lights. For interpretations of this legend, see Carlos Drake ... and Xenia E. Cord, 'Further Notes on the Assailant in the Back Seat'...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* The 1998 film ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' begins with this scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brunvand |first= Jan Harold |authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|title= Encyclopedia of Urban Legends |location= Santa Barbara, California |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2012 |page= 361 |volume= Vol. 1 |ISBN= 978-1-59884-720-8 |quote= 'The Killer in the Backseat' provided the initial scare in the 1998 film ''Urban Legend''. (In the film, however, the assailant does actually kill the driver.) David Letterman's telling of the legend as he heard it growing up in Indianapolis is included in my book ''Too Good To Be True''...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first segment, "Terror in Topanga," of the 1983 film ''[[Nightmares (1983 film)|Nightmares]]'' is a depiction of this legend. 
* An episode of the detective series ''[[Jonathan Creek]]'', "The Coonskin Cap", begins with a version of this legend, except that instead of a killer inside the car, the pursuing driver is trying to alert the woman that there is a body tied to the back of her car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1m8h2i_jonathan-creek-s4e1the-coonskin-cap-on-watch-hd_shortfilms |author=Renwick, David |date=1 March 2003 |title=The Coonskin Cap |publisher=BBC |accessdate=September 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904222944/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1m8h2i_jonathan-creek-s4e1the-coonskin-cap-on-watch-hd_shortfilms |archivedate= 4 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The story is featured in [[The Otto Show|an episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' when [[Otto Mann|Otto]] tells [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] the legend as a bedtime story. In his version, the victim is chased by another car that keeps ramming her vehicle, and she drives off the road into the woods and loses the other car. She is then killed by an axe-wielding maniac who had been hiding in her backseat.
* In the 2015 episode of [[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]], Ghost Stories, Chanel #5 (played by [[Abigail Breslin]]) is driving and a truck starts honking at her and using his high beams. When she pulls over at a petrol station, he tells her about the Red-Devil (the murderer), lurking in her back seat but then he is stabbed by it while #5 makes her escape.

The murder of '''Frauke Liebs''' (February 21, 1985 – after June 27, 2006) is an unsolved criminal case in [[Germany]].

==Disappearance==
On June 20, 2006 the 21-year-old [[student nurse]] Frauke Liebs disappeared under mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref name=PaderPress&gt;{{cite web|title=7,500 Euro Reward for Information on the Murder of Frauke Liebs|url=http://www.paderzeitung.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4722&amp;Itemid=203|publisher=Joint Press Release from Paderborn's Prosecutor's Office and Homicide Division|accessdate=1 January 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last known sighting of her was at a pub in [[Paderborn|Paderborn's]] city center, where she and a friend watched the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] match between England and Sweden.&lt;ref name=NeueW&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollmeier|title=TV Station Seeks the Killer of Frauke Liebs (Fernsehsender sucht den Mörder von Frauke Liebs)|url=http://www.nw.de/lokal/kreis_minden_luebbecke/luebbecke/luebbecke/4974302_Fernsehsender-sucht-den-Moerder-von-Frauke-Liebs.html|publisher=Neue Westfälische|accessdate=1 January 2016|language=German|date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Liebs was still at the pub, she borrowed a friend's mobile phone battery, as the battery on her own phone had been drained. She later returned her friend's battery before leaving the pub at around 11&amp;nbsp;p.m. Since she probably had no more than five [[euros]] with her, she is believed to have been heading home on foot. The pub was about 1.5 [[kilometer]]s away from her home.

At 12:49&amp;nbsp;a.m., her housemate received a [[text message]] from Lieb's [[mobile phone]], saying that she would be home later.&lt;ref name=NeueW /&gt; However, she did not return home that night, and when she also failed to appear at work the day after, her mother reported her missing. The police discovered that the text message had been sent from [[Nieheim]], a small city about 35&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Paderborn.

In the following days, Liebs called her housemate five times via her mobile phone. Police were able to locate the calls, which all came from different industrial areas in Paderborn. During these calls, Liebs continued to say that she would return home soon, but did not communicate any information about her situation. She provided only vague or evasive answers to questions. Frauke Liebs' last phone call was on June 27 in the presence of her sister, who also talked to her. During this conversation, Frauke is said to have answered the question of whether she was being held captive with a faint "yes", immediately followed by a loud "no". Contact broke off after this phone call.

==Discovery and investigation==
Frauke Liebs' skeletonized body was found by a hunter on October 4, 2006 in a forested area next to a [[Landesstraße]] ("state road") near [[Lichtenau, Westphalia|Lichtenau]].&lt;ref name=PaderPress /&gt;&lt;ref name=NeueW /&gt; The body was found with the clothes she was wearing on the day of her disappearance. Her mobile phone, handbag, wallet and wrist watch were not found.&lt;ref name=PaderPress /&gt;&lt;ref name=NeueW /&gt; Due to the advanced state of decomposition, the time and cause of Liebs' death could not be determined.

A case analysis by the police came to the conclusion that Liebs was probably held captive in the area around Nieheim and that the phone calls from Paderborn may have been diversionary maneuvers. No motive for the crime has been determined. Over 900 people who were connected to the victim were questioned by the police, and the initial investigation produced a list of five initial suspects. All five were eventually cleared after producing alibis.&lt;ref name=NeueW /&gt;

The case aroused nationwide interest and was among others presented on the popular television show ''[[Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst]]'' ("Case number XY … Unsolved").

The '''Old Orchard Street Theatre''' in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]], England was built as a provincial theatre before becoming a [[Roman Catholic]] Church and since 1865 has been a [[Masonic Temple|Masonic Hall]].

In 1705 the first theatre opened in Bath. It was on a site which  The building by George Trim was small and cramped and made little profit in the years before its demolition in 1738.

The planning was taken over by John Palmer, a local brewer and chandler.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=16-18}} The site for a new theatre was chosen by [[John Wood, the Elder]], who laid out much of the city, on the site of the old orchard of [[Bath Abbey]].&lt;ref name="mq"/&gt; Construction work for the theatre in Old Orchard Street began in 1748, to designs by the architect Thomas Jolly of Hippesley and Watts, with the work being completed by John Powell in 1750.&lt;ref name="IoE"/&gt; The theatre was {{convert|60|ft|m}} long and {{convert|40|ft|m}} board.&lt;ref name="austenonly"/&gt; The theatre, known as The St James Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre Royal 1750 – 1805|url=http://oldtheatreroyal.com/wp/museum/theatre-royal-1750-1805/|website=Old Theatre Royal|publisher=Bath Masonic Hall Trust Co Ltd|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened on 27 October, under the management of John Palmer, with a performance of [[William Shakespeare]]’s [[Henry IV, Part 2]].&lt;ref name="mq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-10/p-28.php?PHPSESSID=c59cd231db419873a6a6 | title=Walking with the greats | publisher=MQ magazine | date=July 2004 | accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer obtained a royal patent in 1768 which enabled the use of the title ‘Theatre Royal’; the first to achieve this outside London.&lt;ref name="trhist"/&gt;{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|p=22}} He handed control to his son, also [[John Palmer (postal innovator)|John Palmer]] who worked as his father's London agent, frequently travelling between London and Bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raffael |first1=Michael |title=Bath Curiosities |date=2006 |publisher=Birlinn |isbn=978-1841585031 |pages=60-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer also owned the Theatre Royal, King Street, in [[Bristol]], which now houses the [[Bristol Old Vic]]. The two theatres shared one acting company, so Palmer had to move his actors, stagehands and props quickly between Bristol and Bath, he set up a coach service which provided safe, quick and efficient transport for his actors and materials. Later, when Palmer became involved in the Post Office, he believed that the coach service he had previously run between theatres could be utilised for a countrywide mail delivery service.&lt;ref name="austenonly"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://austenonly.com/2009/11/10/jane-austen-and-the-theatre-1-the-theatre-royal-bath/ | title=Jane Austen and the Theatre (1): The Theatre Royal, Bath | publisher=austenonly | accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to manage the theatre until 1785 when he was appointed as Comptroller-General of the [[Post Office]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_MailCoaches_web.pdf | title=The Mail Coach Service | format=PDF | publisher=British Postal Museum and Archive | accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Palmer, John (1742-1818) |last=Aitken |first=George Atherton|authorlink= |volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and handed control to two existing members of the company, [[William Keasberry]] and William Wyatt Dimond.&lt;ref name="mq"/&gt; Keasberry (1726–1797) was associated with the theatre as actor and manager from 1757 to 1795,{{sfn|Wilkinson|Larsen|1998|p=231}} first acting as manager during the season of 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Interculturalism and Resistance: In the London Theater, 1660-1800 - Identity, Performance, Empire |last=Choudhury |first=Mita |authorlink= |coauthors= |publisher=Bucknell University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8387-5448-1 |page=99 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lp8Yywd3M7MC&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1772 the young actor [[John Henderson (actor)|John Henderson]] joined the company and developed into a popular leading man before moving to theaters in London.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=23-25}} [[Sarah Siddons]] joined the company between 1778 and 1782 and was among many leading actors of the day who performed at the theatre.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oldtheatreroyal.com/#/history/4536624518 | title=History | publisher=Bath's Old Street Theatre | accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During these years, the theatre performed an increasing number of plays written by women, and it has been suggested that this was due chiefly to the presence of Siddons in the company, as well as being related to the retirement of [[David Garrick]].{{sfn|O'Quinn|Moody|2007|p=28}} In 1791 [[Robert William Elliston]] made one of his earliest performances at the theatre.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|p=22}}

The building was used as a theatre until 1805, when the present [[Theatre Royal, Bath|Theatre Royal]] opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/543-theatre-royal-i-bath | title=Theatre Royal (i) (Bath) | publisher=Theatre Trust | accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the 19th century, [[Jane Austen]] was familiar with the theatre in Orchard Street, which is believed to be the original of that described in chapter 12 of ''[[Northanger Abbey]]''.{{sfn|Gay|2006|p=9}}

==Catholic church==

After four years standing empty the building was converted into a [[Roman Catholic]] chapel by the authorities of [[Prior Park College|Prior Park]] and [[Downside Abbey]] and consecrated in 1809.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; The conversion involved the removal of the stage, gallery and boxes.&lt;ref name="mq2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-10/p-29.php | title=Walking with the greats. Page 2 | publisher=MQ magazine | accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted by [[Henry Goodridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catholic Chapel 1809 to 1863|url=http://oldtheatreroyal.com/wp/museum/catholic-chapel-1809-to-1863/|website=Old Theatre Royal|publisher=Bath Masonic Hall Trust Co Ltd|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] removed many of the restrictions on Roman Catholics which had been introduced by the [[Act of Uniformity]], the chapel became a church and was a site for the ordination of bishops,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guide2bath.com/news/40/The-Old-Orchard-Street-Theatre-in-Bath | title=The Old Orchard Street Theatre | publisher=Guide to Bath | accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Peter Augustine Baines]].&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; The vaults which had been used to store scenery was used to create stone tombs with 286 bodies being interred.&lt;ref name="mq2"/&gt;

The congregation grew and in the 1850s and early 1860s a new [[St John's Church, Bath|St John's Church]] was designed and built by [[Charles Francis Hansom]]. In 1863 the congregation transferred to St John's Church&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; and most of the bodies which had been in the vaults moved to a new churchyard.&lt;ref name="mq2"/&gt;

==Masonic Hall==

The building stood empty until 1866 when it and adjacent buildings in [[Pierrepont Place, Bath|Pierrepont Place]] were acquired by the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Royal Cumberland Lodge No. 53 for £636,&lt;ref name="mq2"/&gt; to become their meeting hall.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;

The building was damaged during the [[Baedeker Blitz]] of 1942.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;

The hall is now the meeting place of eight Craft Lodges and 15 other Degrees.&lt;ref name="mq2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pglsomerset.org.uk/bath.htm | title=Lodges meeting in Bath | publisher=Provincial Grand Lodge of Somerset | accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bathfreemasons.org.uk/portal.htm | title=Freemasonry in Bath | publisher=Bath Freemasons | accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Christmas Letter''' was a public message for [[peace]] addressed "To the Women of Germany and Austria",&lt;ref name=Oldfield46&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; signed by a group of 101 British [[Women's suffrage|suffragists]]&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, 2008, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 1914 as the first Christmas of the [[First World War]] approached. The Open Christmas Letter was written in acknowledgment of the mounting horror of modern war and as a direct response to letters written to American feminist [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], the president of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA), by a small group of German women's rights activists. Published in January 1915 in ''Jus Suffragii'', the journal of the IWSA, the Open Christmas Letter was answered two months later by a group of 155 prominent German and Austrian women who were [[Pacifism|pacifists]]. The exchange of letters between women of nations at war helped promote the aims of peace, and helped prevent the fracturing of the unity which lay in the common goal they shared, [[Women's suffrage|suffrage for women]].

The decision by some suffragists to speak out against the war split the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. Most British women were in favour of a quick solution to the conflict and were inclined to work toward that end in any way such as by helping fill positions abandoned by men off at war. Others were nationalistic and sought to make certain that British women were seen as patriotic, as doing their part, so that the men in power would think more highly of them and subsequently pass woman suffrage legislation. A minority of women advocated peace vociferously and worked with international peace organisations or with refugee aid societies. Nearly all suffragists agreed not to disrupt the nation at war in their promotion of women's suffrage. Toward the end of the war partial suffrage was granted, for property-holding women aged 30 and over.

==Background==
[[File:Hobhouse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emily Hobhouse]] authored the Open Christmas Letter and circulated it for signatures.]]
From 1906 until mid-1914, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the United Kingdom was the party seen as most supportive of [[women's suffrage]]—the right of women to vote. Suffragettes and other women's rights activists organised to elect Labour candidates and to push for legislation that expanded the rights of women.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;Archive Awareness Campaign. ''From Kitchen Table to Cabinet Table.'' [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4.html "Women, the Vote and Labour 1906–1918." page 1.] [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4_2.html Page 2.] [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4_3.html Page 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1914 when the world became embroiled in war, the British women activists were sharply divided into two camps: the majority who wished to work with their country's war effort, and a minority who opposed the conflict.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]] of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) wished to have the NUWSS members work for the war so that the men in politics would view the women with greater respect and would thus be more amenable to granting them the right to vote. However, the NUWSS membership included those who were against war. When Fawcett turned the NUWSS to war work, eleven pacifist members resigned, later to join the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF).&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

Like the NUWSS, the more militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) led by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst chose to cease their obstructive activism for women's votes and instead advocated the alignment of British women to the cause of war. However, in October 1914, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] travelled to [[Glasgow]] and spoke out against the war, becoming one of the first suffragettes to do so. She said that "peace must be made by the people and not by the diplomats".&lt;ref name=Winslow&gt;Winslow, Barbara. ''Sylvia Pankhurst: sexual politics and political activism'', p. 81. Routledge, 1996. {{ISBN|1-85728-345-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though pacifist, Pankhurst held with her mother and sister to the general agreement that suffragettes would abstain from militant activism for the duration—she arranged for activist women to join with the War Emergency Worker's Committee and fill some of the positions that had been abandoned by men leaving for war.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

==German suffragists==
[[File:Anita Augspurg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[:de:Anita Augspurg|Anita Augspurg]], German lawyer and activist, sent a letter to the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] in late 1914.]]
In ''Jus Suffragii'' in December 1914, Carrie Chapman Catt published a letter that she had received earlier from [[:de:Anita Augspurg|Anita Augspurg]], [[:de:Lida Gustava Heymann|Lida Gustava Heymann]], and several other German women activists including presidents of woman suffrage societies in Germany. The letter was entitled "To the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, through its president, Mrs. Chapman Catt."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It began, "To the women of all nations warm and hearty greetings in these wretched and bloody times."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt; The German women expressed that the "criminally rekindled war" should not separate women from all countries who had previously been united "by the common striving for the highest object—personal and political freedom".&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt; They stated that "True humanity knows no national hatred, no national contempt. Women are nearer to true humanity than men."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt;

Catt published another letter from German women's rights activist [[Clara Zetkin]], one that expressed the desire for all women not to let "the thunder of guns and the shouts of the [[Jingoism|jingoes]]" make them forget that the rise of civilisation amongst the European countries held much in common. Zetkin wrote that the women of the world should guard their children against the "hollow din" of "cheap racial pride" which filled the streets, and that "the blood of dead and wounded must not become a stream to divide what present need and future hope unite".&lt;ref name=Oldfield24&gt;Oldfield, 2003, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==British suffragists==
[[File:Margaret Bondfield 1919.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Margaret Bondfield]] signed the Open Christmas Letter but was unable to travel to [[The Hague]] in April 1915.]]
In response to the letters from Germany, [[Emily Hobhouse]] organised the writing and signing of a peace-promoting letter from British women: the Open Christmas Letter.&lt;ref name=Oldfield60&gt;Oldfield, 2001, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s, [[Emily Hobhouse|Hobhouse]] campaigned against and worked to change the appalling conditions inside the British [[concentration camp]]s in South Africa built for [[Boer]] women and children during the [[Second Boer War]]. She saw in the German letters the opportunity for maintaining vital international relations among women who could help mitigate the damage that war would bring. She wrote what she called a "Letter of Christmas Greeting" in November 1914 and circulated it for signatures of women who wished for peace.&lt;ref name=Foreword&gt;Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (First Congress: 1915: The Hague) ''Bericht—Rapport—Report'', Foreword by Emily Hobhouse, pp. ix–xii. Amsterdam: International Women's Committee of Permanent Peace, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; Pankhurst and [[Helen Bright Clark]] were among the first to sign Hobhouse's plea for continued sisterhood among the women of the world.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;

Others among the 101 signers were [[Margaret Ashton]], [[Margaret Bondfield]],&lt;ref name=Rappaport98&gt;Rappaport, 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eva Gore-Booth]], [[Esther Roper]], [[Maude Royden]], [[Helena Swanwick]], and a wide range of women united by the wish for "undiminished sisterly relations"&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt; and a swift end to hostilities.&lt;ref name=Liddington&gt;Liddington, Jill. ''The road to Greenham Common: feminism and anti-militarism in Britain since 1820'', p. 96. Syracuse University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8156-2539-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included among the women were some who were members of the Women's Labour League, and some of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. One of the listed women was "Mrs. M. K. Gandhi" but it is unknown whether [[Kasturba Gandhi]], the wife of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], asked that her name be included. At least one of the signers was an American: Florence Edgar Hobson was the New York-born wife of English Liberal social theorist and economist [[John A. Hobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Peter.

===Message===
Under the heading "On Earth Peace, Goodwill towards Men",&lt;ref name=Oldfield46/&gt; the letter's salutation addressed "Sisters" and began, "Some of us wish to send you a word at this sad [[Christmastide]], though we can but speak through the Press..."&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The women of the UK were prevented from direct communication with the women of Germany because of the war. Instead, they sent their missive to America which was at that time a neutral nation. The letter continued, "The Christmas message sounds like mockery to a world at war, but those of us who wished and still wish for peace may surely offer a solemn greeting to such of you who feel as we do."&lt;ref name=Oldfield46/&gt; The letter mentioned that, as in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913, "the brunt of modern war falls upon non-combatants, and the conscience of the world cannot bear the sight".&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not our mission to preserve life? Do not humanity and common sense alike prompt us to join hands with the women of neutral countries, and urge our rulers to stay further bloodshed? ...&lt;br /&gt;Even through the clash of arms, we treasure [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|our poet's]] vision, and already seem to hear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"A hundred nations swear that there shall be&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pity and Peace and Love among the good and free."&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley, Percy Bysshe]]. [http://www.bartleby.com/139/shel11325.html The Revolt in Islam. A Poem in Twelve Cantos. Canto Fifth.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May Christmas hasten that day...&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Response==
[[File:Rosa Mayreder, 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rosa Mayreder]] from [[Austria]] signed the reply.]]
In the spring of 1915, the letter was answered in kind by 155 Germanic feminists including Augspurg and Heymann who had sent the earlier letter from Germany. [[Margarethe Lenore Selenka]], [[Minna Cauer]], and [[Helene Stöcker]] were among the German signers; [[Rosa Mayreder]], Marianne Fickert, Ernestine Federn, and [[:de:Ernestine von Fürth|Ernestine von Fürth]] were in the group of Austrian signers.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The response was entitled "Open Letter in Reply to the Open Christmas Letter from Englishwomen to German
and Austrian Women"&lt;ref name=Oldfield67&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in ''Jus Suffragii'' on 1 March 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmers, 2008, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter began:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To our English sisters, sisters of the same race, we express in the name of many German women our warm and heartfelt thanks for their Christmas greetings, which we only heard of lately.&lt;br /&gt;This message was a confirmation of what we foresaw—that women of the belligerent countries, with all faithfulness, devotion, and love to their country, can go beyond it and maintain true solidarity with the women of other belligerent nations, and that really civilised women never lose their humanity...&lt;ref name=Oldfield67/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Peace initiatives==
[[File:Carrie Chapman Catt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carrie Chapman Catt]] aided the interchange of peace wishes between women of warring nations.]]
Directly after war broke out in August 1914, [[Rosika Schwimmer]], a native of [[Austria–Hungary]] working in England but prevented by war from returning home, outlined her idea for an international conference of neutrals to mediate between warring nations.&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt; In September 1914, [[:de:Marie Stritt|Marie Stritt]], president of the German Union for Woman Suffrage, wrote to [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] in America with "deep personal regret" for the "terrible war" to say that the women of Germany must withdraw their invitation to the annual IWSA International Alliance meeting in June 1915 which was to convene in Berlin.&lt;ref name=Oldfield18&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1914 [[Julia Grace Wales]], a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]], expanded eloquently on the concept, and published her views in a pamphlet entitled "Continuous Mediation Without Armistice", popularly known as the [[Wisconsin Plan]].&lt;ref name=WisconsinPlan&gt;Wisconsin Historical Society. Teachers' Lessons. [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/teachers/lessons/wwi/pdfs/prewarpulsepackage.pdf "Teacher Background—Julia Grace Wales and the Peace Movement"]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking these messages as her inspiration, Catt proposed that, instead of holding a woman suffrage convention in Berlin, an international peace congress of women should meet in [[The Hague]] for four days beginning 28 April 1915.&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt;

When this announcement reached the UK, the NUWSS was divided on the one hand by patriots such as Fawcett and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic more than they were peace-minded—they were primarily concerned with helping the UK men win the war.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The NUWSS membership rejected a resolution favoured by [[Helen Bright Clark]] and [[Margaret Bondfield]]&lt;ref name=Rappaport98/&gt; which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Margaret Ashton resigned from the NUWSS and was subsequently censured by her local [[Manchester]] branch of suffragists.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to attend at The Hague.&lt;ref name=Crawford668&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

At The Hague, between 28 April and 1 May 1915, a large congress of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals.&lt;ref name=WASM&gt;Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600–2000. Editorials. [http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/hague/intro.htm "How Did Women Activists Promote Peace in Their 1915 Tour of Warring European Capitals?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The event was called the [[International Congress of Women]], or the Women's Peace Congress. A planned contingent of 180 British women was greatly reduced to just three persons by the government cancellation of British ferry service across the [[English Channel]], stranding Royden and Swanwick, among others.&lt;ref name=Crawford668/&gt; Having already travelled to [[Flushing, Netherlands]] on a mission of mercy in late October 1914 to provide food for refugees from the [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|fall of Antwerp]], [[Chrystal Macmillan]] was able to attend the women's conference and speak for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, January 2008. MacTutor Biographies. [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Printonly/MacMillan_Chrystal.html Jessie Chrystal MacMillan]. University of St. Andrews, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan, a signer of the Open Christmas Letter, had previously resigned from the NUWSS when its refusal to stand against the war had become clear. Macmillan was selected as one of the international committee who would travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method for returning peace to the world,&lt;ref name=WisconsinPlan/&gt; and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President [[Woodrow Wilson]] with the plan. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his [[Fourteen Points]], and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=WASM/&gt;

==Women's suffrage==
During the war, with British suffragists abstaining from taking militant action, British statesmen such as Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] began to have a change of heart regarding their right to vote. In early 1917 a clause which provided suffrage for property-holding women aged 30 years and older was debated, and in June it was attached to the bill which would later become the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]. Suffragists who were pacifists and suffragists who were nationalistic could both congratulate themselves for winning this incremental victory. Ten years later full voting equality with men was achieved in the UK with the [[Representation of the People Act 1928]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

'''Operation ''Fiery Vigil''''' was the [[emergency evacuation]] of all non-essential military and [[United States Department of Defense]] civilian personnel and their dependents from [[Clark Air Base]] and [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] during the June 1991 [[volcano|volcanic]] [[Plinian eruption|eruption]] of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in the [[Philippines]]. This [[Military operations other than war (US)|noncombatant evacuation operation]] (NEO) resulted in the transfer of roughly 20,000 people from Clark Air Base and U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay back to [[Contiguous United States|CONUS]], by way of [[Cebu]], Philippines. The Commanding General, [[Thirteenth Air Force|13th USAF]], was in command of the [[Task force#Joint Task Force|Joint Task Force]].&lt;ref name=GlobalSecurity/&gt;

==Timeline of events==
* 16 July 1990: a magnitude 7.8 [[1990 Luzon earthquake|earthquake]] struck the island of [[Luzon]], Philippines. The [[epicenter]] was near the town of [[Rizal, Nueva Ecija]], roughly 60&amp;nbsp;kilometers from Mount Pinatubo. This earthquake caused a landslide, some local tremors, and a brief increase in steam emissions from a preexisting [[Hotspot (geology)|geothermal area]] at Mount Pinatubo.&lt;ref name=USGSCataclysmic/&gt;
* March–early June 1991: [[magma]] rising toward the surface from more than 32&amp;nbsp;kilometers beneath Mount Pinatubo triggered small earthquakes and caused powerful steam explosions that blasted three craters on the north flank of the volcano. Thousands of small earthquakes occurred beneath Pinatubo, and many thousands of tons of [[sulfur dioxide]] gas were emitted by the volcano.&lt;ref name=USGSCataclysmic/&gt;
* 7 June 1991: the first [[Eruption#Magmatic eruptions|magmatic eruptions]] took place, resulting in the formation of a {{convert|660|ft|m}} high [[lava dome]] at the [[Summit (topography)|summit]] of the volcano.
* 10 June 1991: after receiving final authorization from the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], all non-essential military and Department of Defense civilian personnel and their dependents initiated land evacuation from Clark Air Base at 0600 local time. This land evacuation brought an estimated 15,000 personnel and several thousand vehicles onto U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay.
* 12–14 June 1991: several waves of eruptions generated [[eruption column]]s up to {{convert|80000|ft|m}} in altitude and [[pyroclastic flow]]s (high speed avalanches of superheated gas and [[tephra]]) extending out to 4&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the summit. These eruptions were accompanied by nearly continuous [[Earthquake|seismic activity]] and expulsion of huge quantities of [[volcanic ash|ash]], tephra, and [[volcanic bomb]]s.
* 15 June 1991: the major eruption of Mount Pinatubo occurred, sending ash and tephra over {{convert|100000|ft|m}} into the air. Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station, the two largest U.S. military bases in the Philippines, were heavily damaged by ash from this volcanic eruption.&lt;ref name=USGSCataclysmic/&gt; Nearly one foot of ash accumulated on both Clark Air Base and U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay. Many buildings collapsed under the weight of the accumulated ash, and all flight operations were suspended at both bases for many days or even weeks afterwards.

==Aftermath==
The 1991 [[Plinian eruption|Plinian]]/[[Ultra-Plinian]] eruption of Mount Pinatubo was the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1912 eruption of [[Novarupta]]), and the largest eruption in living memory. The eruption produced high-speed pyroclastic flows, giant [[lahar]]s, and a cloud of volcanic ash hundreds of miles across.&lt;ref name=USGSCataclysmic/&gt; 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide&lt;ref name=Robock2009/&gt; and roughly {{convert|11|km3|cumi|1|sp=us}} of tephra&lt;ref name=Largeeruptions/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fierstein2001/&gt; are estimated to have been ejected in total, which corresponds to a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] (VEI) of 6.&lt;ref name=EruptiveHistory/&gt; By contrast, roughly 4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of material was ejected in the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]]; this corresponds to a VEI of 5.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

Very few of the estimated 20,000 &lt;!-- there are conflicting accounts of this figure with some reaching as high as 45 or 50,000 --&gt; who left the base ever returned. The vast majority were evacuated to [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]] and processed for return to the continental United States. This figure includes approximately 5,000 who were evacuated to [[Cebu City]] on the {{USS|Midway|CV-41}}, {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72}}, {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9}}, {{USS|Peleliu|LHA-5}}, {{USS|Arkansas|CGN-41}}, USS Gary (FFG-51), USS Rodney M. Davis (FFG-60), USS Lake Champlain (CG-57) and seventeen other U.S. Navy ships of the task force.
* 22 June 1991: a team of 11 engineers and utility systems specialists from Headquarters [[Pacific Air Forces]] (PACAF) and the 554th [[Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers]] (RED HORSE) arrived at Clark Air Base to assess the damage caused by Mount Pinatubo to determine the fate of the base.
* 12 July 1991, the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force]] announced that the U.S. Air Force would leave the Philippines no later than 16 September 1992.
* 4 September 1991: a lahar, {{convert|20|ft|m}} to {{convert|40|ft|m}} high and almost {{convert|200|ft|m}} wide, smashed along the southern boundary of Clark Air Base, sweeping away a security policeman who was subsequently rescued.
* 5 November 1991: the Secretary of the Air Force visited Clark Air Base and paid tribute to the "Ash Warriors", the personnel who had remained throughout the volcanic activity and cleanup.
* 26 November 1991: the American flag was lowered for the last time by the Ash Warriors, and Clark Air Base was turned over to the government of the Philippines, ending over 90 years of US presence at the base.

A record fair is an event where individuals can buy, sell, and/or trade recorded music, which is generally in the form of [[vinyl records]]. Most record fairs are open to anyone, but they are of special interest to individuals (such as record collectors, [[disc jockey]]s, and [[record producer]]s) who are looking for recordings that are rare, out-of-print, difficult to find, or produced in limited numbers.

A '''rolling blackout''', also referred to as '''rotational load shedding''' or '''feeder rotation''', is an intentionally engineered electrical power shutdown where electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region. Rolling blackouts are a last-resort measure used by an [[electric utility]] company to avoid a total blackout of the power system. They are a type of [[demand response]] for a situation where the demand for electricity exceeds the power supply capability of the network. Rolling blackouts may be localised to a specific part of the electricity network or may be more widespread and affect entire countries and continents. Rolling blackouts generally result from two causes: insufficient [[electricity generation|generation]] capacity or inadequate [[electricity transmission|transmission]] infrastructure to deliver sufficient power to the area where it is needed.

Rolling blackouts are a common or even a normal daily event in many [[Developing country|developing countries]] where electricity generation capacity is underfunded or [[infrastructure]] is poorly managed.    In well managed under-capacity systems, blackouts are scheduled in advance and advertised to allow people to work around them, but in most cases they happen without warning, typically whenever the transmission frequency falls below the 'safe' limit. Rolling blackouts are also used as a response strategy to cope with reduced output beyond reserve capacity from power stations taken offline unexpectedly such as through an extreme weather event.

Rolling blackouts in [[Developed country|developed countries]] sometimes occur due to economic forces at the expense of system reliability (such as in the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000-2001).

'''Stress Induced Leakage Current''' (SILC) is an increase in the gate [[Leakage (semiconductors)|leakage current]] of a [[MOSFET]], due to defects created in the [[gate oxide]] during electrical stressing. SILC is perhaps the largest factor inhibiting device miniaturization. Increased leakage is a common [[failure modes of electronics|failure mode of electronic devices]].

==Oxide defects==
The most well-studied defects assisting in the leakage current are those produced by [[charge trapping]] in the oxide. This model provides a point of attack and has stimulated researchers to develop methods to decrease the rate of charge trapping by mechanisms such as [[nitrous oxide|nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]] [[nitridation]] of the oxide.

The '''Second Hundred Years' War''' (c. 1689 – c. 1815) is a [[periodization]] or historical era term used by some [[historian]]s&lt;ref&gt;Buffinton, Arthur H. ''"The Second Hundred Years' War, 1689–1815"''. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1929.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[François Crouzet|Crouzet, François]]. "The Second Hundred Years War: Some Reflections", article in ''"French History"'', 10. (1996), pp. 432–450.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, H. M. Review: ''"The Second 'Hundred Years War"'' 1689–1815", article in  ''"The Historical Journal"'', 35, (1992), pp. 443–469.
&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the series of [[military conflict]]s between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[France]] that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815. For the context see [[International relations, 1648–1814]].

The Second Hundred Years' War is named after the [[Hundred Years War]], when the rivalry between England and France began in the 14th century. The term appears to have been coined by [[John Robert Seeley|J. R. Seeley]] in his influential work ''[[The Expansion of England]]: Two Courses of Lectures'' (1883).&lt;ref&gt;Morieux, Renaud: "Diplomacy from Below and Belonging: Fishermen and Cross-Channel Relations in the Eighteenth Century" article in ''"Past &amp; Present"'', 202, (2009), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Like the [[Hundred Years' War]], this term does not describe a single military event but a persistent general state of [[war]] between the two primary belligerents. The use of the phrase as an overarching category indicates the interrelation of all the wars as components of the rivalry between France and Britain for world power.  It was a war between and over the future of each state's [[Empire#Colonial empires|colonial empires]].

The two countries remained continual antagonists even as their national identities underwent significant evolution.  Great Britain was not a single state until 1707, prior to which it was the separate kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], albeit with a shared Crown and military establishment.  In 1801, Britain was united with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].  The period also saw France [[early modern France|under the Bourbon dynasty]], the regimes of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[First French Empire|First Empire]].

The various wars between the two states during the 18th century usually involved other European countries in large alliances; except for the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] when they were bound by the [[Anglo-French Alliance (1716–31)|Anglo-French Alliance]], France and Britain always opposed one another.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Some of the wars, such as the [[Seven Years' War]], have been considered [[world war]]s and included battles in the growing colonies in [[Honourable East India Company|India]], the [[Americas]], and ocean shipping routes around the globe.

==Beginning: 1688–1714==
The series of wars began with the accession of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[William III of England|William III]] as [[King of England]] in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]].  His predecessors the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] had sought friendly terms with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]: [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], both [[Protestantism|Protestants]], had avoided involvement as much as possible in the [[Thirty Years' War]], while [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] convert [[James II of England|James II]] had even actively supported Louis XIV in his [[Franco-Dutch War|War against the Dutch Republic]]. William III, however, sought to oppose Louis XIV's Catholic regime and styled himself as a Protestant champion.  Tensions continued in the following decades, during which France protected [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] who sought to overthrow the later Stuarts and, after [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]], the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]].&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, ''"William III"''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonies: 1744–1783==
After William III, the opposition of France and Britain shifted from religion to economy and trade: the two nations vied for colonial domination in the Americas and Asia. The [[Seven Years' War]] was one of the greatest and most decisive conflicts. France's alliance and backing of the colonists in the [[American Revolutionary War]] against Britain was successful in undermining British colonial hegemony in North America, but in turn debts from that conflict sowed the economic seeds of France's own [[French Revolution|revolution]] shortly thereafter.

==Revolution and Empire: 1792–1815==
The  French military rivalry continued with British opposition of the [[French Revolution]] and the ensuing wars with first the new [[French First Republic|French Republic]] and then the [[First French Empire|Empire]] of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]].  His defeat in 1814 was followed by his abdication and exile, but he escaped the following year to begin the [[Hundred Days]]. These came to a close with his military disaster at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], facing an Allied force commanded by the [[Duke of Wellington]]. The end of the Napoleonic Wars effectively ended the recurrent conflict between France and Britain. However, Britain and her allies' goal of restoring the French Bourbon monarchy in the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] and the subsequent [[Congress of Vienna]], which sought to prevent further revolutions in Europe,&lt;ref name=BFO-281&gt;''"British and Foreign State Papers"'', p.281&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately failed with the later [[Revolutions of 1848]].

==After Waterloo==
The recurrent rhetoric used in each country shifted from references to a "natural enemy" to an agreement to tolerate one another. Common interests led the two to cooperate in the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s.  A century after fighting one another (and with the mutual interest in checking the growing power of a [[German unification|united Germany, aside from Austria, with its Empire]]), the two were able to establish the [[Entente Cordiale]] by 1904, demonstrating that the "First" and "Second" Hundred Years' Wars were in the past; cultural differences continued, but violent conflict was over.

=="Carthage" and "Rome"==
Many in Europe referred to Great Britain as "[[Perfidious Albion]]", suggesting that it was a fundamentally untrustworthy nation. People compared Britain and France to ancient [[Carthage]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], respectively, with the former being cast as a greedy imperialist state that collapsed, while the latter was an intellectual and cultural capital that flourished:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The republicans knew as well as the Bourbons that British control of the oceans weighed in Continental power politics, and that France could not dominate Europe without destroying Britain. "Carthage"—vampire, tyrant of the seas, "perfidious" enemy and bearer of a corrupting commercial civilization—contrasted with "Rome", bearer of universal order, philosophy and selfless values.&lt;ref&gt;Tombs, ''That Sweet Enemy'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Survival''''' is the final serial of the [[Doctor Who (season 26)|26th season]] and also the final story of the original 26-year run of the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which was first broadcast in three weekly parts on [[BBC1]] from 22 November to 6 December 1989. It marks the final regular television appearance of [[Anthony Ainley]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] and of [[Sophie Aldred]] as [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]]. It is also the last regular television appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]].

In the serial, the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] Master kidnaps humans from contemporary [[Perivale]], and uses the teenager Midge (Will Barton) to facilitate his escape from the disintegrating planet of the Cheetah People.

==Plot==
{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|
 {{Plot|episode|date=June 2017}}
}}
The [[Seventh Doctor]] brings Ace back home to [[Perivale]] in west London. The suburb is not as it should be: a mysterious [[black cat]] is wandering around, somehow creating a situation in which humans are hunted down and made to disappear to another dimension. Ace becomes worried when most of her old friends seem to have disappeared, but the Doctor is more preoccupied with the behaviour of the strange cat. It becomes apparent the black cat is being controlled by a strange being in the other dimension, viewing the scenes in Perivale through the cat's eyes and choosing which humans to chase and transport. An unhappy young man called Stuart becomes his next victim. Ace follows soon afterwards, hunted down by a Cheetah Person on horseback, which seems to have a hunting affinity with the curious cat. Later the Doctor and a keep-fit instructor called Paterson are chosen and teleported to another world, bathed in a blood-red sky, where the Doctor is greeted by his nemesis [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]].
 [[File:Doctor Who 50th Celebration (11278583083).jpg|thumb|left|A Cheetah Person, shown at a 50th Anniversary event.]]
The renegade is evidently unwell, his eyes and mouth displaying feline characteristics, and is using the black cat (or kitling) to create a dimensional bridge for the Cheetah People to hunt prey on Earth. He tells the Doctor that the planet is alive and has a bewitching influence; the indigenous population bred the kitlings and had a great civilisation, but they regressed into animals through the power of the planet. He too is beginning to show changes and needs the Doctor's help to escape from the planet.

Ace has meanwhile made contact with some of her friends, Shreela and Midge, who are hiding in some woods with a young man called Derek. The planet is evidently dangerous as both Stuart and a terrified milkman find out when a Cheetah Person hunts him to the death. Ace and her friends soon find the Doctor and Paterson, and the Doctor has deduced they are on a very ancient planet, which is dying. A Cheetah pack then attacks and during the fight back Midge kills one Cheetah while Ace injures another, called Karra. She begins to form an attachment to Karra and nurses her, tending her injuries, which worries the Doctor greatly. In time Ace's eyes change and she begins to transform into a Cheetah herself. She abandons the Doctor to go hunting with Karra but he eventually wins her round.

Midge has meanwhile completely fallen to the power of the planet and is turning into an animal. The Master seizes on this and uses Midge to [[Teleportation|teleport]] them both back to Earth and away from the dying world. The Doctor persuades Ace to help him get back to Perivale and she does so, also enabling Paterson, Derek and Shreela to flee the strange planet. Paterson denies anything amiss has taken place, falling back on his "survival of the fittest" mantras and his self-defence classes. The Doctor and Ace now head around Perivale in search of Midge and the Master. They eventually find them at the youth club, where they have killed Paterson for sport, and Midge too is killed in the Master's machinations. Karra's arrival brings comfort to Ace, whose transformation is continuing, but the Master kills Karra too.

The Master transports the Doctor with him back to the Cheetah Planet for a final conflict but the Doctor resists the pull of the planet, turning away from violence, and is transported away from the dying world. However, the Master looks doomed on the planet as it begins to break up. The Doctor has gone back to the [[TARDIS]] and Earth, where he finds Ace, whose metamorphosis has reversed, and tells her she will have grown through the experience: the element of the Cheetah Planet, however, will remain within her forever and they return to the TARDIS.

==Production==

===Writing===
Writer [[Rona Munro]] approached script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] at a BBC scriptwriting workshop and said that she'd "kill to write for ''Doctor Who''."&lt;ref name="munrointerview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btinternet.com/~david.darlington/rona2007.html |title=You're Killing My Lesbian Subtext…! |accessdate=2010-01-11 |last=Darlington |first=David |author2=[[Rona Munro]]  |date=25 November 2007 |work=Deejsaint|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604155734/http://www.btinternet.com/~david.darlington/rona2007.html|archivedate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story Munro developed incorporated themes including the morals of hunting (personified by the Cheetah People and signposted by Ace's friend Ange collecting for [[Hunt Saboteurs Association|hunt saboteurs]]).&lt;ref name="munrointerview" /&gt; Working titles for the story included ''Cat-Flap'' and ''Blood Hunt''.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{Brief | id=7p | title=Survival}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''Survival'' was chosen by Cartmel.&lt;ref name="munrointerview"/&gt; Munro was disappointed by the realisation of the Cheetah People:

{{blockquote|[They] should have just had cheetah eyes and a very faint pigmentation round of cheetah spots, and big canine teeth. And in fact, I think the actors that were cast, from what I was told, were doing all this wonderful expressive facial work, and then these 'Puss In Boots' things were dropped on them – and so then you can't see what they're doing under there. Particularly Karra and Ace, there were whole amazing scenes between them and for me, that was supposed to be my lesbian subtext – and you can't see it!|Rona Munro, 2007 interview&lt;ref name="munrointerview" /&gt;}}

===Recording===
''Survival'' was one of only three ''Doctor Who'' serials to be recorded completely on BBC Outside Broadcast video, instead of the mix of OB and studio video that was more common during the late 1980s, and the mix of film and video that was usual before them. The other stories to be recorded solely on OB video were ''[[The Sontaran Experiment]]'' (1975) and the previous story ''[[The Curse of Fenric]]'' (1989).

It was almost {{convert|38|C|F}} on the shooting days for the scenes on the planet of the Cheetah people.  One of the extras removed her costume (revealing that she was wearing very little underneath) and simply walked off the set, causing delays while a replacement was found.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Sylvester McCoy on the Survival DVD&lt;/ref&gt; The battle at the climax of the story was recorded and is set on the site of the ancient [[hill fort]] at [[Horsenden Hill]], Perivale. The majority of location recording was done in and around Perivale, with small sections shot at nearby [[Ealing]], outside and near [[The Drayton Court]] pub.

===The final Doctor Who episode in the original series===
Having already surmised that episode three of ''Survival'' was likely to at least be the last episode of ''Doctor Who'' for some time, and possibly the last ever, the programme's producer John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion should be given to the final episode.&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt; To this end, [[script editor]] [[Andrew Cartmel]] wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for actor Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989, the day after Episode 1 was broadcast, and also by coincidence, the show's twenty-sixth anniversary:

''"There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there’s injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace &amp;mdash; we’ve got work to do!"''

This was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and Ace walked off into the distance, apparently to further adventures. The ''Doctor Who'' production office at the BBC finally closed down in August 1990, having been in continuous operation since 1963.

Although ''Survival'' was the last ''Doctor Who'' serial of the original series to be transmitted, it was not the last to have been produced; that was ''[[Ghost Light (Doctor Who)|Ghost Light]]'', which had been broadcast some weeks earlier, as the antepenultimate story of the original run.

This story is the last to feature Anthony Ainley as the Master. Ainley was not asked to return as the Master for the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television movie]]. Instead, Gordon Tipple was cast as the Master for the prologue and [[Eric Roberts]] played the Master for the rest of the movie. Ainley reprised the role of the Master for the 1997 computer game ''[[Destiny of the Doctors]]''. He continued to be active in ''Doctor Who'', attending conventions and recording a commentary track for the DVD of the 1981 serial ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]''. Ainley died in May 2004.

This story was also the last to entirely feature Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor. McCoy returned briefly to the role at the beginning of the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television movie]] to regenerate into the [[Eighth Doctor]] (played by [[Paul McGann]]).

Finally, this story was the last to feature Sophie Aldred as Ace. Aldred would have continued in her role had the series been renewed for Season 27; however, Aldred's contract was set to expire at the middle part of that season. As a result, the character of Ace was set to be written out of the series in an [[Ice Warrior]] story called ''Ice Time'' (1990) by [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~qstnmark/melted/ice_time.htm |title=Ice Time |publisher=Home.earthlink.net |date= |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to various interviews with the production team, the new companion would have been a female [[safe-cracking|safecracker]] whom the Doctor would have taken under his wing, with her gangster father as a recurring character.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For details on ''Doctor Who'' during the 1990s, see [[History of Doctor Who#The 1990s|History of Doctor Who]].

Both McCoy and Aldred would play their characters on screen for the BBC on two occasions after ''Survival'' was broadcast: first in a 1990 episode of the schools and colleges series ''Search Out Science'' and once more in 1993, along with many other former ''Doctor Who'' actors, in ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', a benefit for [[Children in Need]]. The two actors reprised their roles in officially licensed audio productions for [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] starting in 1999, and again in 2001 for the BBC [[webcast]] production, ''[[Death Comes to Time]]''.

''Doctor Who'' eventually returned to production as a BBC television series in 2004, produced by [[BBC Wales]]. "[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]", the first episode of the new series, aired on 26 March 2005. As the new series is produced as 45-minute episodes, this makes ''Survival'' the final serial to date to be produced in 25-minute instalments, which had been the standard for the series (except for a one-season experiment with 45-minute episodes in 1985) since 1963.  This story was also the last to feature the face of the current Doctor in the title sequence, a tradition dating back to ''[[The Macra Terror]]'' of 1967, until the 2012 Christmas Special and the second part of the 7th series. Both the TV Movie that followed this, and the revived series of 2005 until September 2012, had title sequences featuring a "time tunnel" effect, differing in style from time to time. This effect actually served in-universe as the time-vortex.

===Cast notes===
The part of Karra in this serial is played by Lisa Bowerman, who is now more familiar to fans as the voice of [[Bernice Summerfield]] in the [[Big Finish Productions]] [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|audio dramas]]. She is also a director of many Big Finish productions, and also returned to the ''Doctor Who'' series proper when she provided voice-acting work for the animated special ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'' in 2009.

This serial features guest appearances of the comedians Gareth Hale and Norman Pace, and actress Adele Silva (as an 8-year old, in her first television role). See also [[Celebrity appearances in Doctor Who]].

There was no direct indication given to the public that this was to be the final regular installment of ''Doctor Who''; however, unlike previous years' final episodes, this one featured no announcement in the closing credits that the programme would return the following year.

Reviewing ''Survival'', [[David J. Howe]] and [[Stephen James Walker]] described it as "a very good story", with a
script that contains "highly imaginative and original concepts".&lt;ref name="dwttc"&gt;Howe, David,
Walker, Stephen James. ''Doctor Who : The Television Companion''. London : BBC Worldwide, 1999. 
{{ISBN|0563405880}} (pp. 536-37).&lt;/ref&gt; They also expressed admiration for the special effects used for the Cheetah People's planet, 
calling them "superb electronic video effects". Ainley's performance was also praised, with the reviewers
stating it was "deadly serious and implacably evil, but with occasional flashes of dark humour".&lt;ref name="dwttc" /&gt; 
While stating that it was "deeply regrettable" that the original series of ''Doctor Who'' had to end with ''Survival'', they added "that it went out on such a high note is, however, something to be thankful for".&lt;ref name="dwttc" /&gt;

The serial was also positively received by Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, who praised Anthony Ainley's performance and considered the show to be "A great end to the series" with "an epic quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/survival/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide - Survival |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''TC 2000 Championship''' ('''Turismo Competición 2000''') is a [[touring car racing]] series held in [[Argentina]] since 1979.

==Rules==
Prior to 2012, engines of up to 2000 cc were allowed, with only limited modifications from standard engines. This was both to reduce running costs, and give a level playing field to every team. [[Variable valve timing]], variable intake geometry, [[anti-lock braking system]]s and [[traction control system|traction control]] are all forbidden.

From the 2012 season, [[Radical Performance Engines]] will provide 2.7 litre RPE TCX V8 engines (a front-wheel-drive variant of the RPX, originally found in the [[Radical SR8]]), capable of producing 430&amp;nbsp;hp, in place of the previous 2 litre engines. The series was renamed to Super TC2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radicalperformanceengines.com/news/?loadnews=1&amp;cb=60&amp;l=radical-performance-engines-appointed-as-tc2000-engine-supplier&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, cars with the old regulation continue competing with the name TC 2000, currently with an independent calendar.

A '''Tabuik''' is the local manifestation of the [[Remembrance of Muharram]] among the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people in the coastal regions of [[West Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], particularly in the city of [[Pariaman]].

==History==
[[File:Tabuik festival.jpg|left|thumb|175px|''Tabuik'' being lowered into the sea in Pariaman]]
A "''tabuik''" also refers to the towering funeral [[bier]]s carried around during the remembrance procession, and is similar in form to several of the [[Indigenous peoples of North America|indigenous cultures]]' [[totem]]s found in the [[Western culture|old world Western cultures]].

The practice of throwing a tabuik into the sea has taken place every year in Pariaman on the [[Day of Ashura|10th of Muharram]] since 1831.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bachyul Jb | first = Syofiardi | title = 'Tabuik' festival: From a religious event to tourism | publisher = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 2006-03-01 | url = http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/03/01/1422473.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was introduced to the region by the [[Shi'ite Muslim]] ''[[sepoy]]'' troops from [[India]] who were stationed—and later settled—there during the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt;

==The events==
[[Image:Tabuik Pariaman.jpg|rt|upright|thumb|200px|A tabuik monument in the center of [[Pariaman]], [[Indonesia]] ]]
The festival includes [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]]s of the [[Battle of Karbala]], and the playing of [[tassa]] and [[dhol]] drums. Although originally a Shi'a festival, nowadays most inhabitants of Pariaman and other southeastern Asia areas hold similar festivals which are even celebrated by non-Muslims.

==The remembrance bier==
The remembrance is referred to as ''Tabut'' or ''[[Tabot]]'' in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].  (Tabut is the name given in the [[Quran]] for The [[Ark of the Covenant]].)  In preparation for the ceremony, one or more tabuiks are made from [[bamboo]], [[rattan]], and paper. During the week of Tabuik, activities include kite races, traditional plays, and dance expositions (such as the ''[[Tari Piring]]''). The memorial draws a large crowd including dignitaries such as the provincial governor.  Visitors and celebrants can observe the tabuik in the morning before it is slowly taken to the beach in a procession. At noon the tabuik is thrown into the sea. Afterwards, many people go swimming creating 'memories' of the tabuik to keep.

==Exhibition==
The exhibition was curated by art historian Rangihiroa Panoho for the [[Sarjeant Art Gallery]] in [[Whanganui]] in 1990 and the metropolitan City Galleries in Wellington and in Auckland in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abadia|first1=Karina|title=Maori Art Book Takes Inclusive Approach|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/69254057/maori-art-book-takes-inclusive-approach|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=20 June 2015|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's starting point and its iconic motif was a Tahitian tivaevae featuring the Genesis story of the 'Dream of Joseph' or ''Te moemoea no Iotefa''. The exhibition initially filled all spaces of the historic Sarjeant Gallery building, an earlier version of the Wellington City Art Gallery and the entire first floor of the Auckland Art Gallery.&lt;ref name="Moemoea"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panoho|first1=Rangihiroa|title=Te Moemoea no Iotefa (The dream of Joseph)|date=1990|publisher=Sarjeant Art Gallery|location=Whanganui}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the exhibition catalogue Panoho outlined the South Pacific as, 'Aotearoa's most immediate historical, geographical and cultural context', and that he was seeking to 'examine and explore the visual side of this context and the ways in which artists in this country are exploring it'.&lt;ref name="Moemoea" /&gt; The exhibition brought together four strands of art making:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The wealth of material culture from the Pacific Islands found in museums, libraries, private collections - [[taonga]] such as historical writing, photographs, [[tapa cloth|tapa]], tivaevae, weaving and carving.

2. Work currently being produced by Pacific Islanders living in New Zealand such as tivaevae and carving.

3. Work by [[palagi]] artists in this country (e.g. [[Tony Fomison|Fomison]], Shepherd, [[Vivian Lynn|Lynn]], [[Barry Lett Galleries|Lett]], [[Pat Hanly|Hanly]], McMillan, Adams, and Jowitt) which constitutes a response to Pacific Island subject and motif.

4. Work by contemporary Pacific artists utilising a Western aesthetic - to draw on and interpret their particular island cultures.&lt;ref name ='Moemoea'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exhibition 'wove together the various aspects of Pacific culture as it persists in Aotearoa'.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiu|first1=Melissa|last2=Stevenson|first2=Karen|last3=Mason|first3=Ngahiraka|last4=Vercoe|first4=Caroline|title=Paradise now? : contemporary art from the Pacific|date=2004|publisher=David Bateman in association with Asia Society|location=Auckland|isbn=1869535847}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|24}} Art historian Nicholas Thomas writes 'Museum artifacts were placed with contemporary art, folk crafts with paintings, archive photographs with contemporary images, and Pacific artists among white appropriators of culture'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Nicholas|title=The Dream of Joseph: Practices of Identity in Pacific Art|journal=The Contemporary Pacific|date=1996|volume=8|issue=2|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition catalogue contains interviews with 10 contemporary artists included in the show:

*Iosefa Leo
*[[Fatu Feu'u]]
*Jim Vivieaere
*[[Lily Laita]]
*[[John Pule]]
*[[Michel Tuffery]]
*Johnny Peninsula
*[[Ioane Ioane]]
*Sale Jessop
*[[Sopolemalama Filipe Tohi|Filipe Tohi]]

Te Moemoea was also an exploration of Pacificness as it more diversely related to broader creative activity in Aotearoa. As curator Panoho was not exclusively looking at contemporary Pacific art. As with his show 'Whatu Aho Rua' (1989/1992 - another Sarjeant exhibition involving historical and contemporary material) he was also interested in historical Pacific collections of tapa, fibre, photography and carving and in how non-Pacific artists were working with Pacific communities and in how they were interpreting the material and the ideas that they valorised. Te Moemoea while initiated from within a regional institution travelled to and was reinvented by Panoho and gallery staff within the Whanganui, Wellington and Auckland gallery spaces. A newspaper review from Wellington helps clarify the complexity and the layered nature of the content within Te Moemoea: ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Cross-currents crackle around the latest exhibition at Wellington's City Gallery. People who like to keep art in neat pigeonholes... will probably find '''Te Moemoea no Iotefa''' (Joseph's dream defeats them.

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

==Reception and influence==
''Te Moemoea no Iotefa'' has been described as 'the first group exhibition to celebrate the dynamism of Pacific art'.&lt;ref name='Pasifika'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymond|first1=Rosanna|last2=Salmond|first2=Amiria|title=Pasifika Styles|date=2008|publisher=University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology; Otago University Press|location=Cambridge and Dunedin|isbn=0947595155}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40}}

Pacific art historian Peter Brunt saw '''''Te Moemoea''''' as, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The first exhibition to focus on contemporary Pacific art in a civic gallery in New Zealand was Te Moemoea no Iotefa '[the Dream of Joseph: A Celebration of Pacific Art and Taonga]...The exhibition thematized the presence of Pacific culture in New Zealand society, introduced community-based arts like tivaevae into the contemporary gallery, and canvassed the work of migrant artists like Fatu Feu'u, Johnny Penisula, Michel Tuffery and others, only then beginning to garner serious public attention. But it was the title that was the most prescient about its own historical significance. The title was borrowed from the title of a tivaevae it showed, and refers to the biblical story of Joseph sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers, eventually to rise to a position of power in the Pharoah's court. Joseph's dream turns out to be an allegory of the moment of recognition when, as an exile, he reveals himself to his brothers as the important person he has become. The ambiguity of the allegory lies in the question of whether recognition in Egypt or escape from Egypt (if we can pardon the Orientalism) is the preferable goal''.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pihirau.co.nz/maori-curator-ii-future-flowerings/|title=Art in Oceania|last=Brunt|first=Peter|date=2012|website=Pihirau Productions Ltd|publisher=Thames and Hudson|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition contributed to a sense of group identification amongst a group of young or emerging artists, including Ioane, Tuffery, Laita and [[John Pule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallon|first1=Sean|last2=Pereira|first2=Pandora Fulimalo|title=Speaking in colour : conversations with artists of Pacific Island heritage|date=1997|publisher=Te Papa Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0909010447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|134}}The exhibition is seen as an important precursor to [[Bottled Ocean]], a 1994 exhibition focused on the work of contemporary Pacific artists.&lt;ref name="Oceania" /&gt;{{Rp|432}}

Art historian Karen Stevenson notes the importance of the exhibition in building the careers of participating artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With the success of ''Te Moemoea no Iotefa'', Pacific artists found exhibition space more readily available, and as recognition of Pacific artists grew, dealer galleries and community centers became interested in hosting "Pacific" exhibitions. Group "Pacific" shows became regular occurrences in art galleries throughout the country, as did solo exhibitions at dealer galleries."&lt;ref name ='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Masked Marauders''''' is a [[record album]] released on the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros]] Reprise/Deity label in the fall of 1969 that was part of an elaborate [[hoax]] concocted by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Hoax"&gt;{{cite news|last=Noth|first=Pierre Rene|title=Hoax Masked by Rock Record|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KwMqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PCgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4060,1901327&amp;dq=the-masked-marauders+hoax&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=December 24, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC News Were you a believer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Were you a believer in The Masked Marauders?|url=http://rockcenter.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/05/17622557-were-you-a-believer-in-the-masked-marauders?lite|newspaper=NBC News|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christgau"&gt;{{cite web | last = Christgau | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Christgau | title = Album of the Year | date = 1970-01-08 | url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/album-70.php | accessdate = 2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its October 18, 1969 issue, ''Rolling Stone'' ran a tongue-in-cheek [[review]] of a non-existent album that purportedly captured a "super session" of the era's leading [[rock and roll]] musicians, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[John Lennon]], and [[Paul McCartney]]. The review claimed that none of the artists could be listed on the jacket cover because of contractual agreements with their recording companies. The editors involved decided to extend the joke by hiring a relatively obscure band to record an actual album and then secured a deal with Warner Bros.&lt;ref name="NBC News Were you a believer"/&gt; As an indication of how many people were taken in by the joke, ''The Masked Marauders'' reached No. 114 on ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard]]'s'' album chart.

==''Rolling Stone'' spoof==
''The Masked Marauders'' began as a spoof dreamed up by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Greil Marcus]].  Under the [[pseudonym]] T.M. Christian (a reference to [[Terry Southern]]’s novel ''[[The Magic Christian (novel)|The Magic Christian]]''), Marcus wrote a satiric review of a fictitious double [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] album in collaboration with record reviewer Bruce Miroff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Marcus | first = Greil | authorlink = Greil Marcus | title = Online Exchange with Greil Marcus | publisher = Rock Critics Archives | date = 2002-03-12 | url = http://rockcriticsarchives.com/interviews/greilmarcus/01.html | accessdate =  2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The review was intended to [[parody]] the "[[supergroup (music)|supergroup]]" trend then taking place ([[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], [[Blind Faith]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]) and was also inspired by ''[[Great White Wonder]]'', a double album of unreleased Dylan recordings often credited as the first bootleg.&lt;ref name = "Christgau"/&gt;
  
Many readers, however, took the review seriously, despite its obvious jokes:

*"Produced by [[Al Kooper]], the album was recorded with impeccable secrecy in a small town near the site of the original [[Hudson Bay]] Colony in [[Canada]]."  
*"The LP opens with an eighteen-minute version of '[[Season of the Witch (song)|Season of the Witch]]' (lead vocal by Dylan, on which he does a superb imitation of early [[Donovan]]).  The cut is highlighted by an amazing jam between bass and piano, both played by Paul McCartney."
*"Dylan shines on Side Three, displaying his new deep bass voice, with '[[Duke of Earl]]'."
*"Paul showcases his favorite song, '[[My Mammy|Mammy]]', and while his performance is virtually indistinguishable from [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]]'s version, it is still very powerful, evocative, and indeed, stunning.  And they say a white boy can’t sing the [[blues]]!"
*"It can truly be said that this album is more than a way of life; it is life."&lt;ref&gt;T.M. Christian (Greil Marcus), "The Masked Marauders," The Rolling Stone Record Review, compiled by the editors of ''Rolling Stone'' (New York: Pocket Books, 1971), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording sessions and contract==
Enquiries began pouring into ''Rolling Stone'' regarding the album’s availability, not only from fans and retailers, but reportedly from the artists' managers, [[Allen Klein]] ([[Beatles]] and [[Rolling Stones]]) and [[Albert Grossman]] (Dylan).&lt;ref name = "Gleason"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Gleason | first = Ralph J. | author-link = Ralph J. Gleason | title = On the Town | publisher = ''San Francisco Chronicle'' | date = October 18, 1969 | url = http://www.stones.at/stones/vinyl/lpdiv/masked.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The response sparked part two of the put-on:  the album itself.  Marcus and ''Rolling Stone'' editor [[Langdon Winner]] recruited the Cleanliness and Godliness Skiffle Band, a [[Berkeley, California]], group which had an album the previous year on [[Vanguard Records]] and played frequently at [[San Francisco]]’s [[The Fillmore|Fillmore]] and [[Avalon Ballroom|Avalon]] ballrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dodsworth | first = Fred | title = At 35, the Freight Finds Its Future in Tradition | work = The Berkeley Daily Planet | date = 2003-06-06 | url = http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2003-06-06/article/16764 | accessdate = 2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group initially recorded three of the songs cited in the review:  the ''[[Nashville Skyline]]''-inspired [[instrumental]] "Cow Pie", Jagger doing "I Can’t Get No Nookie" (deemed "an instant classic"), and Dylan’s "Duke of Earl".&lt;ref name = "Rhino"&gt;{{citation | title = The Masked Marauders - The Complete Deity Recordings | publisher = Rhino Records }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[songs]] aired on San Francisco and [[Los Angeles]] [[radio stations]] – from tapes Marcus supplied – the pranksters began looking for a [[major label]] to produce an album.  Several recording companies expressed an interest, but Warner Bros. won the production rights, offering a $15,000 advance plus its considerable promotional power.&lt;ref name = "Rhino"/&gt;  In November 1969, Warner released ''The Masked Marauders'' as a single LP on its newly created Deity label.  The album, which sold more than 100,000 copies, spent 12 weeks on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart, peaking at No. 114. The single "Cow Pie" appeared on the [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart at No. 123 for one week on November 29, 1969.

==Original and follow-up releases==
Tipping off buyers to the [[joke]] (albeit after they had purchased the album), Warner inserted the ''Rolling Stone'' review as well as a ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' column by critic [[Ralph J. Gleason]], a co-founder of ''Rolling Stone''.  Gleason found it incredible anyone believed the review and declared the gag a "delightful bit of instant [[mythology]]."&lt;ref name = "Gleason" /&gt;  The closing track, "Saturday Night at the Cow Palace," also made clear the album was all in fun. The track featured a riotous [[monologue]] by a record buyer so indignant at being taken in by the hoax that he vows, "When I get through with those people at Deity Records, I’ll have them walking out of the building in barrels."  The album’s [[liner notes]], penned by "T.M. Christian," also offered its share of clues, most notably the line:

"In a world of sham, the Masked Marauders, bless their hearts, are the genuine article."&lt;ref&gt;T.M. Christian (Greil Marcus), "Masked Marauder" liner notes, Rhino Records, Claremont, California, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Rhino Records]], under its Handmade label, remastered the album, releasing a numbered edition of 2,000 copies entitled ''The Masked Marauders - The Complete Deity Recordings''.  The lineup of songs is the same as on the original LP, except for [[bonus tracks]] of the [[monaural]] single, "I Can’t Get No Nookie" b/w "Cow Pie".  The title of the re-issue posed yet another joke:  the album was Deity’s only recording.  As one of its contributions to the [[Parody|spoof]], Warner created Deity under its Reprise subsidiary to match the name of the non-existent record company credited in the ''Rolling Stone'' review.&lt;ref name = "Rhino"/&gt;

== Media coverage ==
The story of ''The Masked Marauders'' hoax was featured in an April 5, 2013, segment of the TV program ''[[Rock Center with Brian Williams]]''.&lt;ref name="Broadway World Rock Center"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scoop: Rock Center with Brian Williams on NBC - Today, April 5, 2013|url=http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/Scoop-ROCK-CENTER-WITH-BRIAN-WILLIAMS-on-NBC-Today-April-5-2013-20130404|newspaper=Broadway World|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times What's On Friday"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shattuck|first=Kathryn|title=What’s On Friday|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Veintitrés''''' (meaning ''Twenty-three'' in English) is a weekly [[news magazine]] published in [[Argentina]].

==History==
The magazine was established in 1998 as XXI,  in reference both to the upcoming century, and to Lanata's previous publication Página/12 (''21'' is ''12'' with the figures reversed), by [[Jorge Lanata]] and colleagues from the television news magazine, ''Día D'': [[Adolfo Castelo]], Olga Gatti, Claudio Martínez, Jorge Repiso, [[Ernesto Tenembaum]], and Marcelo Zlotogwiazda. Advertised as ''La revista del siglo que viene'' ("The magazine for the century to come"). Later, as people would keep calling it "siglo veintiuno" rather than just ''veintiuno'' ("Twenty-one," ) it changed its name to "Veintiuno". It later appeared as ''Veintidós'' (Twenty-two), and from 2000 onward by its current title, meaning twenty-three.

Much as Lanata's successful news daily, ''[[Página/12]]'', had done, ''Veintitrés'' adopted a format of bold headlines and graphics, as well as a [[muck-raking]] editorial style. Its target audience is the middle and high socioeconomic classes and professionals, government officials, and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author2=Joaquin Barnoya|author1=Javier Saimovici|title=Argentina: “non-smokers’ dictatorship”|journal=Tob Control|date=2004|volume=13|issue=6|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/13/1/6.1.full.html|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also became known for its [[gag gift]]s, chosen in allusion to the news story of the day. Lanata sold a 75% stake in 2001 to investigative journalist Ernesto Tenenbaum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuevosperiodistas.com.ar/entrevistasread_pro.asp?id=7|title=Entrevista|publisher=Nuevos Periodistas}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which ''Veintitrés'' was directed by Guillermo Alfieri; Alfieri left the magazine in 2008 to join Lanata's short-lived ''[[Crítica de la Argentina]]''. ''Veintitrés'' was purchased in 2008 by Sergio Szpolski, who, in turn, sold a 50% stake in Grupo Veintitrés (which also published ''[[Newsweek Argentina]]'', ''[[Tiempo Argentino]]'', among other periodicals, and operates Channel 23) to Matías Garfunkel in 2011. The media group's broadcasters and publications established themselves as some of the most supportive of [[Kirchnerism]] among Argentina's diverse media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideascasiprincipales.wordpress.com/2011/02/26/la-venta-de-los-medios-k-de-szpolski-ver-versiones/|title=Garfunkel Partners adquirió el 50% del Grupo Veintitrés|work=Ideas Casi Principales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vivat! Vivat Regina!''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|aɪ|v|æ|t|_|r|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə}} is a play written by [[Robert Bolt]].&lt;ref&gt;London Playbill Picadilly Theatre &lt;/ref&gt; It debuted at [[Chichester Festival Theatre|Chichester]] in 1970 and later at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] London. Principal actors were 
[[Sarah Miles]] and [[Eileen Atkins]]. The play was directed by [[Peter Dews (director)|Peter Dews]] and designed by [[Carl Toms]].  [[Richard Pearson (actor)|Richard Pearson]] also played a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theatricalia.com/play/4wq/vivat-vivat-regina/production/paw|title=Production of Vivat! Vivat Regina! - Theatricalia|website=theatricalia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the play had a successful run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/vivat--vivat-regina-3637|title=Vivat!  Vivat Regina! – Broadway Play – Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|website=www.ibdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play tells the story of two rival [[monarch]]s who never met: Scotland's [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and her cousin, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. The play's title is [[Latin]] for "Long live! Long live the Queen!", and is taken from the [[I was glad#Acclamation|acclamation]] at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation Service]].

The first act contrasts the personalities of the two monarchs, as they engage in a battle of wiles. Elizabeth is portrayed as a woman who has given up on love and family in order to maintain a firm grasp on power, while Mary is portrayed as a reckless, impulsive woman ready to risk power for love.

The second act concentrates on Mary's term as a prisoner of Elizabeth, during which time she reflected on her own pending execution.

[[Eileen Atkins]] played Elizabeth in the play's British and American debuts. Bolt's wife [[Sarah Miles]] played Mary in the original British production, while [[Claire Bloom]] played Mary in the play's Broadway debut. A 1985 off-Broadway revival featured [[Geraldine Page]] as Elizabeth and Sabra Jones as Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/17/theater/theater-geraldine-page-in-bolt-s-vivat-regina.html|title=THEATER: GERALDINE PAGE IN BOLT'S 'VIVAT REGINA!'|first=Mel|last=Gussow|date=17 March 1985|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was, next to ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'', Bolt's most successful stage production, receiving several Tony nominations for its Broadway production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/vivat--vivat-regina-3637/#awards|title=Vivat!

{{Italic title}}
'''''Wagner Dream''''' is an [[opera]] by [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)|Jonathan Harvey]], premiered in 2007, to a libretto by [[Jean-Claude Carrière]], which intertwines events on the last day of the life of [[Richard Wagner]] with elements from a fragmentary opera sketch by Wagner himself, ''[[Die Sieger]]'' (''The Victors'').

==Background==
''Die Sieger'' was drafted between 1856 and 1858, at a period when Wagner had become greatly interested in [[Buddhism]]. It is based on legends which Wagner discovered in [[Eugène Burnouf]]'s 1844 ''Introduction to the History of Buddhism''. Wagner planned a production of this work for 1870 in his programme for King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] but never progressed it – (however elements of the story persist in his opera ''[[Parsifal]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monsalvat.no/sieger.htm Prose Sketch for ''Die Sieger''] in ''Monsalvat – the Parsifal Pages'', retrieved 28 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

Harvey described some of the processes he used in creating ''Wagner Dream''. These include the use of a [[French horn]] and a [[sampling (music)|sampled]] [[trombone]] playing deep notes at the opera's commencement, representing boat [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]]s on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. The composer also visited [[Chamonix]] to sample a [[thunder]]clap, used to preface an argument between Wagner and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey (2008), 38–39, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative structure and scoring==
The story tells of the love of the outcast [[chandala]] Prakriti for the monk [[Ananda]]. Although both are ostracized by the other monks, [[Buddha]] permits their chaste union and allows Prakriti to join the monastic community. ''Wagner Dream'' intersperses the Prakriti/Ananda story with the events surrounding Wagner's death in [[Venice]]. As Wagner dies from a heart attack, he recalls the opera he never completed. Whilst the "Indian" roles are all sung, the members of the Wagner household, including his wife [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] and the [[soprano]] [[Carrie Pringle]] (with whom it has been alleged that Wagner had his last love affair) are spoken roles.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Clements, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/story/0,,2071182,00.html%20wagner%20dream Wagner Dream]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 May 2007 (retrieved 28 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The score uses [[electronic music]] as well as an ensemble of 24 musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Faber Music News, (northern) Autumn 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premiere and performance history==
The opera was premiered at the [[Grand Théâtre de Luxembourg]] in April 2007, prior to a run at the [[Westergasfabriek]], Amsterdam, in a production by [[Pierre Audi]] for [[De Nederlandse Opera]], which commissioned the work. Its British premiere took place at the [[Barbican Centre]] as a concert performance in London on 29 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/events/908 ''Wagner Dream''], [[BBC]] website (retrieved 28 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The first British staged performance was given on 6 June 2013 in the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] [[Cardiff]] by [[Welsh National Opera]], directed by Pierre Audi.&lt;ref&gt;''Wagner Dream'' programme book, WNO Summer 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In this production, German was used for the spoken text while the Buddhist characters sang in [[Pali]]. In a programme note, WNO's artistic director, [[David Pountney]], stated that this change was discussed with Jonathan Harvey with the aim of "seeking to enhance and clarify the cultural dialogue which is the centrepiece of (Harvey's) opera".&lt;ref&gt;"A note about language", in ''Wagner Dream'' programme book, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;
