'''Amir Hossein Jahanshahi'''([[Persian language|Persian]]: امیرحسین جهانشاهی born 25 September 1960) is an Iranian political activities and businessman. He is the Founder of  ‘Raha TV” (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rahatv.tv//|title=Raha TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family Background ==

The elders of Amir Hossein Jahanshahi’s family belong to the [[Kara Koyunlu]] clan which has a 500 year history of governing a number of key provinces in Iran. Based in Tabriz, the ‘Gharghoyonlou’ ruled over significant sectors of contemporary Iran, including Azerbaijan, Khuzestan, Kerman, Fars and Heart as well as parts of present day Iraq. The last ‘Gharghoyonlou’ ruler was [[Jahan Shah]].

A number of personalities from this clan were religious figures [‘Mojtahid’], who were considered as noble and notable figures in Azerbaijan after the 8th century.

Following the establishment of ‘Adliehe Azam’ (Supreme Court) by Nasserdin Shah in the 19th century, these notables became leading members of the state judiciary. Prominent amongst these figures were ‘Mirza Mohammad Taghi Sadr Jahanshahi’ (the uncle of MirzaShafi Jahanshahi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasekhoon.net/mashahir/print-119183.aspx/|title=MirzaShafi Jahanshahi}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who headed the judiciary in Azarbaijan.

In 1946, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi’s grand father, Mirza Shafi Jahanshahi was appointed as the Head of Iran’s Supreme Court by Prime Minister ََ[[Ahmad Ghavam]] (‘Ghavomol-Saltaneh’).  In the course of the elections to the 15th Majles (1947), Mirza Shafi was also the Head of the Supervisory Group for the elections in Teheran. His father, [[Gholam Hossein Jahanshahi]] was elected to the 19th (1956) and 20th Majles (1960), as Deputy from Teheran and pursuant to that, in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Asadollah Alam]] in 1962, he was appointed as Minister of Trade. For a while, he also served as Deputy Head of the Pahlavi Foundation ([[Persian language|Persian]]:[[Wiktionary:fa:بنیاد پهلوی|بنیاد پهلوی]]).

His Maternal Grand Father was [[Khaz'al al-Ka'bi]] who was the governor of [[Khuzestan Province]] in the early 1920s.

== Business career ==

Amir Hossein Jahanshahi completed his education in France where he obtained degrees in Economics at the [[Panthéon-Assas University]]. Subsequent to completing his studies, he worked as a financial advisor and as a real estate developer in Paris, Madrid and Barcelona, before becoming a major stakeholder in large public companies such as [[Bouygues]], [[Havas]] and [[Vivendi]].

== Political career ==

Concerned adamantly about the rapid rise of radical fundamentalism in Iran and the Middle East, which he believes places the prospects of its future generations in serious jeopardy, his first book entitled, “Defeating the Third Totalitarianism” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vaincre-IIIe-totalitarisme-Amir-Jahanchahi/dp/2841143546/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403498280&amp;sr=1-2/|title=Defeating the Third Totalitarianism}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 2001 in the aftermath of ‘9/11’ attack on the World Trade Center in New York. The publication of his first book was followed by a series of articles published in major French newspapers and leading to the publication of his second book in September 2009, entitled “The Iranian Hitler – Putting anEnd to Ahmadinejad’s Dictatorship” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/LHitler-iranien-finir-dictature-dAhmadinejad/dp/2350131874/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403498280&amp;sr=1-1/|title=The Iranian Hitler – Putting anEnd to Ahmadinejad’s Dictatorship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A message published by the French newspaper, Le Figaro &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/editos/2009/10/06/01031-20091006ARTFIG00001-pour-la-deuxieme-republique-d-iran-.php/|title=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2009, calling on all Iranian opposition groups - inside and outside the country as well as those within the governing regime – to be prepared to work with one another in a united effort to overthrow the ‘Ahmadinejad regime’, marked the official entrance of Jahanshahi into the political fray.

In March 2010, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi launched Green Wave with a new political agenda committed to serving the Iranian nation and preventing regional war and instability.

== Iranian TV Documentaries Concerning Jahanshahi and Green Wave ==

Jahanshahi and Green Wave soon became the main targets of the Iranian state’s propaganda machine in the administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Worried about activities pursued by Jahanshahi’s innovative outlook, commitment and dedication for achieving his objectives, in an unprecedented move not seen before, the Iranian State Television in 2011-2013 produced a total of three separate documentaries (‘Almase Farib’ I &amp; II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE3HnkXR_y/|title=Almase Farib}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011 and 2012) and (‘Triangle’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwb7GoBPtkk/|title=Triangle}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013) to directly damage and derail the activities of Green Wave in order to foil its activities aimed at promoting popular change in Iran and ending the scourge of radical fundamentalism in the region and beyond.

== The Launch of ‘Raha TV’==

In September 2012, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi launched the first major opposition TV channel in London. ‘Raha’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rahatv.tv//|title=Raha TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; (‘to free’) is dedicated to ‘change’ and is run by Iranian journalists who have recently left Iran as well as some working inside the country.

At Raha’s official launch in October 2012, Jahanshahi stated that “At this critical juncture in the history of Iran and the region people will want to watch in order to get news and analysis that they can trust as unbiased”. However, because ‘Raha TV’ poses a major challenge to policies carried out by hardliners and extremists within the ruling establishment, some of its transmissions have been subject to blockage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kalame.co/faqs/15-1389-08-21-19-49-27/20871-%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%8C-%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B4-%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85.html/|title=kalame.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; though these activities have at no time deterred ‘Raha’ from overcoming these obstacles and getting its message to the Iranian people.

== National Reconciliation and Economic Reconstruction ==

In line with his consistent concern that political change should never be sought at a cost of either subjecting the country to the threat of a destructive external military conflict or a situation of internal mayhem and civil war, Amir Hossein Jahanshahi supported the candidacy of Hassan Rouhani in the presidential election of June 2013, using all his various resources both inside and outside Iran. Later, on 26 September 2013, following the publication of a ‘Full Page Message’ printed in the International Herald Tribune &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://organization.greenwavenews.com/journal/1405/|title=Herald Tribune|access-date=2014-10-15|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140518055302/http://organization.greenwavenews.com/journal/1405/|archive-date=2014-05-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (coinciding with the presence of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the General Assembly of the UN), he advanced a new initiative aimed at promoting ‘national reconciliation’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/mon-figaro/2014/02/07/10001-20140207ARTFIG00353-amir-jahanchahi-mon-plaidoyer-pour-la-reconciliation-nationale-en-iran.php/|title=lefigaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst contending factions that wish to retain centuries old traditions and the youth who are seeking a modern and progressive Iran.

Committed to the future rise of the Iranian people and aspiring to attain for Iran its rightful place in the community of nations consistent with its past history and great civilization, Jahanshahi has stressed the importance of [[economic reconstruction]] as a catalyst for future prosperity as well as the best guarantor for the establishment of a just and democratic order in Iran. 

Placing ‘economic reconstruction’ at the top of all priorities, Jahanshahi has sought the cooperation of those anxious to retain the status quo and those committed to the construction of a different Iran, to come together with the explicit eventual aim of establishing reconciliation between civil society and government for the sake of restoring Iran’s damaged economic and social structures, thus allowing it to attain its rightful place amongst the top ten economies of the world within a single decade. 

=== Inviting ‘Real Madrid’ to Iran ===

In the aftermath of his call for ‘National Reconciliation’, at his behest on the birthday of the ‘Prophet of Islam’ (in 2014), his close friend, the president of the ‘Real Madrid’ football club, in what was widely covered &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isna.ir/fa/news/92110402085/%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%B0%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%BE%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%BE%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D9%88-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D9%BE%D8%B1%D8%B3/|title=isna.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Iranian media, accepted his proposal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=646140635431907&amp;set=a.463272353718737.107926.453766961335943&amp;type=1&amp;theater/|title=Perspolis vs Real Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to enter into direct into negotiations with the appropriate Iranian authorities, so that the European Club Champions may visit Iran and play a friendly match against the popular Iranian side [[Persepolis F.C.]] for the benefit of the Iranian people.

=== Return to Iran ===

In order to implement the much need reconstruction of the Iranian economy, as well as securing some of the country’s most immediate vital requirements for the promotion of such a mission, in an interview with the French daily, Le Figaro on 7 February  2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/mon-figaro/2014/02/07/10001-20140207ARTFIG00353-amir-jahanchahi-mon-plaidoyer-pour-la-reconciliation-nationale-en-iran.php/|title=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Hossein Jahanshahi announced that he was willing to return to Iran without any precondition so that this important ‘national mission could be pursued with the Iranian people. He said that Iran belonged to all Iranians and relieving the hardships placed on the lives of all citizens while securing the country’s immediate needs was a critical requirement. According to Jahanshahi, preventing the kind of violence and social and economic catastrophes witnessed in countries like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Egypt was a key priority and, as such, it was the duty for all Iranians who wanted to see their country restore its pride, dignity and former greatness.

=== ‘BAAM’, an umbrella for supporting economic reconstruction and national reconciliation in Iran ===

==Biography==
===Family background and early years===
One of seven children, Arif Ali was born in Danielstown, on the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo coast]], [[British Guiana]] (now Guyana); two of his grandparents were [[India]]n [[indentured labourers]],&lt;ref name=Colourful&gt;Rob Hayward,
 [http://www.colourfulradio.com/content/business/13021 "Arif Ali of Hansib Publications"], Colourful Radio, 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the time of his birth the family had become wealthy landowners.&lt;ref name=Sherwood&gt;[[Marika Sherwood]], [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1106 "Caribbean Publishing in Britain. A Tribute to Arif Ali" (reviews)], ''Reviews in History'', [[Institute of Historical Research]], [[University of London]], July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After graduating from high school in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Ali left on 12 August 1957 for London, intending to study economics,&lt;ref name=SN&gt;[http://www.stabroeknews.com/2008/guyana-review/09/03/publishing/ "A lifetime in publishing: Arif Ali and the Hansib story"], ''[[Stabroek News]]'', 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] on 3 September,&lt;ref&gt;Hoyles (2015), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; having travelled to Britain via the Canary Islands, Spain, Italy and France.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;Adwoa Korkor, [https://angelacobbinah.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/forty-and-still-going-strong/ "Forty and still going strong"], Angela Cobbinah, 30 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He initially worked at different jobs, including on the buses and as a porter in a hospital — where in 1958 he met a young English nurse named Pamela who three months later became his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyles (2015), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First business ventures===
In 1966 Ali started to run a greengrocer's in Tottenham Lane, an area with a significant Caribbean population in [[north London]], and before long, as [[Carolyn Cooper]] notes, "his business place became a vibrant cultural centre".&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Carolyn Cooper, [http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100307/cleisure/cleisure3.html "Seaga's Jamaica? Absolutely!"], ''[[Jamaica Gleaner]]'', 7 March 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few outlets for Caribbean provisions such as yams, plantains and cassava, the shop also sold newspapers brought in from such Caribbean countries as Guyana, [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Barbados]]: "The newspapers served to connect West Indians in the diaspora with their respective home territories."&lt;ref name=SN /&gt;

Ali progressed from this to producing on a [[Gestetner]] machine a cheaply priced compilation of articles called ''The Westindian'', a venture that proved successful.&lt;ref name=SN /&gt; He sold the food shop and in 1970 founded Hansib Publications — named after his parents, Haniff and Nasibun (Sibby) — &lt;ref name=Colourful /&gt; specifically to cater for this readership and in April 1971 the company published ''The Westindian Digest'', a magazine for Britain's West Indian communities.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyles (2015), p. 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Hansib published its first book, edited by Ali and entitled ''Westindians in Great Britain''.&lt;ref name=Sherwood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoyles (2015), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; New editions of this "Who's Who" came out in subsequent years, and with the fifth edition in 1982, the name of the publication was changed to ''Third World Impact''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyles (2015), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaper publishing===
His career as a newspaper publisher started in 1973 with the acquisition of ''West Indian World'' from its then owner Aubrey Baynes, who had launched the paper in mid-1971 but had become disillusioned with its financial viability.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Morrison, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=76M-nuHaji8C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Arif+ali%22+publisher&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zfsC7dsUw_&amp;sig=2GMnBiB4zfrSIfaDyys9PudjvYA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvjsaX6bLKAhUBhhoKHUx8BZsQ6AEImgEwGA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arif%20ali%22%20publisher&amp;f=false ''A Century of Black Journalism in Britain: A Kaleidoscopic View of Race and the Media (1893-2003)''], Truebay Ltd, 2007, p. 36. {{ISBN|978-0-9555540-0-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Ali's editorship the ''West Indian World'' prospered, campaigning on various educational issues that were affecting black schoolchildren. Ali went on to further engage and communicate with the Caribbean, African and Asian communities by establishing the ''Asian Digest'' (August 1980),&lt;ref&gt;Hoyles (2015), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; the newspapers ''[[Caribbean Times]]'' (1981), ''Asian Times'' (1983) and ''African Times'' (1985), as well as ''Root'' magazine (1987).&lt;ref name=AboutUs&gt;[http://www.hansibpublications.com/epages/es147335.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/es147335/Categories/AboutUs "About Us"], Hansib website.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s he had a staff of 140, publishing three weekly papers and two monthly magazines. The circulation of the ''Caribbean Times'' peaked at 28,000, with average sales of about 10,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyles (2015), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book publishing===
In 1997 Ali sold his newspapers in order to concentrate on book publishing,&lt;ref name=Sherwood /&gt; and Hansib remains "the biggest and most diverse black book publisher in Britain".&lt;ref name=Colourful /&gt; Talking to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Ali said: "In the 1960s, mainstream European-led publishing houses rarely published black and minority ethnic (BME) writers' work, if at all. Little positive was written about us, our cultures, our backgrounds and performances. I went into publishing to print stories and feelings that needed telling and would not be produced elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Fay Wertheimer, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/nov/24/minority-publisher-hansib-40th-birthday "Minority publisher celebrates 40th birthday"], ''The Guardian'', 24 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the time of its 40th anniversary in 2010, Hansib had brought out more than 200 titles,&lt;ref&gt;Angela Cobbinah, [http://www.camdenreview.com/node/375088 "Caribbean Publishing in Britain: A Tribute to Arif Ali, by Asher and Martin Hoyles"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827184532/http://www.camdenreview.com/node/375088# |date=2016-08-27 }}, ''Camden Review'', 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in categories encompassing politics, history, culture, sport, cookery, to multicultural literature including poetry, fiction and memoir, with claims to have for more than four decades "reflected and chronicled the achievements and struggles, the turmoils and frustrations, and the hopes and dreams of Britain's Caribbean, African and Asian communities."&lt;ref name=AboutUs /&gt; Ali himself has edited some of the company's successful titles, such as the Nations Series, illustrated portraits of countries, such as ''Jamaica Absolutely'',  ''Trinidad and Tobago: Terrific and Tranquil'' and ''Guyana at 50: Reflection, Celebration and Inspiration''.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Millar, [http://caribbean-beat.com/issue-88/caribbean-bookshelf-novemberdecember-2007#axzz3xmFEhUaL "Caribbean Bookshelf"], ''Caribbean Beat'', Issue 88 (November/December 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theygavethecrowdplentyfun.com/hansib-publications/ "Hansib Publications"], ''They Gave the Crowd Plenty Fun''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AC /&gt;

In parallel with his publishing activities, Ali has been involved over the years with various black political organisations, and was public relations officer for the West Indian Standing Conference, an umbrella organisation comprising more than 40 UK-based African and Caribbean groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyles (2015), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artur Mundet i Carbó''' ([[Sant Antoni de Calonge]], 1879 - [[Mexico City]], 1965) was a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] businessman based in [[Mexico]].

Artur Mundet came from a family of Catalan [[Cork (plug)|cork]] manufacturers, and first travelled to Mexico to establish a branch of the company business there. In 1902, he created the [[Sidral Mundet]] apple flavoured [[soft drink]] which was destined to become popular in the Mexican market and beyond.

He was known for his [[philanthropy|philanthropic work]], including the creation of the [[Recinte Mundet]] in [[Barcelona]] and the [[Germandat de Sant Antoni de Calonge]] in his place of birth. The [[Parque Arturo Mundet]] in Mexico City bears his name, as does the [[Casa Llar per a Ancians Artur Mundet]], an old people's home in the same city.

'''''Atlantis Underwater Tycoon''''' is an [[Ocean|underwater]] [[City-building game|city-building simulation game]] in which the player acts as a [[tycoon]] to simulate the [[Real-time game|real-time]] design and management of an [[Ocean colonization|underwater civilization]]. It was developed and published by [[Activision Value]], and released on March 21, 2003 for [[Microsoft Windows]] on the PC.

''Atlantis Underwater Tycoon'' was the first building sim to be set underwater.&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
In ''Atlantis Underwater Tycoon'', the player can choose to play in missions or in a sandbox-environment map to start building their underwater colony. The player chooses a tycoon character to play as who comes with their own positive and negative traits, such as providing bonus starting money, or having a disreputable attitude towards [[sea life]].

The player starts on the [[ocean floor]] with a home base and a set amount of money. The player then expands the [[Ocean colonization|underwater colony]] by constructing various residential, utility, commercial, industrial, tourist, and military buildings that extend outward from the home base in a design conducive to the ocean floor, linking them with air tubes, and [[terraforming]] the seabed if needed.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; The player is able to collect and store items produced by commercial and industrial buildings in warehouses and sell them off in a market. The player can also breed new wildlife to live in the city's waters, such as [[dolphin]]s or [[shark]]s, as well as create [[Submarine|underwater vehicles]] to roam around the city.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt; As the city grows, a wider range of buildings and residents become available. Such buildings include [[Blue whale|whale]] sanctuaries, [[sea turtle]] aquariums, shopping malls, [[Deepwater drilling|oil drills]], and prison facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109232346/http://pc.ign.com/objects/613/613977.html |url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/613/613977.html |archive-date=2007-01-09 |title=IGN: Atlantis Underwater Tycoon |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; New and better buildings bring in more citizens and tourists, generating more income for the city. Over time, buildings nearing their life expectancies can be demolished to make room for new buildings.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/atlantis-underwater-tycoon |title=Atlantis Underwater Tycoon (Windows) |work=[[MobyGames]] |accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late stages of the game, the player can unlock the ability to build Atlantean structures.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt;

In addition to having to manage the economic aspects of the game, the player must also contend with attacks from enemy [[pirates]] and from enemy Atlanteans, as well as deal with underwater [[natural disaster]]s. Military vessels and friendly Atlantean defenders can be recruited to defend against such attacks.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_new"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamewatcher.com/reviews/atlantis-underwater-tycoon-review/10393 |title=Atlantis Underwater Tycoon Review |date=October 28, 2003 |accessdate=2018-08-18 |author=Chris |work=Gamewatcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military buildings, such as [[Sonic weapon|sonic cannons]] and [[missile turret]]s, can be manned by the player to shoot projectiles at hostile vessels and destructive debris to destroy them.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_new"/&gt;

On the whole, the player prevents the city from falling into harm by keeping a watchful eye out for enemy invaders and natural disasters, while managing the city's businesses so that population happiness, tourism, and sea life can prosper, all the while avoiding the city plunging into financial trouble.

''Atlantis Underwater Tycoon'' has been praised for its well-done visuals and its snappy underwater music track.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_new"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt; The ability to see into buildings and view the people within nightclubs and movie theaters is also a nice plus.&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt; The visual depiction of night and day from the rays of light shining down on the city also provides for a nice ambiance effect.&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt; The top moments in the game can be attributed to the times when a player's prospering city "[comes] under attack from enemy subs, and the player reacts to mount a counter-attack to avoid all the player's hard work from being obliterated."&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt;

One reviewer says that the game's biggest weakness lay in its lack of variety in building models and resources.&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3763">'''Control Council Law No 22, Works Councils''' (10 April 1946) was a [[German labour law]] drafted in [[Allied-occupied Germany]] by the Military Government, to enable organisation of [[work councils]] in rebuilding the economy and society after [[World War Two]]. Work councils, which employees of a firm organised and elected democratically to determine workplace issues, had existed in Germany in various forms since 1889. They had been abolished by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Nazi party.&lt;ref&gt;See E McGaughey, 'The Codetermination Bargains: The History of German Corporate and Labour Law' (2015) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2579932 LSE Legal Studies Working Paper No. 10/2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The new Control Council Law No 22 provided a template for democratic German trade unions to reorganise through [[collective agreements]] with employers.

==Contents==
The key provisions of the new Law were articles I and V, empowering trade unions to organise work councils, and providing a template set of rights for elected representatives.

{{Cquote|
;Article I
The organization and activities of Works Councils (Betriebsräte) to represent the professional, economic and social interests of the workers and employees in each individual enterprise are hereby permitted throughout Germany.

[...]

;Article V
1. Works Councils may have as their basic functions any of the following matters relating to the protection of the interests of the workers and employees of an enterprise except insofar as these matters are governed by or are subject to any restriction by regulations having the force of law:

:a) Negotiations with employers on the application of collective agreements and of internal regulations to individual enterprises.
:b) Negotiations of agreements with the employers regarding factory regulations for the protection of labor, including such matters as safety pre-cautions, medical facilities, factory hygiene, working conditions, rules for engagements, dismissals, and settlement of grievances.
:c) Submission of proposals to the employer for the improvement of methods of work and organization of production for the purpose of avoiding unemployment.
:d) Investigation of grievances and discussion thereof with the employer; assistance to the workers, employees and Trade Unions in the preparation of cases for submission to factory inspectors, social insurance and labor protection authorities, labor courts and other agencies for settling labor disputes.
:e) Co-operation with the authorities in the prevention of all war production and in the denazification of public and private enterprises. Participation in the creation of management of social works designed for the welfare of the workers of an enterprise, including nurseries, medical assistance, sports, etc.

2. Each Works Council shall determine its specific functions and procedure within the limits set forth in this law.}}

==Development==
The Control Council Law No 22 was replaced by a more comprehensive ''Betriebsrätegesetz 1952'' (Work Councils Act 1952) once the new German constitution had passed in 1949, and a democratic government had been elected.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Elon Ganor  was born in Geneva Switzerland in 1964, grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel where he graduated from [[Tel Aviv University]] Sackler Medical school and got an MD in 1975.

===Entrepreneurship career===
After years of practicing medicine Ganor shifted his energy to the creation of technology related companies. His first company was Virovahl S,A- a Swiss-based biotechnology company that he founded in 1987 with a group of Swedish Virologists, the company's laboratory was located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Virovahl SA, developed the world's first HIV synthetic peptide based on diagnostic test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = September 28, 1988| title= Synthetic peptide antigens for the detection of HIV-1 infection. | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP0284587.html| website = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under his guidance as President of Virovahl, the test was licensed exclusively to [[Pharmacia]] AB from Uppsala Sweden (Later merged with [[Upjohn]]).&lt;ref name="Elon-Ganor-VocalTec"/&gt;

In 1990 Ganor joined forces with [[Alon Cohen]] and [[Lior Haramaty]] who formed 6 months earlier VocalTec LTd in Israel. Cohen and Haramaty developed and manufactured a PC sound card (SpeechBoard TM) that was sold mainly to the local visually impaired community in Israel with a unique Text to Speech software enabling blind people to use a computer in the Hebrew language.
Since that market was limited, as VocalTec CEO and Chairman, Ganor decided to shift the company's focus to software. In 1993 VocalChat was born, a software that enabled voice communication from one PC to another on a local and wide area network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = February 14, 94| title= VOCALTEC INTRODUCES VOCALCHAT WAN FOR VOICE COMMUNICATIONS OVER CORPORATE WIDE AREA NETWORKS. | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/VOCALTEC+INTRODUCES+VOCALCHAT+WAN+FOR+VOICE+COMMUNICATIONS+OVER...-a014804936| website = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software was developed by a group of developers including Ofer Kahana (later the founder of Kagoor that was sold to Juniper),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = March 29, 2005| title= JUNIPER NETWORKS, INC.

The software was presented in Atlanta in May 1993 at the Network InterOp trade show.&lt;ref name="von" /&gt; In 1994 support for Internet Protocol was added and on Friday, February 10, 1995 “Internet Phone“ was launched with a near full page Wall Street Journal article by WSJ Boston Correspondent Bill Bulkeley, “Hello World! Audible chats On the Internet” was the header.&lt;ref name ="wallstreetjournal" /&gt;

VocalTec Ltd became a Nasdaq traded company exactly one year later in February 1996 with Ganor as its Chairman &amp; CEO.
In 1997 Ganor with the help of Michael Spencer (At the time Principal at [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] who led the Internet Strategy Group of the Communications, Media and Technology practice) wrote the business plan for a new type of a VoIP exchange phone company.&lt;ref name="von" /&gt; After meeting [[Tom Evslin]] from [[AT&amp;T]] (who led at the time WorldNet AT&amp;T ISP initiative) [[ITXC]] was founded, With Tom Evslin as its CEO and cofounder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=VoIP Nostalgia
|url=http://blog.tomevslin.com/2007/10/voip-nostalgia.html
|website=http://blog.tomevslin.com/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; VocalTec under Ganor invested the initial $500K and gave a credit of $1Million in VoIP Gateway equipment in exchange of 19.9% of the new company, AT&amp;T followed with an additional investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = August 18, 99 | title= "Maariv": ITXC, in Which VocalTec Holds 19.9%, to Be Issued at $300 Mln Value|url =http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=377421|website =http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/nodeview.asp?fid=942}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ITXC became the world's largest VoIP Carrier reaching a market cap of about $8 Billion as a Nasdaq company in 2000 (prior to the March 2008 crash).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In 2008 Ganor became the founder, investor and CEO (with Danny Frumkin, PhD and Adam Wasserstrom, PhD as co-founders) of Nucleix. Nucleix Ltd is a [[Biotechnology]] epigenetic company involved in unique development of Bio-Markers and technologies for Forensic medicine. The company developed a product for the authentication of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = August 20, 2009 |last=Blankenhorn|first=Dana | title= Former VocalTec CEO takes on biological identity theft|url =http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/thinking-tech/former-vocaltec-ceo-takes-on-biological-identity-theft/1140|website =http://www.smartplanet.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16121">An '''enterprise planning system''' covers the methods of planning for the internal and external factors that affect an [[Business|enterprise]].

These factors generally fall under [[PESTLE]]. PESTLE refers to political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors.  Regularly addressing PESTLE factors falls under [[operations management]]. Meanwhile, addressing any event, opportunity or challenge in any one or many factors for the first time will involve [[project management]].

As opposed to [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), enterprise planning systems have broader coverage. Enterprise planning systems address the resources that are available or ''not'' available to an enterprise and its ability to produce products or resources and/or provide services. It also considers those factors that will positively or negatively affect the firm's ability to run these actions.

Enterprise planning systems will tend to vary and are flexible. These are due to the periodic and adaptive nature of strategy formation. These will also have tactical aspects. Typically, enterprise planning systems are part of a firm's knowledge base or corporate structure whether it formally identified and structured or simply executed these when the need appeared.

== Purposes ==

An enterprise planning system will address at least three basic purposes to help the enterprise: 
* survive
* compete
* thrive

===Survival===
An enterprise will plan for tactical moves for quick reaction to the PESTLE threats that affect its survival. For instance, right after Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant has experienced explosions due to the earthquake and the tsunami that followed, several enterprises (within and outside Japan) have publicly announced their course of actions to address the emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Adam Gabbatt |author2=Richard Adams |author3=Ben Quinn |title=Japan tsunami and nuclear alert - Monday 14 March part two|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/mar/14/japan-tsunami-nuclear-alert-live|work=guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=30 April 2011|location=London|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
Meanwhile, an enterprise will plan for longer term strategic actions to address its competition or improve its [[competitiveness]]. For instance, enterprises will plan for, set budgets, implement and use [[strategic information systems]] as “information systems or information technology investments can be a source of competitive advantage”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ward |author2=Joe Peppard |title=Strategic Planning for Information Systems 3rd Edition|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex PO19 1UD, England|isbn=0-470-84147-8|pages=23–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opportunities===
Most significantly, an enterprise will plan for using the PESTLE opportunities that are available to it. The profit and benefit motives justify most enterprise planning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Massood Samii|title=Project Financial Evaluation|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-040-project-management-spring-2009/lecture-notes/|work=Lecture Notes MIT OpenCourseWare|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerabilities===

A fourth noteworthy purpose for enterprise planning systems is preparedness against terrorist attacks. As noted in the US Presidential Directive for [[Critical infrastructure protection]], terrorist groups are likely to attack commercial infrastructure for economic sabotage. Enterprises that are providing products or services that are critical to the economic system of a nation are potential targets of extremists.

== Strategic planning ==
Two major characteristics of EPSs are (1) variety and (2) flexibility. For instance, technological risks abound as even enterprise software are prone to [[obsolescence]] and [[disruptive innovation]]s. Technology is not stagnant. Thus, variety and flexibility work to the advantage of a strategically adaptive or [[agile management|agile]] enterprise as PESTLE conditions change.

To illustrate this some more, ERP software prescribes processes to realize its promised benefits. However, compliance to these rigid, prescribed processes is often assumed rather than real. In many cases, the ERP software is accepted but the practices within the enterprise reflect inconsistencies with the prescribed processes of the software. In a sense, variety and flexibility in a standard ERP implementation will still manifest in many ways such as "workarounds, shadow systems, various forms of unintended improvisations, and organizational 'drift'" as the [[knowledge worker]]s in the enterprise adapt to the realities of daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berente|first=Nicholas |author2=Danail Ivanov |author3=Betty Vandenbosch|title=Process Compliance and Enterprise System Implementation|journal=IEEE Computer Society|year=2007|volume=40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|pages=1530–1605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With changing real world conditions, at least three components can structure enterprise strategy. These are:  
* analytical frameworks for the evaluation of PESTLE data at a given time
* geographic coverage of operations to manage risks or maximize benefits from [[macroeconomic]] forces or government regulations
* projects integration to efficiently support enterprise operations

=== Strategy via analysis ===
Frameworks of analysis usually drive a firm's strategy. These enable the firm to cope with the actions of its competitors, demands of its consumers or clients, nature of its operating environments, effects of government regulations in the places where it does business, or opportunities that are available among other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kevan|title=Strategic Management|publisher=DK Publishing|location=375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, United States of America|isbn=978-0-7566-4859-6|pages=16–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, team planning is crucial. One group will normally specialize in one aspect like operations or government regulations. Managing the interrelation of PESTLE factors requires teamwork in the enterprise planning process.

A sample framework for general analysis is the [[SWOT analysis]]. Another is the [[Balanced Scorecard]] for performance measurement analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|author2=David P. Norton|title=Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=January–February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy via geography ===
Enterprise strategy can also refer to the mix of structured actions that address the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors that affect a business or firm. These structured actions can be local, [[International|transnational]], global or combination of local, transnational or global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mellahi, K., Frynas, J.G. &amp; Finlay, P.|title=Global Strategic Management|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-926615-9|pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, enterprises can have any of the following geographic strategies in their plans:
* local strategy
* regional strategy (Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, etc.)
* international strategy
* global strategy
* global and local strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=HSBC |title=The world's local bank |url=http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/ |work=2011 |publisher=HSBC Holdings plc 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303034643/http://www.hsbc.com/1/2 |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy via projects integration ===
Moreover, since management actions occur simultaneously in an enterprise, strategic planners can consider operations or [[project portfolio management]] (PPM) as crucial elements in an enterprise's strategic planning guide.

For instance, the need to have strategic priorities across many projects in companies with multiple product development projects have made executives borrow principles from investment portfolio management to better manage the distribution of resources compared with the assessed risks for each project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Michael E.|title=Next Generation Product Development: How to Increase Productivity, Cut Costs, and Reduce Cycle Times|year=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=0-07-143512-3|pages=229–232, Chapter 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, PESTLE factors lead to strategy formation that will enable the enterprise to adapt to changing conditions. Meanwhile, the strategies that have been formed from the analytical framework processes of evaluating an enterprise's condition will lead to detailed plans which could be part of a firm's manual of operations or projects portfolio thrusts for funding and execution across the units or geographic coverage of the enterprise.

== Planning and budgeting ==
Enterprise planning and budgeting go hand-in-hand as the wherewithal to execute plans will determine the success or failure of an enterprise strategy. In another light, expanding or limiting the budget for a particular operations aspect of the enterprise or an ongoing project in favor of another will signal changes to an enterprise's strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Xiall M.|title=Global Engineering Economics: Financial Decision Making for Engineers|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-13-207161-1|pages=90–110|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, planning and budgeting are integral parts of any enterprise planning systems as these impact the strategic directions of the enterprise.

For instance, enterprise projects tend to be mutually dependent with other projects to leverage a firm's engineering, financial and technology resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multi-Project Management: Strategy and Organization in Automobile Product Development|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2492/SWP-3609-29056920.pdf?sequence=1|work=WP-3609-93 BPS|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|accessdate=April 27, 2011|first=Kentaro|last=Nobeoka|author2=Michael A. Cusumano|date=11 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; A market research project will trigger a research, development and engineering (RD&amp;E) project for a new product. In turn, this RD&amp;E project could trigger a production strategy project to manufacture the new product at the most efficient locations to bring it closer to its target consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fujimoto |first=Takahiro |title=Production Strategy |url=http://ocw.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/lecture-notes_eng/Eco_02/BusinessAdministration2_07.pdf |publisher=Department of Economics, University of Tokyo |accessdate=16 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080343/http://ocw.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/lecture-notes_eng/Eco_02/BusinessAdministration2_07.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, cutting the RD&amp;E project budget in half or increasing it twice will have profound effects in the long term direction of an enterprise as this will affect the other units of the firm undertaking projects that are linked to the RD&amp;E project.

===Classifications===

Enterprise planning and budgeting can be generally classified into:
* centralized
* devolved
* hybrid

'''Centralized.''' Headquarters or executive management directs all planning and budgets from the top then downwards in the organization hierarchy. It will closely follow Frederick Winslow Taylor's Principles of [[Scientific Management]].

'''Devolved.''' Middle managers set plans effectively steering the enterprise's strategic direction. Executive management takes into account that the enterprise has knowledge workers that are experts in their respective fields. The Management Board approves the proposed strategic direction under certain financial constraints such as expected returns on investment or equity.

'''Hybrid.''' Executive management determines and sets the strategic direction of the enterprise based on the inputs of middle managers and the rank and file. In this set up, plans and budgets are negotiated.

Essentially, enterprise plans and budgets can be detailed in a top-down approach, generalized in a bottom-up approach, or combined in a top-down and bottom-up approach.

== Group planning ==
Enterprise group planning will typically refer to the involvement of the major units of an enterprise such as the finance, marketing, production or technology departments. It can also refer to the involvement of the geographic units of a transnational or global firm. Some enterprises also involve external parties in their group planning where inputs from the crucial parts of the supply chain, cooperation and collaboration, or outsiders-looking-in are part of the firm's strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Usoro|first=Abel|author2=Abbas Abid |author3=Matthew Kuofie |title=Scales Construction for Organisational Variables that Influence the Use Of ICT for Global Planning|journal=International Journal of Global Business|date=December 2008|volume=1|series=1|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Richard|title=The Natural Laws of Business: How to Harness the Power of Evolution, Physics, and Economics to Achieve Business Success|year=2001|publisher=Doubleday, Random House Inc.|location=New York, USA|isbn=0-385-50159-5|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise group planning will usually manifest in regular board of directors' or management committee' meetings with varying frequencies such as monthly, quarterly or annually. Traditional meetings have required the physical presences of representatives from the various business units of the enterprise. With improvements in telecommunications, enterprise group planning can be conducted through video conferencing where participants may be dispersed geographically. However, video conferencing still appears to be an inadequate substitute when warm, interpersonal relations are part of the firm's culture.

Yet for fast-paced events like natural disasters or a meltdown of the financial markets that require immediate action from the enterprise, video conferencing might be the only option. Troubleshooting that requires the major resources of the enterprise will also entail enterprise group planning. Here, enterprise planning systems take a tactical form rather than a strategic focus to preserve the stability or ensure the survival of the enterprise.

== Transition plan ==
Enterprise transition plans will generally refer to change management-related actions in the case of mergers or in the implementation of an enterprise-wide project. The transition plan will cover the elimination of redundant functions in the case of a merger or the incorporation of new processes into business operations in the case of a technology project.

== Planning software ==
Enterprise planning software will have varied or depth of coverage but will not essentially refer to enterprise resource planning software. This will include planning-centric software and the tools to support strategic and tactical planning for and across the enterprise, such as:
* strategy formation and scenario planning software (for example, supporting [[Sales and operations planning]] process)
* performance measurement and evaluation software
* [[project management]] software
* [[data warehouse]] or [[business intelligence]] software
* [[enterprise optimization]] software

==See also==
* [[Business intelligence]]
* [[Business process management]]
* [[Enterprise relationship management]]
* [[Enterprise information system]]
* [[Enterprise system]]
* [[Management information system]]
* [[Supply chain management]]

He graduated from the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]] with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness Management. He also earned a Master of Environment and Natural Resources Management degree from the [[University of the Philippines Open University]].

==Political career==
===Congress===
After serving as chief of staff of his father, Rep. (now Bukidnon Governor) Jose Ma. R. Zubiri, Jr., from 1995–1998, he ran for the seat representing the [[Legislative districts of Bukidnon#Third district|third district of Bukidnon]] to be vacated by his father in the 1998 general elections. Winning easily in that election, he served his first term in the [[10th Congress of the Philippines|10th Congress]]. During his first term, he was one of the members of what the media dubbed as the "[[Spice Boys (Congressmen)|Spice Boys]]", a group of neophyte and two-term congressmen who were openly critical of President [[Joseph Estrada|Joseph Estrada's]] administration. He was subsequently re-elected to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine House of Representatives]] in the 2001 and 2004 elections.

===Senate===
After serving as a [[Congressman]] for three-terms, he was drafted by [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Lakas CMD]] to be one of their candidates in the pro [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] administration [[TEAM Unity]] ticket in the 2007 mid-term elections.

In the final tally for the 2007 senatorial race by the [[Comelec|Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec)]], Rep. Zubiri narrowly defeated opposition candidate [[Koko Pimentel]] for the 12th and last slot in the Senate. Zubiri had a total of 11,001,730 votes against Pimentel's 10,983,358 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20070714hed3.html The Philippine Daily Tribune] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140200/http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20070714hed3.html |date=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The margin of some 18,372 votes was hotly contested, particularly the votes from the southern Philippine province of [[Maguindanao]], where Pimentel had lost heavily to Zubiri.

Claiming the votes in [[Maguindanao]] were tainted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=82880 ABS-CBN News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701205304/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=82880 |date=July 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pimentel petitioned the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Philippine Supreme Court]] to invalidate the votes from Maguindanao, effectively disenfranchising a whole province. The Supreme Court voted unanimously 14 -0 against Pimentel and allowed the COMELEC (Commission on Elections) to count the votes in Zubiri's favor. Pimentel then returned to the Supreme Court for the second time. This time, he petitioned the justices to issue a restraining order against the proclamation of Zubiri. After oral arguments, however, the High Tribunal again voted to uphold the COMELEC's decision to proclaim Zubiri, consequently failing to grant Pimentel's petition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=76486 Inquirer.net, SC paves way for Zubiri proclamation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715122235/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=76486 |date=July 15, 2007 }}. None. Retrieved on August 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, July 14, 2007, Zubiri was duly proclaimed elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]]. However, the Court's judgment did not prevent Pimentel from bringing his poll protests to the Senate Electoral Tribunal.

On March 14, 2008, the Supreme Court, in a 40-page decision penned by Associate Justice [[Minita Chico-Nazario]], dismissed [[Koko Pimentel]] petition to stop the Commission on Elections from canvassing votes from the province of [[Maguindanao]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/84882/Zubiri-SC-decision-a-big-morale-booster www.gmanews.tv, Zubiri: SC decision a big morale booster]. Gmanews.tv. Retrieved on August 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a definite morale booster for Senator Zubiri.

While serving his stint in the Senate, Zubiri began advocating a more in-depth study of biofuels in order to prevent food shortages, all the while allowing current production of alternative clean energy and biofuels so as to lessen dependence on imported oil and allow the Philippine economy a new avenue of economic success, "especially in this day and age of constant rising oil prices".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/archives.php?aid=2008040233&amp;type=2 – Philstar.com- Food vs. Fuel issue not applicable to RP]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2011, however, during his privilege speech on the floor in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]], Zubiri suddenly announced his resignation from the body.&lt;ref name="inquirer1"/&gt; In his speech, he said that his family was hurt by the "unfounded" accusations against him. "Without admitting any fault and with my vehement denial of the alleged electoral fraud hurled against me, I am submitting my resignation as a duly elected Senator of the Republic of the Philippines in the election for which I am falsely accused without mercy and compassion," Zubiri said in his speech. "My political detractors began calling me ugly names and dragging the name of my family in entirety. In other words, Mr. President, the trial by publicity has begun," he continued.

His resignation was lauded by [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañang]] and various sectors&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/228270/news/nation/senator-zubiri-resigns-amid-2007-poll-fraud-controversy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://balita.ph/2011/08/03/enrile-commends-zubiri-resignation-saddened-colleagues&lt;/ref&gt; but was also seen as a step that helped restore the Filipino's faith in national electoral protests. 

Senator [[Francis Pangilinan]], a member of the Senate Electoral Tribunal, likewise refused to comment on what the next procedure is for the vacancy left by Zubiri. "Let's just wait for developments if any," he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/senator-zubiri-resigning-from-post-.html Senator Zubiri resigns from post, to run in 2013 – Yahoo!]. Ph.news.yahoo.com (August 3, 2011). Retrieved on August 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he ran for the senate under the Partido ng Galing at Puso of Senator [[Grace Poe]]'s [[Grace Poe presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] placing 6th in the polls. As like other politicians, he left his party and joined [[PDP–Laban]], mending his relations with Koko Pimentel, his former adversary.

[[Image:Dallas Convention Center.png|thumb|right|Aerial overview of the complex]]
The '''Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center''' (originally the '''Dallas Memorial Auditorium''' and formerly '''Dallas Convention Center''') is a [[convention center]] in the [[Convention Center District, Dallas, Texas|Convention Center District]] of [[downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]]. The original Dallas Memorial Auditorium was designed by [[George Dahl]] in 1957. It holds approximately 10,000 seats. Dahl was responsible for the renowned Art Deco buildings at the Dallas [[Fair Park]], as well as many other Texas landmarks. The Convention Center additions were designed by [[Larry Oltmanns]], who was a Design Partner with [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] at the time.

== About ==
The center is over {{convert|2000000|sqft|m2}} in size and contains over {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2}} of exhibit space. The largest contiguous exhibit space in the structure is {{convert|726726|sqft|m2|0}}. A {{convert|203000|sqft|m2}} column-free exhibit hall in the center is the largest of its kind in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessreviewusa.com/leadership/3679/Top-Ten-US-Convention-Centers|title=Top Ten U.S. Convention Centers|website=www.businessreviewusa.com|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is annually used for the Dallas Auto Show.&lt;ref name="dcc_facility_overview"&gt;[http://www.dallasconventioncenter.com/ Dallas Convention Center] - [http://www.dallasconventioncenter.com/facility/faco.asp Facility Overview].

The east side of the structure contains the original element of the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, a 9,816-seat [[Dallas Convention Center Arena|arena]]. The complex also houses a 1,740-person [[theater]], 105 meeting rooms, and 2 gigantic [[ballroom]]s. In terms of accessibility, the world's largest [[heliport]]/[[vertiport]] sits atop the structure and 75 truck [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s line its docks.&lt;ref name="dcc_facility_overview"/&gt; The [[Dallas CBD Vertiport]], located at the south end of the complex, has two 60 x 60 ft.

In May 2009, voters approved construction of the [[Omni Dallas Convention Center Hotel]], a 1,000 room hotel that is attached to the Convention Center. It opened in late 2011, under budget and ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2012/january/checking-in-the-omni-dallas-convention-center-hotel/|title=Checking In (And Checking Out) the Omni Dallas Hotel - D Magazine|work=D Magazine|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Dallas Memorial Auditorium was originally constructed in 1957 near the intersection of Canton and Akard Streets. While the auditorium still hosts many smaller events, its antiquated facilities and technology, along with the fact that it is not compliant with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]], have kept it less busy than in the past.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cityhallblog.dallasnews.com/2016/06/dallas-memorial-auditorium-was-good-enough-for-the-beatles-jfk-and-led-zeppelin-so-why-not-us-2.html/|title=Dallas’ Memorial Auditorium was good enough for the Beatles, JFK and Led Zeppelin, so why not us?|last=Wilonsky|first=Robert|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the center was expanded and renamed the Dallas Convention Center; the expansion was designed by local architects [[Omniplan (architects)|Omniplan]]. The center was expanded again in 1984 and once more in 1994,&lt;ref name="dcc_history"&gt;[http://www.dallasconventioncenter.com/ Dallas Convention Center] - [http://www.dallasconventioncenter.com/info/history.asp History].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6330">'''Cornelis ("Kees") Bruynzeel''' (February 19, 1900 in [[Rotterdam]] &amp;ndash; 1980) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[businessman]], [[timber]] [[merchant]] and [[yachtsman]].

==Early years==
Bruynzeel was the son of Cornelis Bruynzeel Sr., who founded a timber factory in 1897, and Antoinette Lels. He studied in [[The Hague]], and took several trips to the United States and Sweden to study progress in automatization and wood manufacturing. In 1920 he became manager of the family's new door factory in [[Zaandam]]. In 1922 he married Titia Verkade, granddaughter of the industrialist [[Ericus Verkade|Ericus Gerhardus Verkade]].

Bruynzeel Jr. was an avid sailor. He won the [[Fastnet race]] for the [[Netherlands]] in 1937 with his [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens|Stephens-designed]] [[yawl]] ''Zeearend'' ("sea eagle", the eagle being the logo of the Bruynzeel company). The Dutch designer [[Piet Zwart]] worked closely with Bruynzeel's father and his brother Willem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisg.nl/ondernemers/pdf/pers-0266-02.pdf|title=Biography: Willem Bruynzeel|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he designed their first kitchens) and was involved with the design of the Zeearend as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.nl/foto.php?pageID=157 |title=Piet Zwart, een veelzijdig avant-gardistisch vormgever |language=Dutch }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, when the production had expanded to include floors and kitchens and the threat of [[World War II]] was causing a decline in the building industry, he considered alternatives and pioneered the development of new timber materials for the production of the Bruynzeel kitchen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nai.nl/e/collection/news/2004/0405_bruynzeel_e.html |title=Model by Bruynzeel: Design your own kitchen |publisher=Netherlands Architecture Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724120633/http://www.nai.nl/e/collection/news/2004/0405_bruynzeel_e.html |archivedate=2006-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for boat construction. Using a newly developed water-resistant synthetic resin glue, Bruynzeel developed a durable three-ply wood, similar to [[plywood]], for the fabrication of external doors. Bruynzeel went on to extend the concept of the modular kitchen and with [[E.G. van de Stadt]] developed the first industrialised boat construction system in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valkenklasse.nl/nieuws/newsarch.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426210812/http://www.valkenklasse.nl/nieuws/newsarch.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-04-26 |title=Valkenklasse |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Bruynzeel Multipanel Int. B.V., as it was later renamed, is a leading timber company that specialises in [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[construction]] timber, with distribution throughout [[Europe]], [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], amongst others. The Bruynzeel name also lives on as a [[shelf (storage)|shelving]] brand of the Norwegian [[Constructor Group AS|Constructor Group]].

==South Africa==
In 1956 Kees Bruynzeel Jr. moved to [[South Africa]], where he owned and operated a company [[Bruply Doors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icpcredit.com/ReportRequest.asp?sCompanyID=306988|title=Bruply Doors (Pty) Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a factory at [[Stellenbosch]]. Bruynzeel's South African timber operations now comprise [[PG Bison]] and are controlled by Steinhoff Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinhoffinternational.com/asp/africa_operations.asp|title=PG Bison and Steinhoff Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Bruynzeel built a house in [[Stellenbosch]], that was controversial considering the conservative architecture of the time. The roof of the house is shaped like a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], and is constructed using [[teak]] [[rafter]]s and lined with [[Afrocarpus|yellowwood]]. It was [[design]]ed by [[architect]] [[Aart Bijl]].

==Sailing==
Bruynzeel continued sailing and winning races. In the 1937 Fastnet Race "Zeearend" was winner overall.
In the  Fastnet 1951 Race, "Zeevalk" wasklasse winner and 2. overall.
"Stormvogel" was first to finish in the 61 Fastnet, the 62 Buenos Aires-Rio race, the 64 Burmuda race, the Sydney-Hobart, the China Sea, and the 1967 Trans-Pacific Race (Los Angeles-to-Hawaii [[Transpacific Yacht Race|Transpac]] race with the boat ''Stormvogel'' ("Stormbird" or the ''[[Procellariidae|Shearwater]]''), after coming in a close second in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transpacificyc.org/history/tp03-lists.html |title=The Transpac Race at www.transpacificyc.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504022510/http://www.transpacificyc.org/history/tp03-lists.html |archivedate=2006-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, aged 72, Bruynzeel took both line and overall handicap honours in the [[Cape to Rio Yacht Race]] in his boat ''Stormy'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rorc.org/admiralscup/history/1957/default.html|title=Excerpt from ''The Admiral's Cup'' by Bob Fisher|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427205526/http://www.rorc.org/admiralscup/history/1957/default.html|archivedate=2006-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his progress was followed with keen interest, since he had suffered three [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s in the previous year.

That’s then followed by some “shakeout of people that don’t like it for a lot of reasons—user difficulty, user error, and the like.” In the end, Jetta says, sales numbers balance out. Echoing Ciabarra, Jetta pointed out that such systems reduce cost to the retailer, and stores usually see “a significant customer satisfaction uptick” from customers who place value on self-checkout, particularly in terms of customer loyalty. Like Ciabarra, Jetta says he is “suspicious” of Shine’s story. “The assumption,” Jetta said, is that if a customer tries to leave the store with unpurchased items, “is operator error or oversight … Apple wouldn’t want to make it the norm that they’re harassing and jacking up all the people going to the stores. That doesn’t help anybody.”|title=When using Apple Store's EasyPay isn't so easy|last=Friedman|first=Lex|date=7 March 2012|publisher=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kmart]],&lt;ref name=Covert&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/22/lamperts-sears-remedies-are-masquerade/|title=Lampert’s Sears remedies are a masquerade|last=Covert|first=James|date=22 May 2014|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=22 August 2014|quote=But “Shop Your Way” — whose rewards points program typically gives discounts amounting to 1 percent — represents backward, outdated thinking, says Kurt Jetta, CEO of TABS Group, a retail consultant focused on pricing and merchandise issues. “Sears and Kmart are so hurting for shoppers that anything they do to hurt one customer is bad, but they’re doing it en masse,” Jetta said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[JcPenney]],&lt;ref name=Penney&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/03/27/jcpenney-ceo-flip-flops-again-on-prices/|title=JCPenney CEO flip-flops again on prices|last=Covert|first=James|date=27 March 2013|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sears]].&lt;ref name=Covert/&gt; In addition, Jetta has also studied the [[organic food]] industry,&lt;ref name=Linn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/money/organic-sales-shifting-regular-grocery-stores-6C9678186|title=Organic sales shifting to regular grocery stores|last=Linn|first=Allison|date=12 January 2011|work=[[CNBC]]|publisher=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|accessdate=22 August 2014|quote=The percentage of people who buy organic products has stayed virtually the same for the past few years, according to a new survey out Wednesday from TABS Group.

Mr. Jetta still projects overall growth of 3% to 4% for 2014 in a business he pegs at $11.4 billion in all channels, although he is leaning more toward low end of that range, well below high-single or even double-digit growth rates in years past. The effect is most noticeable on the segment targeted by the study -- multivitamins -- he said. That's in line with prior studies in the past decade that put the kibosh on beta-carotene and vitamin E, yet seems to be having a broader effect than the decline of those businesses had. "Typically the negativity is isolated only on the one product," Mr. Jetta said. "But this one seems to be a bit broader and brought an overall malaise to the category."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the online grocery industry. Other investigations led by Jetta include [[sociological research]] that pertains to the purchasing habits of various ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=Zetlin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2012/05/14/latest-privacy-invasion-retailer-tracking/|title=The Latest Privacy Invasion: Retailer Tracking|last=Zetlin|first=Minda|date=16 May 2012|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=22 August 2014|quote="The most important thing that data is used for is to determine which products consumers prefer, and to make sure what's on the shelf is what they want to buy," explains Kurt Jetta, CEO of TABS Group, a consumer analytics company in Shelton, Conn. "For example, we're doing one project for a retail chain where we found that in areas with high African-American populations, not only do they buy African-American hair care products and cosmetics specifically, but they buy grooming products in general at a very high level. With that kind of information, the retailer can make sure all those products are stocked and available for them."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of [[trade promotion (marketing)|trade promotion]], Jetta has developed an alternative methodology to current industry baseline models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Method and system for estimating base sales volume of a product|last=Kolandaiswamy|first=Antony Arokia Durai Raj|author2=Kanagasabapathi Balasubramanian|date=22 December 2011|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 August 2014|quote=The method includes receiving sales data of the product from one or more sales data sources.

The base sales volume of the product is the same as the calculated total sales volume when the base sales volume obtained after modifying the one or more independent variables is either negative or greater than the total sales volume.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jetta also analyzes [[rewards program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiefexecutive.net/ceos-weigh-fix-troubled-company|title=CEOs Weigh in on How to Fix a Troubled Company|last=Buss|first=Dale|date=25 July 2014|publisher=[[Chief Executive (magazine)|Chief Executive]]|accessdate=27 August 2014|quote=Kurt Jetta, CEO of the TABS consumer metrics company, believes that Sears’ emphasis on its “Shop Your Way” loyalty program—which accounted for 74 percent of sales during the fiscal first quarter, up from 68 percent a year earlier—is only “doubling down on a fatally flawed program.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/22/lamperts-sears-remedies-are-masquerade/|title=Lampert’s Sears remedies are a masquerade|last=Covert|first=James|date=22 May 2014|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=27 August 2014|quote=But “Shop Your Way” — whose rewards points program typically gives discounts amounting to 1 percent — represents backward, outdated thinking, says Kurt Jetta, CEO of TABS Group, a retail consultant focused on pricing and merchandise issues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Republican candidate in Florida’s 21st Congressional District.

==Career==

Between 1996 and 1998 he held a position as Chief Executive Officer of Binky-Griptight, Inc.  Binky-Griptight is a supplier of infant products. Prior to Binky-Griptight, Jetta spent seven years at Playtex Products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/thewagmag/docs/fair_031615|title=Fairfield County Business Journal 031615|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2009 and 2012, Jetta [[sample size|sampled]] 1,000 individuals who were aged 18–75 in order to study "their buying habits when it comes to organic products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesunion.com/living/article/Organics-overhyped-but-on-the-rise-study-says-3389397.php|title=Organics overhyped, but on the rise, study says|last=Fischer|first=Eileen|date=7 March 2012|publisher=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]|accessdate=22 August 2014|quote=During the last four years, Jetta has been conducting national surveys of 1,000 consumers, ages 18 to 75, using a different group each year, to find out their buying habits when it comes to organic products.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt Jetta's research, with regard to the [[organic food]] industry, suggests that the "percentage of people who buy organic products has stayed virtually the same for the past few years,"&lt;ref name=Linn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/health/2014523715_organic18.html|title=Organic, natural products sell strongly despite recession|last=Stock|first=Sue|date=17 March 2011|publisher=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=22 August 2014|quote=Kurt Jetta is president of the TABS Group, a Connecticut consumer research firm.

Jetta has stated that "The most important thing that data is used for is to determine which products consumers prefer, and to make sure what's on the shelf is what they want to buy...For example, we're doing one project for a retail chain where we found that in areas with high African-American populations, not only do they buy African-American hair care products and cosmetics specifically, but they buy grooming products in general at a very high level. With that kind of information, the retailer can make sure all those products are stocked and available for them."&lt;ref name=Zetlin/&gt;

In early 2016, Jetta criticized the consumer packaged goods industry for stalling their own growth. His work, covered by  both Wells Fargo and Food Navigator USA, showed that the consumer packaged goods industry focuses too much on less effective promotional tactics such as retailer loyalty programs and marketing to millennials at the expense of doing more traditional consumer trade promotion.&lt;ref name=Kress&gt;Kress, Melissa. [http://www.csnews.com/node/89942 “Misguided Paradigms Plague Today’s Trade Promotions.”] Convenience Store News. April 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He has also published opinion articles on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Jetta, Kurt.

Nov. 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, Jetta’s research on online purchasing of baby goods by consumers received press when the study revealed that baby products are the largest online market of any  of the consumer packaged goods categories studied.&lt;ref name=Baby&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/target-walmart-amazon-dominate-the-online-baby-goods-market-2016-4 “Target, Walmart, Amazon dominate the online baby goods market.”] Business Insider.

Jetta began commenting on the online grocery business in 2016. After a TABS study found that fewer consumers purchased groceries online in 2016 than in 2015, he reported that “online grocery is failing,” and that Amazon would have difficulty breaking into grocery business because consumers enjoy grocery shopping in brick and mortar stores.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Bryan.

==Corporation analyses==
In July 2014, after [[Dollar Tree]] announced its acquisition bid of [[Family Dollar]], ''[[USA Today]]'' shared Kurt Jetta's prediction that the merger would affect the entire economic [[Sector (economic)|sector]] shared by companies such as Walmart.&lt;ref name=Hadley/&gt; Jetta's TABS Group formed a "senior-level team dedicated to supporting internal and customer-related initiatives with Walmart" and researched the methodology that enables this corporation to operate "on a chain and local level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tabs-group-forms-dedicated-wal-mart-analytics-team-to-enhance-insights-at-largest-us-retailer-2013-10-11|title=TABS Group Forms Dedicated Wal-Mart Analytics Team to Enhance Insights at Largest U.S. Retailer|date=13 October 2011|publisher=[[MarketWatch]]|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tying in with his consumer research related to the organic food industry, Jetta et al. found that Walmart suffered in some areas after it "jumped on the organic bandwagon a little too soon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesunion.com/living/article/Organics-overhyped-but-on-the-rise-study-says-3389397.php|title=Organics overhyped, but on the rise, study says|last=Fischer|first=Eileen|date=7 March 2012|publisher=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]|accessdate=22 August 2014|quote=Kurt Jetta, founder and chief executive officer of TABS Group Inc. in Shelton, Conn., a company that provides analytics, software and strategic consulting to companies involved in consumer products, began studying consumer attitudes on organic products years ago when retailers came to him asking whether or not they should carry organic products. Their concern came from the fact that some stores jumped on the organic bandwagon a little too soon, Jetta explained, pumping up their inventory with organic products, setting up special displays and then regretting their decisions. "Wal-Mart got into (organics) in a big way and got hurt in a few areas," he said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also reviewed Walmart’s change in practice of charging almost all their vendors a stocking fee. Formally the corporation charged these fees sporadically.  While a common practice among other retailers, Jetta notes that the change for Walmart, " suggests that they are seeking areas to offset their increased investment in wages, as well as offset their lack of organic revenue growth."&lt;ref&gt;Layne, Natthan. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/24/us-wal-mart-stores-suppliers-idUSKBN0P400K20150624  “Wal-Mart to Impose Charges on Suppliers as its Costs Mount.”] Reuters.  June 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, he weighed in on the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by retailer chain A&amp;P.  He said that the retailer “…has been a dead man walking for 20 years, and the gig is finally up.”  Jetta predicts that while one of A&amp;P’s largest creditors might take over some of the stores, many will close and better-managed competitors will purchase the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Covert, James. [https://nypost.com/2015/07/20/historic-grocery-chain-ap-files-for-chapter-11/ “Historic Grocery Chain A&amp;P Files for Chapter 11.”] New York Post. June 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ahold NV and Delhaise Group merged to become one of the largest supper market chains in the United States, Jetta noted his approval of the $560 million in savings the companies will incur after just 3 years, was “vital in a flat market.”&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Ian., &amp; Gasparro, A. [http://www.nasdaq.com/article/ahold-delhaize-agree-to-merger--3rd-update-20150624-00968 “Ahold, Delhaize Agree to Merger -- 3rd Update.”] Dow Jones Business News. June 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Jetta also shared his insights about [[Apple Store]]s' EasyPay innovation in [[Macworld]], after a court case was pending about Eric Shine who "was accused of trying to walk out of the Apple Store on New York’s Fifth Avenue without paying for a pair of headphones" although Shine claims that "he did try to pay, using the mobile Apple Store app’s EasyPay option on his phone, but that the purchase didn’t go through."&lt;ref name=Macworld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1168261/when_using_apple_stores_easypay_isnt_so_easy.html|quote=Apple’s EasyPay service promises Apple Store shoppers a fast way to conduct business at the company’s retail outlets, letting them buy items without even talking to a store employee. It’s fast and convenient—but one New Jersey teenager claims he got more than he bargained for, after he was accused of trying to walk out of the Apple Store on New York’s Fifth Avenue without paying for a pair of headphones. Eighteen-year-old Eric Shine insists that he did try to pay, using the mobile Apple Store app’s EasyPay option on his phone, but that the purchase didn’t go through. A New York court will hear his case in October.|title=When using Apple Store's EasyPay isn't so easy|last=Friedman|first=Lex|date=7 March 2012|publisher=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jetta stated that 'when stores add customer-driven point of sale (POS) options like EasyPay, “in general, what happens is that there’s a fairly significant surge in sales” at first, due to the novelty of the new system. That’s then followed by some “shakeout of people that don’t like it for a lot of reasons—user difficulty, user error, and the like.”'&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;

Kurt Jetta's research pertaining to Kmart and Sears found that both of their [[rewards program]]s gave discounts of one percent, which Jetta stated, has the effect of hurting their whole [[customer base]].&lt;ref name=Covert/&gt; Jetta has also criticized [[JcPenney]] for what he perceives to be a lack of understanding of trade promotion methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2012/05/31/jcpenney-revives-clearance-events-ceo-previously-likened-to-drugs/|title=JCPenney revives clearance events CEO previously likened to drugs|last=Covert|first=James|date=31 May 2012|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=27 August 2014|quote=“They’re delusional,” Jetta said of Penney. “They’re not all that much different from other retailers that have had this problem before. They just have a much higher level of hubris about it.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When grocery chain A&amp;P filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015, Jetta criticized the chain, calling the bankruptcy “a surprise to absolutely no one.”&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Thad. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/20/ap-was-the-walmart-of-its-day-now-its-filing-for-bankruptcy/ “A&amp;P was ‘the Wal-Mart of its day.’ Now it’s filing for bankruptcy.”] The Washington Post. July 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, Jetta estimated the US supplements industry at $11.8 billion,  challenging Nutrition Business Journal’s estimate of over $35 billion as “vastly overstated.”&lt;ref name=Daniells&gt;Daniells, Stephen. [http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Markets/Is-the-35-billion-figure-for-the-dietary-supplements-industry-over-inflated “Is the $35 billion figure for the dietary supplements industry over-inflated?”] Nutra Ingredients. Sept. 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His statements prompted a rebuttal from Nutrition Business Journal’s Editor-in-Chief and started an ongoing debate.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, John.

Nineteen years later, Jetta pursued his Ph.D. In Economics from Fordham University, where he graduated in 2008.  His doctoral thesis was titled:  A Theory of Retailer Price Promotion Using Economic Foundations: It’s All Incremental, with his central thesis being that the incremental sales generated on a promoted product is entirely incremental to the brand, category and promoting retailer.&lt;ref&gt;Jetta, Kurt.

{{Translation sidebar}}
The '''language industry''' is the sector of activity dedicated to facilitating multilingual communication, both oral and written. According to the European Commission's Directorate-General of Translation, the language industry comprises the activities of translation, interpreting, subtitling and dubbing, software and website globalisation, language technology tools development, international conference organisation, language teaching and linguistic consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language industry web platform|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/programmes/languageindustry/platform/index_en.htm|publisher=EC DG Translation|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Canadian Language Industry Association, this sector comprises translation (with interpreting, subtitling and localisation), language training and language technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our industry|url=http://www.ailia.ca/Our+Industry|publisher=Language Industry Association|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Language Industry Association limits the sector to translation, localisation, internationalisation and globalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ELIA membership application|url=http://www.elia-association.org/index.php?id=101&amp;no_cache=1|publisher=European Language Industry Association|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An older, perhaps outdated view confines the language industry to computerised [[language processing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btb.gc.ca/btb.php?lang=eng&amp;cont=700#l|title=Glossary - Translation Bureau|publisher=[[Public Works and Government Services Canada]]|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and places it within the [[information technology industry]]. An emerging view expands this sector to include [[Editing#Editing_services|editing]] for authors who write in a second language—especially English—for international communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supporting research writing: roles and challenges in multilingual settings|year=2013|publisher=Chandos|location=Oxford|pages=257–268|last=Matarese|first=Valerie. Supporting research writing in non-anglophone Europe: reflections and recurring themes|editor=Matarese Valerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Services ==
The scope of services in the industry includes:
*[[Translation]]
*[[Editing]] for authors: [[author editing]]
*[[Editing]] for publishers, e.g. [[copy editing]], [[proofreading]] (including [[Computer-assisted reviewing|CAR]]), [[developmental editing]]
*[[Language interpretation]]
*[[Language education]]
*[[Computer-assisted translation]] tools development
*[[Terminology extraction]]
*[[Language localisation]]
*[[Software localisation]]
*[[Machine translation]]

The persons who facilitate multilingual communication by offering individualized services—translation, interpreting, editing or language teaching—are called [[language professional]]s.

== Evolution ==
Translation as an activity exists at least since mankind started developing [[trade]] millennia ago; so, if we include [[interpreting]], it is no exaggeration to say that the origins of language industry are older than those of [[written language]].

Modern language industry has developed rapidly following availability of the [[internet]]. Achievements of the industry include the ability to quickly translate long texts into many languages. This has created new challenges as compared with the traditional activity of translators, such as that of [[quality assurance]]. There are various [[Translation-quality standards|quality standards]] such as the  [[International Organization for Standardization]]'s ISO 17100,  [[EN 15038]] in Europe, the CAN CGSB 131.10 in Canada and ASTM F2575-06 in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030122045/|title=BS EN 15038:2006  Translation services. Service requirements|publisher=[[BSI Group]]|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study commissioned by the EC's Directorate-General for Translation estimated the language industry in European member states to be worth 8.4 billion euro in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The size of the language industry in the EU|year=2009|publisher=European Commission DG Translation|isbn=978-92-79-14181-2|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/EU-Bookshop-Site/en_GB/-/EUR/ViewPublication-Start?PublicationKey=HC8009985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest portion, 5.7 billion euro, was ascribed to the activities of translation, interpreting, software localisation and website globalisation. Editing was not taken into consideration. The study projected an annual growth rate of 10% for the language industry. At the time the study was published, in 2009, the language industry was less affected by the economic crisis than other industry sectors. 

One field of research in the industry includes the possibility of [[machine translation]] fully replacing human translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of TMI|last=Paul |first=Michael |author2=Andrew Finch |author3=Eiichiro Sumita  |title=Reducing human assessment of machine translation quality to binary classifiers|year=2007|pages=154–162|url=http://www.mt-archive.info/TMI-2007-Paul.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Rates for translation services have become a big discussion topic nowadays{{when?|date=January 2014}},&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web|url=http://www.proz.com/forum/money_matters/147026-why_are_rates_so_low-page3.html|title=Why are rates so low?|publisher=[[ProZ.com]]|accessdate=2011-02-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as several translation outsourcers allegedly go in search of cheap labor. Professional associations like [[IAPTI]] try to put a stop to this development.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.translatorscafe.com/cafe/MegaBBS/forumthread14854.htm A new T&amp;I association is born]
&lt;/ref&gt; Currency fluctuation is yet another important factor.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.globalwatchtower.com/2007/11/14/translation-pricing/ Rates for translation services to go up?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from this, phenomena such as [[crowdsourcing]] appear in large-scale translations.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.globalwatchtower.com/2008/03/27/collaborative-translation-and-crowdsourcing/ Collaborative translation and crowdsourcing (in English and Portuguese)]
&lt;/ref&gt; 

US President [[Barack Obama]] drew criticism after a 2009 White House white paper proposed incentives for automatic translation.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Nebojša Čović''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Небојша Човић}}; born 2 July 1958) is a Serbian businessman and basketball executive and former politician. He currently serves as a president for the [[KK Crvena zvezda|Crvena zvezda]].

==Early years and education==
Čović was born in [[Belgrade]], [[People's Republic of Serbia|PR Serbia]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]], and graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]]'s Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. In 2000, he obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] at the same university.

==Political career==
In 1992, as a member of the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] (SPS), 34-year-old Čović started his climb up the political ladder with a position of executive board vice-president in charge of economy and finances at the Belgrade city assembly.

A year later, in 1993, he advanced to the position of the city government president. In 1994 he got elected as the [[Mayor of Belgrade]]. In parallel, Čović was the SPS [[deputy (legislator)|deputy]] ([[Member of Parliament|MP]]) in the [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian National Assembly]]. Čović was sacked from the mayoral post in mid January 1997 by the Serbian president and SPS party leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] amid the [[1996–1997 protests in Serbia|months-long protests]] in Serbia over the November 1996 municipal elections fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/1997-01-14/world/9701_14_yugo.update_1_zajedno-vuk-draskovic-serbian-president-slobodan-milosevic?_s=PM:WORLD Milosevic sacks mayors of Belgrade and Nis], cnn.com, 14 January 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He was expelled from SPS on the same occasion.

He became the president of [[Democratic Alternative (Serbia)|Democratic Alternative]] (DA) after the party got formed by certain number of SPS members seceded from SPS in July 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ex-yupress.com/danas/danas7.html Nebojsa Covic, president of the Democratic Alternative and former mayor of Belgrade: Ms. Mira Markovic Annulled November 1996 Elections, EX-YU Press, 21 November 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Čović served as the head of the Coordination Center for Kosovo and Metohija and as the head of the Southern Serbia Coordination Center during [[Insurgency in the Preševo Valley|Preševo Valley conflict]] (1999–2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/old_archive-article.php?yyyy=2004&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=27154 Covic to stay at Kosovo Coordination Centre], B92.net, 26 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 24 October 2000 to 25 January 2001 he was a member of the trio Co-Prime Ministers together with [[Milomir Minić]] from SPS and [[Spasoje Krunić]] from the [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO) that transitionally governed Serbia after the [[Bulldozer Revolution]], when [[Mirko Marjanović]] was sacked. After the [[assassination of Zoran Đinđić]], he was the acting Prime Minister of Serbia from 12 to 16 March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2003-03-12/world/serbia.djindjic.shooting.1235_1_prime-minister-djindjic-natasa-micic-zoran-djindjic?_s=PM:WORLD Serbian PM shot dead], CNN.com, 12 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, his party Democratic Alternative merged into the [[Social Democratic Party (Serbia 2001–10)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). In 2005, he became president of the Social Democratic Party. The party ceased to exist in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.rs/Vesti/Nebojsa-Covic-za-Press-POVRATAK-U-POLITIKU.html Povratak u politiku (in Serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Politika/Politichka-scena-bez-Liberala-Srbije-SDP-a-SLS-a.sr.html Politička scena bez Liberala Srbije, SDP-a i SLS-a]; accessed 17 April 2015. {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been charged for corruption in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blic.rs/vesti/hronika/optuznica-protiv-nebojse-covica-dostavljena-specijalnom-sudu/ljjjk93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports administration career==

;FMP Železnik (1991–2011)
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2015}}
In 1991 Čović became involved with Serbian basketball club KK ILR Železnik, a dormant sports collective for the workers of state-owned Ivo Lola Ribar metallurgical factory. Inactive since 1986, the club got revived by Čović under the auspices of his privately-owned metal products factory Fabrika metalnih proizvoda AD and renamed [[FMP Železnik]]. Under his guidance and ownership, the club grew into one of the top teams in Serbia and [[FR Yugoslavia]], developing a reputation for player development and quality work with younger categories.

By 1993, the club got its own basketball facility — the 2,000-seat [[Železnik Hall]] that served as its home arena form then on. Climbing rapidly up the basketball pyramid in FR Yugoslavia, FMP began the 1994-95 season in the Second Federal League, winning promotion to the country's [[YUBA League|top basketball competition]] for the following 1995-96 season. 

In 1998, Čović brought former Yugoslav national team player [[Ratko Radovanović]] on board as the club's sporting director. Radovanović soon became synonymous with the emerging club, making player personnel decisions and running its day-to-day operations. 

Čović's son [[Filip Čović|Filip]] later played as [[point guard]] for the club.

;Yugoslav Basketball Federation (1995–1997)
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2015}}
In late 1995, while simultaneously performing the city of Belgrade mayoral job as well as Serbian National Assembly MP duties, Čović became president of the [[Basketball Federation of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Basketball Federation]] (KSJ), succeeding Veselin "Vesko" Barović in the job. In addition to Čović's political connections through SPS, the rapid success of his club FMP Železnik that was about to start competing in the country's top league that season after multiple promotions was the best possible recommendation for the job. 

At the time when Čović came on board to lead the federation, FR Yugoslavia national team led by [[Dušan Ivković|Duda Ivković]] were the reigning [[EuroBasket 1995|European champions]], having returned to international competition following a four-year exile due to the UN embargo. Ivković soon stepped down and his assistant [[Željko Obradović]] took over the national team head coaching job. The national team had a great run at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, reaching the final against the American Dream Team composed of NBA players. In early 1997, soon after Čović's fall from grace in SPS, he was removed from the KSJ job as well.

'''Paul Dayton Bailey''' (12 July 1906 — 26 October 1987) was the owner/publisher of Westernlore Press and a writer of many books himself that focused on the Western American experience and, in particular, [[Latter-day Saint]] history.

== Early years ==
Bailey was the son of Eli and Olive Bailey and the grandson of Joseph Forbes. He was raised in [[American Fork, Utah]] until the age of 13 when his father went to [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grant's Pass]], [[Oregon]] to take part in the building of a new [[sugar beet]]-processing [[factory]] for the [[Amalgamated Sugar Company|Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]]. As Eli helped build the factory, he sent letters and money home, finally persuading his family to join him.&lt;ref name=PolyMono&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Paul|title=Polygamy Was Better than Monotony|publisher= Westernlore Press|date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family did not stay in Oregon long. Utah-Idaho failed to persuade local farmers to pick up the new crop and, two summers later, Eli was put in charge of dismantling the factory and loading it upon rail cars for reassembly in [[Yakima River|Yakima Valley]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; The family, which had always been poor, grew more impoverished with each move, and the Yakima venture did not pull them out.

The factory was not reassembled in time for the first year's (bumper) crop, and before the second year's crop could be processed, [[World War I]] ended, dropping sugar prices to what Bailey would later describe as "catastrophic lows".&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;{{rp|114}} The lowered prices were accompanied by a disease called "[[curly top]]" which reduced the previously enormous Washington yields to industry-killing scarcity.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

The Bailey family responded to the death of sugar with a disastrous attempt at [[Potato#Cultivation|potato farming]] in Washington, after which young Bailey ran away, back home to American Fork, where he set up residence with his maternal grandfather Joseph Barlow Forbes and his [[Plural marriage|first wife]]—Bailey's grandmother—Nancy. Living with them meant Bailey was not allowed to drop out of school and work as he had intended.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

A year after his return to American Fork, his mother and his [[siblings]] also returned. Elie moved to [[Idaho Falls]], [[Idaho]] to be foreman at a UISC factory there. Although Eli sent checks to his family, Bailey finally did drop out of school to help support his mother, who would soon divorce Eli, at which point Bailey left home for good with a move to [[Salt Lake City]].&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

Supporting himself with odd jobs, Bailey put himself through [[Stevens-Henager College|Henager's Business College]] and [[LDS Business College]].&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; While working at the county [[hospital]] as a night [[orderly]], Bailey met Evelyn Robison. Shortly after impulsively kissing her and getting slapped in return, he moved to [[California]] and she returned to her [[Fillmore, Utah|hometown]] due to illness.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

== Early writing career ==
Shortly after arriving in [[Los Angeles]], Bailey began work as an apprentice [[typographer]]. While working in newspapers, he remet Robison, who was working again at becoming a [[registered nurse]]. They were soon married, which resulted in her expulsion from General Hospital's School of Nursing.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; It was the eve of the [[Great Depression]].

Evelyn undertook secretarial training at Metropolitan College. Bailey's typographic work kept him busy and well employed throughout the Depression. However, he had developed a desire to write. He fed that need initially with fact-based, usually historical articles, including a serialized study of [[Samuel Brannan]], published in the LDS periodicals ''[[Improvement Era|Era]]'' and ''[[Millennial Star]]'', and, later, with much success, in book form.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; This began a string of successes with Church-owned publications, such as his novel ''For This My Glory''; about the [[Mormon Battalion]]. His books were popular in Utah and even used as Sunday School texts.

Meanwhile, he had taken reporting jobs at the ''Los Angeles Record'' and ''[[Hollywood Citizen]]'', followed by a sudden opportunity to purchase the ''Eagle Rock Advertiser'', one of two newspapers in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California|Eagle Rock]], a small town outside of Los Angeles. The paper was on the verge of collapse, but since he had both editorial and typographical preparation, Bailey was able to keep costs down and eventually turn the ''Advertiser'' into Eagle Rock's premier paper. Evelyn, for her part, drummed up additional advertising revenue.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;

== World War II ==
[[World War II]] brought on serious paper-rationing with smaller newspapers were powerless to work around. While larger LA-area papers were able to purchase Canadian pulp mills to keep in paper, smaller papers were forced to print fewer pages less frequently.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt; The Baileys were particularly frustrated because during those boom years, the advertising available was much more than they had paper to print upon.

To supplement income, Bailey took a job reorganizing and running the [[Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]]'s ''Lockheed Star'', printing five separate editions for the five separate factories in the [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] area.

Also during the war years, Bailey started Westernlore Press to reprint classic texts on the Western United States, whose rarity prevented most interested libraries from purchasing copies. To his surprise, this venture was eased by the [[War Production Board]]'s far less stringent requirements for acquiring book paper. The books published by Westernlore—on the same presses used by the ''Advertiser''—were immediate successes and every edition sold out.

During this time, Bailey also found time to write three new books. The first, a fictionalized version of his [[Samuel Brannan]] biography, and the second (also a novel) were "enthusiastically received by the Saints."&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;{{rp|189}} The third, ''Jacob Hamblin, Buckskin Apostle'', became a source of controversy. Bailey received angry responses from LDS leadership and the [[Jacob Hamblin|Hamblin]] family—in large part because his book dealt with Hamblin's marriages to two [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] women and two white women, and the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]]. In later years however, ''Buckskin Apostle'' would experience a renaissance in LDS circles—even being published by Church-owned publication.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The end of the war saw larger corporations buying up impoverished smaller papers and forcing the others out of business. The ''Advertiser'' was one of the few, hardy small papers that survived the war rationing, only to be forced out of business by larger corporation shortly thereafter.

== Later life ==
Bailey ran Westernlore until 1973, when its inventory was lost in a fire and his son Lynn moved the company to [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="PhotoCollection"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Paul Dayton Bailey Photograph Collection, ca 1940-1980|url=https://heritage.utah.gov/apps/history/findaids/C00414/c0414.xml|website=Utah Department of Heritage &amp; Arts|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years he ran it, Westernlore continued to publish books focused on the Western United States that were highly regarded by libraries and well purchased. Westernlore published some of Bailey's own work, but his better known books were published by larger companies.

Many of his later books proved, to his and his publishers' surprise, to be controversial. For instance, ''For Time and All Eternity''—a book about the anti-polygamy crusade in the 1890s—caused a small uproar among the Utah faithful (although, according to [[Samuel W. Taylor]], "Bailey . . . [said the uproar] resulted from the objections of one man to a single passage in the book"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Samuel W.|authorlink1=Samuel W. Taylor|title=Peculiar People, Positive Thinkers and the Prospects of Mormon Literature|journal=[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]|date=Summer 1967|volume=2|issue=2|pages=17–31|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V02N02_19.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as did his book on [[Zion's Camp]], the Missouri Contingent, the [[Nauvoo Legion]] and the Mormon Battalion— ''The Armies of God.'' Bailey believed the book was "a warm, honest appraisal of Mormon heroism in conquering the West" and his publisher had arranged for numerous interviews and signings in Utah; however, in the end the book was never so much as reviewed in the State.&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;{{rp|197}}

Although estranged in many ways from Mormonism, Bailey always embraced that part of his heritage.

{{quote|As a writer, the fact that I am steeped in Mormon lore, has been more hindrance than help to me. I've never been able to purge from my stubborn mind a conviction that the Mormon tale is one of the most unique and interesting human dramas in the annals of America. It has been my soaring wings; it has been my cement coffin".&lt;ref name=PolyMono /&gt;{{rp|195}}}}

Evelyn died in 1981. Bailey never remarried; he died in 1987. They were buried in [[Fillmore, Utah]].&lt;ref name=PhotoCollection/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Dayton Bailey (1906-1987)|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14475232/paul-dayton-bailey|website=[[Find a Grave]]|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his papers are held by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Aid for the Paul Dayton Bailey Papers, 1940-1953|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1h4n981n/|website=The Online Archive of California|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Public Relations Institute of Australia''' (PRIA) is a [[peak organisation|peak body]] for [[public relations]] and communication professionals in Australia. It promotes high ethical standards in the public relations and communication industry through accredited membership, resources, training, and recognition. 

PRIA was founded in 1949. It sponsors the [[open access]] ''[[Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal]]''. The organisation is a member of the Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management.

== Projects ==
In 2014, PRIA projects included advising on lobbyist legislation, increasing the use of valid measurement in PR, and offering career development and professional support resources to practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bandt.com.au/media/ray-shaw-lead-pria-new-ceo |archivedate=25 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025125023/http://www.bandt.com.au/media/ray-shaw-lead-pria-new-ceo |date=20 June 2014 |title=Ray Shaw to lead PRIA as new CEO |publisher=B&amp;T |first=Neil |last=O'Sullivan |}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRIA also offers member training and professional development, runs a consultancy registration scheme, organises conferences and networking events, and presents annual awards for outstanding programs (the Golden Target Awards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noelturnbull.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/How-PR-works-but-often-doesnt.pdf |first=Noel |last=Turnbull |page=27 |title=How PR works... but often doesn't |date=2010 |publisher=N.S. &amp; J.S.

=== Course accreditations ===
PRIA introduced accreditation of Australian public relations courses in the late 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[PRism (journal) |PRism]] |url=http://www.prismjournal.org/fileadmin/10_1/Johnston_Macnamara.pdf |title=Public relations literature and scholarship in Australia: A brief history of change and diversification |date=2013 |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=9 |first1=Jane |last1=Johnston |first2=Jim |last2=Macnamara}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies three core benefits to accreditation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=PRIA |author= |title=PRIA Accreditation for Educational Programs |date=2014 |url=http://www.pria.com.au/eventsawards/accreditation-for-educational-programs |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923185850/https://www.pria.com.au/eventsawards/accreditation-for-educational-programs |archivedate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* committing education providers to aligning with current industry practice
* uniting educators and industry to progress the PR profession
* equipping graduates with best practice skills and competencies
PRIA continues to accredit courses for a five-year rolling period, but the Australian Government has not [[charter]]ed the association and PRIA does not demand degrees from its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/the-profession-that-dare-not-speak-its-name/story-e6frgcjx-1225891321598?nk=969b9f190510ddb15a4e647b2c989844 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |title=The profession that dare not speak its name |first=Stephen |last=Matchett |date=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships and sponsorships==
When [[Deakin University]] began publishing the ''Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal'' in 1999, PRIA became a sponsor of the publication, and it continues its support today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ojs.deakin.edu.au/index.php/apprj/about/journalSponsorship |title=Journal Sponsorship |publisher=Deakin University |accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PRIA is one of 25 founding members of the Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalalliancepr.org/website/member/public-relations-institute-australia-pria |title=Members: Public Relations Institute of Australia (PRIA) |publisher=Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management |accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, PRIA announced a partnership with the International Special Events Society to enable PRIA members to earn professional development points by attending ISES events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spicenews.com.au/2014/09/pria-ises-partnership-explained/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103081420/http://www.spicenews.com.au/2014/09/pria-ises-partnership-explained/|archivedate=3 November 2014 |title=PRIA and ISES partnership explained |first=Emma |last=Gardiner |date=4 September 2014 |publisher=Spice News |accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
When PRIA was established in 1949, [[Asher Joel]] was one of its founding members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pria.com.au/aboutus/in-honour/sir-asher-joel |archivedate=25 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025130519/http://www.pria.com.au/aboutus/in-honour/sir-asher-joel |title=Sir Asher Joel |deadurl=no |publisher=PRIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PRIA established the annual Golden Target Awards in 1976, to recognise excellence in Australian public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publications.crowtherblayne.com.au/pria-golden-target-awards/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303035927/http://publications.crowtherblayne.com.au/pria-golden-target-awards/ |archivedate=3 March 2014 |title=PRIA Golden Target Awards| publisher=Crowther Blayne &amp; Associates 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Western Sydney]]'s Ward Library is home to the winners collection which dates from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pria.com.au/eventsawards/cid/14/t/eventsawards/l/layout |author=PRIA |publisher=PRIA |title=Golden Target Award (GTA) past winners |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029095011/http://www.pria.com.au/eventsawards/cid/14/t/eventsawards/l/layout |archivedate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the Public Relations Council was formed in 2012, PR practitioners discussed whether Australia's PR industry was big enough for two peak bodies, generally concluding that the market could embrace both organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketingmag.com.au/interviews/debate-is-australian-pr-big-enough-for-two-industry-bodies-26196/#.VE879K0cQy8 |publisher=Marketing Mag |date=6 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705232300/http://www.marketingmag.com.au/interviews/debate-is-australian-pr-big-enough-for-two-industry-bodies-26196/#.VE879K0cQy8 |archivedate=5 July 2013 |title=Debate: Is Australian PR big enough for two industry bodies?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''regulatory capitalism''' suggests that the operation maintenance and development of the [[International political economy|global political economy]] increasingly depends on administrative rules outside the legislatures and the courts.

The general trend despite and beyond the process of [[liberalization]] is that of growth rather than decline of [[regulation]]. [[Deregulation]] may represent trends in some industries (notably finance), but more regulation is the general trend beyond that characterize modern and post-modern capitalism alike.&lt;ref&gt;[[Levi-Faur, David]], ''The Global Diffusion of Regulatory Capitalism'', The ANNALS of the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]], March 2005, vol. 598, no. 1, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation in this interpretation is an instrument of organizations—states, business, civil and hybrid and is carried at all political arenas and levels.

The concept of regulatory capitalism serves as an alternative to concepts like [[financial capitalism]], [[welfare capitalism]], [[Casino Capitalism|casino capitalism]], [[developmental capitalism]], [[risk capitalism]], [[state capitalism]] and [[crony capitalism]] in an attempt to shed more light on capitalism as a polymorphous order.

==Business career==
Born in [[Vienna]], Lugner got a licence to work as a building contractor (''Baumeisterkonzession'') in 1962 and at first specialized in the erection of [[filling station]]s and the renovation of old buildings. His company started to prosper, and he eventually became known to a wider public with the completion, in 1979, of Vienna's first [[mosque]], situated on the banks of the river [[Danube]].

In 1990 he opened his own [[shopping mall]], ''Lugner City'', in a [[working class]] district of Vienna and, from the start, aggressively advertised his business by regularly inviting [[celebrity|celebrities]]&amp;mdash;starting with [[Thomas Gottschalk]]&amp;mdash;who would perform there and sign [[autograph]]s&amp;mdash;a [[marketing]] strategy not very common in a city that, back then, hardly had any shopping malls.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Through his shopping mall, Lugner was one of a small group of businesspeople who helped change Austrians' shopping habits by pushing to the limits the various regulations concerning [[shopping hours|opening hours]]. In a city where shops generally closed at 6 p.m. Mondays to Fridays and at noon on Saturdays to remain closed for more than one and a half days until Monday morning, Lugner strongly advocated late night shopping on at least one weekday and an extension of shopping hours to Saturday afternoon, even when that meant raising the [[trades union]]s' opposition.

==Celebrities==
[[File:Nielsen Lugner 20120115.jpg|thumb|"Mörtel" Lugner with [[Brigitte Nielsen]] (c.) and his wife Christina, 2012 at his ''Lugner City'' mall]]
In 1992 Mörtel and Mausi Lugner brought Harry Belafonte to Lugner City, and also took him along to the [[Vienna Opera Ball]]. From that time on, the couple have each year paid a celebrity to visit the shopping centre and then accompany them as their guest to that prestigious function at the Vienna State Opera, an "invitation" which has often been criticised or just belittled for being a nouveau riche idea. However, media attention has continually been rising, also abroad, so that today any official guests of honour are usually neglected compared to the Lugners' celebrities, who invariably have a status image:

==Political ambitions==

In the late 1990s Richard Lugner handed over his business to his two grown-up sons by an earlier marriage, [[Alexander Lugner|Alexander]] and [[Andreas Lugner]], and went into [[politics]]. In the [[Austrian presidential election, 1998|1998 presidential elections]] he finished fourth in a field of five candidates, receiving 9.91 per cent of the popular vote;  incumbent [[President of Austria|Federal President]] [[Thomas Klestil]], who had been running for a second term of office, received 63.4%. For the [[Austrian legislative election, 1999|parliamentary elections that took place the following year]], the Lugners organised a separate platform called ''Die Unabhängigen'' ("[[The Independents (Austria)|The Independents]]") but, as they only received 1.02 per cent of the vote, did not get any seats in the ''Nationalrat''. Nevertheless, at the end of the millennium, a survey found that more than 90 per cent of Austrians recognized the name ''Lugner''. For the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] he announced to collect the necessary signatures in order to participate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxist.com/political-earthquake-in-austria.htm ''Political Earthquake in Austria''] indicates received 2.4% in lowest turnout on record&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
In September 2014, Lugner (aged 81) married [[Germany|German]] [[Playboy]] model [[Cathy Schmitz]] (aged 24) at a ceremony held at the [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in Vienna. Schmitz was a [[Playboy Bunny]] at the [[Playboy Club]] in [[Cologne]] before being the cover model of German Playboy in 2013. Lugner had been married four times before.&lt;ref name="SD2014-09-13"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/richard-moertel-lugner-hauptsache-die-leute-schauen-1.2127218 Hauptsache, die Leute schauen], Carolin Gasteiger, Suddeutsche, 13 September 2014, accessed 16 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/playboy-model-cathy-schmitz-aged-24-marries-81-year-old-billionaire-richard-lugner-1465571 Playboy Model Cathy Schmitz, Aged 24, Marries 81-Year-Old Billionaire Richard Lugner], Toyin Owoseje, [[International Business Times]] 15 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugner has four children: His two sons, [[Alexander Lugner|Alexander]] and [[Andreas Lugner]], are from his first marriage. He has another child Nadine from a marriage to actress Sonja Jeannine. His youngest child, daughter Jacqueline (aged 21 in 2014), is from his 4th marriage.&lt;ref name="SD2014-09-13" /&gt;

==Trivia==
*''Die Lugners'' ("The Lugners") was a [[reality television|reality TV]] show produced by a private television broadcaster which showed Richard and Christina Lugner, their daughter, Jacqueline (born 1993), and Richard Lugner's mother-in-law, Martha Haidinger, at home, at work, and on holiday.
*Christina Lugner has co-written a book, ''Fit für die Society. Wie Frauen sich erfolgreich machen'' ("Fit for Society. How Women Make Themselves Successful", 2004) ({{ISBN|3-7015-0473-3}}), in which she advises career women on questions of [[etiquette]].

'''Ronald Steven Lauder''' (born February 26, 1944) is an American businessman, art collector, and political activist. He is an heir to the [[Estée Lauder Companies]], and the president of the [[World Jewish Congress]].

==Early life and education==
Lauder was born in [[New York City]], the son of [[Estée Lauder (businesswoman)|Estée Lauder]] and Joseph Lauder, founders of [[Estée Lauder Companies]]. He is the younger brother of [[Leonard Lauder]], chairman of the board of the Estée Lauder Companies.  The boys were raised [[Jewish]].

He attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] and holds a bachelor's degree in International Business from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. He studied at the [[University of Paris]], and received a Certificate in International Business from the [[University of Brussels]].

==Career==
Lauder started to work for the Estée Lauder Company in 1964.  In 1984, he became a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO policy at the [[United States Department of Defense]].

In 1986, [[Ronald Reagan]] named him as the [[United States Ambassador to Austria]], a position he held until 1987. As ambassador, he fired diplomatic officer [[Felix Bloch (diplomatic officer)|Felix Bloch]], who later became known in connection with the [[Robert Hanssen]] espionage case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DD1E3EF934A15754C0A96F948260|title= Just Who Was Our Envoy to Vienna?| work = [[The New York Times]] |date= July 27, 1989|accessdate= February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he made a bid to become the [[mayor of New York City]] in 1989, losing to [[Rudy Giuliani]] in the Republican primary. [[Michael Massing]], writing of this nomination race, notes that politically Lauder 'seemed out of step with most American Jews; ... he ran to the right of Rudolph Giuliani. And, on Israeli issues, he was a vocal supporter of the [[Likud]] party, with long-standing ties to [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Massing|Massing, Michael]] (March 2001). "Deal Breakers". ''[[The American Prospect]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Lauder was asked by [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] Benjamin Netanyahu to begin [[Diplomacy#Informal diplomacy|Track II negotiations]] with [[Syria]]n leader [[Hafez al-Assad]]; these negotiations continued after the election of [[Ehud Barak]] to the post. Lauder communicated a new-found willingness on Assad's part to make compromises with the Israelis in an overall [[land for peace]] deal, and his draft "Treaty of Peace Between Israel and Syria" formed an important part of the (ultimately fruitless) Israeli-Syrian negotiations that occurred in January 2000 in [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]], [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Lauder manages investments in real estate and media, including [[Central European Media Enterprises]] and Israeli TV. In 2010, Lauder founded RWL Water, LLC.

==Civic and philanthropic activities==
Lauder is actively involved in numerous civic organizations, including the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], the [[Jewish National Fund]], the [[World Jewish Congress]], the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]], [[Brandeis University]], and the [[Abraham Fund]]. With his brother he founded the Lauder Institute at Wharton School. Lauder has also served as a finance chairman of the [[New York Republican State Committee]].

In 2003, Lauder founded and became a president of [[Lauder Business School]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

Lauder led a movement to introduce [[term limit]]s in the [[New York City Council]], which were subsequently imposed on most NYC elected officials, including the Mayor and City Council, after a citywide referendum in 1993. In 1996, voters turned down a council proposal to extend term limits. Lauder spent $4 million on the two referendums. He has been involved in environmental conservation efforts in eastern Long Island and has served on the board of directors of the conservation organization Group for the East End since 2002.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Art===
On November 16, 2001, Lauder opened the [[Neue Galerie New York|Neue Galerie]] in New York, an art museum across the street from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].  The Neue Galerie is dedicated to art from Germany and Austria from the early 20th century. It holds one of the best collections of works by [[Egon Schiele]] in the world.

On June 18, 2006, he purchased from [[Maria Altmann]] and her family, the painting ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' by [[Gustav Klimt]] for $135 million, the [[List of most expensive paintings|highest price ever paid for a painting]] at that time. Lauder called the painting "Our [[Mona Lisa]]". He reportedly saw Klimt's portrait as a youth in Vienna and had admired it since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Vogel, Carol |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/19/arts/design/19klim.html |title= Lauder Pays $135 Million, a Record, for a Klimt Portrait |date= June 19, 2006 |work= [[The New York Times]] |access-date= June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/19/local/me-klimt19 |title= Klimt Painting Sells for Record Amount |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, a [[Nazi plunder|Nazi-looted art piece]] which had just been restored to Altmann following years of negotiation and litigation with the [[Austrian government]], now forms the centerpiece of the museum's collection.

Lauder also has the world's largest private collection of [[Components of medieval armour|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[armor]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Lauder has been instrumental in a number of cases in recovering "lost" art from the Nazi period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://financialservices.house.gov/banking/21000lau.htm |title=Testimony of Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman, Commission for Art Recovery, World Jewish Congress, Before The House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, February 10, 2000 |accessdate=2006-06-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602014451/http://financialservices.house.gov/banking/21000lau.htm |archivedate=June 2, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}. financialservices.house.gov&lt;/ref&gt; He has been criticized for failure to resolve a case involving the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), which in 1997 exhibited some paintings owned by [[Rudolph Leopold]], a Viennese doctor and art collector. An investigative article in ''The New York Times'' on December 24, 1997 – "A Singular Passion for Amassing Art, One Way or Another" – outlined a case involving ''[[Portrait of Wally]]'' by [[Egon Schiele]], which was in the MoMA exhibition but was obtained by Leopold soon after the Nazi era. The [[New York County District Attorney]] (Manhattan) stepped in to help restore the piece to descendants of its original owner, but ownership of the painting is still in contention, nearly ten years later. Lauder has been accused of a failure to act on the case, despite being MoMA chairman at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Dobrzynski, Judith H. (January 25, 1998) [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/29/arts/man-in-the-middle-of-the-schiele-case.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "Man in the Middle of the Schiele Case"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder is an honorary trustee of the [[World Monuments Fund]], a New York-based non-profit with the mission of protecting endangered cultural heritage sites around the world.

===Ronald S. Lauder Foundation===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2016}}
In 1987, Lauder established the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, a philanthropic organization that is dedicated to rebuilding Jewish life in Central and Eastern [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lauderfoundation.com/president|title=Our President|website=lauderfoundation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also supports student exchange programs between New York and various capitals in Central and Eastern Europe.

===Alzheimer's Research===
In 1998, Lauder co-founded the [[Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation]] with his brother, [[Leonard Lauder|Leonard A. Lauder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elcompanies.com/~/media/Files/E/Estee-Lauder/media-resources-executive-profiles/Ronald%20S%20Lauder.pdf|title=Ronald S.

===President of the World Jewish Congress===

Left to right: Cardinal [[Reinhard Marx]], Protestant Church leader [[Nikolaus Schneider]], Ronald S. Lauder, German Federal President [[Joachim Gauck]], Central Council of Jews in Germany President Dieter Graumann, German Federal Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].]]
Lauder was elected president of the [[World Jewish Congress]] on June 10, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lauder elected President of WJCongress |url=https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Lauder-elected-President-of-WJCongress |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the resignation of [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.]]. He beat the South African businessman [[Mendel Kaplan (philanthropist)|Mendel Kaplan]] and [[Einat Wilf]] of Israel by a clear margin. As head of the international Jewish umbrella organization, he has met with a number of heads of state and government, including German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Italian President [[Giorgio Napolitano]], Austrian Chancellor [[Alfred Gusenbauer]], Czech President [[Václav Klaus]], Hungarian Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]], King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]], King [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah of Jordan]], Swiss President [[Pascal Couchepin]], Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]] and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.

President [[George W. Bush]] appointed him to serve on the honorary delegation to accompany him to [[Jerusalem]] for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the [[State of Israel]] in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Eli Lake|Lake, Eli]] | url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/bush-visit-may-boost-olmert/76303/ |title=Bush Visit May Boost Olmert |newspaper= [[The New York Sun]] |date=May 13, 2008 | access-date = June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder condemned the [[Rohingya persecution in Myanmar (2016–present)|persecution of Rohingya Muslims]] in [[Myanmar]]. He said in a statement that "The World Jewish Congress is extremely concerned by the plight of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, who has suffered widespread persecution for years under the ruling military government and has been forced to flee in the hundreds of thousands in the past two weeks alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/world-jewish-congress-condemns-myanmars-persecution-of-rohingya-urges-international-community-to-safeguard-rights-of-all-minorities-9-2-2017|author=World Jewish Congress|website=worldjewishcongress.org|title=World Jewish Congress condemns Myanmar’s persecution of Rohingya, urges international community to safeguard rights of all minorities :: World Jewish Congress |accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish activism===
In July 2009, [[Bernie Ecclestone]] faced calls from Lauder to resign as [[Formula One]] chief after he had praised [[Adolf Hitler]] in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler "got things done". Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that "I think the people who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things." Asked if the [[World Jewish Congress]] was influential, Ecclestone said: "It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out" and "They have a lot of influence everywhere". After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had "been an idiot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nascar/story/11923197|title=F1 boss Ecclestone faces criticism over Hitler comments|publisher= [[CBS Sports]] |date=July 4, 2009|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/sports/jews-call-on-bernie-ecclestone-to-resign-over-hitler-remarks_100214406.html|title=Jews call on Bernie Ecclestone to resign over Hitler remarks|work=ThaiIndian.com|date=July 6, 2009|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/f1/news/story?id=4308574 |title=Ecclestone: Outrage 'probably my fault{{'-}}|agency=Associated Press|date=July 6, 2009|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Lauder protested against the Roman Curia's decree recognizing the heroic virtues of [[Pope Pius XII]], asserting that an eventual [[beatification]] would be inopportune until the Holy See's historical archives from the 1939–1945 period were opened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/World-Jewish-Congress-criticizes-Popes-decision-to-beatify-Pius-XII "World Jewish Congress criticizes Pope's decision to beatify Pius XII"]. ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' (December 21, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, writing in the German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article12470166/Warum-Israel-Mitglied-der-Nato-werden-muss.html "Ronald Lauder, Warum Israel Mitglied der Nato werden muss"]. ''Die Welt'', February 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lauder called for Israel to be admitted into the Western defense alliance [[NATO]]: "Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance," the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how "unpredictable" developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership "would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel", Lauder argued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/world-jewish-congress/44854/call-israel-join-nato "Call for Israel to join NATO"]. ''Jewish Chronicle''. February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ronald Lauder WJC 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Lauder addressing a [[World Jewish Congress]] meeting in Berlin]]
Lauder has also been outspoken on anti-Semitism. In an opinion article entitled "Sweden's Shame", he attacked the Swedish government, church officials and media for "fanning the flames" of hatred against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder, Ronald S. (August 12, 2010). [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sweden-s-shame "Sweden's Shame"]. Project Syndicate.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Lauder condemned as "despicable" remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist [[Johan Galtung]] who had "revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media" and suggested that Israel's Mossad could have been behind the 2011 "massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik" in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: "There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun. It is a scandal that a leading academics such as Galtung does not shy away from citing notorious forgeries such as the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] to support his bigoted arguments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eju.org/news/world/ronald-lauder-condemns-norwegian-scholar-anti-semitic-statements "Ronald Lauder condemns Norwegian scholar anti-Semitic statements"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518075946/http://www.eju.org/news/world/ronald-lauder-condemns-norwegian-scholar-anti-semitic-statements |date=May 18, 2012 }}. ''EJU News''. May 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Lauder criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his [[Facebook]] page. "Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves," Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: "This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, and it could have negative repercussions for Austrian Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Prodhan, Georgina (August 23, 2012) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/23/us-austria-rightists-antisemitism-idUSBRE87M0NL20120823 "Austrian rightist chief accused of anti-Semitism over cartoon"]. [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder has been strongly critical of business deals by European energy firms with Iran and called for stronger UN sanctions because of Tehran's threat against Israel and its nuclear program. In April 2008, he criticized a visit by Swiss Foreign Minister [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] to Tehran where she met with Iran's President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] to help a Swiss company secure a multibillion-dollar contract to buy natural gas from Iran. Lauder told a press conference in Bern: "Maybe that money that Switzerland is paying to Iran will some day be used to either buy weapons to kill Israelis, or buy weapons to kill Americans, or buy missiles to be able to deliver nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-04-29-3972860867_x.htm%20 "World Jewish Congress head wants Swiss to cancel Iran deal"] Associated Press. April 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Lauder also led diplomatic efforts to persuade European businesses to withdraw from Iran. In January 2010, he warmly welcomed the announcement by [[Siemens]] CEO [[Peter Löscher]] that his company would not seek new business in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/01/27/siemens_to_stop_doing_business_in_iran/ "Siemens to stop doing business in Iran"]. [[Associated Press]]. January 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the [[Poland|Polish]] Prime Minister [[Mateusz Morawiecki]] stated that "there were Jewish perpetrators" of the [[Holocaust]], "not only German perpetrators."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/benjamin-netanyahu-mateusz-morawiecki-jews-perpetrators-holocaust-munich-security-conference-a8216421.html Benjamin Netanyahu attacks Polish PM for saying Jews were among perpetrators of the Holocaust]". ''The Independent.'' 18 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Lauder condemned Morawiecki's comment as anti-Semitic, saying: "The Polish prime minister [Morawiecki] has displayed appalling ignorance with his unconscionable claim that so-called 'Jewish perpetrators' were partly responsible for the Nazi German attempt to wipe out European Jewry...this government is going to extreme and unfathomable lengths to exonerate some of their countrymen's own complicity in the murders of their neighbors. This is nothing short of an attempt to falsify history, that is one of the very worst forms of anti-Semitism and Holocaust obfuscation. We demand an immediate retraction and apology from the Polish government of these absurd and offensive remarks.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Polish PM pays respects to Nazi collaborators underground group |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5119435,00.html |work=[[Ynetnews]] |date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April 2018, Ronald Lauder together with international guests took part in official 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in Poland. Lauder made a long speech near the front of the [[Monument to the Ghetto Heroes]] in Warsaw and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are standing here in a modern day [[Masada]]. Here in this former Warsaw Ghetto area the current ground is about 120 cm above prewar ground, above the rubble, bones and bodies of the heroes. This is holy ground. Every one here today should use these brave young Warsaw Ghetto fighters as an inspiration we will face all challenges ahead. We should learn strength and courage. I know I do. We also know that the death camps were designed, maintained and staffed by German SS troops. Jews, Christians and others were murdered there. Throughout Europe and in Poland there were also brave non-Jews &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Righteous Among the Nations]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; who risked their lives and saved Jewish lives and were also people who betrayed Jews and sold their property. There was another chapter of great heroism written in Warsaw, here that we must also remember. Just one year after the small band of Polish Jews rose up against the Germans &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in 1943&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the entire Polish underground fought the German Nazis in one of the most brutal battle of the world &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Non-Jewish but Polish [[Warsaw Uprising]] in 1944&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and we must honor these great fighters as well in 1944. May God bless the memory of the valiant Polish Jews who fought and died here in the Warsaw Ghetto. May God bless the memory of the valiant Polish Catholics who fought and died here. May God bless all the Jewish people worldwide and all the Polish people. We will fight together against any oppressor who want to destroy our world. God bless Poland!&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tvn24.pl/raporty/75-rocznica-powstania-w-getcie-warszawskim,1274 Video available on www.tvn24.pl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Support for Conservative Foreign Policy===
In 2018, [[OpenSecrets]] reported that Lauder had donated $1.1 Million  to [[Secure America Now]]. The organization committed to educating the American public on the dangers posed to America by the development of nuclear weapons by Iran and radical Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanfound.org/|title=Secure America Now|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Israel activism==
Lauder has repeatedly come to the defense of Israel in public and is seen as an ally of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]. In May 2012, he reacted "with dismay" at a suggestion by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister [[Eamon Gilmore]] to impose a European Union-wide import ban on products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Gilmore said were "illegal" and made peace between Israel and the Palestinians "impossible". Lauder said: "Such boycott calls are cynical and hypocritical. Minister Gilmore is taking aim at the only liberal democracy in the Middle East while keeping quiet about those who really wreak havoc in the region: the Assads, Ahmadinejads and their allies Hezbollah and Hamas." He added that "the West Bank territories are legally disputed and not illegally occupied."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11814/world_jewish_congress_dismayed_at_irish_call_for_eu_ban_on_israeli_goods_from_west_bank "World Jewish Congress dismayed at Irish call for EU ban on Israeli goods from West Bank"]. Worldjewishcongress.org. (May 23, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In remarks to the [[International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians]] made on June 28, 2011, Lauder reportedly scolded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a number of missteps, including lacking a diplomatic plan heading into the September UN vote on Palestinian statehood and setting preconditions for negotiations as part of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, according to ''[[Haaretz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/top-jewish-leader-and-close-netanyahu-ally-blasts-pm-for-lack-of-diplomatic-plan-1.370134 |title=Top Jewish leader and close Netanyahu ally blasts PM for lack of diplomatic plan |date=June 29, 2011 |work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2012, on the third anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu#Second Premiership: 2009–2013|Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at Bar-Ilan University]], Lauder published a full-page advertisement in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and other newspapers in which he called on Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] to return to the negotiating table. "Accept the offer to talk, President Abbas. It takes two sides to make peace," Lauder wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4242587,00.html "World Jewish Congress urges Abbas to resume talks"]. ''YNet News''. June 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channel 10==
Lauder has participated in a number of large media deals in Israel, among which was his purchase of part of commercial television [[Channel 10 (Israel)|Channel 10]].

In September 2011, Israeli media published accounts that Lauder had put heavy pressure on the executives of the channel to broadcast a personal apology to the businessman [[Sheldon Adelson]] with regards to a profile that the channel had broadcast in January 2011. The apology read, "After the broadcast of the piece, we checked the accusations. Our checks revealed that the accusations were – and are – completely false... We are very regretful that we did not check these accusations before broadcasting them." Lauder's forcing of the form of the apology led to the resignation of the channel's news chief Reudor Benziman, its news editor Ruti Yuval, and its presenter Guy Zohar (who continues in another post in Channel 10), who criticized Lauder for the pressure he exerted.&lt;ref&gt;Averbach, Lior; Barak, Roi (September 9, 2008). [http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000680845 "Benziman's Resignation: What really happened behind the scenes at Channel 10 News?"] (in Hebrew). ''[[Globes]]''. Retrieved June 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker, Shelly (September 9, 2008). [http://www.calcalist.co.il/marketing/articles/0,7340,L-3530853,00.html "The Shocks Continue at Channel 10: Ruti Yuval, editor of the Friday edition 'The Week', has resigned"] (in Hebrew). ''[[Calcalist]]''. Retrieved June 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the attacks, detailed above, on Lauder (who had been until then the last major funder of the channel), he decided to reconsider his financial support. If the channel lost his funding, it would have difficulty continuing to operate to its current standard past October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak, Yoav (September 17, 2011). [http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/001-D-277694-00.html "Channel 10 has no funds for October"] (in Hebrew). [[News First Class]].  Retrieved June 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2011, [[The Second Authority for Television and Radio]] reached a decision on the issue in which it decided that the apology to Adelson broadcast by the channel was appropriate and that "no evidence has been presented that there was any intervention by the shareholders of Channel 10 on new content, or even on the text of the apology, which was agreed between the news company and the person injured by the broadcast".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Israel Hayom]]'' (''Israel Today''). November 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations by Austrian Jewish community leader==
The [[Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien]] (Vienna Israelite Community) banned Lauder for allegedly interfering in its board elections.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (December 7, 2012). [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4316799,00.html "Austrian Jewish group bans Ron Lauder"]. [[Reuters]] (via [[Ynetnews]]). Retrieved June 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; IKG President Oskar Deutsch alleged that Lauder had offered incentives to members of the IKG to support another candidate. A Lauder spokesman denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;Liphshiz, Cnaan (December 4, 2012).

==Residences==
A 2007 profile of Lauder in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine detailed his residences, including three properties in Manhattan – a townhouse on East [[70th Street (Manhattan)|70th Street]], a townhouse ([[List of works by Philip Johnson|designed by Philip Johnson]]) on East [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]], as well as an apartment at [[740 Park Avenue]].  The profile additionally listed homes in Florida, London, Paris, and [[Wainscott, New York|Wainscott]], [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Mead, Rebecca (January 15, 2007).  [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/01/15/an-acquiring-eye "An Acquiring Eye – Ronald Lauder's Career in Collecting Art"]. ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  Retrieved June 23, 2016.  "One afternoon, Lauder took me to a town house, on Seventieth Street between Park and Madison Avenues, that his mother bought in the sixties, and in which she lived until her death, in 2004, at ninety-seven. Estée Lauder left an empire worth ten billion dollars, and part of Ronald's inheritance was this house, which he has added to a collection that includes residences in Florida, Paris, and London; an apartment at 740 Park Avenue; and a town house on East Fifty-second Street that was designed by Philip Johnson in 1950 as a guesthouse for Blanchette Rockefeller, who was later the president of MOMA, and which Lauder bought at auction in 2000 for eleven million dollars. There is also a country house in Wainscott, Long Island, on the grounds of which sits an eighteenth-century church that Lauder bought in Massachusetts and had moved to a more convenient spot."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6535">'''Samuel David Leidesdorf''', (1881-1968) internationally known [[accountant]], recently inducted into the [[CPA Hall of Fame]].

Leidesdorf, was born on September 25, 1881 in [[New York City]]. He attended the [[New York School of Accounting]] and [[Pace College]]. In 1905, he began his own accounting firm, [[S.D. Leidesdorf &amp; Co.]], [[certified public accountant]]s, which grew and eventually became one of the largest accounting firms in the nation. The 1915 New York City Directory shows him living at 302 West 79th and with the S.D. Leidesdorf Co office at 417 5th Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.ancestry.com/Browse/view.aspx?dbid=8773&amp;path=New+York+City.1915.L.33 1915 New York City Directory], online at www.ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;  His World War I Draft Registration Card shows he had moved to 309 W 86th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.ancestry.com/Browse/view.aspx?dbid=6482&amp;path=New+York.Manhattan+City.126.L.94&amp;fn=Samuel%20David&amp;ln=Leidesdorf&amp;st=r&amp;pid=17519580&amp;rc=&amp;zp=100 WW1 Draft Registration Card], online at www.ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, he helped arrange the sale of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark-based]] [[Bamberger's]] department store, to the [[Macy's|R.H. Macy]] Co.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/Summaries/V35I5P41-1.htm ''Commentary'' magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050421162649/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/Summaries/V35I5P41-1.htm |date=2005-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fortune Magazine]] recognized his company as a “Pioneering Firm” in 1932.

In 1931 he was on the executive committee of the [[American Jewish Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scplweb.santacruzpl.org:2281/hqoweb/library/do/books/results/image?urn=urn:proquest:US;glhbooks;Genealogy-glh47067257;-1;-1;&amp;polarity=&amp;scale=&amp;hitthreadid=347 ''The American Jewish yearbook''], Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia. 1931. 532 pages&lt;/ref&gt;  He served on the [[State Council of Accountancy]], from 1934 to 1942.  When [[Einstein]] arrived in the US, Leidesdorf was his accountant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossingwallstreet.com/archives/2005/12/albert_einstein.html Crossingwallstreet.com Archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901111123/http://www.crossingwallstreet.com/archives/2005/12/albert_einstein.html |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He soon began dedicating himself to what would become a lifetime of philanthropic endeavors for medical and educational institutions, and many other charitable causes, including the [[Red Cross]], the [[United Jewish Communities|United Jewish Appeal]], the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] and the [[United Negro College Fund]]. "In a letter written to Mr. S. D. Leidesdorf of New York, [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.|Rockefeller]] solicited Leidesdorf to serve as a member of the Foundation Committee of the UNCF, working with W. D. Embree, the Chairman."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scplweb.santacruzpl.org:2299/itx/retrieve.do?subjectParam=Locale%2528en%252C%252C%2529%253AFQE%253D%2528su%252CNone%252C10%2529Leidesdorf%2524&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;sort=DateDescend&amp;tabID=T002&amp;sgCurrentPosition=0&amp;subjectAction=DISPLAY_SUBJECTS&amp;prodId=ITOF&amp;searchId=R1&amp;currentPosition=4&amp;userGroupName=scruzpl&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;sgHitCountType=None&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28TX%2CNone%2C10%29Leidesdorf%24&amp;inPS=true&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;displaySubject=&amp;docId=A98253620&amp;docType=IAC ''The early years of the United Negro College Fund, 1943-1960''. Shuana K. Tucker. The Journal of African American History (Fall 2002): p416(17).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Leidesdorf was active in civic and community service and received numerous honors and awards, including an honorary degree as doctor of humane letters from [[Hebrew Union College]], the Medal of the [[National Fund for Medical Education]], the [[Herbert H. Lehman Human Relations Award]] of the [[American Jewish Committee]] and the [[Medal for Distinguished Service]] from the [[Protestant Council]] of the City of New York.  In 1958, Mr. Leidesdorf received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York." He was a founding Trustee for the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].

In 1948, Mr. Leidesdorf began his tenure on the board of the New York University Medical Center serving as the first Chair of the Building Committee. Later he served as the Chair of the board from 1956 until his death on September 21, 1968.

He was chairman of the board of [[New York University School of Medicine|NYU Medical Center]] from 1956 to 1968.  At the time of his death in 1968, the firm he founded was in the top 10 of accounting firms in the United States.  The company he started merged to become [[Ernst &amp; Whinney]] in 1979 and [[Ernst and Young]] in 1989.

With his wife Elsa Grunwald, he had two children Helen and Arthur (1918–91).  Arthur D. like his father, was a philanthropist.  Arthur also married Tova, a prior beauty-contest winner and International Socialite, who continues his philanthropic work.  Tova was honored in 2003 as "Woman of the Year" by the [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]].

'''Samuel "Sami" David Alexander''' (13 July 1862 – 8 March 1943) was a [[Croatian people|Croatian]] [[Jew]]ish industrialist, doyen of Croatian industrialists, a philanthropist and a member of the [[Zagreb]] prominent [[Alexander family]].&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="žuz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ivo Goldstein|2005|pp=174, 268, 269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obitelj"&gt;{{harvtxt|Jasminka Domaš Nalbantić|1996|pp=38, 39, 40, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and family==
Alexander, known as ''Der Gescheite'' (The Smart One), was born in Zagreb to a Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ognjen Kraus|1998|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Jonas Alexander, was a merchant who came to Zagreb from [[Güssing]], [[Austria]] and his mother Roza ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Stern) was from an old influential Jewish family from Zagreb. Alexander's father was councillor at the "Croatian commercial artisan chamber".&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gavro Schwarz|1939|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander had a younger brother, [[Šandor Alexander|Šandor]], and two sisters, Gizela and Ilka. He attended elementary and high school in Zagreb, and a business academy in [[Vienna]]. Around 1860 his father opened a grain store in Zagreb. After his education, Alexander returned to Zagreb and started to work with his father. In 1880 he moved to Sisak where he opened another grain store for his family business. There he was introduced to his future wife, Emma ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Neumann), the daughter of [[Varaždin]] businessman Wolf Neumann. With his wife Alexander had three daughters, Vera (died as a child), Gizela and Mira, and four sons, Ivo, Božidar, Branko and Dragutin. All his children were born in Sisak.&lt;ref name="gs"/&gt; Alexander was active member of the Israelites of Zagreb community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Imenik|1911|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1885 he was the president of the choral society "Danica". In 1915 he moved back to Zagreb with his family.&lt;ref name="gs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obitelj"/&gt; Alexander was member of the society "Narodni rad - društvo židovskih asimilanata i anticionista u Hrvatskoj" (''Peoples work - Society of Jewish assimilates and anti Zionists in Croatia'').&lt;ref name="žuz"/&gt;

==Later life==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5874">'''Sergei Vladimirovich Kolesnikov''' ({{lang-ru|Сергей Владимирович Колесников}}; born 1948, Leningrad) is a Russian businessman and former associate of [[Vladimir Putin]] currently believed to be living in exile in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].  He is best known as a whistleblower after his December 2010 letter to [[Dmitry Medvedev]], which exposed the corrupt scheme that included the construction of '[[Putin's Palace]]' and challenged the Russian president to fight corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corruptionfreerussia.com/ Corruption Free Russia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Articles of his in the Russian press have continued this theme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/260677/prizrak_dvorca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/261532/bolshoj_medicinskij_raspil&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Kolesnikov graduated from the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute in 1972, where he studied biophysics. He holds a doctorate from the Sergei Kirov Military Medical Academy, and spent 20 years as a scientist specialising in the applications of biophysics in medicine.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.snob.ru/selected/entry/37367 Сергей Колесников: Почему я рассказал про Дворец Путина. «Мы перешли границу между добром и злом в 2009 году» – Интервью – Тематические материалы – Сноб&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 he and scientific colleagues combined with the St Petersburg health authorities to found a state enterprise to manufacture medical equipment which they had been developing. In 1992, when it became legal, they set up a joint stock company called Petromed.  Vladmir Putin, then head of the St Petersburg Committee on External Economic Affairs, was one of the founders.  Petromed expanded through the 1990s from the manufacture of equipment to procurement, and from procurement to major health infrastructure projects.  The election of [[Vladimir Yakovlev]] as Mayor St Petersburg was a setback for Petromed as the company did not enjoy as good relations with him as they had with [[Anatoly Sobchak]]. The publicly owned stake in the company was sold so that Kolesnikov and another of the co-founders, Dmitri Gorelov, each held a 50% stake.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Putin's palace==

Kolesnikov's involvement in this is described in his letter to Medvedev and has been covered by the media, notably by [[David Ignatius]] in the Washington Post, who concluded from his investigations that 'Kolesnikov is one of those brave souls a journalist meets occasionally, who decides to expose what he sees as wrongdoing, regardless of the personal risks.' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/22/AR2010122203770.html David Ignatius - Sergey Kolesnikov's tale of palatial corruption, Russian style&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Kolesnikov was approached by Nikolai Shamalov, a contact from Petromed's early days, on behalf of Putin.  Putin proposed the following scheme: Petromed would be commissioned to undertake a number of health infrastructure projects, funded by oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich.  A proportion of the donations would be siphoned into an offshore investment fund, in which Putin would have by far the largest stake.

This scheme went ahead, as well as 'Project South', aka Putin's Palace, which Shamalov supervised.  Kolesnikov claims that he became disillusioned when, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, he was instructed that all funds were to be directed to Putin's Palace and investment projects on which people's livelihoods depended were to be shut down. In September 2010 he left Russia having decided  to become a whistleblower.  After consulting lawyers and meeting with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius he published his letter to Medvedev, which met with official denials.  The plausibility of these denials has been undermined by investigations by Novaya Gazeta, which revealed a paper trail going back to the Kremlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2011/016/00.html Novayagazeta | February 14, 2011 №16 | 740 square metre palace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907110633/http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2011/016/00.html |date=September 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked by [[Masha Gessen]] why he had become a whistleblower he replied, 'On the one hand, it's a complicated question, on the other hand, it's simple. If you are a Russian, if Russia is your homeland, and if you have something you can do for her, then the act is perfectly natural. Sometimes I wondered whether I would be able, for example, to 'go over the top' as my father did. Well, I came to the conclusion that maybe I could.'  On Russia today he is pessimistic, 'My analysis led to the conclusion that the country has no real positive development. The country is heading for collapse.  Moreover, for a really serious collapse, possibly revolution. And considering that today Russia is a  nuclear power, and that revolution in a country where there is a huge number of nuclear weapons is an incredibly dangerous thing for the existence of  the whole world, I came to the conclusion that something had to be done. These were the main motives for my decision to write the letter. Well, in the end, let's say, I have lived most of my life, I've got children and grandchildren, and not just me, everyone.' &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8692">{{nihongo|'''''Sōkaiya'''''|総会屋|sōkaiya}} (sometimes also translated as ''corporate bouncers'', ''meeting-men'', or ''corporate blackmailers'') are specialized [[racketeer]]s unique to [[Japan]], and often associated with the [[yakuza]], who [[Extortion|extort]] money from or [[blackmail]] companies by threatening to publicly [[Humiliation|humiliate]] companies and their management, usually in their {{nihongo|annual meeting|総会|sōkai}}.

Conversely, if they ''are'' paid, they will work to prevent others from embarrassing the company, either through intimidation or by disrupting the meeting so they cannot be heard.

==History==
Sōkaiya originate from the late 19th century. At this time, the unlimited liability of the management put the managers' personal fortune at risk in case of rumors and scandals. Hence the management hired protection, called sōkaiya, to reduce the risk of such rumors. Even after the Japanese laws included a limited liability, hence reducing the personal risk to the managers, these sōkaiya continued to prosper, and were often used to quiet down otherwise difficult meetings. In that respect, they have even been compared to [[corporate lawyer]]s in America.&lt;ref name = "Sokaya book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Szymkowiak |first=Kenneth |title=Sokaiya: Extortion, Protection, and the Japanese Corporation |year=2002 |publisher=East Gate Book |isbn=978-0-7656-0780-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the law made first steps to reduce the threat from sōkaiya by establishing a minimum number of holdings (¥50,000) in order to be allowed into the shareholder meeting, leading to a slow decline of the number of sōkaiya. In response to this, the sōkaiya formed fake [[uyoku dantai]], announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies.&lt;ref name = "Sokaya book"/&gt;

In 1994, [[Juntarō Suzuki]], vice president of [[Fujifilm]], was murdered by sōkaiya after he stopped paying these bribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/Maruko.html Sōkaiya and Japanese Corporations], Eiko Maruko, Electronic Journal of Contemporary Japanese Studies, 25 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Disrupting shareholder meetings===
Individuals acquire enough stock from multiple companies in order to gain entrance to a [[shareholders' meeting]]. There, they disrupt the meeting (and embarrass the company) until their demands are met. For this, the sōkaiya often research the company in detail beforehand to uncover incidents of misconduct or other company secrets, and then blackmail the management so that these issues are not raised in the shareholder meeting or elsewhere. Often, they also invent fictional issues that the company would have a difficult time disproving.

Modern sōkaiya have developed other, similar methods to accomplish their goals. One less subtle example is the ''banzai sōkaiya'', who disrupt business places with their cries of "[[Ten thousand years|Banzai]]!" and praise of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] until they are quietly paid to leave.

===Other disruption===
Sōkaiya also form fake groups, announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies.&lt;ref name = "Sokaya book"/&gt; They may also print special newspapers with topics embarrassing to companies, and then ask the company to buy the entire print at inflated prices, or even to subscribe to these newspapers, generating a steady flow of cash.

===Preventing disruption of shareholder meetings===
Sōkaiya have also been used by companies to drown out questions from legitimate shareholders which company officials do not want presented. One infamous case is related to [[Minamata disease]] (mercury poisoning), where the [[Chisso]] chemicals company managed to close a number of annual meetings within minutes even though hundreds of protesters wanted to voice their anger. They have also been active against anti-war protesters and other people who may be viewed as a nuisance by the company at a particular time.

==Countermeasures==
Article 968 of the Japanese corporations code prohibits sōkaiya activity, imposing imprisonment of no more than five years or a fine of no more than ¥5 million for "receiving, demanding or promising a proprietary benefit with regard to" statements or the exercise of voting rights at a shareholder or creditor meeting.

A practical countermeasure used by large corporations is to hold all shareholder meetings on the same day, so sōkaiya cannot disrupt all of them.&lt;ref name = "SameDay meeting"&gt;

==Background==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

While in the west a shareholders' meeting is usually an earnest discussion between the shareholders and the management, in Japan it is often more of a ceremony, and the management does not feel the need to truly inform shareholders.&lt;ref name = "ceremony only"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this atmosphere, the sōkaiya are able to prosper. However, with the trend for more [[deregulation]] in the Japanese market the business environment for sōkaiya is getting more and more difficult.

==Companies that have bribed sōkaiya==
Major companies that have been found guilty of employing sōkaiya include but are not limited to:

[[File:Tomás Terry.jpg|thumbnail|Marble statue of Tomás Terry in the lobby of the Terry theatre, [[Cienfuegos]], [[Cuba]]; sculptor [[Tommaso Solari]]]]

'''Tomás Terry y Adán''' (24 February 1808 in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] – 5 July 1886 in [[Paris]], [[France]])&lt;ref name="thomas140"&gt;Thomas, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Cuba]]n [[business magnate]].

==Family origins==
Of [[Irish people|Irish]] paternal descent, Terry was born in Caracas to [[Spain|Spanish]]-born José Antonio Terry y Mendoza, who had settled in Venezuela from [[Cádiz]], and wife Tomasa Adán y España. Following the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], the Terrys had fled their hometown of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] for [[Catholic]] countries such as Spain, [[France]] and the states of the [[Italian peninsula]]. The Spanish branch, established in Cádiz and [[El Puerto de Santa María]], became involved in trade with the [[Spanish West Indies|Indies]] and [[Sherry]] production quite successfully, as in less than a decade from their arrival many of its members were knighted in the [[Order of Santiago]] and Guillermo Terry was granted the title of Marquis of la Cañada by King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], on 8 September 1729.

==Life==
[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 92 - Terry y Dorticos 08.jpg|thumb|[[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]].]]
Terry initially became involved in the [[slave trade]] in Cuba, making his first $10,000 by buying sick slaves, nursing them back to health, and then reselling them healthy for a large profit.&lt;ref name="thomas137"&gt;Thomas, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He bought the ''Caracas'' [[sugar mill]] for $23,000, and upgraded it to be the first in Cuba to use [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="thomas137" /&gt; He went on to make a fortune through involvement in all aspects of the economy, from the sugar trade and slave trade to banking and imports, becoming the dominant businessman in [[Cienfuegos]] and earning the nickname the "Cuban [[Croesus]]".&lt;ref name="thomas140" /&gt; His fortune grew to be among the largest in the world, with a net worth of about $725,000 in 1851, $3,090,00 in 1860, $7,890,000 in 1870, $13,760,000 in 1880, and over $25,000,000 at his death in 1886, which occurred in Paris, where he was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] (division 92).&lt;ref name="thomas140" /&gt;

==Descendants==
[[File:"La marquesa de Perinat" (Raimundo Madrazo).JPG|thumbnail|Portrait of María del Carmen Terry, 1st Marchioness of Perinat by [[Raimundo Madrazo]]. [[Madrid]], [[Museo del Prado]].]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">'''''Toy Biz v. United States''''' was a 2003 decision in the [[United States Court of International Trade]] that determined that for purposes of [[tariffs]], [[Toy Biz]]'s [[action figures]] were [[toy|toys]], not [[doll|dolls]], because they represented "nonhuman creatures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Toy Biz v. United States |court=United States Court of International Trade |date=January 3, 2003 |url=http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/slip-op%2003-2.pdf |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision effectively halved the tariff rate, from 12 percent tax to 6.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Iglesias |first=Matthew |title=How Trade Policy Cost The X-Men Their Humanity |url=https://slate.com/business/2011/12/are-mutants-human.html |access-date=November 22, 2018 |work=Slate.com |date=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the United States|Harmonized Tariff Schedule]] in [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]] distinguished between two types of action figures for determining tariffs: dolls, which are defined to include human figures, and toys, which include "nonhuman creatures". Because duties on dolls were higher than those on toys, [[Marvel Comics]] [[subsidiary]] Toy Biz argued before the [[U.S. Court of International Trade]], that their action figures (including the [[X-Men]] and [[Fantastic Four]]) represented "nonhuman creatures" and were subject to the lower tariff rates for toys instead of the higher ones for dolls. On January 3, 2003, after examining more than 60 action figures, Judge [[Judith Barzilay]] ruled in their favor, granting Toy Biz reimbursement for import taxes on previous toys.

==Reaction==
Because a common theme in Marvel Comics had been the struggle for [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] like the X-Men to prove their humanity, the case shocked numerous fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Time for Mutants |work=USC Annenberg Online Journalism Review |date=January 22, 2003 |url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/spike/1043234172.php |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel responded to these concerns by claiming "our heroes are living, breathing human beings{{spaced en dash}}but humans who have extraordinary abilities ... A decision that the X-Men figures indeed do have 'nonhuman' characteristics further proves our characters have special, out-of-this world powers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=Neal |title=Fans Howl in Protest as Judge Decides X-Men Aren't Human |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 20, 2003 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1043013622300562504 |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the United States|Harmonized Tariff Schedule]] was amended to eliminate the distinction between dolls and other toys, which are now in the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Daily |first=James |title=Are the X-Men Human?

Prince Turki was born in 1934.&lt;ref name=shenderson94&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Simon|title=After King Fahd|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PP_37_AFTERKINGFAHD.pdf|publisher=Washington Institute|accessdate=2 February 2013|format=Policy Paper|year=1994 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Saudi King's brother Prince Turki bin Abdulaziz passes away |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/11/12/Saudi-King-s-brother-Prince-Turki-bin-Abdulaziz-passes-away.html  |newspaper=Al Alarabiya English |date=12 November 2016 |access-date=13 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Sudairi Seven]], a powerful faction of brothers within the Al Saud. His parents were [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Ibn Saud]] and [[Hussa Ahmad Al-Sudayri|Hassa Al Sudairi]].&lt;ref name=Chai2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Winberg Chai|title=Saudi Arabia: A Modern Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lh4bENPP_HEC&amp;pg=PA193|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=22 September 2005|publisher=University Press|isbn=978-0-88093-859-4|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known as Turki "the second" (الثاني ''ath-thānī'') because he was the second son born to Ibn Saud named "Turki". The [[Turki of Najd|first Prince Turki]] was Abdulaziz's first son who died in 1919 due to [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]].&lt;ref name=shenderson94/&gt;

Prince Turki studied at the [[Princes' School]] established by his father.&lt;ref name=moi&gt;{{cite web|title=His royal highness prince Turki bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|url=http://www.riyadh.gov.sa/en/Pages/Princes/Princes.aspx?ItemId=6|publisher=Ministry of Interior|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Turki bin Abdulaziz assumed the Riyadh principality delegation  on 10 October 1957, because [[Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Salman]], (later to become King Salman) then-Riyadh governor, travelled with [[King Saud]] to [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=moi/&gt; In 1960, the approval of the King was issued to assign Prince Turki as the governor of the [[Riyadh Province]] in the period of the formal vacation of Prince Salman. Turki bin Abdulaziz was appointed the deputy defense minister in July 1969 by a royal order.&lt;ref name=succ&gt;{{cite book|last=Kechichian|first=Joseph A.|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=79Fs5bLPgBYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=al+saud+family+and+kings+of+saudi+arabia&amp;ots=YFmkl8GmQZ&amp;sig=45qdVk8oekLEYh6Ep0e-wTguhqk&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20saud%20family%20and%20kings%20of%20saudi%20arabia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure lasted for nine years and he was forced to resign from office due to his marriage in 1978.&lt;ref name=news22apr&gt;{{cite news|title=Princes are glue of nation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WYRJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1wsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4565,2194228&amp;dq=salman+bin+abdulaziz&amp;hl=en|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=The News and Courier|date=22 April 1990|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wynbrandt2010&gt;{{cite book|author=James Wynbrandt|title="A" Brief History of Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZkIXdsZpPsC&amp;pg=PA182|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-7876-9|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
After his  falling-out with other princes and joining with the [[Free Princes Movement|free princes]] group, Turki bin Abdulaziz moved to [[Cairo]] and  lived there in self-imposed exile for a time.&lt;ref name="succession"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudis 'kidnap reformist prince'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3416877.stm|publisher=BBC News|last=Hardy|first=Roger|date=21 January 2004|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research on the [[Free Princes Movement]] does not mention his name as part of this group;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soubra Barrage|first=Rada|title=The domestic challenges facing Saudi Arabia|url=https://ecommons.lau.edu.lb:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10725/982/Rada_Soubra_Barrage_Thesis.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=ecommons|accessdate=8 May 2012|year=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005032859/https://ecommons.lau.edu.lb:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10725/982/Rada_Soubra_Barrage_Thesis.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so an alternate explanation of his self-exile in [[Cairo]] offers that it occurred as a result of an intra-family dispute due to his marriage to Hind Al Fassi (See also below and ''Personal life'' section).

In February 1982, Turki bin Abdulaziz and his family, while living in [[Miami]], were accused of holding an Egyptian servant against her will. Officers from the [[Miami-Dade Police Department|Metro Dade Police Department]] (MDPD) searched his apartment with a warrant but failed to find the woman. However, the police encountered fierce resistance from Prince Turki's bodyguards. He eventually sued the MDPD for $210 million, wherein the defendant then launched a countersuit. The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] granted him [[diplomatic immunity]] in April 1982 and the lawsuit was dropped in June 1982.&lt;ref name="servant"&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi prince's life in the U.S. leads to suits and countersuits|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZJJVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-j8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1160,1599692&amp;dq=prince+turki&amp;hl=en |work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Leader-Post]]|last=Hackley|first=Randall|date=9 September 1982|accessdate=12 May 2011|page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter published by Wagze news agency in July 2010, Prince Turki is reported to have warned Saudi Arabia's ruling family of a fate similar to that of Iraq's executed dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] and the ousted Iranian [[Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], calling on them to escape before people "cut off our heads in streets." He argued that the Saudi royal family was no longer able to "impose" itself on people, arguing that deviations in carrying out the religious concepts that make up the basis of the Saudi government "have gotten out of our hands," so that the opposition views our acts as "interfering in people's private life and restricting their liberties."
He further urged "Do it today before tomorrow as long as the money we have is enough for us to live anywhere in the world; from Switzerland to Canada and Australia…we should not return as long as we are able to get out safely, we must take our families quickly and pull out.", continuing "Do not fool yourself by relying on the United States or Britain or Israel, because they will not survive the loss; the only door open is now the exit door of no return. Let us go before it closes." He finally warned against a military coup against the ruling family, saying "no one will attack us from outside but our armed forces will attack us."&lt;ref name=presstv&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince warns S. Arabia of apocalypse|url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/129692.html|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=Press TV|date=9 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516110742/http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/129692.html|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later Turki bin Abdulaziz told [[Saudi Press Agency]] that the alleged letter to him circulated by some media and internet sites was nonexistent and fabricated by enemy parties wishing to spread confusion and excitement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denial of Prince Turki bin Abdul Aziz|url=http://www.spa.gov.sa/english/readsinglenews.php?id=792468&amp;content_id=&amp;scroll=1|publisher=Saudi Press Agency|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120530/http://www.spa.gov.sa/english/readsinglenews.php?id=792468&amp;content_id=&amp;scroll=1|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy he experienced was about the death of his wife Hind al Fassi in August 2010. Her brother Allal al Fassi accused his brother-in-law, Prince Turki as well as his nephew and niece of killing his sister with a drug overdose. He submitted a report to the Attorney General and then, disappeared for 24 hours and reappeared after the medical report proved that there was nothing wrong in her system, leading to the withdrawal of all his accusations to his brother in law.&lt;ref name=xfiles&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic X-Files:RIP Hend El-Fassi|url=http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2010/09/arabic-x-files-rip-hend-el-fassi.html|publisher=Egyptian Chronicles|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Prince Turki's son, Abdul Rahman, sued his uncle Allal al Fassi claiming that he beat him and his father in the hospital where his mother died.&lt;ref name=siasat2010&gt;{{cite news|title=Dispute over Saudi princess mysterious death|url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/dispute-over-saudi-princess-mysterious-death|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=The Siasat Daily|date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, as a total result, although in 2012 he was left as Hussa's eldest son, he was of course bypassed for the throne.

==Views==
During the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990, Prince Turki argued in a press conference that [[The United Nations|the United Nations']] embargo was not enough to drive the Iraqi army out of [[Kuwait]]. For him, military action was required to achieve it.&lt;ref name=tpcourier&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Prince calls for swift action against Iraq's Saddam|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=egtTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=woEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5247,3597596&amp;dq=prince+turki+bin+abdulaziz&amp;hl=en|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=The Prescott Courier|date=19 August 1990|agency=AP|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Saudi Arabia in 2011, Prince Turki fully supported the appointments of his younger{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} brothers, late [[Prince Nayef]] and Prince Salman. He argued in October 2011 that the decision to appoint late Prince Nayef as Crown Prince was totally right and that Prince Nayef had wisdom, sound management and long history in serving the country.&lt;ref name=zawya3012&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudis swear allegiance to Crown Prince|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517151911/http://www.zawya.com/story/ZAWYA20111030043232/|accessdate=2018|newspaper=Zawya|date=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Turki bin Abdulaziz's first wife whom he divorced to marry Hind Al Fassi was Noura bint Abdallah bin Abdul Rahman.&lt;ref name=kap2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Death on the Nile: A royal murder mystery?|url=http://www.datarabia.com/royals/viewCommentary.do?id=16736|publisher=Datarabia|accessdate=26 May 2012|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharaf2001&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabri Sharaf|title=The House of Saud in Commerce: A Study of Royal Entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51Bb8Ix7xw8C&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=2 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=Sharaf Sabri|isbn=978-81-901254-0-6|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His second wife was Hind Al Fassi, a member of the Saudi Arabian [[al-Fassi family]] and daughter of Sheikh Shams ed-din Al Fassi, a [[Sufism|Sufi]] religious leader from the [[Shadhili]] order, and great-grandson of Moroccan Sufi [[Imam Fassi|Imam al-Fassi]], a Hasani Idrissi descendant of Prophet Mohammed, who had settled in [[Mecca]] in the late 18th-century.&lt;ref name="servant"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kap2010/&gt; Turki bin Abdulaziz sacrificed his position as deputy defense minister and moved from the Kingdom into a self exile because he refused to divorce her in late 1970s. Therefore, he lost not only his position but also his candidacy for the Saudi Throne. Later, he and his wife went to [[Egypt]] in the late 1970s and never returned to [[Saudi Arabia]] together again. She died in 2010 in [[Cairo]] at the age of 57.&lt;ref name="succession"&gt;{{cite news|title=After King Abdullah: Succession in Saudi Arabia|last=Henderson|first=Simon|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/pubPDFs/PolicyFocus96.pdf|work=Policy Focus #96|publisher=[[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]|date=August 2009|accessdate=12 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kap2010/&gt; After her death, Prince Turki returned to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=fb2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Bremmer|first=Ian|title=The next generation of Saudi royals is being groomed|url=http://eurasia.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/02/the_next_generation_of_saudi_royals_is_being_groomed|newspaper=Foreign Policy|accessdate=26 March 2012|date=2 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521174722/http://eurasia.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/02/the_next_generation_of_saudi_royals_is_being_groomed|archivedate=21 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Turki had four sons from his first marriage, Prince Khalid (born December 1957), [[Sultan bin Turki II bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Sultan]] (born May 1968), Prince Faisal (born January 1965) and Prince Fahd (born August 1959).&lt;ref name=shenderson94/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharaf2001/&gt; In 1975, Prince Turki's elder sons took $1.1 million loan from the [[U.S. Export-Import Bank]] (Eximbank) to finance their business in relation to rice mills in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=victoria&gt;{{cite news|last=Treen|first=Joseph|title=Saudi Princes get US loan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I_lYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VkYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7034,2802256&amp;dq=prince+turki+king+khalid&amp;hl=en|accessdate=7 August 2012|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|date=16 August 1975|agency=Washington Post News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Prince Turki's daughters is married to [[Khalid bin Sultan]]. His son, Sultan bin Turki II bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, was "kidnapped" in [[Geneva]] and placed under house arrest in [[Riyadh]] in 2004 after he spoke out in favour of reform in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Another son, Faisal bin Turki, is an adviser at the ministry of petroleum and natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Al Saud dynasty|url=http://www.islamdaily.org/en/saudi-arabia/4565.the-al-saud-dynasty.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102082949/http://www.islamdaily.org/en/saudi-arabia/4565.the-al-saud-dynasty.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 November 2013|accessdate=18 April 2012|newspaper=Islam Daily|date=6 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabian Government Ministries|url=http://www.the-saudi.net/business-center/key-contacts-sag.htm|publisher=The Saudi Network|accessdate=4 May  2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VLJs are considered the lightest [[business jet]]s and are approved for single-pilot operation.

==History==
There were early attempts to create small jet aircraft in this class in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the [[CMC Leopard]].

After a flurry of interest in the [[Small Aircraft Transportation System|Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS)]] and [[air taxi]] markets in the early 2000s, the VLJ sector underwent significant expansion. Several new designs were produced, such as the [[Embraer Phenom 100]], the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]], and the [[Eclipse 500]]. However, following the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]] the air taxi market underperformed expectations, and both [[Eclipse Aviation]] and air taxi firm [[DayJet]] collapsed. In December 2010, AvWeb's Paul Bertorelli explained that the term ''very light jet'' has lost favor in the aviation industry. "Personal jet is the description du jour. You don't hear the term VLJ—very light jet—much anymore and some people in the industry tell me they think it's because that term was too tightly coupled to Eclipse, a failure that the remaining players want to, understandably, distance themselves from."&lt;ref name="AvWeb10Dec10" /&gt;

Single-engine designs were popular in the mid-2000s, before the [[global financial crisis]] diminished the market appeal of the category. Most of those programs, which included the [[Piper Altaire]], [[Diamond D-Jet]], [[Eclipse 400]] and [[VisionAire Vantage]], were all shelved and the only maintained aircraft are the [[Cirrus Vision SF50]], which is now [[type certification|type certified]] and in production, and the [[Stratos 714]], which expects certification in 2019. They are expected to compete with single [[turboprop]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-getting-personal-with-single-engined-jets-427139/ |title= Getting personal with single-engined jets |work= Flight Global |date= 21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two VLJs in history have won the [[Collier Trophy]], known as the most prestigious aerospace engineering award in the United States — the Eclipse 500 (in 2006) and the Cirrus Vision Jet (in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://naa.aero/awards/awards-and-trophies/collier-trophy |title= Collier Trophy |work= National Aeronautic Association |accessdate= 11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target market==
VLJs are intended to have lower operating costs than conventional jets, and to be able to operate from runways as short as {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, either for personal use or in point-to-point [[air taxi]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] | work=Aerospace America | url=http://www.aiaa.org/aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_May06_CRO.pdf | first=John | last=Croft | title=Very Light Jets: Boom or Blip | date=May 2006 | accessdate=2007-02-27|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Aboulafia | url=http://www.richardaboulafia.com/shownote.asp?id=211 | title=March 2006 Newsletter | date=2006-03-13 | accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the [[Small Aircraft Transportation System]] is aimed at providing air service to areas ignored by [[airline]]s.

[[Florida]]-based air taxi provider [[DayJet]], which on October 3, 2007 began its Eclipse 500 service, planned to operate more than 1,000 of the VLJs within five years,&lt;ref name=hgj20071102/&gt; and had stated in mid-2007 that it planned to operate 300 Eclipse 500s serving 40 regional airports in the [[Southeastern United States]] by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name=pm200706/&gt;  DayJet ceased operations on September 19, 2008.&lt;ref name=hgj20071102&gt;{{cite news | title=Very Light Jets Enter Fractional Market | publisher=[[Halogen Guides Jets]] | date=2007-11-02 | accessdate=2007-11-13 | url=http://jets.halogenguides.com/articles/885-very-light-jets-enter-fractional-markets }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When these smaller jets were first mooted, there was much interest in the fact that they would not have a [[Toilet#Lavatory|lavatory]] on board, with articles discussing the matter in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="NYT Big Battle"&gt;{{cite news | last=Sharkey | first=Joe | title=Big Battle in Small-Jet Skies | publisher=The New York Times | date=2006-08-29 | accessdate=2006-12-12 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/business/29jets.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and items on [[NBC Nightly News]].&lt;ref name="CharterX"&gt;{{cite news|last=Di Piazza |first=Karen |title=No Throne Room on Eclipse VLJ: Real Issue or Media Hype? |publisher=CharterX |url=http://www.charterx.com/resources/article.aspx?id=2314 |accessdate=2006-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084205/http://www.charterx.com/resources/article.aspx?id=2314 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some manufacturers argued that for short flights of {{convert|300|to|500|mi|km}} and 40 to 80 minutes' duration the lavatory issue was not a problem&lt;ref name="NYT Big Battle"/&gt; and air taxi service companies said that it was not a concern for most of their passengers.&lt;ref name="CharterX" /&gt; Despite this, the Eclipse 500 had the option of an electric flush, remove-to-service lavatory with a privacy curtain - at the expense of one passenger seat, and the proposed [[Adam A700]] design had a seven-seat configuration with rear lavatory with a privacy curtain. The [[Cessna Mustang]] also has an emergency toilet, but it is located between the cockpit and cabin.  The [[Embraer Phenom 100]] offers a fully enclosed lavatory with a solid door. The 2015 [[Honda HA-420 HondaJet]] has a full lavatory at the rear of the aircraft with flushing toilet, full sink and closing door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightrun.com/hondajet/lavatory-toilet |title=HondaJet Lavatory - Toilet |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Two Guys===
The origins of the company can be traced back to the [[Two Guys]] discount store chain, founded in 1947 by brothers Sidney and Herbert Hubschman.&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/13/business/chairman-of-its-executive-committee-a-change-at-troubled-vornado.html | title=A CHANGE AT TROUBLED VORNADO | first=ISADORE | last=BARMASH | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 13, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, [[Two Guys]] acquired [[Vornado Air|O. A. Sutton Corporation]], manufacturers of the Vornado line of electric fans, and the company was renamed Vornado Inc.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;

By 1964, the company operated over 200 stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/10/10/two-guys-stores-are-expanding.html | title=Two Guys Stores Are Expanding | first=LEONARD | last=SLOANE | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 10, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1970s, Vornado began divesting its retail operations. In 1978, the company sold 80 Two Guys locations in California.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;

In 1980, Interstate Properties Inc., a [[real estate development]] company controlled by [[Steven Roth]], acquired an 18% stake in Vornado, since Roth became interested in the company's real estate holdings.&lt;ref name=change/&gt; In 1981, Interstate Properties took control of the firm after winning a [[proxy fight|proxy struggle]] against existing management and closed additional stores, reducing the number of stores in operation to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/03/business/vornado-to-increase-store-closings-by-18-units.html | title=VORNADO TO INCREASE STORE CLOSINGS BY 18 UNITS | first=ISADORE | last=BARMASH | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 3, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1992/06/02/looking-closer-at-the-odd-bankruptcy-of-alexanders-inc/ab2614c3-4f55-4506-a42a-1eec2ae99c30/ | title=LOOKING CLOSER AT THE ODD BANKRUPTCY OF ALEXANDER'S INC. | first=ALLAN | last=SLOAN | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=June 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of Alexander's (1986–1995)===
In 1986, Interstate Properties and [[Donald Trump]] each bought approximately 20% of [[Alexander's]], a failing retailer whose real estate holdings included a store that occupied the entire block between [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan#Details##58th Street|East 58th]] and 59th streets and Lexington and [[Third Avenue]]s in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/22/business/company-news-trump-to-acquire-20-of-alexander-s.html | title=Trump to Acquire 20% of Alexander's | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 22, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, they each raised their stakes to 27% of the company, but Trump pledged his interest as collateral for a personal loan from [[Citicorp]] and in 1991, Trump was forced to turn over his holdings to Citibank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/14/business/company-news-alexander-s-jumps-on-trump-rumor.html | title=Alexander's Jumps On Trump Rumor | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 14, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Roth and Alexander's creditors forced Alexander's into bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/16/business/alexander-s-shuts-all-its-11-stores-plans-liquidation.html | title=Alexander's Shuts All Its 11 Stores; Plans Liquidation | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 16, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alexander's emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 as a [[real estate investment trust]]. That same year, Vornado Inc. was converted into a [[REIT]], Vornado Realty Trust. In 1995, Vornado bought Citicorp's interest in Alexander's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/business/company-news-vornado-and-affiliate-get-control-of-alexander-s.html | title=Vornado and Affiliate Get Control of Alexander's | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vornado Air licensing deal (1989)===
In 1989, the Vornado name was [[brand licensing|licensed]] to [[Vornado Air]], LLC, a new company formed to manufacture heating and cooling equipment. Outside of the brand licensing agreement, the Trust has no modern relation to Vornado Air, LLC.
