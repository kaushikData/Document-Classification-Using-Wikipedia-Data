From March to May 1998, a terror plot against the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] in France was uncovered by European law enforcement.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=European Police Raids Target World Cup Terrorist Threat|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/27/sports/sp-53951|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=27 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Europe Overview|journal=Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1998|url=https://fas.org/irp/threat/terror_98/europe.htm|publisher=[[Bureau of Counterterrorism|Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism]] (United States Department of State)|date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 people were arrested in seven countries as a result of the plot.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|authorlink=Simon Kuper|title=Is football facing a new age of stadium terrorism after Paris attacks?|url=http://www.espnfc.com/european-championship/74/blog/post/2715900/paris-attacks-and-a-new-age-of-stadium-terrorism|work=ESPN FC|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised by the Algerian [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) and backed by [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]], the plot is thought to have targeted the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Group G#England vs Tunisia|England–Tunisia match]] on 15 June 1998, and involved infiltrating the [[Stade Vélodrome]] in [[Marseille]] in order to attack players and spectators during the game, attack the hotel in [[Paris]] hosting the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]], and finally hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into the [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant]] near [[Poitiers]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

==Raids and arrests==
The original suspect of the plot was French-Algerian [[Farid Melouk]], who had previously been sentenced ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' to seven years in prison in France for his connection to the [[1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=World News Briefs; Belgians Arrest Suspect In Paris Bombings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/06/world/world-news-briefs-belgians-arrest-suspect-in-paris-bombings.html|work=The New York Times|date=6 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Depeche"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bruxelles : échec au réseau du GIA|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/1998/03/06/186734-bruxelles-echec-au-reseau-du-gia.html|work=La Dépêche du Midi|date=6 March 1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anschläge bei Fußball-WM?|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-7838193.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=16 March 1998|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Silhouette|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Archives/1998-11-10/Silhouette-_NP_-1998-11-10-462539|work=La Croix|date=10 November 1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Le repaire belge du terrorisme|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/le-repaire-belge-du-terrorisme-51b874c6e4b0de6db9a638e6|work=La Libre Belgique|date=14 September 2001|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melouk had reportedly been tracked by intelligence services following his entry into [[Belgium]], where he was found to be in contact with [[Ahmed Zaoui]] and a GIA-linked [[Brussels]] mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March, after two weeks of surveillance, fifty police officers stormed a house where Melouk was staying with others involved in the plot.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people including Swedish and Danish nationals were arrested in the 12-hour siege, amid a series of anti-terrorism raids in Belgium.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Depeche"/&gt; Large amounts of liquid explosives were found during the raid, as well as detonators, a [[AK-47|Kalashnikov rifle]], several handguns and thousands worth of [[United States dollar|US dollars]] in cash.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Brynjar|last1=Lia|authorlink1=Brynjar Lia|first2=Åshild|last2=Kjøk|date=8 August 2001|title=Islamist Insurgencies, Diasporic Support Networks, and their Host States: The Case of the Algerian GIA in Europe 1993–2000|url=https://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/01-03789.pdf|publisher=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] (FFI)|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a large number of documents, brochures and maps relating to the World Cup were retrieved.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; More explosives were uncovered in a follow-up raid of another house.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;

The March raid was part of a joint security operation between Belgium, France, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt; Despite initial Belgian claims denying links to any plot against the World Cup, the plot was later confirmed by the French counter-intelligence chief.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chronology: The Plots|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/front/special/cron.html|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melouk was sentenced to 9 years in prison for charges including attempted murder.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; In early May, eight suspected militants linked to the plot were arrested in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 26 May, nearly 100 people were detained in coordinated operations across France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; In France, 53 men including Algerian, French and Tunisian nationals suspected of links to ex-GIA commander [[Hassan Hattab]] were detained across 43 locations, including in Marseilles, Paris, [[Lyon]] and [[Corsica]]; around 25 were arrested and charged or deported.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Five Algerians were arrested in Germany after raids across several cities, ten in Belgium, two in Switzerland, six in Italy, and many more detained.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; French Interior Minister [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]] said on French television after the arrests that investigators had found evidence of plots to attack the World Cup.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Islamist paraphernalia and $150,000 in cash were found during the raids, but no explosives or arms.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; Some police sources have said that a goal of the May raids was to crush GIA support networks.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; According to counter-terrorism magistrate [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], the May raids were a preventive measure to protect the tournament.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;

==Plot and aftermath==
The plot involved terrorists infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille as stadium crew, in order to attack English players and spectators during the England-Tunisia match on 15 June.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; Terrorists had reportedly planned to blow up the England substitute bench (targeting youngsters [[David Beckham]] and [[Michael Owen]]), shoot English players and throw grenades into the stands.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harry|last=Harris|title=England terrorist plot revealed|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/683732/england-football-team-escaped-terrorist-attack-at-1998-world-cup|work=ESPN FC|date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Laurent|last=Dubois|year=2010|title=Soccer Empire: The World Cup and the Future of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tyBmBcbZIMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PT181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=University of California Press|page=181|isbn=9780520259287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terrorists were then to storm the United States national team's hotel in Paris and attack American players watching the game there.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; The attacks would be followed by another group of terrorists who would hijack an aircraft and crash it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers, causing a [[nuclear meltdown]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

The details or even existence of the plot was kept secret from managers, players and the media, but was known to security including [[The Football Association|FA]] staff.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt; In 2009, England manager in 1998 [[Glenn Hoddle]] revealed that he had only been informed of the plot "years later", while FA Director of Communications during 1998 [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]] said that he had been informed of the plot before the match by FA Head of Security Brian Hayes.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt; The match was otherwise marred by supporter riots in Marseilles, with British vehicles being bricked while bottles were thrown across the streets, causing police to use tear gas as large numbers of supporters were injured and arrested.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt;

Although organised by GIA operatives, the plot reportedly had the backing and support of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-first1=Nicholas John|editor-last1=Cull|editor-first2=David Holbrook|editor-last2=Culbert|editor-first3=David|editor-last3=Welch|first=Nicholas J.|last=Cull|year=2003|title=Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present|chapter=Osama bin Laden|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Byzv7rf6gL8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=9781576078204}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to bin Laden biographer [[Yossef Bodansky]], the World Cup plot being foiled was one of the reasons for "dormant terrorist networks" responsible for the August [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] being "reactivated". The attacks killed over 200 and wounded more than 4,000.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The World's Game Is Not Just A Game|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/26/magazine/the-world-s-game-is-not-just-a-game.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=26 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A terror plot against the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] was discovered after Dutch intelligence intercepted calls made between GIA operatives from inside French prisons.&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Gun guard on French soccer stars|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/euro2000/news/20000620frathreat.html|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=20 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three men were detained in French prisons as a result of the plot, and three were subsequently arrested in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"/&gt; One of the French prisoners detained for the plot was Adel Mechat, who served 6 years after having been arrested in Germany and extradited to France as part of the 1998 World Cup raids.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"/&gt;

The night before the first ever football match between France and Algeria in October 2001, police seized explosives and arrested four Islamist militants suspected of having targeted the game after a phone call had been intercepted with warnings to stay away from the [[Stade de France]]. Other items retrieved included bulletproof vests and explosives manuals.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|title=International Football: Seventeen held as Algerian fans invade pitch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3014255/International-Football-Seventeen-held-as-Algerian-fans-invade-pitch.html|work=The Telegraph|date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match itself became marred with controversy, and was eventually stopped with 15 minutes left playing after Algerian fans stormed the field.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

==Background and development==
[[File:Big Bang 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Big Bang performing in Singapore]]
In support of their fifth extended Korean-language EP, ''[[Alive (EP)|Alive]]'' and their fourth Japanese-language studio album of [[Alive (Big Bang album)|the same name]], released February 29 and March 28, 2012, respectively, Big Bang's record label [[YG Entertainment]] announced that the group intended to hold a world tour in partnership with tour promoter [[Live Nation]], visiting Asia, North America, South America and Europe.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/2012/02/big-bang-to-hold-world-tour-through-live-nation/|title=Big Bang to hold ‘ALIVE TOUR 2012′ around the world through Live Nation!|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2012|publisher=allkpop.com|author=allkpop}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live Nation president Alan Ridgeway stated, "We are very happy that we are working with YG Entertainment and Big Bang to show [our work] to worldwide K-pop fans." A representative for YG Entertainment followed this with, "We are working hard to hold the best concert with the best production team to equal the anticipation of the world fans who are waiting for the first concert they will get to meet Big Bang.&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt;

Choreographer and creative director [[Laurieann Gibson]], famed for her work with [[Lady Gaga]], was hired as the tour's director and choreographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://style.mtv.com/2012/03/14/big-bang-tour/|title=Big Bang Pairs Up With Laurieann Gibson|publisher=style.mtv.com|author=Chrissy Mahlmeister|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; US-based visual contents company Possible Productions was hired to create the Alive tour's custom backdrops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.possibleproductions.com/bigbang-american-idol-mau5trap-kids-choice-awards/|title=BIGBANG, American Idol, Mau5trap, Nicki Minaj &amp; Kid’s Choice Awards|date=April 3, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2012|work=possibleproductions.com|author=Figgie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628005255/http://www.possibleproductions.com/bigbang-american-idol-mau5trap-kids-choice-awards/|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team described the concept as a "bleak futuristic world [that could only be] saved by Big Bang."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.possibleproductions.com/work/bigbang-alive-galaxy-tour-2012/ |title=BIGBANG ALIVE GALAXY TOUR 2012 |date=November 2012 |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |publisher=possibleproductions.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213024933/http://www.possibleproductions.com/work/bigbang-alive-galaxy-tour-2012/ |archivedate=December 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting and staging, as well as overall production, was designed by Leroy Bennet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leroybennett.com/resume.html |title=His Résumé - 2012 |work=leroybennett.com |year=2012 |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209055558/http://leroybennett.com/resume.html |archivedate=February 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Staging and lighting alone was estimated at USD$1.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redtix.airasia.com/events/BigBang/|title=YG ENTERTAINMENT AND LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT PRESENT BIGBANG Alive Galaxy Tour 2012 in Malaysia|year=2012|accessdate=December 4, 2012|publisher=redtix.airasia.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125093522/http://redtix.airasia.com/events/BigBang/|archive-date=2012-11-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean electronics brand [[Samsung]] was contracted as the tour's official sponsor, who provided electronics for the members and touring staff on the dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soompi.com/2012/07/06/big-bang-to-collaborate-with-samsung-electronics-for-bigbang-alive-galaxy-tour-2012/|title=Big Bang to Collaborate with Samsung Electronics for "BIGBANG ALIVE GALAXY TOUR 2012″|date=July 6, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2012|publisher=soompi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the first time the group has conducted a worldwide concert tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nseq=137850&amp;code=Ne2&amp;category=2 |title=Arirang News |publisher=Arirang.co.kr |date=2012-09-28 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial performance==
Tickets for the group's world tour, which kicked off in Seoul in March 2012, sold out faster than Live Nation had anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/04/bigbang-theory.html |title=BigBang theory |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=2012-10-04 |accessdate=2012-10-13|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006234641/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/04/bigbang-theory.html |archivedate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Singapore, all tickets were sold out shortly after its on sale and a second show was immediately announced to cope with the huge ticket demand from fans. Later in Malaysia, they attracted more than 3,500 fans to queue up at the box office to fight for their tickets. In Taiwan, all 22,000 tickets of their 2 shows were sold out within just a few hours.&lt;ref name="njtoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://njtoday.net/2012/10/01/korean-pop-group-adds-2nd-newark-show-after-original-date-sells-out/ |title=Korean Pop Group Adds 2nd Newark Show After Original Date Sells Out &amp;#124; njtoday.net – Everything New Jersey |work=Njtoday.net |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Bigbang merchandise.jpg|thumb|220px|Fan holding a Big Bang stick at a concert]]
''[[The New York Times]]'' journalist Jon Caramanica wrote that Big Bang performed more than two dozen songs wearing almost as many outfits, and in unusual setups such as "taking the stage on gilded [[Segway PT|Segways]] and lowrider bicycles" during their "short but loud American tour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CARAMANICA|first=JON|title=BigBang Performs at the Prudential Center|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/music/bigbang-performs-at-the-prudential-center.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=10 November 2012|date=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Billboard K-Town]]'' columnist Jeff Benjamin reported that concertgoers were treated to breakdancing and [[Taeyang]]'s gymnastics for a few on-stage flips during Big Bang's concert at the [[Prudential Center]] in [[New Jersey]], and described the band's concerts in America as "a success for all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benjamin|first=Jeff|title=BIGBANG in America: Behind the Scenes With the K-Pop Boy Wonders|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/474146/bigbang-in-america-behind-the-scenes-with-the-k-pop-boy-wonders|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Lapin from the Californian newspaper ''[[OC Weekly]]'' attended Big Bang's concert in [[Los Angeles]] and reported that the atmosphere during the show was "almost palpable". Lapin concluded, "It was nostalgic, a throwback to old-school hip-hop but with a commercial twist and a foreign reinterpretation...these boys, well, they'll be back, and they know they're going to be superstars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lapin|first=Joseph|title=BIG BANG - Honda Center - November 3, 2012|url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/11/bigbang_honda_center_k-pop.php|publisher=OC Weekly|accessdate=13 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211014156/http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/11/bigbang_honda_center_k-pop.php|archive-date=2012-12-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'''s music journalist Caroline Sullivan praised Big Bang for holding a "fabulous spectacle" at the [[Wembley Arena]] in [[London]]. She compared Big Bang with other Western music bands, and noted that Big Bang's edges "are crisper, the sound louder, the dancing sharper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|title=Big Bang – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/16/big-bang-review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 December 2012|location=London|date=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Radio Programas del Perú]]'' ranked the tour as the best K-pop concert in [[South America]] for 2012, beating out earlier concerts performed by [[JYJ]], [[U-Kiss]] and a [[Music Bank (TV series)]] concert at [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lunes|title=Concierto de Big Bang en Lima elegido el mejor en Sudamérica en 2012|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2012-12-31-concierto-de-big-bang-en-lima-elegido-el-mejor-en-sudamerica-en-2012-noticia_553663.html|publisher=Radio Programas del Perú|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for Music in International Schools''', best known as '''AMIS''', is an organization that brings together students of schools worldwide who excel in musical achievements for days of music practice and then conclude with a concert.  The Association also provides professional development through an annual Music Educators' Conference.

==The Acronym==
The association name ''Amis'' is also [[French language|French]] for the word ''friends''. The founders of AMIS choose this name with the purpose of the association in mind. ''Amis'' symbolizes friendships established by children all over the world who attend AMIS Festivals. AMIS' vision is to create a music festival atmosphere that is a place of learning, laughing and most importantly coming together; this is reflected in its name. Although the association AMIS is based out of the [[United Kingdom]], the association chose a French (as opposed to an English) name to represent the numerous nationalities that participate in and contribute to AMIS festivals all over the world.

==Mission statement==

[[File:TwoGirlsInBlueAmisTshirt2013.jpg|thumb|left|Two girls captured wearing the 2013 European Middle School Honor Girls’ Festival Shirt.]]

“The Association is an international, non-profit, [[Nonsectarian|non-sectarian]], politically neutral organization dedicated to the promotion of excellence at all levels of [[music education]]. Its objectives are to advance the education of school pupils and teachers throughout the world by developing their understanding, knowledge and appreciation of music; to advance the  education of young people and their teachers in global issues and cultural diversity through the performance and study of music; to promote high standards of musical performance in school pupils of all ages and abilities throughout the world; to promote furtherance of educationally valuable music repertoire.”&lt;ref name="AMIS Mission Statement"&gt;[http://www.amis-online.org.uk/about/mission.html AMIS Mission Statement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530065828/http://www.amis-online.org.uk/about/mission.html |date=May 30, 2008 }} at www.amis-online.org.uk (accessed 2008-06-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==AMIS Festivals==

Once a year, there is a festival for each of the different categories. (See '''Festival Categories''' for list). Each festival is hosted by an AMIS Membership school, rotating between them yearly.  To qualify for band, strings, and all High School auditions, students must audition by recordings, which are judged by a blind panel of music educators.  Middle School Choir auditions are conducted by each participating school's teacher.  The successful students travel to the host school and participate in the practice days and the final concert.  The format is usually: travel Wednesday, rehearse Thursday-Saturday, concert Saturday evening, travel home Sunday.

[[File:ThreeGirlsInWaterlooBelgiumAMIS.jpg|thumb|right|Three girls attending the 2013 European Middle School Honor Girls’ Choir in [[Waterloo, Belgium]].]]

AMIS' member schools mainly lie in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], with some participants in [[Africa]] (although at the moment there is one membership school that participates in festivals and hails from [[Central America]]).  Founded in [[London]], AMIS slowly grew across Western Europe and now has many festivals reserved only for Asian schools.  Festivals are conducted in English, though due to the participants coming from within international school populations, most students (and many teachers) speak multiple languages. Concert repertoires always include multiple languages; and concert speeches and introductions are usually held in the (festival's) host country's language in addition to English. (For example: The 2014 European Middle School Honor Girls’ Choir, hosted in [[Stavanger, Norway]], had concert services conducted in Norwegian as well as English.)

==Conductors==

AMIS selects a different conductor for each festival. Often, conductors are teachers in international schools who are well respected and recommended by their peers.  At the high school level, the Association contracts premiere conductors from around the world.

==Music==

The repertoire style depends on the AMIS festival and the songs that the conductor wants to play. Many times, AMIS has commissioned works by authors, making the band/choir present world-premiere songs. Such authors include [[Philip Sparke]], David Brunner, Dr. Richard Prior, [[Christopher Marshall (composer)|Christopher Marshall]], and more.

==Festival Categories==

AMIS presents a multitude of different yearly festivals focused on different music, instrumentation, and musicians. These are:
* High School Honor Band
* High School Honor Orchestra
* High School Honor Mixed Choir
* High School Honor Women's Choir
* High School Honor Men's Choir

The city of Atlanta is widely noted for being a "Black Gay Mecca" due to its highly visible black LGBT community, [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive reputation]], and vibrant [[urban area#United States|urban]] LGBT [[nightlife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2005/08/16/atlanta-new-mecca-black-gays/|title=Atlanta the new mecca for black gays|date=16 August 2005|website=Advocate.com|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta also has the largest community of black same-sex couples in the [[Southern United States|South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/08/nation/na-blackgay8|title=Voice of Atlanta's Black Gays Is Emerging|last=Jarvie|first=Jenny|date=2006-05-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winter Pride==
January's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend is when Atlanta's first major pride event of the year is held.  During this unofficial pride weekend, there are several special black gay events and celebrations for locals and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectq.us/atlanta/lgbt_atlanta_calls_mlk_weekend_winter_pride?gid=7246|title=LGBT Atlanta calls MLK Weekend ‘Winter Pride’|website=Projectq.us|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's wife and Atlanta resident, [[Coretta Scott King]], was a well-known proud supporter of the black gay community. In 1998, Mrs. King publicly stated at the 25th [[Lambda Legal]] anniversary reception that she believes her late husband would have also been a supporter of [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americablog.com/2012/01/remember-the-words-of-coretta-scott-king-speaking-of-gay-civil-rights.html|title=Remember the words of Coretta Scott King, speaking of gay civil rights - AMERICAblog News|date=17 January 2012|website=Americablog.com|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bang and Whimper 2017 – The Farewell Tour''' was a concert tour by the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[gothic rock]] band [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]]. Originally formed in 1991, the band announced on 5 March 2017 their plans to disband following a farewell tour that same year. HIM took a break during 2016, but began work on new material at the end of the year. According to vocalist [[Ville Valo]] "the new material wasn't taking flight", and the band eventually decided to disband while still on good terms. Titled '''Bang and Whimper 2017''', the tour began on 14 June 2017 in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], and concluded on 31 December 2017 in [[Helsinki]], Finland, as a part of the band's annual [[Helldone|Helldone Festival]]. The tour spanned three legs, across [[Europe]] and [[North America]], with most shows being sold-out, gathering over 110 000 attendees and mostly positive reviews, with the ''[[Nottingham Post]]'' noting that HIM "truly went out with a 'bang'{{tsp}}".

For the tour, the band brought out material from all their studio albums, and also played theirs first ever outdoor show in Helsinki at the [[Tuska Open Air Metal Festival]], breaking the festival's record for highest attendance on a single date. In conjunction with the tour, a special photo exhibition by [[Ville Juurikkala]], titled ''HIM: Right Here in My Eyes'', was also held at the [[Helsinki Art Museum]] and the Morrison Hotel Gallery in [[New York City|New York]], featuring new photos of the band preparing for the tour.

==Background==
HIM had been on hiatus in 2016, during which time the bandmembers worked on different side projects, before regrouping at the end of the year to start work on new material with drummer Jukka "Kosmo" Kröger, who had replaced [[Gas Lipstick|Mika "Gas Lipstick" Karppinen]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="Kosmo"&gt;{{Cite web | title = HIM's VILLE VALO Talks New Drummer, Upcoming Studio Album| date =August 15, 2015  | website = [[Blabbermouth]]  | url =http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/hims-ville-valo-talks-new-drummer-upcoming-studio-album-video/ | accessdate = 2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to vocalist [[Ville Valo]]: "We felt like the new material wasn't taking flight.

We completed the pattern, solved the puzzle and turned the key. Thank you."&lt;ref name="Loppu"/&gt; Bassist [[Mige (musician)|Mikko "Mige" Paananen]] also added: "At the end of 2017 we will be released into the wild.

Along with the announcement, the band also revealed European dates for their farewell tour, with a North American leg being announced later in June.&lt;ref name="BangandWhimper"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = HIM Announces North American Leg Of Farewell Tour; Special BLABBERMOUTH.NET Presale Available| date =2017-06-13| website =[[Blabbermouth.net]]  | url =http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/him-announces-north-american-leg-of-farewell-tour-special-blabbermouth-net-presale-available/ | accessdate = 2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from two festival appearances, no other Finnish dates were revealed, with Valo later commenting: "My deep personal wish is, that HIM's last note would be heard on the stage of the [[Tavastia Club]] on the first day of next year, but we'll see."&lt;ref name="MTVToive"&gt;{{cite web|title = Ville Valo: "Syvä toiveeni on, että HIMin viimeinen sävel kuullaan Tavastian lavalta" |url =https://www.mtv.fi/viihde/musiikki/artikkeli/ville-valo-syva-toiveeni-on-etta-himin-viimeinen-savel-kuullaan-tavastian-lavalta/6491214#gs.yrBG=bY |publisher=MTV |date=2017-07-03 |accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, it was announced that the band's final show would take place on [[New Year's Eve]] at the Tavastia Club as a part of the band's annual [[Helldone|Helldone Festival]].&lt;ref name="Helldone2017"&gt;{{cite web|title = HIM TO BID FAREWELL AT TAVASTIA CLUB ON NEW YEAR’S EVE |url =https://www.tiketti.fi/HIM-to-bid-farewell-at-Tavastia-Club-on-New-Years-Eve-uutiset/10877 |publisher=Tiketti |date=2017-08-07 |accessdate=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was quickly sold-out, so four additional Finnish dates for December were announced, all of which sold-out as well.&lt;ref name="Helldone20172"&gt;{{cite web|title = Jäitkö ilman HIM-lippua?

===Setlist===
For the setlist, HIM brought out songs from all of their studio albums, as well as their 1996 EP ''[[666 Ways to Love: Prologue]]''. The main set stayed largely the same throughout the tour, with "Stigmata Diaboli" and "It's All Tears (Drown in This Love)" having a rotating slot, while "Resurrection" was dropped from the set after the first European leg.&lt;ref name="Resurrection"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/him-4bd6cf0a.html?song=Resurrection |title=Song Statistics: Resurrection by HIM |publisher=Setlist.fm }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Beyond Redemption" also made an appearance in the setlist for the first time in thirteen years at the Summit Music Hall in [[Denver]].&lt;ref name="Summit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/him/2017/summit-music-hall-denver-co-5be3033c.html |title=HIM Setlist at Summit Music Hall, Denver, CO, USA |publisher=Setlist.fm }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stigmata Diaboli" and "Resurrection" also hadn't been performed live since 2002 and 2004 respectively.&lt;ref name="Razz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/him/2017/razzmatazz-barcelona-spain-1be4b92c.html |title=HIM Setlist at Razzmatazz, Barcelona, Spain |publisher=Setlist.fm }}&lt;/ref&gt; "When Love and Death Embrace" and a cover of [[Billy Idol]]'s "[[Rebel Yell (song)|Rebel Yell]]" were the major mainstays of the encore, with "[[Pretending (HIM song)|Pretending]]" and "Razorblade Kiss" occasionally appearing as well.&lt;ref name="Pepsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/him/2017/pepsi-center-wtc-mexico-city-mexico-2be36cae.html |title=HIM Setlist at Pepsi Center WTC, Mexico City, Mexico  |publisher=Setlist.fm }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sleepwalking Past Hope" also appeared twice on the encore, at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] and [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Blues"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/him/2017/house-of-blues-lake-buena-vista-fl-7be35288.html |title=HIM Setlist at House of Blues, Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA  |publisher=Setlist.fm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blues2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/him/2017/house-of-blues-anaheim-ca-13e30179.html |title=HIM Setlist at House of Blues, Anaheim, CA, USA |publisher=Setlist.fm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HIM - Helsinki Ice Hall 2017 (15).jpg|thumb|300px|right|HIM performing at the [[Helsinki Ice Hall]] on 27 December 2017]]
The tour was generally well received, with the ''[[Nottingham Post]]'' stating that HIM "truly went out with a 'bang'".&lt;ref name="Nottingham"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = HIM at Rock City, Nottingham on their farewell tour – review and photos | date =December 16, 2017| website = ''[[Nottingham Post]]''  | url =http://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/music-nightlife/him-rock-city-nottingham-farewell-936297 | accessdate = 2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most shows were sold-out, with the tour gathering an audience of over 110 000 people.&lt;ref name="HSLontoo"&gt;{{Cite web | title = HIM-yhtyeen maailmanvalloitus päättyi Lontooseen, mutta takaportti jää auki: Ehkä me soitetaan Ruisrockissa 2024, kun rahat on loppu | language = Finnish | date =December 20, 2017 | website = ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' | url =https://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005496946.html | accessdate = 2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Soundi'' gave praise to the band's appearance at [[Tuska Open Air Metal Festival|Tuska]], commending their stage-presence and overall performance,&lt;ref name="SoundiTuska"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Keikkareportaasi: Karismaa, ei sirkustemppuja – HIM ensimmäistä ja viimeistä kertaa Tuskassa | language = Finnish | date =July 4, 2017| website = ''Soundi''  | url =https://www.soundi.fi/keikat/keikkareportaasi-karismaa-ei-sirkustemppuja-ensimmaista-ja-viimeista-kertaa-tuskassa/ | accessdate = 2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was echoed by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', who touted the show as "meeting all expectations".&lt;ref name="HSTuska"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = HIMin keikka Tuskassa täytti kaikki odotukset | language = Finnish | date =July 2, 2017| website = ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]''  | url =https://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/konserttiarvostelu/art-2000005276161.html | accessdate = 2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise was also given to the tour's setlist, which ''[[Loudwire]]'' stated "couldn’t have been more perfectly crafted".&lt;ref name="LoudwireNYC"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = HIM KISS NORTH AMERICA GOODBYE WITH STUNNING NEW YORK CITY GIG | date =November 18, 2017| website = ''[[Loudwire]]''  | url =http://loudwire.com/him-kiss-north-america-goodbye-new-york-city/#photogallery-1=4 | accessdate = 2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valo's vocal performance was well received, which ''Loudwire'' touted as sounding "perfect the entire night" at the band's show in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name="LoudwireNYC"/&gt; ''Soundi'' echoed this, describing Valo's performance at Tuska as "possibly the best the man has ever sounded".&lt;ref name="SoundiTuska"/&gt; The rest of the band were also praised, with ''[[Etelä-Suomen Sanomat]]'' noting how all members got their respective moments to shine, singling out [[Linde Lindström]]'s solo in "[[Wicked Game]]" as a particular highlight.&lt;ref name="ESS"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Konserttiarvio: HIM käy riemulla kohti loppuaan – Helsingin Jäähallissa nähtiin keskiviikkoiltana vapautunut Ville Valo | language = Finnish | date =| website = ''[[Etelä-Suomen Sanomat]]'' | url =https://www.ess.fi/uutiset/kulttuurijaviihde/art2426187 | accessdate = 2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall atmosphere of the shows was described as "celebratory", "exciting", yet "solemn",&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Finnish Goth-Metal Band HIM Bids Farewell to U.S. With New York City Tour Stop | date =November 18, 2017| website = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''  | url =https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8039473/finnish-goth-metal-band-him-farewell-tour-new-york-city-concert | accessdate = 2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The Guardian]]'' concluding their review by stating that "in an era saturated with cash-in reunions it is refreshing to see a band devil-sign off on their own eccentric terms".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = HIM review – fond and florid farewell for Finnish metal monsters | date =December 15, 2017| website = ''[[The Guardian]]''  | url =https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/15/him-review-fond-and-florid-farewell-for-finnish-metal-monsters | accessdate = 2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ilta-Sanomat'' felt similarly, commenting how HIM "never became [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeymen]], whose only fuel for touring was just nostalgia", noting how their show at the [[Helsinki Ice Hall]] featured a band with "more fury and character than most performers ever".&lt;ref name="ISHalli"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Kommentti: HIM lopettaa huipulla – yhtye ei ole jäähyväiskiertueellaan säälittävä kehäraakki | language = Finnish | date =| website = ''[[Ilta-Sanomat]]''  | url =https://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000005504601.html | accessdate = 2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the tour was mostly well received, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' noted technical difficulties hindering the band's show in [[New York City|New York]],&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt; while ''[[Ilta-Sanomat]]'' gave a less-favorable review for the band's appearance at [[Miljoona Rock]], describing it as lacking "atmosphere" and Valo "looking bored".&lt;ref name="ISTuuri"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Näkökulma: Eturivissä haukoteltiin avoimesti – HIM:n viimeinen festarikeikka ei sujunut odotusten mukaan | language = Finnish | date =July 14, 2017| website = ''[[Ilta-Sanomat]]''  | url =https://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000005291788.html | accessdate = 2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV felt similarly, likening Valo's performance at the Helsinki Ice Hall to a "karaoke night", and stating that "at the Ice Hall we saw a HIM that won't be missed in the slightest".&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Kommentti: Ville Valo oli illan suurin häviäjä – Jäähallissa nähtiin HIM, jota ei tule tippaakaan ikävä | language = Finnish | date =| website = MTV  | url =https://www.mtv.fi/viihde/musiikki/artikkeli/kommentti-ville-valo-oli-illan-suurin-haviaja-jaahallissa-nahtiin-him-jota-ei-tule-tippaakaan-ikava/6710662 | accessdate = 2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dead Press!'' also gave the band's show in [[Manchester]] a mixed review, noting how the band seemed to be "going through the motions", and ultimately called the show "mostly a yawn orgy, and unfortunately a bittersweet farewell."&lt;ref name="DeadPress"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = LIVE: HIM @ ACADEMY, MANCHESTER (16/12/2017) | language = | date =| website =''Dead Press!''  | url =http://www.deadpress.co.uk/77216/live-him-academy-manchester-2017 | accessdate = 2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ticket sales for the tour's final five dates also caused some controversy. Tickets for the [[Helldone]] shows were named specific to the buyer, and attendees were required to show matching identification upon entry to the venue.&lt;ref name="ISLippu"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Fanit raivostuivat: HIM-yhtyeen jäähyväiskeikkojen lipunmyynti suututtaa – erikoisella käytännöllä yritetään estää trokaaminen | language = Finnish | date =| website = ''[[Ilta-Sanomat]]''  | url =https://www.is.fi/musiikki/art-2000005489039.html | accessdate = 2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; If several tickets had been purchased to a large party and the buyer was unable to attend, ticket offices did not provide the option of changing the name, only allowing resale of the tickets back to the seller.&lt;ref name="ISLippu"/&gt; This policy was taken in order to reduce [[Ticket resale|scalping]], with organizer Tiina Vuorinen commenting: "HIM has always been surrounded by a ticket-scam-mentality, and that's why this policy has been in effect for years at previous Helldone shows."&lt;ref name="ISLippu"/&gt;

'''''Boesman and Lena''''' is a small-cast [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[South Africa]]n playwright [[Athol Fugard]], set in the [[Swartkops]] mudflats outside the playwright's native [[Port Elizabeth]] in the [[Eastern Cape]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/boesman-lena "Boesman &amp; Lena"], Encyclopedia.com.&lt;/ref&gt; that shows the effect of [[apartheid]] on a few individuals, featuring as characters a "[[Coloured]]" man and woman walking from one shanty town to another.

==Background==
In common with much of Fugard's other work, the play focuses on non-white characters and includes an element of social protest. ''Boesman and Lena'' was inspired by an incident in 1965 when Fugard was driving down a rural road in South Africa. He noticed an old lady walking along the road in the boiling-hot sun, miles from anywhere, and offered her a lift. She was overcome and cried with gratitude. She told him that her husband had just died and she was walking to another farm. If Fugard had not stopped, she would have spent the night on the side of the road.&lt;ref name='enotes'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Boesman and Lena / Introduction | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.enotes.com/boesman/ | work =enotes | pages = | accessdate =6 March 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (It was a common practice in [[apartheid]] South Africa for farmers to evict worker's families when the worker died.) What struck Fugard was that the woman was in pain and suffering but was far from defeated. This inspired him to write the play.

==Notable productions==
The play premiered in 1969 at the [[Rhodes University]] Little Theatre in [[Grahamstown]], South Africa. Fugard himself played the part of Boesman, Lena was played by [[Yvonne Bryceland]] and Glynn Day, a white actor, played the part of Outa in [[blackface]].

On 22 June 1970, the US premiere, an acclaimed [[off-Broadway]] at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre|Circle in the Square Downtown]], starred [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Ruby Dee]],&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/22/archives/james-earl-jones-sighs-for-boesman-and-lena.html?_r=0 "James Earl Jones Sighs For ‘Boesman and Lena’"], ''The New York Times'', 22 June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[John Berry (film director)|John Berry]] (who would also direct a film version, also titled ''Boesman and Lena'', in 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/01/arts/john-berry-82-stage-film-director-who-exiled-himself-during-blacklisting-1950-s.html|title=John Berry, 82, Stage and Film Director Who Exiled Himself During Blacklisting of 1950's|author=Ralph Blumenthal|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 December 1999|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Running for 205 performances until 24 January 1971, the production won [[Obie Awards]] for Best Foreign Play, Distinguished Direction, and Best Performance by an Actress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1199 "Boesman and Lena"] at Circle in the Square Downtown, Lortel Archives, Internet Off-Broadway Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival of the play by the [[Manhattan Theater Club]], directed by the playwright himself (and starring [[Keith David]], [[Lynne Thigpen]] and Tsepo Mokone), was produced at [[New York City Center]] in 1992, when the ''[[New York Times]]'' review by [[Frank Rich]] said: "Whether or not you get to the Manhattan Theater Club's revival of 'Boesman and Lena,' you can always see another, informal version of its drama day or night on a Manhattan sidewalk or subway platform or vacant lot. Athol Fugard's image of an itinerant homeless couple sheltered within their scrap-heap possessions and awaiting the next official eviction is now as common in New York City, among other places, as it was in the South Africa where he set and wrote his play in the late 1960's. Even at the time of its premiere, 'Boesman and Lena' was recognized as a universal work that might speak to audiences long after apartheid had collapsed. But who would have imagined that the universality would soon prove so uncomfortably literal?"&lt;ref&gt;Frank Rich, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/30/theater/review-theater-boesman-and-lena-fugard-s-sad-wanderers-with-intimations-of-now.html "Review/Theater: Boesman and Lena; Fugard's Sad Wanderers, With Intimations of Now"], ''The New York Times'', 30 June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] concluded: "This is an important play, no less so since conditions in South Africa have somewhat improved: The misery may now be as much existential as social. Outside oppressors add to it, but we carry oppression within us."&lt;ref&gt;John Simon, "Benoit &amp; Marcelle &amp; Henri &amp; Angelique" in ''New York'', Vol. 25, no. 6, 10 February 1992, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; This production won a [[Lucille Lortel Award]] for Outstanding Revival and an Obie Award for Thigpen's performance, as well as being nominated as Best Revival of a Play for an [[Outer Critics Circle Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1318 "Boesman and Lena"] at New York City Center-Stage I, Lortel Archives, Internet Off-Broadway Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film versions==
Two film adaptations of Fugard's play, both of the same title — one directed by [[Ross Devenish]], starring Fugard and Bryceland, and the other directed by John Berry, starring [[Danny Glover]] and [[Angela Bassett]] — were released in 1973&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071234/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_17 "Boesman and Lena (1973)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0197311/ "Boesman and Lena (2000)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

==Publication==
''Boesman and Lena'' was first published in 1971 by [[Samuel French]] ({{ISBN|9780573606205}}), and has since appeared in other editions of Fugard's works: ''Boesman and Lena and Other Plays'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1978; {{ISBN|978-0192812421}}), ''Three Port Elizabeth Plays: The Blood Knot: Hello and Goodbye: Boesman and Lena'' (Oxford University Press, 1974, {{ISBN|978-0192113665}}; Viking Press, 1974; {{ISBN|978-0670709298}}), and ''Blood Knot and Other Plays including Boesman And Lena and Hello And Goodbye'' ([[Theatre Communications Group]], 1991; {{ISBN|978-1559360203}}).

'''Brutal Assault''' is an [[Open-air concert|open-air]] [[extreme metal]] [[rock festival|festival]] that takes place in the 18th-century army fortress [[Josefov Fortress|Josefov]], located in [[Jaroměř]], Czech Republic. It is held each August early in the month from Wednesday until Saturday. The festival started in 1996, originally focused on [[grindcore]]. For many years, it was a small event with mainly Czech and Slovak bands performing. It changed location several times and grew into a large event by 2006, when over 7,000 people attended the festival in [[Svojšice (Pardubice District)|Svojšice]]. After moving to Josefov, attendances grew further to 15,000 in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brutal Assault byl vyprodaný, přijelo 15 tisíc metalistů|url=http://kultura.idnes.cz/brutal-assault-01s-/hudba.aspx?c=A120813_085356_hudba_ob|website=iDnes|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the festival has operated two alternating main stages since. Currently, Brutal Assault features artists that perform all forms of extreme metal, including some of the genre's most prominent figures, as well as artists with dark and intense styles from genres outside of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] such as [[punk rock]], [[experimental rock]] and [[electronic music|electronic]]. The festival motto is: "Against violence and intolerance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brutalassault.cz/en/directions/|title=Directions for the festival visitors {{!}} Brutal Assault Festival|website=brutalassault.cz|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

[[File:Josefstadt-festung.JPG|thumb|right|A view inside of the fortress.]]

Brutal Assault takes place in [[Josefov Fortress|Josefov]], an army fortress built between 1780 and 1787 by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] on the left bank of the [[Elbe]] and [[Metuje|Mettau]] rivers near [[Jaroměř]]. The two main stages are built against the fortress walls.

===Safety===
Stealing from the tents and bodies of drunk visitors is common at Brutal Assault.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Guests are advised to keep their valuables in safe places (e.g. deposit boxes provided by the festival organizers for a fee, locked inside the trunk of a car, etc.).

The festival area at Brutal Assault in Josefov is near a hill, which can be difficult to navigate. Nicknamed "the hill of death", it becomes muddy and slippery after rain.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The hill can be walked around, however, and the site is fully accessible to the handicapped.

The '''Peeks Toronto Caribbean Carnival''', formerly and still commonly called '''Caribana''', is a festival of [[Caribbean]] culture and traditions held each summer in the city of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It is a Caribbean [[Carnival]] event, that has been billed as [[North America]]'s largest street festival,&lt;ref&gt;[https://rove.me/to/toronto/toronto-caribbean-carnival-or-caribana Toronto Caribbean Carnival or Caribana]&lt;/ref&gt; frequented by over 1.3 million visitors each year for the festival's final parade and an overall attendance of 2 million.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32391351|title=Caribana, the greatest celebration|last=1954-|first=Foster, Cecil,|date=1995|publisher=Ballantine Books|others=Schwarz, Chris, 1948–2007.|isbn=0345398165|edition=Souvenir|location=Toronto|oclc=32391351}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire event, which is one of the first [[Caribbean Carnival]]s along with those in [[Labor Day Carnival|New York City]], [[Notting Hill Carnival|Notting Hill]] and [[Boston]] to be held outside of the Caribbean region, brings in over one million people to Toronto and over $400 million into Ontario's economy, annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/article/803506|title=The Caribana success story|last=|first=|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural significance ==
The festival was introduced to Canada by immigrants from the [[Caribbean]]. It follows a Carnival format, particularly following the [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]], but also influenced by the street dancing and masquerading in costume found on every Caribbean island such as [[John Canoe]] in Jamaica, [[Crop Over]] in Barbados, and other similar festivals in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The Carnival participants say that this event is very important for preserving and expressing their Caribbean identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/society/why-torontos-caribbean-carnival-is-still-important-50-years-later/|title=Why Toronto's Caribbean Carnival is still important 50 years later|publisher=Maclean's|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonality between these cultural events is a cultural legacy that is born out of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spacing.ca/toronto/2017/07/31/caribana-meaning-ordered-chaos/|title=Caribana and the meaning of ordered chaos - Spacing Toronto|date=2017-07-31|work=Spacing Toronto|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caribana also taps into the legacy of the [[Canadian Negro Women's Organization]]'s pre-Lenten Calypso Carnival celebrations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.library.yorku.ca/exhibits/show/pushingbuttons/black--caribbean-community/caribana-buttons|title=York University Libraries {{!}} Clara Thomas Archives &amp; Special Collections online exhibits {{!}} Caribana buttons · The Jean Augustine Political Button Collection|website=archives.library.yorku.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the centuries-long [[Black Canadians|Black Canadian]] tradition of [[Emancipation Day]] parades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Celebrations such as Calypso Carnivals and the Emancipation parades made a lot of room for Caribbean to exist as such a large observance of black Canadian pride. Canada’s Carnival traditions owe a lot to Canadian Negro Women’s Association, or CANEWA, who were one of the first groups to make space for the commemoration of black history within Ontario. Although a majority of the members did not have Caribbean roots, from 1952-1964 CANEWA produced, funded, and hosted annual one-day celebrations of Caribbean culture through food, dance, and music called the Calypso Carnivals. These carnivals began as fundraisers for scholarships in order for black students to attend recently desegregated schools in southern Ontario. Emancipation Day Parades began to celebrate the liberation of slaves throughout the Americas and were largely observed around the same time as the Calypso Carnivals. The founders of this parade were largely decadents of fugitive slaves and other black American immigrants. The parades were marked as a black victory over the British and operated as a military-style event, displaying military regalia, marching bands, and drum corps. Emancipation Day Parades became the most notable displays by and for Black Canadians prior to Caribana.&lt;ref&gt; Phillip, Lyndon. “Reading Caribana 1997: Black Youth, Puff Daddy, Style, and Diaspora Transformations” 2007. &lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in July, the multi-week festivities lead up to the parade which occurs over the long weekend in August which is also known as [[Emancipation Day]], August 1, 1834, in Toronto and [[Simcoe Day]] in Ontario, in honour of [[John Graves Simcoe]], the first Lieutenant-Governor of [[Upper Canada]] who is credited with signing "An Act to Prevent the Further Introduction of Slaves, and to Limit the Terms of Contracts for Servitude Within This Province" (1793).

==Events==
Several events occur over the course of the festivities celebrating Caribbean culture. The main stakeholders of the events are the [[Toronto Mas' Bands Association]], the [[Organization of Calypso Performing Artists]], and the [[Ontario Steelpan Association]].

While the Parade of Bands is the most-well known festivities, events include tastes of Caribbean life including exhibits, such as the first Caribana which displayed every book published by a Caribbean writer, including [[Austin Clarke (novelist)|Austin Clarke]] who was the centrepiece of the exhibition; theatre plays, such as Austin Clarke's "Children of the Scheme", which dealt with the plight of Caribbean women who came to Canada on the domestic immigrant worker scheme; and fashion shows.

'''Parade of Bands'''&lt;br /&gt;
While the Caribbean Festival holds events over several weeks, the culmination of the Caribana event is the final weekend which is punctuated by the street Parade of Bands. This weekend traditionally coincides with the [[civic holiday]] in August. The street Parade of Bands consists of costumed dancers (called "Mas players") along with live [[Caribbean music]] being played from large speakers on the flat-bed of 18 wheeler trucks. Much of the music associated with the event, such as [[steel pan]], [[Soca music|soca]] and [[Calypso music|calypso]], but you can also find floats which play [[Chutney music|chutney]], [[dancehall]] and [[reggae]].

Band leaders start preparation for the following year, the day after the parade ends. As of 2017, [[Whitfield Belasco]] has led a band since his brother recruited him from the Trinidad Carnival to help organize the first Caribana in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/caribana-caribbean-festival-carnival-funding-toronto-1.4136632|title=50 years later, the beat goes on for the city's Caribbean festival {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bands are the most important part of the main Carnival parade. The bands are actually in competition with one another during the parade. They must pass a judging spot which will rate each band section for its costume design, the energy of masqueraders, the creativity of presentation and so on. Work on the costumes begin soon after the previous year's celebration and usually takes one full year to complete all of the costumes. Bands typically dances to calypso, soca, [[reggae]], [[jazz]], and [[dancehall]]. A King and Queen of the Band is also judged, and winning is considered claiming the biggest prize of the festival.

In the 1970s, the parade route originally followed Bloor and Yonge Streets ending at Toronto City Hall concluding with a concert at Nathan Phillips Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacing.ca/toronto/2017/07/31/caribana-meaning-ordered-chaos/ |title=COMMUNITYComments3 Caribana and the meaning of ordered chaos |publisher=Spacing Toronto |accessdate=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the parade ran along Bay and University Avenue. Since 1991, when the parade shifted to Lake Shore Boulevard into Exhibition Place, barricades were introduced to separate the spectators from those [[playing mas]].

'''King and Queen Show'''&lt;br /&gt;
The night before the grande para, all the kings and queens (leaders) of the bands compete on stage to be named King and Queen of Carnival.

'''Calypso Monarch '''&lt;br /&gt;
An event where the Calypso Monarch is crowned.

'''Junior Carnival'''&lt;br /&gt;
The junior carnival (commonly known as Kiddie Carnival) has run since, at least, the 1990s and provides an opportunity for young masquerades to dance through the streets. Similar to the grand parade, the junior carnival consists of a series of bands with leaders who display costumes in competition.

'''J'ouvert'''&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the main parade, the Caribbean community also celebrates a smaller pre-dawn parade known as [[J'ouvert]] (Pronounced "Jou-vay"). This too has been modelled after and taken from [[Trinidad Carnival]]. In Caribbean French-creole this means "day open" or morning. The J'ouvert portion of Carnival is the more rhythmic part of the Carnival celebration and is usually featured with steelpan bands, and persons using improvised musical instruments. It is not usually accompanied by any singing but will have a lot of whistles and other music makers. Spectators and or persons "playing Mas" will occasionally get themselves covered from head-to-toe with mud, flour, baby powder, or different water-colored paints in the tradition of the Caribbean-based J'ouvert celebrations. In many instances, everyone in the band is supposed to resemble evil spirits while parading around at night. There are some common characters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visittnt.com/todo/events/Carnival/old_time/default.html |title=Old-Time Carnival Characters (ARCHIVE) |publisher=Trinidad Investment and Development Co.

'''Fêtes'''&lt;br /&gt;
Leading up to the main parade a number of Caribbean music artists perform in Toronto. These parties are generally called "[[fête]]s", for a French-Creole Caribbean word meaning "festival", and usually start in June–July.

'''Picnics'''&lt;br /&gt;
Originally taking place on the [[Toronto Islands]], the island picnics now occur at [[Ontario Place]]. Picnics are two days of feasting on [[roti]]s, [[jerk chicken]] and [[festival]], [[callaloo]], goat head soup, [[potato pudding]], [[pelau]], fried fish, cow foot, [[rum cakes]]; drinking sorrell, Mauby, and [[ginger beer]]; and dancing to music.

'''Talk tents'''&lt;br /&gt;
Talk tents contain shows featuring storytellers, comedians and others well versed in oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/caribana-emc/|title=Toronto Caribbean Carnival (Caribana)|first=Annemarie|last=Gallaugher|date=|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gala'''&lt;br /&gt;
The gala, debuted in 2008, is an evening of elegance celebrating Carnival music, arts, and the works of the pioneers of the Caribana festival.

==History==
[[File:Scotiabank Toronto Caribbean Carnival.jpg|thumb|right|Scotiabank Toronto Caribbean Carnival logo 2011-2015]]
{{Main|History of Caribana (1967–71)}}

Caribana has been run annually since 1967, first performed as a gift from Canada's Caribbean community, as a tribute to [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's Centennial]]. Billing itself as a multicultural nation, the Canadian government invited ethno-cultural groups to contribute celebrations with representations of their ethnic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Peter|date=|title=The politics of the streets: a geography of Caribana|url=|journal=Political Geography|volume=11|issue=2|pages=130–151|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Caribana was invented by the organizers to capture the notions of Canada, the Caribbean, bacchanal and merrymaking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Caribana emerged during a time when many Caribbean residents emigrated to Canada following immigration reform, internationally acclaimed singers, such as [[Harry Belafonte]], was popularizing Caribbean music (in fact, Harry Belafonte sang to a sold out crowd at the [[O'Keefe Centre]] in Toronto), [[Civil Rights Movement]] activities such as [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], visited Canadian audiences, and [[Muhammad Ali]] fought against the Canadian heavyweight champion [[George Chuvalo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The main Caribana events were run by a [[nonprofit]] Toronto-based organization, the Caribbean Cultural Committee (CCC), its board members mostly made up of expatriate-Caribbean nationals living in Canada. [[Charles Roach]] and [[Julius Iaasc]] (the first Black judge of the Federal Court of Appeal) were among the community leaders who organized the first Caribana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As the festival became a permanent annual event, the festival organization became dependent on borrowing money from the City of Toronto prior to the festival, to be repaid out of festival profits afterwards. By 1992, the festival had built up a significant debt to the City. To aid the festival, the City of Toronto forgave the outstanding debt after the 1992 event.&lt;ref name=biggerprofit&gt;{{cite news|last=Small|first=Peter|title=Caribana expecting bigger profit|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=August 11, 1992|author2=Jane Armstrong|location=Toronto ON|page=A06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Caribana developed a new partnership with Toronto-area hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henton|first=Darcy|title=Tourism faces new economy|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=May 1, 1993|location=Toronto ON|page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the organization fired its operating chief.&lt;ref name=opchief&gt;{{cite news|title=Caribana fires operating chief|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=May 21, 1993|location=Toronto ON|page=A07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At launch in [[Nathan Phillips Square]], Premier [[Bob Rae]] calls the event a "beacon of hope" for all Canadians, as a symbol of racial harmony. "Carry a Can to Caribana" launched, in support of [[Daily Bread Food Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Lisa|title=Caribana bumps and grinds|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 20, 1993|location=Toronto ON|page=A06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1993, the Caribana Marketplace covered market was added at [[Marilyn Bell|Marilyn Bell Park]] along the parade route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnbull|first=Barbara|title=Party time!|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 30, 1993|location=Toronto ON|page=A06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-behaved crowd and barricades along the entire parade route contributed to an incident-free parade.&lt;ref name=soakup1993&gt;{{cite news|title=A million revellers soak up Caribbean beat|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=August 1, 1993|location=Toronto ON|page=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With attendance down, the board chair blamed the federal and provincial tourism ministries for not funding their American advertising campaign.&lt;ref name=grumblesandraves&gt;{{cite news|last=MacKinnon|first=Donna Jean|title=Caribana draws grumbles and rave reviews|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=August 5, 1993|location=Toronto ON|page=A06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, after the 37th festival, the [[consul general]] of Trinidad and Tobago pledged to work more closely with Caribbean Cultural Committee to get support for the carnival from the business community; the committee received around {{CAD|1 million}} that year from the national, provincial, and city governments, but it cost about twice that to run the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle-Marshall, William,
 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231823/http://www.guardian.co.tt/archives/2004-09-15/bussguardian6.html "The festival for all – Envoy targets Board of Trade to boost Caribana"], ''The Trinidad Guardian'', September 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Caribbean Cultural Committee ran into financial troubles again. Because of a lack of financial accountability, the [[City of Toronto]] cut off funding until the organization could get its finances in order. Instead, the funding was given to the Toronto Mas Band Association which had organized the festival in 2002. Due to an ongoing dispute about the ownership of the trademark "Caribana", the 2006 festival was promoted as "the Toronto Caribbean Carnival (Caribana)".

In May 2010, the festival added a new initiative to involve post-secondary schools. The only college to participate was [[Centennial College]] School of Hospitality, Tourism and Culture, where they created a costume theme of the Tropical Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Centennial College |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2010/27/c6887.html |title=Centennial College students getting into the Caribana spirit |publisher=Newswire.ca |date=July 27, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2010, new management took over the Festival Management Committee (FMC) and named Denise Herrera-Jackson as CEO/Chair of FMC and Chris Alexander as CAO.

A naming dispute arose over the use of "Caribana." The Caribbean Cultural Committee claimed that it legally held the [[trademark]] for "Caribana". In April 2010, a panel for the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) ruled that Scotiabank, as the sponsors of the Caribana festival, did not have grounds for being awarded the domain name caribana.com from its current owners the Working Word Co-operative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scotiabank fails in bid to snag Caribana domain name |author= |first=Omar |last=El Akkad |authorlink= |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/scotiabank-fails-in-bid-to-snag-caribana-domain-name/article1546808/ |agency= |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=April 26, 2010 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=May 9, 2010 |language= |trans-title=|quote=Scotiabank's unsuccessful attempt to gain control of the potentially lucrative website name became the basis for a case before the global tribunal that resolves such domain name disputes – a case that lawyers say could have set a wide-ranging and controversial precedent. |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Ontario Superior Court Of Justice ruled that the Caribana Arts Group (CAG), the successors of Caribbean Cultural Committee (CCC), has legal rights to the name Caribana. On May 25, 2011, the festival released its new logo and new name, "Scotiabank Caribbean Carnival Toronto".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708080734/http://caribflyer.com/carib/it%E2%80%99s-no-longer-caribana-festival-unveils-its-new-name/ "It’s no longer Caribana: Festival unveils its new name"], Carib101.com, May 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Scotiabank announced that it would end its sponsorship with Toronto's Caribbean Carnival parade after six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/scotiabank-won-t-renew-sponsorship-of-caribbean-carnival-1.2610963 |title=Scotiabank won't renew sponsorship of Caribbean Carnival |work=CTV News |date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival continued without a naming sponsor until 2017 when Peeks became the new title sponsor and the festival became the Peeks Toronto Caribbean Carnival.&lt;ref name="ontariosciencecentre.ca"&gt;[https://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca/Media/Details/449/ "Peeks Toronto Caribbean Carnival 2017"], News Release, Ontario Science Centre, June 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incidents'''&lt;br /&gt;
Incidents have sometimes occurred at the festival, though organizers have long disassociated themselves from the violence. Said [[Lennox Farrell]] in 1992: "We as a board abhor any kind of violence whatsoever. If violence occurs outside a [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]] game, it is not ever associated with the Blue Jays game. We wonder why in the mind of the press... that shooting has become associated with Caribana."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brent|first=Bob|title=Organizers fear violence might thwart '93 Caribana|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/456460111.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+04%2C+1992&amp;author=Bob+Brent+Toronto+Star&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Organizers+fear+violence+might+thwart+'93+Caribana&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=July 31, 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=August 4, 1992|location=Toronto ON|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carnival blocks''', '''carnaval blocos''' or '''blocos de rua''' are street bands that mobilize crowds on the streets and are the main popular expression of [[Brazilian Carnival]]. These parades fall under the term "street carnival", and happen during a period of about one month, beginning before and finishing after Carnival. Carnaval blocos usually perform [[samba]] music all around Brazil, but other popular musical styles (also identified with Carnaval) are present in specific regions, including [[frevo]] and [[maracatu]] in [[Pernambuco]] and [[axé]] in [[Bahia]].

==In Rio de Janeiro==
Street carnival blocos have become a mainstay of Rio's Carnival, and today, there are several hundred blocos. Block parades start in January, and may last until the Sunday after Carnival. Carnaval Blocos are found throughout Rio de Janeiro. One of the largest and oldest blocos is the Cordão do Bola Preta, based in downtown Rio. Other large groups include [[Banda de Ipanema]] and [[Monobloco]].

==In Recife and Olinda==
[[File:Bonecos de Olinda - Pernambuco, Brasil.jpg|thumb|Giants dolls of Olinda, Pernambuco]]

In [[Recife]], the carnival block [[Galo da Madrugada]] was registered in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the biggest carnival parade in the world. In its 2013 parade, the crowd following the bloco was larger than 2,500,000 people&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,galo-da-madrugada-publico-estimado-de-2-5-milhoes,995344&lt;/ref&gt;).

Besides [[Galo da Madrugada]], thousands of others carnival blocks with sizes ranging from few hundred to millions of people, perform in the streets of [[Recife]] and [[Olinda]] including As Virgens de Olinda, Eu Acho É Pouco, Batutas de São José, Lenhadores, Pitombeiras, Segura o Talo, Bloco da Saudade, Enquanto Isso Na Sala de Justiça and Homem da Meia-Noite.

The '''Chimney Fire''' was a [[wildfire]] in the [[Santa Lucia Range]], within [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=cdf/&gt; The fire temporarily closed [[Hearst Castle]] to tourists and also forced the closure of [[California State Route 1|Highway 1]] along the scenic [[Big Sur]] coast for a time. By the time the fire was contained on September 6, 2016 it had burned {{Convert| 46,344 |acre|km2|0}} acres of land.&lt;ref name=cdf/&gt;

==Events==
The fire was first reported Saturday August 13 shortly after 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=cdf/&gt; Evacuations were ordered in the area of Running Deer Ranch, located on the south side of [[Lake Nacimiento]].&lt;ref name="Nooz1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Lindsey|title=Wildfire Chars 1,450 Acres Near Lake Nacimiento in San Luis Obispo County|url=https://www.noozhawk.com/article/wildfire_chars_hundreds_of_acres_near_lake_nacimiento_in_san_luis_obispo_co|accessdate=15 August 2016|agency=[[Noozhawk]]|date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At {{convert|17,000 |acre|km2}} on Saturday afternoon with 35% containment, the fire was within {{convert|2|miles}} of [[Hearst Castle]].

As of August 31, the fire had burned {{Convert|46,344| acre|km2}}  and was 85% contained. All evacuation orders and road closures have been lifted. The firefighting effort is starting  to wind down, although copious smoke is still evident on windy days, and the fire is still uncontrolled towards the northwest. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/1389 Cal Fire status report, 8/31/2016] &lt;/ref&gt;

* [[ethnic conflict]]s, attributed to actors primarily divided by cultural, ethnic, or religious communities and identities, such as instances of [[Religious violence in Nigeria|religious violence between Christian and Muslim communities]]
* herder-farmer conflicts, typically involving disputes over land and/or cattle between herders (in particular the [[Fula people|Fulani]] or [[Hausa people|Hausa]]) and farmers (in particular the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] or [[Tarok people|Tarok]])

==Herder-farmer conflicts==
{{main|Herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria}}
Since the Fourth Nigerian Republic’s founding in 1999, farmer-herder violence has killed thousands of people and displaced tens of thousands more. Insecurity and violence have led many populations to create self-defence forces and ethnic militias, which have engaged in further violence. The majority of farmer-herder clashes have occurred between Muslim [[Fulani herdsmen]] and Christian peasants, exacerbating ethnoreligious hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farmer-Herder Clashes Amplify Challenge for Beleaguered Nigerian Security|url=http://theglobalobservatory.org/2015/07/farmer-herder-nigeria-buhari-abuja-fulani/|publisher=IPI Global Observatory|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16380">'''Cyber-collection''' refers to the use of [[cyber-warfare]] techniques in order to conduct [[espionage]].  Cyber-collection activities typically rely on the insertion of [[malware]] into a targeted network or computer in order to scan for, collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

Cyber-collection started as far back as 1996, when widespread deployment of [[Internet connectivity]] to government and corporate systems gained momentum.  Since that time, there have been numerous cases of such activity.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;Pete Warren, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/30/state-sponsored-cyber-espionage-prevalent State-sponsored cyber espionage projects now prevalent, say experts]'', The Guardian, August 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesfin"&gt;Nicole Perlroth, ''[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/elusive-finspy-spyware-pops-up-in-10-countries/ Elusive FinSpy Spyware Pops Up in 10 Countries]'', New York Times, August 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AolTech"&gt;Kevin G.

In addition to the state sponsored examples, cyber-collection has also been used by organized crime for identity and e-banking theft and by corporate spies.  [[Operation High Roller]] used cyber-collection agents in order to collect PC and smart-phone information that was used to electronically raid bank accounts.&lt;ref name="HighRoller"&gt;Rachael King, ''[https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2012/06/26/operation-high-roller-targets-corporate-bank-accounts/ Operation High Roller Targets Corporate Bank Accounts]'', June 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rocra]], aka Red October, collection system is an "espionage for hire" operation by organized criminals who sell the collected information to the highest bidder.&lt;ref name="CrunchOctober"&gt;Frederic Lardinois, ''[https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/21/eugene-kaspersky-and-mikko-hypponen-talk-red-october-and-the-future-of-cyber-warfare-at-dld/ Eugene Kaspersky And Mikko Hypponen Talk Red October And The Future Of Cyber Warfare At DLD]'', TechCrunch, January 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SundayOctober"&gt;Mark Prigg, ''[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2263322/Operation-Red-October-revealed-The-astonishing-hacker-attack-infiltrated-55-000-high-level-government-computers.html The hunt for Red October: The astonishing hacking ring that has infiltrated over 1,000 high level government computers around the world]'', Daily Mail, January 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms and functionality==
Cyber-collection tools have been developed by governments and private interests for nearly every computer and smart-phone operating system.  Tools are known to exist for Microsoft, Apple, and Linux computers and iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows phones.&lt;ref name="BloomFinFisher"&gt;Vernon Silver, ''[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-29/spyware-matching-finfisher-can-take-over-iphone-and-blackberry.html Spyware Matching FinFisher Can Take Over IPhones]'',, Bloomberg, August 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Major manufacturers of [[Commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) cyber collection technology include Gamma Group from the UK&lt;ref name="finfisher"&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120731073430/http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/index.php FinFisher IT Intrusion]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hacking Team]] from Italy.&lt;ref name="hackingteam"&gt;[http://www.hackingteam.it/index.php/remote-control-system Hacking Team, Remote Control System]&lt;/ref&gt; Bespoke cyber-collection tool companies, many offering COTS packages of [[Zero-day attack|zero-day]] exploits, include [[Endgame, Inc.]] and Netragard of the United States and Vupen from France.&lt;ref name="iw"&gt;Mathew J. Schwartz, ''[https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/weaponized-bugs-time-for-digital-arms-co/240008564 Weaponized Bugs: Time For Digital Arms Control]'', Information Week, 9 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  State intelligence agencies often have their own teams to develop cyber-collection tools, such as [[Stuxnet]], but require a constant source of ''zero-day exploits'' in order to insert their tools into newly targeted systems.  Specific technical details of these attack methods often sells for six figure sums.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Ryan Gallagher, ''[http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html Cyberwar’s Gray Market]'', Slate, 16 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Common functionality of cyber-collection systems include:
*''Data scan'': local and network storage are scanned to find and copy files of interest, these are often documents, spreadsheets, design files such as Autocad files and system files such as the passwd file.
*''Capture location'': GPS, WiFi, network information and other attached sensors are used to determine the location and movement of the infiltrated device
*''[[Covert listening device|Bug]]'': the device microphone can be activated in order to record audio.  Likewise, audio streams intended for the local speakers can be intercepted at the device level and recorded.
* ''Hidden Private Networks'' that bypass the corporate network security.  A compute that is being spied upon can be plugged into a legitimate corporate network that is heavy monitored for malware activity and at same time belongs to a private wifi network outside of the company network that is leaking confidential information off of an employee's computer.  A computer like this is easily set up by a double-agent working in the IT department by install a second Wireless card in a computer and special software to remotely monitor an employee's computer through this second interface card without them being aware of a side-band communication channel pulling information off of his computer.
*''Camera'': the device cameras can be activated in order to covertly capture images or video.   
*''[[Keylogger]] and Mouse Logger'': the malware agent can capture each keystroke, mouse movement and click that the target user makes.  Combined with screen grabs, this can be used to obtain passwords that are entered using a virtual on-screen keyboard.
*''Screen Grabber'': the malware agent can take periodic screen capture images.  In addition to showing sensitive information that may not be stored on the machine, such as e-banking balances and encrypted web mail, these can be used in combination with the key and mouse logger data to determine access credentials for other Internet resources. 
*''Encryption'': Collected data is usually encrypted at the time of capture and may be transmitted live or stored for later exfiltration.  Likewise, it is common practice for each specific operation to use specific encryption and poly-morphic capabilities of the cyber-collection agent in order to ensure that detection in one location will not compromise others.
*''Bypass Encryption'': Because the malware agent operates on the target system with all the access and rights of the user account of the target or system administrator, encryption is bypassed.  For example, interception of audio using the microphone and audio output devices enables the malware to capture to both sides of an encrypted Skype call.&lt;ref name="Milan"&gt;Daniele Milan, [http://www.comm.rtaf.mi.th/Sitedirectory/124/3148/3148_2_6-Daniele-Milan.pdf The Data Encryption Problem], Hacking Team&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Exfiltration'': Cyber-collection agents usually exfiltrate the captured data in a discrete manner, often waiting for high web traffic and disguising the transmission as secure web browsing.  [[USB flash drive]]s have been used to exfiltrate information from [[Air gap (networking)|air gap]] protected systems.  Exfiltration systems often involve the use of reverse proxy systems that anonymize the receiver of the data.&lt;ref name="FlameUSB"&gt;Robert Lemos, ''[https://www.infoworld.com/t/malware/flame-stashes-secrets-in-usb-drives-195455 Flame stashes secrets in USB drives]'', InfoWorld, June 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Replicate'': Agents may replicate themselves onto other media or systems, for example an agent may infect files on a writable network share or install themselves onto USB drives in order to infect computers protected by an [[Air gap (networking)|air gap]] or otherwise not on the same network.
*''Manipulate Files and File Maintenance'': Malware can be used to erase traces of itself from log files.  It can also download and install modules or updates as well as data files.  This function may also be used to place "evidence" on the target system, e.g. to insert child pornography onto the computer of a politician or to manipulate votes on an electronic vote counting machine.
*''Combination Rules'': Some agents are very complex and are able to combine the above features in order to provide very targeted intelligence collection capabilities.  For example, the use of GPS bounding boxes and microphone activity can be used to turn a smart phone into a smart bug that intercepts conversations only within the office of a target.
*''Compromised cellphones''. Since, modern cellphones are increasingly similar to general purpose computer, these cellphones are vulnerable to the same cyber-collect attacks as computer systems, and are vulnerable to leak extremely sensitive conversational and location information to an attackers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elgj2ZFMZDE how to spy on a cell phone without having access]&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaking of cellphone GPS location and conversational information to an attacker has been reported in a number of recent [[cyber stalking]] cases where the attacker was able to use the victim's GPS location to call nearby businesses and police authorities to make false allegations against the victim depending on his location, this can range from telling the restaurant staff information to tease the victim, or making false witness against the victim.  For instance if the victim were parked in large parking lot the attackers may call and state that they saw drug or violence activity going on with a description of the victim and directions to their GPS location.

==Infiltration==
There are several common ways to infect or access the target:
*An ''[[Injection Proxy]]'' is a system that is placed upstream from the target individual or company, usually at the Internet service provider, that injects malware into the targets system.  For example, an innocent download made by the user can be injected with the malware executable on the fly so that the target system then is accessible to the government agents.&lt;ref name="Gloor"&gt;Pascal Gloor, ''[http://www.swinog.ch/meetings/swinog25/p/02_(Un)Lawful%20Intercept%202012-11-07%20SwiNOG25.pdf (Un)lawful Interception] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205065155/http://www.swinog.ch/meetings/swinog25/p/02_%28Un%29Lawful%20Intercept%202012-11-07%20SwiNOG25.pdf |date=2016-02-05 }}'', SwiNOG #25, 07 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Phishing|Spear Phishing]]'': A carefully crafted e-mail is sent to the target in order to entice them to install the malware via a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] document or a [[Drive-by download|drive by attack]] hosted on a web server compromised or controlled by the malware owner.&lt;ref name="SpearTechWeb"&gt;Mathew J. Schwartz, ''[https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/operation-red-october-attackers-wielded/240146621 Operation Red October Attackers Wielded Spear Phishing]'', Information Week, January 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Black bag operation|Surreptitious Entry]]'' may be used to infect a system.  In other words, the spies carefully break into the target's residence or office and install the malware on the target's system.&lt;ref name="blackbagfbi"&gt;FBI Records: The Vault, ''[http://vault.fbi.gov/Surreptitious%20Entries%20%28Black%20Bag%20Jobs%29%20/ Surreptitious Entries]'', Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/ref&gt;
*An ''Upstream monitor'' or ''[[Packet analyzer|sniffer]]'' is a device that can intercept and view the data transmitted by a target system.  Usually this device is placed at the Internet service provider.  The [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] system developed by the U.S. [[FBI]] is a famous example of this type of system.  Based on the same logic as a [[Lawful Interception|telephone intercept]], this type of system is of limited use today due to the widespread use of encryption during data transmission.  
*A ''wireless infiltration'' system can be used in proximity of the target when the target is using wireless technology.  This is usually a laptop based system that impersonates a WiFi or 3G base station to capture the target systems and relay requests upstream to the Internet. Once the target systems are on the  network, the system then functions as an ''Injection Proxy'' or as an ''Upstream Monitor'' in order to infiltrate or monitor the target system.
*A ''[[USB flash drive|USB Key]]'' preloaded with the malware infector may be given to or dropped at the target site.

Cyber-collection agents are usually installed by payload delivery software constructed using [[0-day attack|zero-day]] attacks and delivered via infected USB drives, e-mail attachments or malicious web sites.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Zetter, ''[http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/29/tech/web/iran-spyware-flame/index.html "Flame" spyware infiltrating Iranian computers]'', CNN - Wired, May 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DutchUSB"&gt;Anne Belle de Bruijn, ''[http://www.elsevier.nl/Tech/nieuws/2012/7/Cybercriminelen-doen-poging-tot-spionage-bij-DSM-ELSEVIER343610W/ Cybercriminelen doen poging tot spionage bij DSM]'', Elsevier, July 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  State sponsored cyber-collections efforts have used official operating system certificates in place of relying on security vulnerabilities.  In the Flame operation, [[Microsoft]] states that the Microsoft certificate used to impersonate a [[Windows Update]] was forged;&lt;ref name="MSCertForged"&gt;Mike Lennon, ''[https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-unauthorized-certificate-was-used-sign-flame-malware Microsoft Certificate Was Used to Sign "Flame" Malware] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307131239/http://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-unauthorized-certificate-was-used-sign-flame-malware |date=2013-03-07 }}'', June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; however, some experts believe that it may have been acquired through [[HUMINT]] efforts.&lt;ref name="MSCertStolen"&gt;Paul Wagenseil, ''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47675971/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/flame-malware-uses-stolen-microsoft-digital-signature/ Flame Malware Uses Stolen Microsoft Digital Signature]'', NBC News, June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eqtesad-e Golestan''''' (اقتصاد گلستان lit. "Golestan Economics") is an [[Independent business|independent]] [[socio-economic]] [[Persian language]] weekly [[newspaper|paper]] published in Gorgan, [[Golestan Province|Golestan]], [[Iran]]. The first issue appeared on the newsstands throughout Golestan province and especially in the capital, Gorgan city, on 18 February 2005.

This is the fourteenth regular newspaper or magazine to be published in the province since 1996.

[[Moosa Jorjani]], a Sunni Muslim of the Iranian Turkomen ethnic minority origin, is its license holder and official director, and [[Abdonnasser Mohaimeni]], an Iranian Shii Muslim of Persian origin is its editor-in-chief and executive manager. At 22,500 copies for each issue, the newspaper has the largest circulation recorded in the history of local newspapers in North Iran.

''Eqtesad-e Golestan'' is usually published in eight (and sometimes twelve) pages, with the first and last pages being in full color. The size of each page is 35&amp;nbsp;cm by 50&amp;nbsp;cm.

At present, the newspaper is in no way a specialised one, but rather a general [[socio-cultural]] and economic weekly covering news, articles, commentaries and [[advertising|advertisement]]s related to local, national and international matters.

The '''Eurovision Young Dancers 1987''' was the second edition of the [[Eurovision Young Dancers]], held at the [[Schlosstheater Schwetzingen]], [[Germany]] on 31 May 1987.&lt;ref name=Show&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Young Dancers 1987: About the show|url=http://www.youngdancers.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1763#About|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and host broadcaster [[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen]] (ZDF), dancers from fourteen countries participated in the televised final. {{Esccnty|Austria|Dancers}}, {{Esccnty|Canada|Dancers}}, {{Esccnty|Denmark|Dancers}} and {{Esccnty|Yugoslavia|Dancers}} made their début at the contest, while {{Esccnty|Belgium|Dancers}} and {{Esccnty|Netherlands|Dancers}} competed together with a joint entry.&lt;ref name=Show/&gt;

For the first time ever, the Canadian broadcaster [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] (EBU Associate Member) joined the show with its participant. The participant countries could send one or two dancers, male or female, that could not be older than 20. Each entry consisted in one or two dances with no rules or limitations regarding the style. The dances could not be longer than 5 minutes (for soloists) or 10 minutes (for couples).&lt;ref name=Show/&gt;

Rose Gad Poulsen and [[Nikolaj Hübbe]] of Denmark won the contest, with Switzerland and West Germany placing second and third respectively.&lt;ref name=Results&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Young Dancers 1987: Participants|url=http://www.youngdancers.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1763#Participants|website=youngdancers.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
{{details|topic=the host venue|Schlosstheater Schwetzingen}}
[[File:Schlossgarten Schwetzingen 008.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Schlosstheater Schwetzingen]]
Schlosstheater Schwetzingen (Schwetzingen palace theater), a court theater in [[Schwetzingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany was the host venue for the 1987 edition of the Eurovision Young Dancers.&lt;ref name=Show/&gt;

The historic building, opened in 1753, is part of [[Schwetzingen Castle|Schloss Schwetzingen]] and since 1952 the principal venue of the [[Schwetzingen Festival]]. It is also called ''Hoftheater'' (court theater), ''Hofoper'' (court opera), and ''Comoedienhaus'' (comedy house). The frequently applied name ''Rokokotheater'' (Rococo theater) is misleading, because it shows also [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] elements, added in 1762.

==Format==
The format consists of dancers who are non-[[professional]] and between the ages of 16–21, competing in a performance of dance routines of their choice, which they have prepared in advance of the competition. All of the acts then take part in a choreographed [[group dance]] during 'Young Dancers Week'.&lt;ref name="EYD Format"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Young Dancers - Format|url=http://www.youngdancers.tv/page/pilsen-2015/about/format|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211202304/http://www.youngdancers.tv/page/pilsen-2015/about/format|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 February 2015|website=youngdancers.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jury|Jury members]] of a professional aspect and representing the elements of [[ballet]], [[Contemporary dance|contemporary]], and [[Modern dance|modern]] dancing styles, score each of the competing individual and group dance routines. Once all the jury votes have been counted, the two participants which received the highest total of points progress to a final round. The final round consists of a 90-second 'dual', were each of the finalists perform a 45-second random dance-off routine. The overall winner upon completion of the final dances is chosen by the professional jury members.&lt;ref name="EYD Format"/&gt;

==Results==
===Final===
Awards were given to the top three countries. The table below highlights these using ''gold, silver, and bronze''. The placing results of the remaining participants is unknown and never made public by the European Broadcasting Union.&lt;ref name=Results/&gt;

'''The Gradients of Agreement Scale''' was developed in 1987 by [[Sam Kaner]], [[Duane Berger]], and the staff of [[Community At Work]].

It enables members of a group to express their support for a proposal in degrees, along a continuum. Using this tool, group members are no longer trapped into expressing support in terms of "yes" and "no."

The book "The [[Facilitator]]'s Guide to Participatory [[Decision-Making]]" has been translated into Spanish, French, Russian, Mandarin, Arabic and Swahili, and it has been used in organizations large and small throughout the world.

'''Haunted Castle''' was a [[haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attraction]] at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] amusement park in [[Jackson Township, New Jersey]]. The original Haunted House was built prior to the fall "shoulder season"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/shoulder-season |title=shoulder season |website=Dictionary.com |quote=shoulder season: a travel season between peak and off-peak seasons, especially spring and fall, when fares tend to be relatively low. |access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1978 to boost attendance and as a test for building a larger facility the following year. While it was intended that it be open only at night, the popularity of the attraction caused management to open it at the beginning of the day and keep it open until the park closed. At the end of the 1978 season, the attraction was disassembled and sent to Six Flags Over Mid America, where it would continue to run from 1979 through 1982. The old façade was torn down and Botanical Gardens took its place. A medieval-styled [[façade]] was built for the Haunted Castle on the site on which it was relocated.

On May 11, 1984, a fire destroyed the attraction, trapping and killing eight teenaged visitors. Six Flags Great Adventure and its parent company [[Six Flags]] were indicted for [[aggravated]] [[manslaughter]] and accused of [[Recklessness (psychology)|recklessly]] causing the deaths by taking inadequate precautions against a fire. In the trial, the prosecution argued that repeated warnings by safety consultants to install sprinklers or smoke or fire alarms had been ignored. The defendants denied any culpability, and contended that the fire was [[arson]] and that no amount of precautions would have saved lives. The trial jury found the defendants not guilty.

== Operation ==
The purpose of the Haunted Castle walk-through [[dark ride]] was to entertain its customers by frightening them. Exterior decorations included plastic monsters, skulls and other features meant to create a frightening atmosphere. A façade of false turrets and towers lent the illusion of height to the one-story structure, completing the look of a forbidding [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[castle]]. After crossing a [[drawbridge]] over the surrounding [[moat]], visitors entered the castle and felt their way along a {{convert|450|ft|m|sing=on}}-long convoluted path of dim corridors, occasionally being startled when employee actors dressed as mummies, vampires and other creatures jumped from hiding. Various [[Theatrical property|theatrical props]] and exhibits were in view, including coffins, ghoulish [[mannequin]]s, hanging spider webs and skeletons. Alcoves along the route were used to present vignettes of famous and infamous characters and events from movies, horror and ghost stories, and sometimes real life, with live actors portraying the stars of the scene. [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], the Wolf Man and Lizzie Borden were frequent guest stars. [[Strobe light]]s and eerie sounds completed the scene.&lt;ref name=COSTAL&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.hauntedattraction.com/33/industry.html#ind2 |first=Joe |last=Costal |title = Fire at the Haunted Castle (excerpted from ''Amusement Park Crisis Management'') |publisher = Haunted Attraction Magazine |access-date = 2006-11-18 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018013158/http://www.hauntedattraction.com/33/industry.html#ind2 |archive-date = 2006-10-18 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout of the Haunted Castle was two sets of eight semi-trailers lined up in a mirror configuration.&lt;ref name=COSTAL/&gt; A single trailer was placed in the middle of the configuration for use as a control room,&lt;ref name=NYT_19850621/&gt;&lt;ref name=floorplan/&gt; from which the lights, sounds, and other effects were managed; and for changing rooms for the young men and women who acted the parts of the monsters and ghouls present on the tour. During slow times only one side of the attraction would be used. Peak attendance would cause the park to open both sides, allowing thousands of visitors to enjoy the attraction.&lt;ref name=COSTAL/&gt; Guests would enter the Castle via the typical switchback guide rails used at amusement park which led to a gate. From there, the guests would enter through the drawbridge main portal where a doorman would direct them to the entrance of the actual walk-through&lt;ref name=floorplan/&gt;. At peak times, the doorman would alternate sides to keep a gap between groups to allow for greater effect and to keep the leaders from warning the following group of upcoming surprises.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Construction and history ==
Originally known as the Haunted House, the attraction was constructed of four aluminum [[semi-trailers]] when it opened in 1978. It was intended as a test for a more substantial attraction that was to be built the following year. The four trailers came from the Toms River Haunted House Company, owned by George Mahana, with scenes preinstalled.&lt;ref name = COSTAL/&gt; The [[lessee]] was responsible for the construction of a façade that would create the illusion of a haunted house. The park built a wooden front that resembled a white, two-story house with forest green shingles and shutters, contained by a wrought-iron fence and gates, and accentuated with stucco planters. The guide rails for the waiting lines were left over from the previous ride that had been on the site, Alpine Blitz. To help create the right mood, creepy music was played over exterior speakers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Haunted House attraction had a [[gatekeeper]] stationed outside with a doorkeeper admitting visitors, while three or four [[monster]]s inside occupied various scenes or wandered around surprising and frightening groups of visitors. The staffing requirements for the haunted house were drawn from other areas of the park; they were [[clown]]s and [[street performer]]s when they weren't acting as [[vampire]]s or [[serial killer]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

At the end of the 1978 season, the four trailers were taken away by the manufacturer and sent to Six Flags Over Mid-America (now known as [[Six Flags St. Louis]]) in Eureka, MO. There they were reassembled and would continue to run from 1979 through 1982. The site in Jackson was cleared to make way for the Botanical Gardens.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Having passed the test, the Haunted Castle was assembled on a new site in 1979, consisting of seventeen interconnected aluminum trailers leased from same manufacturer&lt;ref name=NYT_19850621&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/21/nyregion/great-adventure-s-sister-park-installed-sprinklers.html |title=GREAT ADVENTURE'S SISTER PARK INSTALLED SPRINKLERS |website=The New York Times |date=21 June 1985 |access-date=11 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143517/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/21/nyregion/great-adventure-s-sister-park-installed-sprinklers.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;—eight to a side mirroring each other—with separate corridors and a common control room in the center.&lt;ref name=floorplan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=Kathleen |year=2014 |title=The Haunted Castle Fire |url=http://www.nfpa.org/~/media/images/nfpa-journal/2014/may-june-2014/pages/haunted-castle/distribution_opt.jpeg?h=540&amp;w=400&amp;as=1&amp;iar=1&amp;la=en |volume=May June 2014 |publisher=National Fire Protection Association |pages=49-59, 85 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223131940/http://www.nfpa.org/~/media/images/nfpa-journal/2014/may-june-2014/pages/haunted-castle/distribution_opt.jpeg?h=540&amp;w=400&amp;as=1&amp;iar=1&amp;la=en |archive-date=23 December 2016 |access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19850601&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/nyregion/sprinklers-not-sought-attraction-builder-says.html |title=SPRINKLERS NOT SOUGHT, ATTRACTION BUILDER SAYS |website=The New York Times |date=1 June 1985 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143437/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/nyregion/sprinklers-not-sought-attraction-builder-says.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle's trailers were linked by [[plywood]] partitions to create a complex maze. The interiors were built of plywood walls and ceilings with wooden studs for support. The materials used on the walls included [[Polyurethane|foam rubber]], various fabrics and plastics, plywood and [[tar paper]]. Wax mannequins were used as props. Attached to its exterior were painted turrets and towers of plywood on wooden frames intended to emulate a medieval façade.&lt;ref name = COSTAL/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19850616&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/18/nyregion/official-recalls-code-violations-at-theme-park.html |title=OFFICIAL RECALLS CODE VIOLATIONS AT THEME PARK |website=The New York Times

The management of Great Adventure hadn't expected the success of the attraction and didn't pay it much attention. Despite this, the Haunted Castle became the park’s largest single-show attraction since its construction. During peak attendance times both sides of the attraction would be in use, and thousands of visitors would come to the Haunted Castle throughout the normal hours of operation. The original planning had been to treat the attraction as seasonal and disassemble the trailers and send them back at the end of the season. Because of its unexpected success, it was decided instead to extend the lease and add it to the list of permanent attractions.&lt;ref name = COSTAL/&gt;

== 1984 fire ==
The fire started at 6:35&amp;nbsp;p.m. on a Friday evening on May 11, 1984. Fanned by outside air conditioners that continued to push air up through the floor vents, it spread rapidly due to the use of flammable building materials.&lt;ref name=COSTAL/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19840513&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/13/nyregion/cause-sought-in-blaze-fatal-to-8-at-jersey-park-s-haunted-castle.html |title=CAUSE SOUGHT IN BLAZE FATAL TO 8 AT JERSEY PARK'S HAUNTED CASTLE |website=The New York Times |date=13 May 1984 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Robert D. |last=McFadden |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143507/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/13/nyregion/cause-sought-in-blaze-fatal-to-8-at-jersey-park-s-haunted-castle.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 29 people were in the attraction when the fire started. Fourteen, including four park employees, escaped. Seven were treated for [[smoke inhalation]] at an area hospital.

One witness, whose group entered the attraction three to five minutes behind the group who would fall victim to the fire, later testified that when she reached a display called the [[Quasimodo|Hunchback]], she saw flames coming from around a bend beyond the display. She thought it was part of the show, but then smelled smoke and realized the flames were real. Her group started shouting "Fire!" and ran back to the entrance, bumping into walls.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850613&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/13/nyregion/girl-tells-court-about-escaping-fun-house-fire.html |title=GIRL TELLS COURT ABOUT ESCAPING FUN HOUSE FIRE |website=The New York Times |date=13 June 1985 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143457/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/13/nyregion/girl-tells-court-about-escaping-fun-house-fire.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firefighters from eleven surrounding communities responded, and the fire was declared under control at 7:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. The park remained open during the fire, and closed at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., two hours early.&lt;ref name=COSTAL /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19840512&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/12/nyregion/8-people-killed-7-hurt-in-blaze-at-theme-park.html |title=8 PEOPLE KILLED, 7 HURT IN BLAZE AT THEME PARK |website=The New York Times |date=12 May 1984 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Douglas C. |last=McGill |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501161217/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/12/nyregion/8-people-killed-7-hurt-in-blaze-at-theme-park.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
No one realized that lives were lost until later that night. Firefighters searching one of the burnt-out trailers discovered the bodies of the eight deceased teenagers. The bodies were burnt beyond recognition and, at first, were thought to be mannequins.&lt;ref name=NYT_19840513/&gt; The  cause of death for all were determined to be smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. These eight teenage corpses were placed into white body bags to let emergency personnel differentiate real corpses from charred mannequins in the dark.

During the subsequent [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]], the Jackson Township fire inspector testified that he had never inspected the castle.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850716&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/16/nyregion/fun-house-never-inspected-town-fire-inspector-testifies.html |title=FUN HOUSE NEVER INSPECTED, TOWN FIRE INSPECTOR TESTIFIES |website=The New York Times |date=16 July 1984 |access-date=10 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143452/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/16/nyregion/fun-house-never-inspected-town-fire-inspector-testifies.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The township considered the castle a "temporary structure," even after it had been at the park for five years, based  on the fact that the trailers were still on wheels.&lt;ref name=COSTAL/&gt; The castle lacked a building permit or a certificate of occupancy, and it had no sprinklers or fire or smoke detectors despite repeated recommendations by the park's own safety consultants.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850713&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/13/nyregion/fire-safety-was-weak-at-6-flags-expert-says.html |title=FIRE SAFETY WAS WEAK AT 6 FLAGS, EXPERT SAYS |website=The New York Times |date=13 July 1985 |access-date=11 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430162810/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/13/nyregion/fire-safety-was-weak-at-6-flags-expert-says.html |archive-date=30 April 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one side of the structure, utilizing 9 of the 17 trailers, was occupied at the time of the fire.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850601/&gt;

== Investigation ==
The fire spotlighted a complex collection of local, state and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] laws. New Jersey's Department of Labor and Industries inspects the safety of rides, such as roller coasters and ferris wheels. Locally, [[Municipality|municipalities]] enforce state and local [[building code]]s governing fire safety and electrical wiring.  In turn, the state's Department of Community Affairs is responsible for ensuring that municipalities enforce the codes.  Finally, the federal [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] is responsible for monitoring employee safety. A state panel investigating the fire said that the regulatory system had failed at almost every level, and that the Haunted Castle had been in violation of a dozen state fire codes.&lt;ref name=NYT_19840519SAFETY&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/19/nyregion/park-fire-inquiry-finds-the-system-fell-short.html |title=PARK-FIRE INQUIRY FINDS THE SYSTEM FELL SHORT |website=The New York Times |date=1984-05-19 |access-date=2006-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430154910/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/19/nyregion/park-fire-inquiry-finds-the-system-fell-short.html |archive-date=30 April 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19840927&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/27/nyregion/report-in-jersey-finds-park-fire-was-avoidable.html |title=REPORT IN JERSEY FINDS PARK FIRE WAS AVOIDABLE |website=The New York Times |date=1984-09-27 |access-date=2006-11-10 |first=Alfonso A. |last=Narvaez |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143512/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/27/nyregion/report-in-jersey-finds-park-fire-was-avoidable.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel said the state's Uniform Construction Code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/dca/divisions/codes/codreg/ucc.html |title=The Uniform Construction Code (NJAC 5:23) |website=State of New Jersey: Department of Community Affairs |access-date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; required the owners to install smoke detectors and several other common safety devices before the castle opened.  A spokesman for the local volunteer fire department said it had not enforced the state requirement for smoke detectors because the township's building inspector said that the code did not apply: the inspector had determined that the castle was a temporary structure.&lt;ref name=NYT_19840519SAFETY/&gt;

Eight days after the fire, a statement by the [[Ocean County]] [[Prosecutor|Prosecutor's Office]] said a thirteen-year-old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses. The boy told the police that he had been befriended by a fourteen-year-old boy at the castle's entrance. He said the older youth, who appeared to be familiar with the castle, offered to guide him through. He said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light, and he eventually bumped into and ignited a foam-rubber wall pad. The prosecutor exonerated the older youth, who has never been identified, of any criminal wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=NYT_19840519/&gt;

== Legal proceedings ==
On September 14, 1984, a [[grand jury]] in [[Toms River, New Jersey]], [[indictment|indicted]] Six Flags Great Adventure and its parent company, Six Flags, on a charge of [[Aggravation (legal concept)|aggravated]] [[manslaughter]], for "recklessly causing the deaths under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life." The indictment also charged two park executives, the general manager at the time of the fire and his predecessor, with [[manslaughter]] for [[Recklessness (psychology)|reckless]] conduct in ignoring repeated warnings of safety violations.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850517&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/17/nyregion/amusement-park-owners-go-on-trial-for-fire-that-killed-8.html |title=AMUSEMENT PARK OWNERS GO ON TRIAL FOR FIRE THAT KILLED 8 |website=The New York Times |date=17 May 1985 |access-date=10 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501161222/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/17/nyregion/amusement-park-owners-go-on-trial-for-fire-that-killed-8.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] began in [[New Jersey Superior Court]] in Toms River on May 29, 1985. The prosecution argued that repeated warnings by safety consultants to install sprinklers or smoke alarms had been ignored. The defendants denied any culpability, and contended that the fire was [[arson]] and that no precautions would have saved lives.

The [[prosecutor|prosecution]] called as witnesses fire-prevention consultants who had inspected the castle, and who had recommended the installation of sprinklers or smoke alarms.

They also testified that a ripped "crash pad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/crash-pad |title=crash pad |website=Dictionary.com |quote=padding inside cars, tanks, or the like, for protecting passengers in the event of an accident, sudden stop, etc.  |access-date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the corridor had exposed foam rubber padding.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850612/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19850607&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/07/nyregion/haunted-castle-manager-says-he-reported-perils.html |title=HAUNTED CASTLE MANAGER SAYS HE REPORTED PERILS |website=The New York Times |date=7 June 1985 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143442/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/07/nyregion/haunted-castle-manager-says-he-reported-perils.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19850604&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/04/nyregion/3-ex-park-aides-say-safety-pleas-went-unheeded.html |title=3 EX-PARK AIDES SAY SAFETY PLEAS WENT UNHEEDED |website=The New York Times |date=4 June 1985 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430154905/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/04/nyregion/3-ex-park-aides-say-safety-pleas-went-unheeded.html |archive-date=30 April 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boy who had come forward as a witness during the initial investigation repeated what he had told investigators earlier, testifying for the prosecution that he had seen another boy his age—a boy he did not know—accidentally set the fire with a cigarette lighter by brushing its flame against a foam wall pad. According to news reports of the trial, no such boy was ever found, and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy. Under [[cross-examination]] by the defense, the boy denied starting the fire himself.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850712&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/12/nyregion/baden-criticizes-inquiry-by-jersey-into-park-fire.html |title=BADEN CRITICIZES INQUIRY BY JERSEY INTO PARK FIRE |website=The New York Times |date=12 July 1985 |access-date=18 November 2006 | first=Donald | last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129071045/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/12/nyregion/baden-criticizes-inquiry-by-jersey-into-park-fire.html |archive-date=29 November 2014 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[defense (legal)|defense]] denied any culpability, saying that company executives had carefully considered all safety recommendations, acting on some and rejecting others, and contending that the fire was [[arson]] and that no precautions would have saved lives in a fire where an [[accelerant]] was used.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850719&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/19/nyregion/closing-statements-to-jurors-are-made-in-park-fire-trial.html |title=CLOSING STATEMENTS TO JURORS ARE MADE IN PARK FIRE TRIAL |website=The New York Times |date=19 July 1985 |access-date=19 December 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143537/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/19/nyregion/closing-statements-to-jurors-are-made-in-park-fire-trial.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A defense [[forensic pathologist]] said arson might be the cause, saying that "high levels" of [[benzene]] in the victims' blood "could indicate some sinister reason for the fire." However, another defense witness said there were no burn patterns or other evidence of an accelerant.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850712/&gt;

Park officials testified that smoke alarms had been installed, but the park was unable to control vandalism to them and decided not to reinstall them after 1979. A park official testified that having an employee assigned to walk continually through the attraction was a good alternative to the smoke alarms.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850627&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/27/nyregion/fun-house-patrol-called-a-substitute-for-alarms.html |title=FUN HOUSE PATROL CALLED A SUBSTITUTE FOR ALARMS |website=The New York Times |date=27 June 1985 |access-date=18 December 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143502/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/27/nyregion/fun-house-patrol-called-a-substitute-for-alarms.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A top fire-safety official testifying for the defense said that sprinklers and smoke detectors might have saved part of the structure, but would not have saved lives because by then "you would have had lethal combustion products throughout the facility" suffocating the victims.&lt;ref name=NYT_19850710&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/10/nyregion/value-of-sprinklers-disputed.html |title=VALUE OF SPRINKLERS DISPUTED |website=The New York Times |date=10 July 1985 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501161151/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/10/nyregion/value-of-sprinklers-disputed.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His testimony was later criticised by other fire-safety experts as undermining efforts to advance sprinkler legislation.&lt;ref name=NYT_19860223&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/nyregion/fire-safety-official-criticized-for-testimony-on-fatal-jersey-blaze.html |title=FIRE SAFETY OFFICIAL CRITICIZED FOR TESTIMONY ON FATAL JERSEY BLAZE |website=The New York Times |date=23 February 1986 |access-date=11 November 2006 |first=Thomas J. |last=Knudson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501161156/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/nyregion/fire-safety-official-criticized-for-testimony-on-fatal-jersey-blaze.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Verdict ==
The [[jury trial|jury]], after an eight-week trial and thirteen hours of deliberation, found the two companies not guilty of the charges. Interviewed after the trial, the jury foreman blamed Jackson Township officials for repeatedly allowing the castle to slip through cracks in the fire code. A second juror disagreed, saying that township officials were not derelict. Both jurors held the two companies blameless because they had been told by township officials that they needed no permit or sprinklers.&lt;ref name=COSTAL/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19850723&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/23/nyregion/foreman-of-jury-blames-town-for-six-flags-fire.html |title=FOREMAN OF JURY BLAMES TOWN FOR SIX FLAGS FIRE |website=The New York Times |date=23 July 1985 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143417/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/23/nyregion/foreman-of-jury-blames-town-for-six-flags-fire.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19850728&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/28/nyregion/great-adventure-juror-absolves-township-in-fire.html |title=GREAT ADVENTURE JUROR ABSOLVES TOWNSHIP IN FIRE |website=The New York Times |date=28 July 1985 |access-date=20 November 2006 |first=Donald |last=Janson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501161136/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/28/nyregion/great-adventure-juror-absolves-township-in-fire.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The two park executives charged separately with manslaughter avoided trial and possible imprisonment by entering a pretrial intervention program that allowed them to perform [[community service]].&lt;ref name=NYT_19850308&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/nyregion/the-region-charges-dropped-in-six-flags-case.html |title=CHARGES DROPPED IN SIX FLAGS CASE |website=The New York Times |date=8 March 1985 |access-date=11 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501134956/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/nyregion/the-region-charges-dropped-in-six-flags-case.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The families of four of the victims filed [[civil suit]]s against Bally Manufacturing, the owner of Six Flags; Six Flags Great Adventure; and the Castle's builder, George Mahana, the owner of Toms River Haunted House Company, charging [[manslaughter]] and [[Aggravation (legal concept)|aggravated]] manslaughter.

Immediately after the fire, several other New Jersey haunted house attractions were closed pending fire inspections, including the multi-trailer ''Doorway to Hell'' on [[Casino Pier]] in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]], also built by Toms River Haunted House Company.&lt;ref name=COSTAL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popartpete.com/doorwaygood2(2).jpg |title=Doorway to Hell, Seaside Heights |publisher=Ocean County Observer |date=14 May 1984 |access-date=15 June 2009 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726081341/http://www.popartpete.com/doorwaygood2(2).jpg |archive-date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19840520&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/20/nyregion/haunted-houses-inspected.html |first=Albert J. |last=Parisi |title='HAUNTED HOUSES' INSPECTED |website=The New York Times |date=20 May 1984 |access-date=11 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143447/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/20/nyregion/haunted-houses-inspected.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey and other states passed new fire-safety laws for [[dark ride]]s and "any structure that intentionally [[Orientation (mental)|disorients]]".&lt;ref name=COSTAL/&gt;&lt;ref name= NYT_19840923&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/23/nyregion/jersey-fire-panel-to-suggest-amusement-park-improvements.html |title=JERSEY FIRE PANEL TO SUGGEST AMUSEMENT-PARK IMPROVEMENTS |website=The New York Times |date=23 September 1984 |access-date=10 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143542/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/23/nyregion/jersey-fire-panel-to-suggest-amusement-park-improvements.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park attendance at Six Flags Great Adventure fell sharply for the rest of the year, finishing fifteen percent below the $3.3 million for the year preceding. Park officials said pre-fire attendance levels were restored the next year after they reassured the public that the park was made safer by the addition of $5.2 million worth of sprinklers and computerized smoke and heat detectors. However, industry sources were reporting that ensuing poor attendance almost caused the park to close in 1987.&lt;ref name=COSTAL/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_19850715&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/15/nyregion/reporter-s-notebook-prosecutor-facing-legal-team-in-trial-on-park-fire.html |first=Donald |last=Janson |title=PROSECUTOR FACING LEGAL TEAM IN TRIAL ON PARK FIRE |website=The New York Times |date=15 July 1985 |access-date=11 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501143412/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/15/nyregion/reporter-s-notebook-prosecutor-facing-legal-team-in-trial-on-park-fire.html |archive-date=1 May 2009 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Doorway to Hell?'' ==
An [[independent film]] titled ''Doorway to Hell? The Mystery and Controversy Surrounding the Fire at the Haunted Castle''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popartpete.com/page12.html |title=Haunted Castle Clip |last=Smith |first=Peter James |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406024504/http://www.popartpete.com/page12.html |archive-date=6 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was produced in 2003 by Peter James Smith, a long-time patron of the ''Haunted Castle''. Smith's documentary, which won a "Best Research" award at the 2004 [[New York International Independent Film and Video Festival]], documents the fire, investigation and trial, and questions the official report's finding that the fire was accidental. Smith speaks of an "emotionally disturbed" youth with a history of setting fires who "kept playing with a lighter in his pocket" and resembled the boy that was said to have started the fire. He says the youth was seen exiting the attraction as the fire broke out and was later questioned by police but not charged due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=APPvideo1&gt;{{cite news|first=Kirk |last=Moore |url=http://popartpete.com/2004article1.jpg |title=New video recounts story of '84 Great Adventure fire |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715103551/http://popartpete.com/2004article1.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=APPvideo2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://popartpete.com/2004article2.jpg |title=...video recounts... PAGE 2 |website=Asbury Park Press |date=May 2004 |access-date=19 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715103633/http://popartpete.com/2004article2.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film says that two earlier visitors on the day of the fire reported finding an exit door chained shut, but they were not called as witnesses. (Ocean County authorities reported no physical evidence of chained doors and dismissed such claims.) Some visitors and employees Smith interviewed thought doors were blocked at times for the security of the actors and to keep people from going outside to smoke cigarettes or marijuana.&lt;ref name=APPvideo1/&gt;

Smith also says that diagrams&lt;ref name=floorplan/&gt; of the castle and its exits used in the trial were inaccurate, and did not show a metal fence erected to protect actors from hostile guests, something that would have made escape more difficult, which was found at the scene. Great Adventure officials declined to comment on the film.&lt;ref name=APPvideo2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12292">'''Hayemaker Promotions''' is a promotional company operated by former WBA heavyweight and undisputed cruiserweight champion [[David Haye]]. The company held their first boxing promotional event in [[Sheffield]] on 20 September 2008.

==Starting Up==
On establishing the company, [[David Haye]] drew comparisons with [[Golden Boy Promotions]] when he said; "Golden Boy have taken over from [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] and [[Bob Arum]] and they've done it by empowering the fighters, putting control back in their hands and giving them the lion's share". Giving an insight into how the new promotional outfits would actually help fighters he added: "Promoting other fighters is not a money-making scheme for me, I make enough from my own fights, I don't need to take any money from six- to eight-rounders. Taking 15 or 20 grand from a British title fight doesn't mean anything to me, but that extra money means a hell of a lot to someone who's fighting for, say, 10 grand three times a year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/boxing-hayemaker-lands-blow-for-fellow-fighters-842458.html|title=Boxing: Hayemaker lands blow for fellow fighters|author=Alan Hubbard|date=7 June 2008|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haye and Booth signed up a number of fighters to their stable. Former [[WBU]] champion [[Derry Mathews]] signed having previously been with [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Sports Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7568752.stm|title=BBC SPORT - Boxing - Mathews signs up to Haye's camp|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; British light-middleweight champion [[Ryan Rhodes]], and trainer Dave Coldwell joined as Head of Boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/boxing/Long-road-travelled-for-Coldwell.4257019.jp|title=Long road travelled for Coldwell|website=Thestar.co.uk|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outfit also signed a number of up and coming young stars, including undefeated Liverpool lightweight [[John Watson (boxer)|John Watson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_3671-BBN-Exclusive-Hayemaker-promotions-sign-up-rising-lightweight.html|title=britishboxing.net|website=Britishboxing.net|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield prospect [[Josh Wale]],

==Deal with Setanta==
Hayemaker signed a deal on 27 May 2008 which would see ten promotions from the company broadcast on [[Setanta Sports]]. This would include the next four [[David Haye]] fights. The first promotion was held in [[Sheffield]] on 20 September 2008, and broadcast 4 live bouts which included the two-time British champion [[Ryan Rhodes]] defending his light-middleweight belt against Scotsman Jamie Coyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_3826-Bravery-and-brutality-in-Sheffield.html|title=britishboxing.net|website=Britishboxing.net|accessdate=2016-02-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194702/http://www.britishboxing.net/news_3826-Bravery-and-brutality-in-Sheffield.html|archivedate=2015-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second promotion was held in [[London]] and featured [[David Haye]] against American [[Monte Barrett]] at heavyweight with Haye winning by knockout after 5 rounds.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Two more televised promotions followed before the subscription sports channel went bust in the UK on 23 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8115360.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Business - Setanta goes into administration|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Liverpool]] [[Tony Quigley]] claimed the British super-middleweight title with a win over [[Tony Dodson]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7966003.stm|title=BBC SPORT - Boxing - Quigley battles to title victory|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as marking the professional debut of [[David Price (boxer)|David Price]].  This was followed by a bill in [[Belfast]] topped by [[Martin Lindsay (boxer)|Martin Lindsay]] winning the British featherweight title against Scotland's [[Paul Appleby (boxer)|Paul Appleby]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The loss of the television deal meant that opportunities for boxers signed to the stable became rarer and saw fighters like [[Derry Mathews]] and [[David Price (boxer)|David Price]] split from the promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/boxing/2009/09/12/david-price-and-derry-mathews-quit-hayemaker-100252-24667647/|title=David Price and Derry Mathews quit Hayemaker|author=liverpoolecho Administrator|date=12 September 2009|work=Liverpoolecho.co.uk|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[George Groves (boxer)|George Groves]] signed promotional deals with other promoters whilst continuing to be managed by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=21375&amp;more=1|title=Round 3 Has Signed An Agreement For A Financial Interest In Andrzej Fonfara|author=Round 3 Productions|website=Eastsideboxing.com|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Small hall shows==
During the term of the deal with Setanta, Hayemaker also promoted a number of non-televised small hall shows in venues such as [[Rotherham]], [[Sheffield]] and London's [[York Hall]]. They featured local fighters such as former [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] player turned boxer [[Curtis Woodhouse]] who topped the bill at Rotherham's Consort Hotel on a two-fight dinner card,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/boxing/Boxing-Blade-leaves-opponent-Dunn.4747734.jp|title=Boxing Blade leaves opponent Dunn and dusted|website=Thestar.co.uk|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at his former club's ground in [[Bramall Lane]].

==2016 return==
On 24 November 2015, Haye and his new promotion and management team, Salter Brothers Entertainment, announced his comeback fight against WBA #10 ranked heavyweight [[Mark de Mori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbanews.com/wba-ranking|title=World Boxing Association Ranking {{!}} World Boxing Association|website=www.wbanews.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight took place on 16 January 2016 (marketed by Salter Brothers Entertainment as "Haye Day") at the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]] in London, and was Haye's first fight in more than three years since stopping Dereck Chisora in 2012. Coming into the fight, Australian De Mori had lost only once in 33 career bouts and 26 of his 29 victories had come via knockout, albeit against limited opposition. It was announced on 6 January 2016 that Haye and the Salter Brothers had struck a deal for the comeback fight to be shown on [[free-to-air]] entertainment channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]], the largest non-PSB broadcaster in the UK and the channel's first ever live sport broadcast. Haye commented on the broadcast deal, stating: "I'm looking forward to putting on a great show for the fans on 'Haye Day' at The O2 on January 16 and I'm delighted that my first fight in three-and-a-half years is going to be available free to air on Dave, giving as many people as possible the chance to watch my comeback. I was determined to make this comeback fight free to everybody and fans should sit back and get ready for another fun-fuelled ride as I look to regain the heavyweight championship of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-3386701/David-Haye-fight-Mark-Mori-shown-free-air-entertainment-channel-Dave.html|title=Haye fight with De Mori to be shown on free-to-air channel Dave|website=Mail Online|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a world's first, Salter Brothers Entertainment also partnered with [[YouTube]] to live-stream the event outside of the UK to a global audience for free.

At an official press conference on 12 July 2017, Hayemaker Ringstar announced they had agreed a TV rights deal with the biggest multichannel broadcaster in the UK, [[UKTV]], for entertainment channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]].

The '''Intercontinental GT Challenge''' is a [[sports car racing]] series developed by the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO Group]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=sro&gt;{{cite journal |title=Concept|url=http://www.sro-motorsports.com/intercontinental-gt-challenge|journal=SRO motorsports|date = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of international [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance races]] for [[grand tourer]] racing cars complying with the FIA's GT3 regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 2017 Intercontinental GT Challenge opener has its date|url=http://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/news/667/the-2017-intercontinental-gt-challenge-opener-has-its-date|journal=Blanc Pain|date = 16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The series is aimed at manufacturers. Instead of fielding their own cars, manufacturers can appoint and support local teams in selected events to gain points.&lt;ref name="IGTC_INFO"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intercontinentalgtchallenge.com/about/intercontinental-gt-challenge | title = Intercontinental GT Challenege | publisher = Intercontinental GT Challenge | date = 2016| accessdate = 2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sro/&gt; Four manufacturers took part in the inaugural series in [[2016 Intercontinental GT Challenge|2016]]: [[Audi]], [[Bentley]], [[McLaren]] and [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Vanthoor seals Intercontinental GT Challenge|url=http://www.bathurst12hour.com.au/news/vanthoor-seals-intercontinental-gt-challenge/|journal=Bathurst 12 Hour|date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The races may be stand-alone events (like the [[Sepang 12 Hours]] or the [[Bathurst 12 Hour]]) or part of another championship (like the [[24 Hours of Spa]]) but they are all contested by cars complying with the same technical regulations.&lt;ref name="IGTC_INFO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Monterey added to 2017 Intercontinental GT Challenge|url=http://sportscar365.com/sro/igtc/monterey-added-to-2017-intercontinental-gt-challenge-schedule/|journal=Sportscar 365|date = 29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bathurst to open Intercontinental GT Challenge|url=https://www.motorsport.com/endurance/news/bathurst-to-open-intercontinental-gt-challenge/|journal=Motorsport|date = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Champions==
The title is awarded to the manufacturer with the highest points tally.&lt;ref name="IGTC_INFO"/&gt; A manufacturer can enter up to four cars in any event but only receives points for its two highest placed cars. Drivers’ titles are awarded in the Pro category and the Am category for drivers that a rated ''bronze'' by the FIA's ranking system.

The '''Formula 3000 International Championship''' was a motor racing series created by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) in 1985 to become the final preparatory step for drivers hoping to enter the [[Formula One]] championship. [[Formula Two]] had become too expensive, and was dominated by works-run cars with factory engines; the hope was that Formula 3000 would offer quicker, cheaper, more open racing. The series began as an open specification, then tyres were standardized from 1986 onwards, followed by engines and chassis in 1996. The series ran annually until 2004, and was replaced in 2005 by the [[GP2 Series]].

The series was staged as the '''Formula 3000 European Championship''' in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;1986 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; as the '''Formula 3000 Intercontinental Championship''' in 1986&lt;ref&gt;1987 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; and 1987&lt;ref&gt;1988 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; and then as the '''Formula 3000 International Championship''' from 1988&lt;ref&gt;Automobile Year 1988/89, pages 236-242&lt;/ref&gt; to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041216021312/http://www.fia.com/sport/Championships/F3000/Classifications/2004.html 2004 FIA Formula 3000 International Championship Classifications] Retrieved from web.archive.org on 25 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engines==
Formula 3000 replaced Formula Two, and was so named because the engines used were limited to 3000cc maximum capacity. Initially, the [[Cosworth DFV]] was a popular choice, having been made obsolete in Formula One by the adoption of 1.5 litre turbocharged engines. (It has been observed{{who|date=May 2015}} that [[Bernie Ecclestone]] had purchased a job-lot of DFVs in 1984, with no obvious use for them at the time).

The rules permitted any 90-degree V8 engine, fitted with a rev-limiter to keep power output under control. As well as the Cosworth, a Honda engine based on an Indy V8 by [[Judd (engine)|John Judd]] also appeared; a rumoured [[Lamborghini]] V8 never raced. In later years, a [[Mugen-Honda]] V8 became the thing to have, eclipsing the DFV; Cosworth responded with the brand new AC engine. Costs, not unlike the senior series, were getting out of control.

==Chassis==
[[File:Fórmula 3000 (Fernado Alonso)01.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Fernando Alonso|Fernando Alonso's]] [[Lola Cars|Lola]] chassis in the [[2000 International Formula 3000 Championship|2000 season]].]]
The first chassis from [[March Engineering|March]], [[Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives|AGS]] and [[Ralt]] were developments of their existing 1984 [[Formula Two]] designs, although [[Lola Cars|Lola]]'s entry was based on and looked very much like an [[Champ car|IndyCar]]. A few smaller teams tried obsolete three-litre [[Formula One]] cars (from [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]], [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]], [[Minardi]], [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] and RAM), with little success—the Grand Prix and Indycar-derived entries were too unwieldy—their fuel tanks were about twice the size of those needed for F3000 races, and the weight distribution was not ideal. The first few years of the championship saw March establishing a superiority over Ralt and Lola—there was little to choose between the chassis, but more Marches were sold and ended up in better hands. The form book was rewritten in 1988 with the entry of the ambitious [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] marque with a brand new chassis; Reynard had won their first race in every formula they'd entered. This would continue in F3000. The next couple of years saw Lola improve slightly—their car was arguably marginally superior to the Reynard in 1990—and March slip, but both were crushed by the Reynard teams and by the mid-90s, F3000 was a virtual Reynard monopoly, although [[Lola Cars|Lola]] did eventually return with a promising car and the Japanese [[Footwork (racing team)|Footwork]] and [[Dome (constructor)|Dome]] chassis were seen in Europe. [[Dallara]] briefly tried the series before moving up to [[Formula One]], and [[Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives|AGS]] moved up from Formula Two but never recaptured their occasional success. At least one unraced F3000 chassis existed—the Wagner fitted with a straight-six short-stroke BMW. This was converted into a sports car, however.

==Politics==
The series was not without controversy. Definitive rules for the 1985 season did not appear until the championship was well under way. In 1987 questions were asked about the ability of some of the drivers, given the high number of accidents in the formula. In 1989 the eligibility of the new [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] chassis was challenged - it was raced with a different (but safer and no faster) nose to the one that had been crash tested. This season also saw problems with driver changes - the cost of F3000 was escalating to the point that teams were finding it difficult to run drivers for a whole season. A badly implemented "two driver changes per car per season" rule meant that some cars had to sit idle while drivers with budgets could not race them (rather than allowing two drivers to share a drive through the season on a race-by-race basis, teams could only change the driver of any entry twice in a year). In 1991 the performance of some Italian teams attracted attention - they had started using [[Agip]]'s "jungle juice" [[Formula One]] fuel, worth an estimated 15&amp;nbsp;bhp—giving their drivers a significant advantage. In the early years of the formula there was much concern about safety, with a high number of accidents resulting in injuries to drivers and, unfortunately, one fatality in the International Championship - [[Marco Campos]] in the very last round of the 1995 series.

==Races==
Formula 3000 races during the "open chassis" era tended to be of about 100–120 miles in distance, held at major circuits, either headlining meetings or paired with other international events. The "jewel in the crown" of the F3000 season was traditionally the [[Pau Grand Prix]] street race, rivalled for a few years by the [[Birmingham Superprix|Birmingham]] round. Most major circuits in France, [[Italy]], Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom saw the series visit at least once.

==The spec-chassis years==
In 1996, new rules introduced a single engine (a detuned [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] V8 engine, re-engineered by and badged as a [[Zytek]]) and chassis ([[Lola Cars|Lola]]), to go along with tyre standardization ([[Avon Tyres|Avon]]) introduced in 1986. The following year the calendar was combined with that of Formula One, so the series became support races for the Grand Prix. Several Grand Prix teams established formal links with F3000 teams to develop young drivers (and engineering talent); these relationships varied from formal "junior teams" (such as the one [[McLaren]] set up for [[Nick Heidfeld]]) to fairly distant relationships based mostly upon shared sponsors and the use of the 'parent' team's name. The series grew dramatically through the late nineties, reaching an entry of nearly 40 cars - although this in itself was problematic as it meant many drivers failed to qualify. In 2000, the series was restricted to 15 teams of two cars each.

However, by 2002 expenses were once more very high and the number of entries, and sponsors, rapidly dwindled. International Formula 3000 was experiencing tough competition with cheaper formulae, such as [[Auto GP|European F3000]] (using ex-FIA 1999 and 2002 Lola chassis), [[World Series by Nissan]] (also known as Formula Nissan) and [[Formula Renault 3.5|Formula Renault V6 Eurocup]]. By the end of 2003, car counts had fallen to new lows.

The [[2004 International Formula 3000 Championship|2004 season]] was the last F3000 campaign, due in part to dwindling field sizes. In 2005 it was replaced with a new series known as [[GP2 Series|GP2]], with [[Renault]] backing.

Three past F3000 champions (Müller, Junqueira and Wirdheim) have never been entered in an F1 race. Montoya and Bourdais became Champions in North American open-wheel ([[Champ Car|CART]] and [[Champcar]]) respectively, with Fittipaldi, Moreno, Junqueira and Wilson also becoming race winners, and Wirdheim making the ranks. Müller became a BMW driver in [[World Touring Car Championship|WTCC]] [[touring car racing]] after having been a test driver for the BMW-[[WilliamsF1|Williams]] F1 project in 1999 as well as a racer of the [[BMW V12 LMR]] Le Mans winner.  Sospiri attempted to qualify for one Formula One race but failed to make it, as part of the disastrous [[MasterCard Lola]] team. Wirdheim has been third driver in practice sessions for [[Jaguar Racing]], but has never participated in a race.

Three past F3000 champions have won an F1 Grand Prix:  Alesi, Panis and Montoya (who also won the [[Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]]).

'''James Bartley''' (1870–1909) is the central figure in a late nineteenth-century story according to which he was [[Swallowing|swallowed]] whole by a [[sperm whale]]. He was found still living days later in the stomach of the whale, which was dead from constipation.

The story originated of an anonymous firm, began to appear in American newspapers.  The anonymous article appeared in the ''St. Louis Globe Democrat'' of [[Saint Louis, Missouri]], then the note appeared in other newspapers with the title "A Modern Jonah" or something similar in multiple newspapers&lt;ref&gt; ''The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer'', July 2, 1891 (Wheeling, W. Va.); ''The Wichita Daily Eagle'', August 6, 1891 (Wichita, Kan.); ''The Morning Call'', July 6, 1891; "The Modern Mr. Jonah" ''The Daily Independent'', July 14, 1891 (Helena, Mont.); "A Real Living Jonah" ''Wood County Reporter'', July 30, 1891 (Grand Rapids, Wis.); "Swallowed by a Whale" ''The Somerset Herald'', August 19, 1891 (Somerset, Pa.) At the beginning of this article they wrote: "Correspondent from the veracious ''St. Louis Globe Democrat'' writes from New London, Conn., has just arrived...";  "A Living Jonah" ''St. Johnsbury Caledonian''. September 17, 1891 (St. Johnsbury, Vt.) University of Vermont. At the end of this another article they wrote: (New London (Conn.) Cor. ''St. Louis Globe Democrat''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news spread beyond the ocean in articles as "Man in a Whale's Stomach.  "Rescue of a Modern Jonah" in page 8 of the August 22, 2017 issue of the ''Yarmouth Mercury'' newspaper of [[Great Yarmouth]] on England.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Peggotty, "[http://greatyarmouthmercury.co.uk/1.4524849 Army shot at lost whale, thinking it was German submarine, in River Yare]," ''Great Yarmouth Mercury'' (6 May 2016): http://greatyarmouthmercury.co.uk/1.4524849 (Accessed 16 May 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The story as reported is that during a [[whaling]] expedition off the [[Falkland Islands]], Bartley's boat was attacked by the whale and he landed inside the whale's mouth.  He survived the ordeal and was carved out of the stomach by his peers when they, not knowing he was inside, caught and began skinning the whale because of the hot weather which would have rotted the whale meat.  It was said that he was in the whale for 36 hours and it was also said that his skin had been bleached by the gastric juices, and that he was blind the rest of his life.  He was, however, supposed to have returned to work within three weeks in some accounts.  He died 18 years later and his tombstone in Gloucester says "James Bartley- a modern day Jonah."&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Durham, "Modern Folklore",  David Gunston, "The man who lived in a whale", ''[[The Mail on Sunday|Sunday Mail]]'', May 12, 1985, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ycaol.com/swallowed.htm |title=Swallowed by a Whale |publisher=Ycaol.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, an article named "A Modern Jonah Proves his Story." was published in the ''New York World'' quoted a brief portion of this story, as told by Rev. William Justin Harsha, along with some initial observations.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in "[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1896/11/17/106851789.pdf Personal]," ''The New York Times'' (17 November 1896): https://www.nytimes.com/1896/11/17/archives/personal.html (Accessed 16 May 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed about a week later by another article that briefly summarised some responses from readers,&lt;ref&gt;Cited in "[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1896/11/25/108264371.pdf Topics of the Times]," ''The New York Times'' (25 November 1896): https://www.nytimes.com/1896/11/25/archives/topics-of-the-times.html (Accessed 16 May 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a third article by William L. Stone, who related a similar story involving a massive "man-eating shark".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in "[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1896/12/04/108266568.pdf A Shark Story of Great Merit]," ''The New York Times'' (4 December 1896): https://www.nytimes.com/1896/12/04/archives/a-shark-story-of-great-merit.html (Accessed 16 May 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[The article "A Modern Jonah Proves his Story." appeared in the newspaper called New York World (April 12, 1896) , and not in the New York Times as erroneously repeated in several investigations.[https://newspaperarchive.com/new-york-world-apr-12-1896-p-15/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French scientist De Parville published a report of the alleged incident in the Paris ''[[Journal des Débats]]'' in 1914.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

==Investigations==
More recently, the facts were carefully investigated by historian Edward Davis, who pointed out many inconsistencies. The ship in the story is ''The Star of the East'';  a [[United Kingdom|British]] ship by the same name existed and sailed during the time in which the incident allegedly occurred and could have been near the Falklands at the right time, but the real ''Star of the East'' was not a whaling vessel and its crew list did not include a "James Bartley".&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Edward Davis, ''[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1991/PSCF12-91Davis.html A Whale of a Tale: Fundamentalist Fish Stories.]'' [[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]] 43 (1991): 224-37&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, Mrs. John Killam, the wife of the Captain, wrote a letter stating that "there is not one word of truth in the whale story. I was with my husband all the years he was in the ''Star of the East''. There was never a man lost overboard while my husband was in her. The sailor has told a great sea yarn." Davis suggested that the story may have been inspired by the "Gorleston whale", a 30-foot [[rorqual]] killed near Great Yarmouth shortly before in June 1891 that generated a lot of publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[Robert B. Durham, "Modern Folklore"]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the veracity of the story is in question, it is physically possible for a sperm whale to swallow a human whole, as they have been known to swallow giant squid whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/10/photogalleries/giant-squid-sperm-whale-pictures/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731152421/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/10/photogalleries/giant-squid-sperm-whale-pictures/ |archive-date=2016-07-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/could-a-whale-accidentally-swallow-you-it-is-possible-26353362/ |title=Could a Whale Accidentally Swallow You?

==Cultural references==
[[George Orwell]] refers to this incident (twice) in his 1939 novel ''[[Coming Up for Air]]'' (though not in his 1940 essay "[[Inside the Whale]]").  [[Julian Barnes]] references the event in his novel ''[[A History of the World in 10½ Chapters]]'', as did [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and [[J. M. Ledgard]] in his novel ''[[Submergence (novel)|Submergence]]'', the latter albeit using a different name, John More, for the swallowed victim.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Ledgard (2013). "Submergence", p. 33-34. Coffee House Press, Minneapolis. {{ISBN|978-1-56689-319-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clive Cussler]] also refers to the James Bartley story in his novel ''[[Medusa (Cussler novel)|Medusa]]''.  James Bartley was also mentioned in the 1965 "Jonah and the Whale" episode of the [[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'']] television series.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Durham, "Modern Folklore"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''King's Theatre''' is located in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. It was built for [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]] under its chairman Baillie Michael Simons as a sister theatre of their [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] in the city and was designed by [[Frank Matcham]], opening in 1904. The theatre is primarily a [[receiving house]] for touring musicals, dance, comedy and circus-type performances. The theatre also provides a prominent stage for local amateur productions. The King's Theatre also stages an [[King's Theatre Pantomime|annual pantomime]], produced by [[First Family Entertainment]]

The theatre is currently operated by the [[Ambassador Theatre Group]], under a lease from [[Glasgow City Council]] who own the building.

== Location ==
The theatre occupies the corner of Bath Street and Elmbank Street, in the Charing Cross area of the city. The longer Bath Street elevation houses both the main entrance, the scenery dock and stage door. The equally decorative but shorter Elmbank Street elevation has various fire exits and the entrance to the Gallery.

== History ==
The King's Theatre was commissioned by the theatre company [[Howard &amp; Wyndham]] at a cost of over £50,000
and opened on 12 September 1904.

In the 1930s like many city theatres, it had been policy to close during the summer while many city residents headed to the coast for their holidays, but this all changed in 1933 when the then managing director of Howard &amp; Wyndham, A. Stewart Cruikshank, decided to experiment with a quality show, a cocktail of music, laughter and song, to outmatch the seaside-style summer shows. The show started at 8.30pm and was changed weekly, attracting huge crowds. The record run of 31 weeks under the top billing of Dave Willis remains unbroken in variety history. The first such show was on 5 June 1933, and was imaginatively titled the ''Half Past Eight Show''. This successful summer tradition continued, with changes becoming fortnightly to allow as many people to see it as possible.

Howard and Wyndham Ltd acquired the larger [[Alhambra Theatre Glasgow|Alhambra Theatre]] in Waterloo Street in 1954, in anticipation of  selling their [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] in Hope Street to Roy Thomson as studios for the launch of the commercial television station [[Scottish Television|STV]], and the summer shows were transferred there.
[[File:Carol Smillie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carol Smillie]] in Hormonal Housewives at The King's Theatre, Glasgow, November 2011]]
The King's concentrated upon musical plays and drama and in time introduced ballet, Pavlova being greatly popular. Film seasons were introduced before 1914. Pantomime started in the 1960s only after the [[Alhambra Theatre]] closed. These lavish shows, originally funded in a joint venture by Glasgow Corporation and Edinburgh Corporation included [[Stanley Baxter]] and others. The Christmas pantomime continued as an annual feature,  with comedians and actors such as Gerard Kelly and Elaine C. Smith. There is always a healthy rivalry with other Scottish theatres to put on the biggest and best Christmas pantomimes, with the main competition to the King's in Glasgow now being the [[Pavilion Theatre (Glasgow)|Pavilion Theatre]] in Renfield Street.

Over the years many actors and actresses have graced the stage of The King's. These included [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Ray Walston]], [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Tyrone Power]]. The [[Jackson Five]] appeared at a Royal Variety Performance in the late 1970s.

In 1967, Howard and Wyndham sold the King's Theatre to [[Glasgow Corporation]] in the face of competition from the civic theatre movement, which was attracting Arts Council money. This secured the theatre for the future, as television and colour films had led to the closure of the majority of them in Britain.  Around the same period, the theatre gained an extension to the rear as part of the [[Elmbank Gardens|Charing Cross Complex]] which was built to the west of the building in the early 1970s.

However, the King's has been most famous among locals for its annual pantomime  - which has starred variety greats such as [[Stanley Baxter]], [[Jimmy Logan]] and [[Rikki Fulton]]. In 1990 when the City of Glasgow became the first [[European City of Culture]] in Britain, the theatre was a main venue, and underwent a programme of major refurbishment.

In 2002 the theatre's day-to-day management was transferred to the [[Ambassador Theatre Group]], becoming their first venue in Scotland, although they have since also taken over the management of the [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] at the opposite end of the city centre as well as the [[Edinburgh Playhouse]].

In 2004, the theatre celebrated its centenary, and a one-off documentary on the theatre was broadcast on BBC1 Scotland on 31 January 2003. The programme was presented by [[Elaine C Smith]] and featured interviews with [[Gerard Kelly]], [[Stanley Baxter]], [[Paul O'Grady]], [[Tony Roper (actor)|Tony Roper]], [[Nicholas Parsons]] and [[Johnny Beattie]], among others.

In 2005, responsibility for production of the pantomime was transferred to the Ambassador Theatre Group subsidiary [[First Family Entertainment]].

== The building ==
[[File:King's Theatre DSCN1784.jpg|thumb|View from the Stage]]
[[File:King's Theatre DSCN1779.jpg|thumb|Boxes seen from the Grand Circle]]
[[Frank Matcham]] made effective use of the prominent corner site in designing the two facades of the building. Originally, an  iron canopy, made by the [[Saracen Foundry]] in [[Possilpark]], Glasgow, wrapped around the front of the building, although this appears to have been removed by the Second World War, possibly for munitions production. The facade on Bath Street is a mix of styles, with influences of [[Baroque]] and [[Art Nouveau]] in red [[Dumfriesshire]] sandstone. A pair of two storey pavilions stand near either end of the Bath Street elevation, one providing access to the main [[foyer]] whilst the other houses the scenery dock, and opens straight onto the stage. The pavilions are topped with ball [[finial]]s. Originally a female statue stood on top of either pavilion, but these were removed during the war period,to prevent them becoming damaged, however were subsequently misplaced, and have never been rediscovered.

The theatre provides seating on four levels - Stalls, Grand Circle, Upper Circle and Gallery. Matcham was famous for his innovative style of cantilever construction of the individual seating tiers, which virtually eliminated the need for supporting pillars, and the King's was no exception, with reasonable sightlines from most seats. Victorian and Edwardian theatres were almost always built to segregate patrons at each level, although subsequent modernisations often eradicate this. This has thus far not been the case in the King's, which still has separate entrances, some of which have traces of former pay boxes, now disused. The standard of seating and decoration is also less luxurious as you get further up the house. The Stalls and Grand Circle are accessed via the small main foyer, which still  impresses with its barrel vaulted ceiling, horizontal bands of red and white marble, and decorative plasterwork on the ceilings, including caryatids. The Upper Circle is accessed via a door to a stairwell to the left of the main Bath Street entrance. The Gallery is accessed via a staircase at the back of the building with its own entrance on Elmbank Street.

The [[auditorium]] seats 1,785. The ceiling panelling fans out from a single centre ceiling rose - each panel originally contained painted scenes, although they are currently plain. The proscenium is surrounded by heavy marble and plasterwork borders. Above the [[proscenium]] an elegant design with cherubs flanking a crown and a K/T emblem provides a focal point to the theatre when the curtain is down. The red curtain has simple gilding, but often remains unseen as it is unused for many of today's productions. The seats and drapes are of a rich red material. The [[safety curtain]] features a painted design of drapes, and framed in the centre is a projection screen. At Grand Circle level two boxes on either side of the auditorium continue where the grand circle balcony finishes. A further box (now disused) is located at Upper Circle level above this, with an elaborate domed canopy. Three domed alcoves sit along either side of the upper circle. Comedian and actor [[Billy Connolly]] famously described it as "like performing inside a wedding cake".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Subsequent alterations to the theatre includes the unfortunate removal of a modern canopy, which ran along most of the Bath Street elevation. This dated from around the 1950s, and was removed in 2004 during a programme of external works, which also included some stone-cleaning and refurbishment.  To complement the newly revealed exterior architecture, the facades were floodlit with coloured lights. In 1986, an extension to the western side of the Bath Street elevation provided new dressing room and office accommodation, as well as a new wardrobe room and stage door.

== Restoration ==

In early 2008, the management of the King's Theatre announced that a full programme of interior refurbishment was planned, to restore the theatre to its full former glory, in time for the Commonwealth Games that the city is to host in 2014. Work for this restoration is expected to commence in the Summer of 2009. The firm chosen as Architects for the work are Simpson &amp; Brown.

The theatre had its Stalls &amp; Grand Circle seating replaced during the autumn 2009, with an authentic style appropriate to the theatre. The stalls has improved legroom and no centre aisle, improving sightlines.  The theatre is offering patrons the opportunity to sponsor a seat, with the price including a membership to the Friends scheme that the theatre operates. Other restoration work includes new carpet within the auditorium, new orchestra pit railing, and preparations for the installation of air conditioning.

On 30 September 2010, U.S. helicopters entered Pakistani airspace after ground troops determined that a mortar attack by militants in Pakistan was imminent, according to the Coalition. Pakistani [[Frontier Corps]] troops manning the Mandata Kadaho border post fired warning shots, and the helicopters responded by firing two missiles that destroyed the post. Three soldiers were killed and another three wounded. Pakistan responded by closing a key NATO supply route for eleven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093000145.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Karin | last=Brulliard | title=Pakistan blocks NATO's Afghan-bound supply trucks after airstrike kills 3 | date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Longborough Festival Opera''' is an [[opera]] festival which presents a season of high quality opera each June and July in the English [[Cotswolds]] village of [[Longborough]] in north [[Gloucestershire]]. It began in 1991 as '''Banks Fee Opera''' by presenting concerts, and moved forward with operas presented by a travelling company. This was followed by converting a barn into an opera house.  Audiences grew rapidly in the 1990s and, during the last decade, a focus on [[Wagner]]'s operas led to three complete [[Ring Cycle]]s being performed in 2013. The present chairman of the festival is Martin Graham, the music director Anthony Negus&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/15/siegfried-wagner-opera-anthony-negus&lt;/ref&gt; and the artistic director is Alan Privett.

==Beginnings==
[[File:LongboroughFestivalOpera.jpg|350px|right]]
After its initial start and after a series of chamber music concerts in the drawing room of the founders' house, Banks Fee, Travelling Opera, a small touring opera company, was invited to give two performances with a small orchestra on a temporary stage in the courtyard of the stable block in aid of the charities [[Sue Ryder Care]] and [[Barnardo's]]. A barn was then converted into a theatre, using seats from the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]], which were being discarded during the refurbishment of the late 1990s.

The original audience was mainly local supporters of the charities and about £3,000 was raised after costs, including donations which were divided between the two charities.

The opera evenings, with picnic interval, were very popular and there was demand to continue. Until 1998, the Festival's relationship was exclusively with Travelling Opera, whose productions of well-known operas in English were much enjoyed by the steadily increasing audience, which grew from a total of 400 in 1991 to 1,600 in 1997. Over that period, Banks Fee Opera presented many popular operas by [[Mozart]], [[Rossini]], [[Puccini]], [[Verdi]] and [[Bizet]].

==Longborough and Wagner==
If each of the British [[country house opera]] companies have their speciality, Longborough’s is its commitment to [[Wagner]].

LFO is the first privately owned opera house to be mounting a complete cycle of Wagner’s ''[[Ring Cycle|Ring]]''. After LFO’s acclaimed production of the reduced version prepared by [[Graham Vick]] and [[Jonathan Dove]] for the [[City of Birmingham Touring Opera]] company, Longborough is now producing a fully orchestrated version making use of its excellent [[orchestra pit]], which is modelled on that at the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] and accommodates 72 players.

The 2007 season featured the first instalment of a new full-length Ring Cycle: ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' was sung in German and had an orchestra of 60 players conducted by Anthony Negus. Alan Privett directed, and the set was designed by [[Kjell Torriset]]. ''Das Rheingold'' returned in 2008 for a further three performances, and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' was staged in 2010

2011 saw a production of ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Christiansen, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/8667485/Siegfried-Longborough-Festival-Opera-review.html "''Siegfried'', Longborough Festival Opera, review:] Longborough's full-length production of the Ring holds a happy balance between pit and stage.", ''The Telegraph'', (London), 28 Jul 2011. Retrieved 13 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and 2012 involved a production of ''[[Gotterdammerung]]''. In Wagner's bicentenary year, 2013, the whole cycle has been staged; it is believed that this will be the first time that this has happened in a privately owned opera house.

== Education at Longborough ==
Longborough Festival has since 2003 been involved in education projects in two ways: through workshops in local schools and productions for young artists to perform. The 2012 education production was ''[[Sweeney Todd]]'' and local children are often featured in the Festival's productions. The company runs workshops in schools and at Longborough as well as offering work experience.

'''Melodifestivalen 2008''' was the 47th [[Melodifestivalen]], and the selection process for the 48th song to represent Sweden at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].
A new rule—''Lex Agnes''—went into effect in 2008 calling for each submitted entry to include a document containing all information relevant to the song. It was named after [[Agnes Carlsson]], who was disqualified from the 2007 competition for publicly revealing details of her song before the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deliverya.aftonbladet.se/vss/telegram/0,1082,69532407_640__,00.html Lex Agnes i Melodifestivalen 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814115735/http://deliverya.aftonbladet.se/vss/telegram/0%2C1082%2C69532407_640__%2C00.html |date=14 August 2011 }} {{sv icon}}.

{{Campaignbox Mongol Invasion of the Khwarezmian Empire}}

'''Mongol conquests of Kingdom of Georgia''', which at that time consisted of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]] proper, [[Zakarid Armenia|Armenia]], and much of the [[Caucasus]], involved multiple invasions and large-scale raids throughout the 13th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] first appeared in the Caucasus in 1220 as generals [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] pursued [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm]] during the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|destruction of the Khwarezmian Empire]]. After a series of raids in which they defeated the Georgian and Armenian armies ([[Battle of Caucasus Mountain]]),&lt;ref&gt;"Early Ukraine: A Military and Social History to the Mid-19th Century"
By Alexander Basilevsky&lt;/ref&gt; Subutai and Jebe continued north to [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|invade Kievan Rus']]. After his empire was destroyed, Khwarazm ruler [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], son of Muhammed II, battled both the Mongols and the Georgians before moving on to challenge the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuks]] in Anatolia. A full-scale Mongol conquest of the Caucasus and eastern [[Anatolia]] began in 1236, in which the [[Kingdom of Georgia]], the [[Sultanate of Rum]], and the [[Empire of Trebizond]] were subjugated, the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] and other [[Crusader states]] voluntarily accepted Mongol vassalage, and the [[Assassins]] were eliminated. The Mongols also [[Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia|invaded Durdzuketia]], modern-day [[Chechnya]], but faced continual resistance in that area. After the death of [[Möngke Khan]] in 1259, the Mongol Empire descended into civil war and [[Berke]] of the [[Golden Horde]] and [[Hulagu]] of the [[Ilkhanate]] repeatedly [[Berke–Hulagu war|invaded each other]] in the Caucasus until the ascension of [[Kublai Khan]] in  1264.

The second Mongol invasion of the Caucasus started with the expedition of [[Chormaqan]] against  [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], ordered by khan  [[Ögedei]] in 1231. The Southern Persian dynasties in [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman]] voluntarily submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tributes.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy May-Chormaqan, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; To the west, [[Hamadan]] and the rest of Persia was secured by Chormaqan. The Mongols turned their attention to Armenia and Georgia  in 1236. They completed the conquest of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] in 1238 and the Mongol Empire began to attack the kingdom's southern possessions in Armenia, which was under the [[Seljuks]] the next year. In 1236 Ogedei despoiled [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassan]] and populated [[Herat]]. The Mongol military governors mostly made their camp in [[Mughan plain]]. Realizing the danger of the Mongols, rulers of [[Mosul]] and [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]] submitted to the Great Khan. Chormaqan divided the [[Transcaucasia]] region into three districts based on military hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Grigor of Akanc-The history of the nation of archers, (tr. R.P.Blake) 303&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia, the population were temporarily divided into eight [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalistriat Salia-History of the Georguan Nation, p.210&lt;/ref&gt; By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia, excluding [[Abbasid]] Iraq and [[Ismaili]] strongholds, and all of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Allsen-Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols began conquering the North Caucasus in 1237, but encountered bloody resistance from the local populations there.

After the [[battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243, the Mongols under [[Baiju]] occupied [[Anatolia]], and the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]] became vassals of the Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;George Finlay- The history of Greece from its conquest by the Crusaders to its conquest by the Ottomans, p.384&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assassins|Assassin]] strongholds lay scattered throughout Persia and the Caucasus, and Mongol commander [[Kitbuqa]], under orders from [[Möngke Khan]], began laying siege to them in 1253. Hulagu launched a full-scale assault in 1256 and eradicated Assassin presence from the region.

Following the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destruction of Baghdad in 1258]], civil war broke out between [[Berke|Berke Khan]] of the [[Golden Horde]] and Hulagu Khan of the [[Ilkhanate]]. Part of the larger [[Toluid Civil War]] succession conflict between [[Kublai Khan|Kubilai]] and [[Ariq Böke]], the war consisted mainly of raids and invasions carried out by both sides throughout the Caucasus region, with Berke enlisting the aid of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] and Hulagu the aid of the [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|Byzantine Empire]]. Neither side gained a real advantage, and the conflict ceased after the victory of Kublai and his enthronement as [[Great Khan]].

Mongol rule in the Caucasus lasted until the late 1330s.&lt;ref&gt;Wakhusht, Sak'art'velos istoria, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]] stayed under Mongol lordship from 1220 to 1344.&lt;ref&gt;Bayarsaikhan Dashdondong - The Mongols and the Armenians (1220-1335), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  During that period, the King [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]] restored the kingdom of Georgia for a brief period before it finally disintegrated due to [[Timur's invasions of Georgia]].

==Initial attacks==
[[File:Mongol_invasion_of_Georgia-en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mongol_invasion_of_Georgia-en.png|thumb|230x230px|Mongol invasion of Georgia and battle of Khunan.]]
The [[Mongols]] made their first appearance in the Georgian possessions when this latter kingdom was still in its zenith, dominating most of the [[Caucasus]]. First contact occurred early in the fall of 1220 ([[Battle of Caucasus Mountain]]),&lt;ref&gt;"Early Ukraine: A Military and Social History to the Mid-19th Century"
By Alexander Basilevsky&lt;/ref&gt; when approximately 20,000 Mongols led by [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] pursued the ousted [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Muhammad II]] of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] to the [[Caspian Sea]]. With the consent of [[Genghis Khan]], the two Mongol generals proceeded west on a reconnaissance mission. They thrust into Armenia, then under the Georgian authority, and defeated some 60,000{{citation needed|reason=number seems very exaggerated, please provide historical or academic reference|date=May 2016}} Georgians and Armenians commanded by King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV "Lasha"]] of Georgia and his [[atabek]] (tutor) and [[sipah salar|spasalar]] (commander-in-chief) [[Iwane Mkhargrdzeli]] at the [[Battle of Khunan]] on the Kotman River. George was severely wounded in the chest. The Mongol commanders, however, were unable to advance further into the Caucasus at that time due to the demands of the war against the Khwarezmian Empire, and turned back south to [[Hamadan]]. Once Khwarezmian resistance was all but mopped up, the Mongols returned in force in January 1221. Though King George was initially reluctant to give battle after his previous defeat, Jebe and Subutai forced him to take action by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. The ensuing battle at Bardav (Pardav; modern-day [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]], [[Azerbaijan]]) was another decisive Mongol victory, obliterating Georgia's field army. Though Georgia lay bare, the Mongols had come as a small reconnaissance and plundering expedition, not an army of conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Mongols marched to the north plundering northeastern Armenia and [[Shirvan]] en route. This took them through the Caucasus into [[Alans|Alania]] and the South [[Russia]]n [[steppe]]s where the Mongols routed the [[Kievan Rus’|Rus’]]-[[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] armies at the [[Battle of the Kalka River]] (1223).
[[File:Caucasus_1245_AD_map_de.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Caucasus_1245_AD_map_de.png|thumb|Kingdom of Georgia, 1245 AD.]]
These surprise attacks left the Georgians in confusion as to the identity of their attackers: the record of one contemporary chronicler indicates that he is unaware of the nature of the attackers and does not mention them by name. In 1223, when the Mongols had seemingly deferred their plans regarding Georgia, King George IV's sister and successor Queen [[Rusudan of Georgia|Rusudan]] wrote in a letter to [[Pope]] [[Honorius III]], that the Georgians had presumed the Mongols were [[Christianity|Christians]] because they fought [[Muslim]]s, but they had turned out to be pagans. The Mongol invasion also inadvertently altered the fate of the 5th Crusade. Georgia had planned to send its splendid army to open up a second front in the north at the same time as the European crusaders invaded from the west. Because the Mongols annihilated the Georgian army, it could not help, and the European Crusaders spent critical time waiting inactively for their allies who would never come.&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the invasion of Transoxania in 1219 Genghis Khan used a Chinese catapult unit in battle, they were used again in 1220 in Transoxania. The Chinese may have used the catapults to hurl gunpowder bombs, since they already had them by this time. In the 1239-1240 Mongol invasion of the North Caucasus, Chinese weapons were once again used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esnWJkYRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=transoxania+chinese+gunpowder+catapult#v=onepage&amp;q=transoxania%20chinese%20gunpowder%20catapult&amp;f=false |title=Firearms: a global history to 1700   |author=Kenneth Warren Chase|accessdate=2011-11-28  |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=2003 |month= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-521-82274-2 |page=58 |pages= |quote=Chinggis Khan organized a unit of Chinese catapult specialists in 1214, and these men formed part of the first Mongol army to invade Transoania in 1219. This was not too early for true firearms, and it was nearly two centuries after catapult-thrown gunpowder bombs had been added to the Chinese arsenal. Chinese siege equipment saw action in Transoxania in 1220 and in the north Caucasus in 1239-40. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mongol conquest of Georgia proper==
The third and final invasion of the Caucasus by the Mongols took place in 1236. This offensive, which would prove the ruin of Georgia, was preceded by the devastating conflict with Jalal ad-Din [[Mingburnu]], a refugee shah of Khwarezmia, who had demanded in 1225, that the Georgian government support his war against the Mongols. The ensuing Khwarezmian attack, [[Tbilisi]] was captured in 1226, and much of the former strength and prosperity of the Kingdom of Georgia was destroyed, leaving the country largely defenseless in the face of the forthcoming Mongol conquests.

After the death of Mingburnu in 1231, the Mongols' hands were finally free and the prominent Mongol commander [[Chormaqan]] led, in 1236, a large army against Georgia and its vassal Armenian princedoms. Most of the Georgian and Armenian nobles, who held military posts along the frontier regions submitted without any serious opposition or confined their resistance to their castles while others preferred to flee to safer areas. Queen Rusudan had to evacuate [[Tbilisi]] for [[Kutaisi]] and some people went into the mountainous part of Georgia, leaving [[eastern Georgia]] (Non-mountain part) in the hands of [[atabek]] [[Avag Mkhargrdzeli]] and Egarslan Bakurtsikheli, who made peace with the Mongols and agreed to pay them tribute. The only Georgian great noble to have resisted was [[Ivane I Jaqeli|Iwane Jakeli-Tsikhisjvreli]], prince of [[Samtskhe]]. His extensive possessions were fearfully devastated, and Iwane had to finally, with the consent of Queen Rusudan, submit to the invaders in 1238. The Mongol armies chose not to cross the [[Likhi Range]] in pursuit of the Georgian queen, leaving western Georgia relatively spared of the rampages. Rusudan attempted to gain support from Pope [[Gregory IX]], but without any success. Atabek Avag arranged her submission in 1243, and Georgia officially acknowledged the [[Great Khan]] as its overlord. The country was forced to pay an annual tribute of 50,000 gold pieces and support the Mongols with an army.

==Mongol rule==
{{see also|Armenia under the Ilkhanate}}
[[File:Georgian_Cavalry.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Georgian_Cavalry.jpg|thumb|245x245px|Georgian knights.]]
The Mongols created the [[Vilayet]] of Gurjistan, which included Georgia and the whole [[South Caucasus]], where they ruled indirectly, through the Georgian monarch, the latter to be confirmed by the Great Khan upon his/her ascension. With the death of Rusudan in 1245, an interregnum began during which the Mongols divided the Caucasus into eight [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]s. Exploiting the complicated issue of succession, the Mongols had the Georgian nobles divided into two rival parties, each of which advocated their own candidate to the crown. These were [[David VII of Georgia|David VII "Ulu"]], an illegitimate son of George IV, and his cousin [[David VI of Georgia|David VI "Narin"]], son of [[Rusudan of Georgia|Rusudan]]. After a [[Tsotne Dadiani|failed plot]] against the Mongol rule in Georgia (1245), [[Güyük Khan]] made, in 1247, both pretenders co-kings, in eastern and western parts of the kingdom respectively. The system of dumans was abolished, but the Mongols closely watched the Georgian administration in order to secure a steady flow of taxes and tributes from the subject peoples, who were also pressed into the Mongol armies.

Large Georgian contingents fought under the Mongol banners at [[Alamut]] (1256), [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Baghdad]] (1258), [[Battle of Ain Jalut|Ain Jalut]] (1260) and elsewhere, losing tens of thousands of soldiers while Georgia, and the Caucasus in general, was left without native defenders against the Mongol forces dispatched to suppress spontaneous revolts erupting in protest to heavy taxation and the onerous burden of military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbedrosian.com/atmi3.htm ''The Turco-Mongol Invasions and the Lords of Armenia in the 13-14th Centuries'', R. Bedrosian's Ph.D. Dissertation (Columbia University, 1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, in the [[Battle of Köse Dag]] (1243), where the Mongols crushed the [[Seljuks]] of [[Sultanate of Rum|Rüm]], at least three thousand Georgian auxiliaries fought in the Mongol ranks, while the Georgian prince [[Akhaltsikheli|Shamadavle of Akhaltsikhe]] was a commander in the Seljuk army.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Eureka/Enterprises/2493/caucbord.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:25:13  ''The Caucasian Borderland''. (Excerpts from A lecture by [[WED Allen]] delivered at the meeting of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], London, on May 4, 1942]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1256, Georgia was placed under the Mongol empire of [[Ilkhanate]], centered on [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]). In 1259–1260, Georgian nobles, led by David Narin, rose against the Mongols, and succeeding in separation of [[Imereti]] (western Georgia) from the Mongol-controlled eastern Georgia. David Ulu decided to join his cousin in rebellion, but was defeated near [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] and once again submitted to Mongol rule. Beginning with 1261, the Caucasus became a theater of the series of conflicts fought between Il-Khanids and another Mongol empire of [[Golden Horde]] centered in the lower [[Volga]] with its capital at [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]].

Georgia's unity was shattered; the nobles were encouraged to rise against the crown that naturally facilitated the Mongol control of the country. In 1266, Prince [[Sargis I Jaqeli|Sargis Jakeli]] of Samtskhe (with [[Akhaltsikhe]] as the capital) was granted special protection and patronage by the khan [[Abaqa]], thus winning virtual independence from the Georgian crown. The next (eastern) Georgian king [[Demetre II of Georgia|Demetre II]], "the Devoted" (1259–1289), through maneuvering in the intrigues that divided the Il-khans, attempted to revive his country, but suspected in an abortive coup against [[Arghun Khan]], he had, to save Georgia from invasion, to agree to surrender and be executed. Then the kingdom fell into near anarchy. While western Georgia maintained a perilous independence from the Ilkhans, eastern Georgia suffered from both heavy tribute and unstable political situation. In religious matters the Mongols were generally tolerant even though many churches and monasteries were taxed. An uprising by [[David VIII of Georgia|David VIII]] (1292–1310), though long-lasting, did not lead to the liberation of Georgia, but prompted a series of devastating punitive expeditions. The Mongols attempted to retain the control over the country by raising and bringing down the rival monarchs and by inciting the civil strife, but their influence over Georgia gradually weakened with the disintegration of the Il-khan power in Persia.

==Revival and collapse of the kingdom of Georgia==
There was a brief period of reunion and revival under [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]] (1299–1302, 1314–1346). With the support of Chupan, ulus-beg of the Ilkhanate, George eliminated his domestic opponents who remained independent of the Georgian crown. George V conquered Imereti uniting all of Georgian Kingdom before the death of the last effective Ilkhan Abu Sai'd. In 1319 George and the Mongols suppressed the rebellion of the Ilkhanid governor of Georgia, Qurumshi.&lt;ref&gt;W. Barthold, ' Die persische Inschrift an der Mauer der Manucehr-Moschee zu Ani ', trans.and edit. W. Hinz, ZDMG, Bd. 101, 1951, 246;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spuler, Die Mongolen in Iran, p. 121;&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably due to the internal strife between the Mongol khanates and ilkhanid generals, almost all Mongol troops in Georgia withdrew in 1320s.&lt;ref&gt;Marxist historians believe that George repulsed the Ilkhanids and his country became independent. However, no original sources and historical records mention any open challenge of George after 1327. He remained neutral during the internal strife of the Ilkhans in 1336-1353.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wakhusht, Sak'art'velos istoria, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; The Ilkhan Abu Sai'd (d.1335) exempted Ani and the neighbouring districts of Georgi from any kind of taxes.&lt;ref&gt;ZDMG, Bd. 101, 1951, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1321 letter of Avignon mentions schismatic people (Georgians) who are a part of Tatar Empire (Ilkhanate).&lt;ref&gt;Tea Tsitlanadze, Tea Karchava, Giorgi Kavtaradze - Towards the Clarification of the Identity and Sphere of Activities of the Missionaries who Visited the Orient and Georgia in the 14th century,p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1327 there occurred in Persia the most dramatic event of the reign of the Il-Khan Abu Sa'id, namely the disgrace and execution of the once all-powerful minister Chupan. Thus it was a heavy blow and George lost his patron at the Mongol court. Chupan's son Mahmud, who commanded the Mongol garrison in Georgia, was arrested by his own troops and executed. Subsequently, Iqbalshah, son of Qutlughshah, was appointed to be Mongol governor of Georgia (Gurjistan). In 1330-31 George V the Brilliant annexed Imereti uniting all of Georgia in the process. Therefore, four years prior the last effective Ilkhan Abu Sai'd's demise, two kingdoms of Georgia united again. In 1334, the post of the Ilkhanid governor in Georgia was given to Shaykh Hasan of the [[Jalayir]] by Abu Sai'd.&lt;ref&gt;Ta'rfkh-i Shaikh Uwais (History of Shaikh Uwais), trans. and ed. J. B. van Loon, The Hague, 1954, 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Timurids, much of Georgia was still under the Mongol Jalayirids and Chobanids.&lt;ref&gt;PETER JACKSON and Lockhart - THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF IRAN, vol.6, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; The eight onslaughts of the [[Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur]] between 1386 and 1403 dealt a great blow to the Georgian kingdom. Its unity was finally shattered and, by 1491, Georgia was shattered  into a number of petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the Early Modern period struggled to maintain their independence against [[Safavid]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination until Georgia was finally annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1801.

The use of '''music at sporting events''' is a practice that is thousands of years old, but has recently had a resurgence as a noted phenomenon. Some sports have specific traditions with respect to pieces of music played at particular intervals. Others have made the presentation of music very specific to the team—even to particular players. Music may be used to build the energy of the fans, and music may also be introduced in ways that are less directly connected with the action in a sporting event.

==History of music at sporting events==
The [[ancient Greeks]] intently tied the performance of music to sporting events, particularly at their quadrenniel Olympic games.
:"The extent to which cultural elements were included in the Pan-Hellenic games is enlightening. At several festivals, including Delphi, Isthmia and Athens, music played a prominent role in the athletic contests."{{ref|Romano}}
The revival of the Olympic games in 1896 also incorporated music into the festivities surrounding the competitions. On March 25 of that year, "the [[Philharmonic Orchestra]] played the [[National Anthem]] and the first [[Olympic Hymn]], written by poet [[Kostis Palamas]] and set to music by the well-known Greek composer [[Spyridon Samaras]]."

==Music used for dramatic effect==
Composer [[Carl Orff]]'s [[O Fortuna]] is most commonly played over a sports venue's public-address system, just before the start of many important, significant professional and collegiate games.

Within its first two notes, coupled with its booming operatic vocals and percussive instrumentation, Orff’s ''O Fortuna'' is based upon a 13th-century poem entitled,'' [[Carmina Burana]]''.  Orff's legendary composition laments fate, and it forms the beginning and end of his interpretation of the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-classical-music-pieces-men-should-know_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association of songs with sporting events==
Certain songs have historically been associated with particular sporting events.  Fans of the home team at collegiate athletic events may serenade the losing visitors with a song recorded by [[Steam (band)|Steam]], titled "[[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye]]", with its familiar refrain, "na na, na na na na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye."

[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s standards '"[[We Will Rock You]]" and "[[We Are the Champions]]" have also become common fare at sporting events, as have Five Stone's "Make Noise", [[Gary Glitter]]'s "[[Rock and Roll Part 2]]", and [[Zombie Nation (band)|Zombie Nation]]'s "Kernkraft 400". Most collegiate sports are accompanied by a [[band (music)|band]] that plays [[brass instruments|brass]] and [[drum]] [[instrumental music]] designed to accentuate the experience.

===Basketball music===
At [[NBA]] games, repetitive [[Organ (music)|organ]] music is played at key points of the game. For example, the announcers often play the "[[Charge (fanfare)|Charge]]" fanfare to accompany the home team entering the visitor's side of the court with possession of the ball. A different theme is used to encourage the home team in defense of their own side of the court. Many NBA teams now play a particular theme to accompany the home team taking the court to begin the game. They also use chant such as the defence chant to show support and pump up the crowd.

The NCAA does not use organ music, but in many Division I schools, a  smaller pep band plays at games (as compared to the full-size football marching bands).  However, during a 2004 game between [[Michigan State University]] and the [[University of Kentucky]] at [[Ford Field]], both teams' full football marching bands played.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Baseball music===
Ballpark music performed by an [[organist]] debuted at Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]] in 1941, and had spread to most other [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] parks by the 1960s.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, pre-recorded pop and rock music began to supplement the organ music (or replace it entirely) at many ballparks.{{ref|organ}} A very popular theme song is "[[Meet the Mets]]" from 1962 when the Mets joined the MLB. The Mets also had a theme song for their World Series run in 1986, it was "Lets go Mets".

In the modern evolution of the sport, many athletes now have "theme songs" that are played when they come up to bat. Slate notes that Major League Baseball players "can pick several songs as personal themes for their plate appearances, sometimes a rotation of four different tracks a game." Indeed, in 2004, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the longtime organist for [[Dodger Stadium]] "has been usurped by a deejay who sits directly below her. He plays a selection of hip-hop and rock, interspersed with devices designed to pump up the crowd and the stadium's volume." In that same year, the [[Dropkick Murphys]]' [[Tessie#Dropkick Murphys version|version]] of [[Tessie#Broadway &amp; Royal Rooters version|a 1902 Red Sox fight song]] ended up inspiring [[Red Sox Nation|Red Sox fandom]], as [[Boston Red Sox|their team]] headed to victory in both the [[2004 ALCS]] and the [[2004 World Series]].

The [[Atlanta Braves]] are known for an organist whose primary duty is playing the visiting player's walkup music, which is often fan-selected or plays on a player's name, with special dispensation for certain players.  Former Braves usually are greeted with the theme to [[Welcome Back, Kotter]].  Georgia natives having the popular state anthem [[Georgia on My Mind]].  Players who played college baseball at one of the currently 14 [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) or currently 14 [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) schools (both conferences' fan bases reach the city) or Big Ten–school Maryland (which had been an ACC member until the 2013-14 season, since former Terrapins probably made visits to the state of Georgia while playing college baseball) receive their respective school's fight song.  (The fight song is played for all players who played at current ACC-schools Louisville, Notre Dame, and Pittsburgh or current SEC-schools Missouri and Texas A&amp;M—the five most recent members of the respective conferences in baseball—even if their team played in the American (then–Big East) or Big 12 conference at the time.)

====Repertoire====

In some cases a particular song may be played at a specific time in the game.

''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' is often played or sung at major- or minor-league [[baseball]] games, typically during the [[seventh-inning stretch]].

At [[Fenway Park]], [[Neil Diamond]]'s song, "[[Sweet Caroline]]," is played during the eighth inning of [[Boston Red Sox]] home games, and has been a regular part of the program since 2002.

Since 2006, ''Sweet Caroline'' has also played over the sound system during the middle of the eighth inning of [[New York Mets]] home games.

Consequently, Diamond's hit single became a standing tradition after several years of playing it based upon the home-team's performance.{{ref|Caroline}}

The National Football League team, the Buffalo Bills, have been credited for playing "Seven Nation Army" by the White Stripes before each team kickoff.

===Hockey music===
Many [[NHL]] hockey teams feature an organist to lead crowd chants, cues and other prompts. Hockey organists may adapt popular music for the organ and play genres such as rock, film scores, or pop on the organ in instrumental form.

===Association football music===
In the many countries where [[football (soccer)|football]] is popular, and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in particular, football music is a varied and popular subgenre of popular music.  Songs are often released to coincide with specific events, such as the [[Football World Cup|World Cup]], or to become anthems for particular teams.  Since football has a huge spectator base, such songs are often very popular on the charts.  Examples of music created to be football songs include [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s "World in Motion", and "Three Lions" by [[The Lightning Seeds]] in collaboration with comedians and football fans: [[David Baddiel]] and [[Frank Skinner]].  A subset of football music is novelty football music, which typically includes humorous lyrics.  Examples of novelty football songs include "[[Vindaloo (single)|Vindaloo]]" by [[Fat Les]], "Meat Pie, Sausage Roll", and numerous [[Frank Sidebottom]] songs.

The [[Village People]]/[[Pet Shop Boys]] song "[[Go West (song)|Go West]]" has also become popular, and an instrumental version of the music was used as the theme for the [[FIFA World Cup 2006|2006 World Cup]].

[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] adopted "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]", specifically the version performed by [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] band [[Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers]], as its theme song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coslett|first=Paul|title=You'll never walk alone|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2008/06/09/youll_never_walk_alone_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC Liverpool|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] have adopted [[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]] as their song whilst [[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]] can be heard at games involving [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Moon:Significance|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/news/features/2011/march/blue-moon-significance|publisher=www.mcfc.co.uk|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] fans' anthem has been [[Delilah (Tom Jones song)|Delilah]] since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke City fans back Tom Jones's Delilah to top charts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-13291654|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme music in American football===
Many College Football teams have [[marching band]]s that play during the game at football games and march on the field during halftime.

Currently two teams have marching bands in the NFL.  The [[Washington Redskins]] have featured a marching band since 1938, and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] have featured a marching band since its 1996 inception;  however, [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens]] dating to the All-American Football Conference (a league which merged with the NFL) team in Baltimore, MD, featured a marching band when it began in 1947, went through many years with the Colts, and continued operations after being abandoned by the Irsay family when the team moved to Indianapolis in 1984.  However, that band stayed intact in the area and began playing at other events, including the [[Preakness Stakes]], and  was used for the two-year CFL experiment known as the Baltimore Stallions.  When the NFL returned to Baltimore with an expansion team in 1996 (the NFL suspended the Cleveland Browns franchise, and awarded an "expansion team" in Baltimore in a complex deal), the loyal band was rewarded by becoming the new Ravens' marching band. For the two years that the Ravens played at the Memorial Statium (former home of the Baltimore Colts) they remained "The Marching Colts." Once the new stadium opened in 1998, the group's name was changed to Baltimore's Marching Ravens to reflect the new era for the new team. During their existence, the [[Los Angeles Rams]] had a marching band during their time at both the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|LA Coliseum]] and [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Anaheim Stadium]]. The practice was abandoned when the team relocated to St. Louis.

The [[Seattle Seahawks]] adopted [[The Verve]]'s "Bittersweet Symphony" as their theme song, and it is heard whenever something special happens to the home team. For instance, when the team takes the field to a sellout crowd, the song blares throughout the reverberating stadium, or when the Seahawks score the game-winning field goal, it would undoubtedly be played. When the New England Patriots come out from the tunnel, Ozzy Osbourne's hit "Crazy Train" is played. A common song for the [[New Orleans Saints]] during and since their Super Bowl Season is "Half-time", or "Stand Up and Get Crunk" by  [[Ying Yang Twins]]. The [[Green Bay Packers]] play [[Todd Rundgren]]'s "[[Bang the Drum All Day]]" after every Packers touchdown at [[Lambeau Field]].

A common choice of music to be played over PA systems as games are being kicked off is "[[Start Me Up]]" by the [[Rolling Stones]] and "[[Welcome to the Jungle]]" by [[Guns N' Roses]].

===Theme music in other sports===
Entire teams will occasionally adopt a theme song (such as the [[Chicago Bears]] with their 1985 ''[[Super Bowl Shuffle]]'', sung by the members of the team). Up until 2011, [[Monday Night Football]] had its own theme, sung by [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]; the [[Hockey Night in Canada]] theme has sometimes been referred to as Canada's second national anthem; and the [[Olympic Games]] have long had powerful theme music composed to accompany ceremonies opening and closing the games.

Perhaps the most extreme example of this can be found in [[professional wrestling]] and some [[mixed martial arts]] promotions, where almost every wrestler has an entry theme written to suit their particular character.

An album entitled "ESPN Presents Stadium Anthems" has been released that includes many songs that are played over the Public Address system at North American sporting events.  Similar albums, such as [[Jock Jams]] have been released in the past.

{{Northwest Airlines Flight 253}}
'''[[Northwest Airlines]] Flight 253''' was an international passenger flight from [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] in [[Haarlemmermeer]], Netherlands, to [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] in [[Romulus, Michigan]], United States. The flight was the target of a failed [[al-Qaeda]] bombing attempt on [[Christmas Day]], December&amp;nbsp;25, 2009, in which a passenger tried to set off [[chemical explosive]]s sewn to his underwear.  There were 290 people on board the aircraft&amp;mdash;an [[Airbus A330#Airbus A330-300|Airbus A330-323E]] operated by [[Northwest Airlines]], which had merged with [[Delta Air Lines]] the year before.  Had the attempt succeeded, it would have surpassed [[American Airlines Flight 191]] as the deadliest [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation occurrence]] on U.S. soil and tied [[Iran Air Flight 655]] as the eighth-deadliest of all time.  The incident was also the second in [[2009 in aviation|2009]] involving an Airbus A330, after the crash of [[Air France Flight 447]] on June&amp;nbsp;1. This was also the final accident/incident involving [[Northwest Airlines]] as it closed down a month later when it merged with [[Delta Air Lines]].

The convicted bomber in the "Christmas Day bombing attempt"&lt;ref name="LA Times Christmas Day bombing attempt"&gt;{{vcite news|author=Daragahi, Borzou|title=Bin Laden takes responsibility for Christmas Day bombing attempt|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/24/world/la-fgw-bin-laden25-2010jan25|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was 23-year-old [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], a [[Nigerian]] man who had concealed plastic explosives in his underwear but failed to detonate them properly. A Dutch passenger, [[#Jasper Schuringa|Jasper Schuringa]], tackled and restrained him and put out the fire with the aid of others. Abdulmutallab was handcuffed while the pilot safely landed the plane. In all, three people were injured: Abdulmutallab, Schuringa, and one other passenger. Upon landing in Detroit, Abdulmutallab was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment of his burns. On December&amp;nbsp;28, 2009, [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing. On January&amp;nbsp;6, 2010, a federal [[grand jury]] [[indictment|indicted]] Abdulmutallab on six criminal charges, including attempted use of a [[weapon of mass destruction]] and [[attempted murder]].

Reports indicated that the U.S. had received intelligence regarding a powder bomb planned attack by a [[Yemen]]-based [[Nigeria]]n man. While describing security measures taken by U.S. and foreign governments in the immediate aftermath of the attack, [[U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[Janet Napolitano]], said, "once the incident occurred, the system worked." She cited "the actions of the passengers and the crew on this flight" to show "why that system is so important."&lt;ref name="This Week system worked"/&gt; After heavy criticism, she stated the following day that the system "failed miserably", this time referring to Abdulmutallab's boarding the flight with an explosive device.&lt;ref name="Reuters system failed miserably"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BQ0Z420091228|title=System to keep air travel safe failed: Napolitano|author=Charles, Deborah|date=December 28, 2009|agency=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] called the U.S.'s failure to prevent the bombing attempt "totally unacceptable", and ordered an investigation.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Obama totally unacceptable"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/6908709/Barack-Obama-admits-unacceptable-systemic-failure-in-Detroit-plane-attack.html|title=Barack Obama admits 'unacceptable systemic failure' in Detroit plane attack|author=Allen, Nick|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (UK)|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2010, it was reported that President Obama had authorized military action that took out [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], a Muslim cleric who was accused by the Obama administration of being a Yemen-based al-Qaeda commander behind the plot.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07yemen.html|title=U.S. Approves Targeted Killing of American Cleric|author=Scott Shane|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 6, 2010|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Awlaki was killed on September 30, 2011.

===Getting on Flight 253===
On [[Christmas Eve]], December 24, 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian, boarded [[Virgin Nigeria]] Flight 804 at [[Accra Airport]] in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]] and  arrived at [[Murtala Muhammed Airport]] in [[Lagos]], Nigeria. Eight days earlier at the [[KLM|KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] office in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], he had paid $2,831 in cash for his Lagos-Amsterdam-Detroit round-trip ticket with a January 8, 2010 return date.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|author=Mason, Jeff|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BU3NZ20100101|title=Obama summons intel chiefs for security talks|publisher=Thomson Reuters|agency=Reuters|date=December 31, 2009| accessdate=January 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Drum]], a political blogger for ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', said that Ghana and Nigeria are largely cash-based economies, so it would be normal for someone to buy an airplane ticket with cash in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Drum|Drum, Kevin]]. "[http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/01/revisiting-intelligence-failure Revisiting the Intelligence Failure]." ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', 11 January 2010. Retrieved on March 28, 2012. "Nigeria and Ghana (where Abdulmutallab bought his ticket) are largely cash economies. Andrew Sprung tells us that Abdulmutallab "would certainly raise no alarms by paying cash.""&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdulmutallab left Lagos on Christmas Eve at 23:00 aboard KLM Flight 588, a [[Boeing 777]] bound for Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="NYT-20091226-2"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/us/27plane.html|title=Passengers' Quick Action Halted Attack|date=December 26, 2009 |author=Shane, Scott |coauthors=Lipton, Eric|publisher=The New York Times| accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Amsterdam, on Christmas Day, Abdulmutallab checked in for Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit with only carry-on luggage. On March&amp;nbsp;24, 2011, the ''[[Associated Press]]'' reported that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket there was the least expensive of tickets to potential U.S. targets, which included [[Chicago]] and [[Houston]]. Initially, some media rumored that Abdulmutallab tried to fly to Detroit because it was a major hub of the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. automotive industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/03/24/2011-03-24_christmas_underwear_bomber_targeted_detroit_because_it_was_the_cheapest_flight_r.html?r=news|title=Christmas 2009 'underwear bomber' targeted Detroit because it was the cheapest flight: report|date=March 24, 2011|author=Caulfield, Philip|agency=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-boarding event====
Kurt and Lori Haskell, an American couple, said that while waiting to board Flight 253 at Schiphol Airport, they saw a "poor-looking African-American teenager around 16 or 17," who Kurt Haskell claims was Abdulmutallab, with a second man, who was "sharp-dressed", possibly of Indian descent, around 50 years old, and who spoke "in an American accent similar to my own."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/pr/haskell-truth-flight253.html |title=The Truth About Flight 253 Has Been Revealed by Kurt Haskell |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205185250/http://www.lewrockwell.com/pr/haskell-truth-flight253.html |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="detnews1"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.ticklethewire.com/2009/12/29/atty-says-he-saw-man-try-to-help-nigerian-on-flight-without-a-passport/|title=Passenger Says Accused Terrorist Got Help Boarding|author=Egan, Paul|date=December 28, 2009|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lori Haskell, the second man told the ticket agent: "We need to get this man on the plane. He doesn't have a [[passport]]." The ticket agent said nobody was allowed to board without a passport. The well-dressed man replied: "We do this all the time; he's from [[Sudan]]."&lt;ref name="CNN 12-28-09" &gt;{{vcite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0912/28/acd.01.html|title=Investigating the Northwest Airlines Terror Attack|work=Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees|date=Aired December 28, 2009|format=Transcript|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dfp 12-06-09" &gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20091230/NEWS06/912300364/FBI-probes-account-of-Mich.-couple|title=FBI probes account of Michigan couple in Flight 253 case|authorPatton, Naomi and Schmitt, Ben|date=December 30, 2009|publisher=The Detroit Free Press|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lori Haskell said the two men were directed down a corridor, to talk to a manager.

The substance that the suspect tried to detonate was more than {{convert|80|g}} of [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate]] (PETN), a [[crystalline]] powder that is often the [[active ingredient]] of plastic explosives, the high explosive [[acetone peroxide|triacetone triperoxide]] (TATP),&lt;ref name="detroitfreepress 01-07-10"/&gt; and other ingredients.&lt;ref name="indict"/&gt; PETN is among the most powerful of explosives, and chemically resembles [[nitroglycerin]].&lt;ref name="NYT PETN explosives"/&gt; The powder was analyzed by the FBI at [[FBI Academy|Quantico]],&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121927036&amp;ps=cprs|title=Terrorism Links Uncertain In Airplane Attack|date=December 26, 2009|author=Temple-Raston, Dina |work=NPR| accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an FBI [[affidavit]] filed in the Eastern District of Michigan&lt;ref name=complaint /&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt; reflected preliminary findings that the device contained PETN.&lt;ref name="KATU"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.katu.com/news/national/80140857.html |title=Christmas Day terrorism suspect is charged |date=December 26, 2009 |author=Barrett, Devlin |agency=The Associated Press | publisher=KATU | accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities also found the remains of the syringe.&lt;ref name=complaint /&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt; The suspect apparently carried the PETN onto the plane in a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}}-long&lt;ref name=acid /&gt; soft plastic container, possibly a [[condom]], attached to his underwear.

In a public test conducted by the [[BBC]], the test plane's [[fuselage]] remained intact, indicating that the bomb would not have destroyed the aircraft, though it did show window damage that would likely have led to cabin depressurization. This test was undertaken at ground level, with zero pressure differential between the cabin and the surrounding environment. This was claimed to have no effect on the overall result of the test, which aimed to simulate the explosion at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. It was not demonstrated what would happen at a typical cruising altitude of between {{convert|31000|ft|m}} and {{convert|39000|ft|m}}, where the pressure differential would have caused the fuselage to be under a far greater stress than at ground level.&lt;ref name="BBC bomb test"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548021.stm|title=Boeing 747 survives simulation bomb blast|date=March 4, 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of January 2010, a Yemeni journalist, Abdulelah Hider Sha’ea, said he met with al-Awlaki, who told Sha'ea that he had met and spoken with Abdulmutallab in Yemen in late 2009. Al-Awlaki also reportedly called Abdulmutallab one of his students, said that he supported what Abdulmutallab did but did not tell him to do it, and that he was proud of Abdulmutallab.  A ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist who listened to a digital recording of the meeting said that while the tape's authenticity could not be independently verified, the voice resembled that on other recordings of al-Awlaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|author=Worth, Robert F|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/world/middleeast/01yemen.html|title=Cleric in Yemen Admits Meeting Airliner Plot Suspect, Journalist Says|date=January 31, 2010|accessdate=January 31, 2010|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Awlaki released a tape in March 2010, in which he said, in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:To the American people ... nine years after 9/11, nine years of spending, and nine years of beefing up security you are still unsafe even in the holiest and most sacred of days to you, Christmas Day....

:Our brother Umar Farouk has succeeded in breaking through the security systems that have cost the U.S. government alone over 40 billion dollars since 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/18/raw-data-partial-transcript-radical-clerics-tape/|title=Raw Data: "Partial Transcript of Radical Cleric's Tape"|publisher=Fox News Network|work=FOX News|date=March 18, 2010|accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beginning December 18, 2009, President Obama authorized attacks on suspected Al-Qaeda bases in Yemen. On April 6, 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported that President Obama had authorized the targeted killing of al-Awlaki.&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt; Al-Qaeda in Yemen released a video in 2010 that showed Abdulmutallab and others training in a desert camp. The tape includes a statement from Abdulmutallab justifying his actions against "the Jews and the Christians and their agents."&lt;ref name="ABC shooting video"&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://abcnews.com/Blotter/underwear-bomber-video-training-martyrdom-statements/story?id=10479470|title=Underwear Bomber: New Video of Training, Martyrdom Statements|author=Cole, Matthew; Ross, Brian; Atta, Nasser|publisher=ABC News|date=April 26, 2010|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Yemen on September 30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/30/anwar-alawlaki-usborn-mus_n_988397.html?icid=maing-grid7%7Cmain5%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk3%7C100362 | work=Huffington Post | title=Officials: U.S.-Born Muslim Cleric Killed In Yemen | date=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Qaeda involvement===
On December 28, 2009, Obama, in his first address after the incident, said that the event "demonstrates that an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist".&lt;ref name="CNN Obama initial remarks"&gt;{{vcite news|author=Keck, Kristi|title=Everyday heroes last line of defense in terror fight|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/13/terrorism.public.role/index.html|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) announced that it was responsible for the attempted bombing. AQAP said that the attack, during "their [Americans'] celebration of the Christmas holidays", was to "avenge U.S. attacks on the militants in Yemen".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|author=Sudam, Mohamed|title=Qaeda group claims U.S. jet plot, vows more attacks|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BR31020091228|date=December 28, 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|title=Al-Qaeda claims Christmas Day US flight bomb plot |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8433151.stm|date=December 28, 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, an audio tape said to be from [[Osama bin Laden]] praised the bombing attempt and warned of further attacks against the United States, but did not claim responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="NYT Hailed"&gt;{{vcite news|author=Schmitt, Eric; Shane, Scott|publisher=The New York Times|title=Christmas Bombing Try Is Hailed by bin Laden|date=January 24, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/world/25binladen.html|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short recording, which was broadcast on [[Al Jazeera]] television, said: "The message delivered to you through the plane of the heroic warrior Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was a confirmation of the previous messages sent by the heroes of the September 11."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|author=Bone, James|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article7000386.ece|title=Fears of new attack as bin Laden reclaims front line of global jihad|date=January 25, 2010|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/01/201012415287209336.html|title=Bin Laden warns US of more attacks|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=January 25, 2010|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adviser to the U.S. President said he could not confirm whether the voice was that of bin Laden.

While in custody, Abdulmutallab told authorities he had been directed by al-Qaeda. He said he had obtained the device in Yemen, and was told to detonate it when the plane was over the United States.&lt;ref name="NY Daily News" /&gt;  Abdulmutallab said he had contacted al-Qaeda through a radical Yemeni imam (who according to ''The New York Times'' on December 26 was not believed to be al-Awlaki)&lt;ref name="chargesNYTIMES"&gt;{{vcite news|author=Shane, Scott, Schmitt, Eric and Lipton, Eric|title=U.S. Charges Suspect, Eyeing Link to Qaeda in Yemen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/us/27terror.html|date=December 26, 2009|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had reached through the internet.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported on December 25 that a counter-terrorism official had told them Abdulmutallab's claim of connection with al-Qaeda "may have been aspirational".&lt;ref name=NYT-20091225&gt;{{vcite news|author=O'Connor, Anahad and Schmitt, Eric|title=Terror Attempt Seen as Man Tries to Ignite Device on Jet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/us/26plane.html|date=December 25, 2009|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But U.S. Representative [[Jane Harman]] (D-Calif.), Chairman of the [[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment|House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment]], said the following day that a federal official briefed lawmakers about "strong suggestions of a Yemen-al Qaeda connection" with the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|author=Shear, Michael D.|coauthors= Hsu, Spenser S. and Raghavan, Sudarsan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/26/AR2009122601311.html?hpid=topnews|title=Officials: Terror suspect may have ties to al-Qaeda network in Yemen|publisher=The Washington Post|date=December 26, 2009|accessdate=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 2, 2010, President Obama said that AQAP trained, equipped, and dispatched Abdulmutallab, and vowed retribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/03/nation/la-na-terror-yemen3-2010jan03|author=Meyer, Josh|title=Yemeni groups pose new set of terrorism threats|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|work=Article collections|date=January 2, 2010|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt 01-02-10"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/us/politics/03address.html?hpw|title=Obama Says Al Qaeda in Yemen Planned Bombing Plot, and He Vows Retribution|author=Baker, Peter|date=January 2, 2010|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to suggestions that the U.S. launch a military offensive against the alleged terrorists' sanctuary in Yemen, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted that Yemeni forces equipped with U.S. weapons and intelligence had carried out two major raids against AQAP shortly before the bombing attempt, and that the terror group may have lost top leaders in a December 24, 2009 [[airstrike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/29/AR2009122902475.html?hpid=opinionsbox1|title=How to fight al-Qaeda's offshoot in Yemen|publisher=The Washington Post|date=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2011, the ''Associated Press'' reported that before Abdulmutallab set off on his mission, he visited the home of al-Qaeda manager [[Fahd al-Quso]] to discuss the plot and the workings of the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chibrknews-chicago-flight-was-too-expensive-for-alqaida-bomb-suspect-20110324,0,1545625.story|title=Chicago flight too costly for al-Qaida bomb suspect|author=Associated Press|date=March 24, 2011|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=March 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501075115/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chibrknews-chicago-flight-was-too-expensive-for-alqaida-bomb-suspect-20110324,0,1545625.story|archivedate=May 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ''AP'' said that Abdulmutallab targeted Detroit because the plane ticket there was cheaper than the tickets to either Houston or Chicago. This suggests that al-Qaeda in Yemen chose to attack "targets of opportunity," rather than Osama bin Laden's preference of "symbolic targets."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-24-underwear-bomber-cheaper-flight_N.htm|title=For al-Qaeda, Detroit was just the cheapest flight|author=Associated Press|date=March 24, 2011|agency=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett|Gannett Co.

==Jasper Schuringa==
Jasper Schuringa, who was en route to Miami, Florida for a vacation, stopped Abdulmutallab from causing too much damage and received burn injuries in the process. In a statement, Schuringa, who was in seat 20J on the flight, said he was able to locate Abdulmutallab, help to extinguish the fire that the explosive had caused, and helped to restrain Abdulmutallab using plastic cuffs.&lt;ref name="jasp"/&gt; Schuringa lives in Amsterdam, and was born in 1977 in [[Curaçao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article6343134.ab|title=Student försökte spränga flygplan|language=Swedish|publisher=Aftonbladet|work=Aftonbladet|accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schuringa is a graduate of [[Leiden University]], [[Leiden]].

The U.S. is examining what information it had before the attack, why its National Counterterrorism Center did not make a connection between the warning from Abdulmutallab's father and intercepts by the National Security Agency of conversations among Yemeni al-Qaida leaders about a "Nigerian" to be used for an attack (months before the attack took place), and why the suspect's U.S. visa was not withdrawn.&lt;ref name= st /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|author=MacAskill, Ewen|coauthors=Stratton, Allegra|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/31/intelligence-bomb-suspect-vague-available|title=US intelligence on plane bomb suspect was 'vague but available'; Security review blames human and systemic errors for failure|publisher=The Guardian|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=July 17 ,2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2010, [[James L. Jones]], the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], said Americans would feel "a certain shock" when a report detailing the intelligence failures that could have prevented the Christmas Day attack would be released that day. He said that President Obama would be "legitimately and correctly alarmed that things that were available, bits of information that were available, patterns of behavior that were available, were not acted on."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|publisher=Fox News|title=National Security Adviser Says Airline Bomber Report Will 'Shock' Americans|date=January 7, 2010|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/01/07/national-security-adviser-airline-bomber-report-shock/|accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. also increased the installation and use of full-body scanners in many of its major airports as a result of the attack. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including [[O'Hare International Airport]] in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following [[fiscal year]], starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat-down search or be searched with hand-held detectors.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg body scanners"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-05/u-s-adding-body-scanners-at-11-airports-napolitano-says.html|title=U.S. Adding Full-Body Bomb Scanners at 11 Airports (Update3)|author=Hughes, John|date=March 5, 2010|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune body scanners"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-met-airport-body-scanner-20100223,0,3580465.story |title=Full-body scanner arriving at O’Hare |author=Mack, Kristen |date=February 24, 2010 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |publisher=Tribune Company |accessdate=March 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227024929/http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-met-airport-body-scanner-20100223%2C0%2C3580465.story |archivedate=February 27, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under new rules prompted by the incident, airline passengers traveling to the U.S. from 14 nations would undergo extra screening: [[Afghanistan]], [[Algeria]], [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], and [[Yemen]].

[[Gordon Brown]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], said that the UK would take "whatever action was necessary".

In response to the incident and to comply with new U.S. regulations, the Canadian government said it would install full body scanners at major airports. The first 44&amp;nbsp;scanners were planned to be installed at airports in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Halifax.&lt;ref name="BodyScan"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/01/05/security-canada-us-airport.html|title=Body scanners coming to Canadian airports|date=Tuesday, January 5, 2010|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, [[ICTS International]], a security firm that provides security services to Schiphol airport,&lt;ref name=Haaretz10012010/&gt; and [[G4S]] (Group 4 Securicor Aviation Security B.V.), another security firm, traded blame over the security oversight, as did authorities at Schiphol Airport, the Federal Aviation Authority, and U.S. intelligence officials.&lt;ref name=Haaretz10012010&gt;{{vcite news|date=January 10, 2010|title=Israeli firm blasted for letting would-be plane bomber slip through|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israeli-firm-blasted-for-letting-would-be-plane-bomber-slip-through-1.261107|author=                                                                                                            Yossi Melman|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[Haaretz]]'', the failure was twofold: An intelligence failure, as Obama stated, in the poor handling of information that arrived at the State Department and probably also the CIA from both the father of the would-be bomber and the British security service; and a failure within the security system, including that of ICTS.&lt;ref name="Haaretz10012010"/&gt;

===Criminal charges and conviction===

In the back, a solitary green tree is visible atop a grassy mound, with a tower to its right.|Prison grounds at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Milan]], where Abdulmutallab was incarcerated, in [[York Charter Township, Michigan]]]]
On December 26, a [[criminal complaint]] was filed against Abdulmutallab in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]], charging him with two counts: placing a destructive device in, and attempting to destroy, a U.S. civil aircraft.&lt;ref name=complaint&gt;{{vcite news|author=US District Court, Eastern District of Michigan|title=US v.

On January 6, 2010, a federal grand jury indicted Abdulmutallab on six criminal counts including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder.  "Not guilty" pleas were entered on the behalf of Abdulmutallab at the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;

When asked about his decision to prosecute Abdulmutallab in federal court rather than have him detained under the [[law of war]], U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder defended his position, saying that it was "fully consistent with the long-established and publicly known policies and practices of the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the United States Government as a whole," and that he was confident that Abdulmutallab would be successfully prosecuted under the federal criminal law. Holder had originally been asked by U.S. Senator [[Mitch McConnell]], as well as several others, about his choice.&lt;ref name="Holder McConnell letter"&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/HolderLetterMcConnell_Abdulmutallab2.pdf |title=The Honorable Mitch McConnell |author=Holder, Jr., Eric H. |date=February 3, 2010 |publisher=Office of the Attorney General |accessdate=March 15, 2010 |location=Washington, D.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162954/http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/HolderLetterMcConnell_Abdulmutallab2.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2012, Abdulmutallab, who had pleaded guilty but remained unrepentant, was sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life in prison without the possibility of parole]].&lt;ref name=nyt2-16&gt;{{cite news |title=Would-Be Plane Bomber Is Sentenced to Life in Prison |author= |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/us/would-be-plane-bomber-sentenced-to-life.html|newspaper= The New York Times|work= |date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is currently incarcerated at the [[ADX Florence]] supermax prison, near [[Florence, Colorado]].

===Effect on travel===
The U.S. government did not raise the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] terrorist [[Homeland Security Advisory System|threat level]], orange at the time (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/explosives-northwest-airlines-plane-amsterdam-detroit/story?id=9423871|title=Man Attempts to Set Off Explosives on Detroit-Bound Airplane|date=December 25, 2009|author=Esposito, Richard; Mayerowitz, Scott|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; The Department of Homeland Security said that additional security measures would be in place for the remainder of the Christmas travel period.&lt;ref name="FOX" /&gt; The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports.&lt;ref name="NYT-20091226-2" /&gt;

On December 28, [[Transport Canada]] announced that for several days it would not allow passengers flying to the U.S. from Canada a carry-on bag, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|author=Allan Chernoff|coauthors=Taylor Gandossy and Sandra Endo|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/12/29/canada.carryons/|title=Canada limits carry-on baggage on flights into U.S.|publisher=CNN|date=December 29, 2009|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Airways]] said that passengers flying to the U.S. would only be permitted one carry-on item.&lt;ref name="NYT-20091226"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/us/27security.html|title=Restrictions Rise After Terrorism Attempt|date=December 26, 2009|author=Robbins, Liz; Maynard, Micheline|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries increased baggage screening, pat-down searches, and random searches for passengers traveling to the U.S. A spokesperson for Schiphol Airport said that heightened security would be in place for "an indefinite period".&lt;ref name="Reuters US"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BP0TS20091226|title=Europe tightens security after foiled U.S. attack|date=December 26, 2009|author=Baker, Luke|work=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of the extra measures said to have been put in place to prevent a follow-up attack, Stuart Clarke, a photoreporter from the British newspaper ''[[Daily Express]]'', claimed to have smuggled a syringe containing fluid, which could have been a liquid bomb detonator onto another plane. On January 3, 2010, Clarke said he boarded a jet from Schiphol Airport bound for Heathrow Airport just five days after the Christmas Day attack, and that the airport appeared to have imposed no additional security, such as precautionary pat-downs which could easily have discovered the syringe which he claimed he kept in his jacket pocket throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|author=Jarvis, David|url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/149412|title=Plane crazy: we carry a syringe on jet at terror airport|date=January 3, 2010|publisher=The Daily Express (UK)|accessdate=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. political fallout===
[[White House Press Secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said several times on Sunday [[talk show]]s that "the system had worked", a statement that engendered some controversy.&lt;ref name="Free Press" /&gt;&lt;ref name=thesystem&gt;{{vcite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=9443548| title=Analysis: Many Question "System Worked" Comment | last=Loven | first=Jennifer | authorlink=Jennifer Loven | date=December 29, 2009 | agency=Associated Press |publisher=ABC News| accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day they retracted the statements, saying that the system had in fact "failed miserably."&lt;ref name="thesystem"/&gt; According to Napolitano, her initial statement had referred to the rapid response to the attack that included alerts sent to the 128 other aircraft in U.S. airspace at the time, and new security requirements for the final hour of flight, rather than the security failures that allowed the attack to happen.&lt;ref name="first of many"&gt;{{vcite news|author=Whittell, Giles and Fresco, Adam|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6969645.ece|title=I'm the first of many, warns airline 'bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=The Times (UK)|accessdate=January 4, 2010|archiveurl=http://gunnyg.wordpress.com/2009/12/29/im-the-first-of-many-warns-airline-bomber-umar-farouk-abdulmutallab-by-giles-whittell-and-adam-fresco/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napolitano had originally stated on ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' that "once this incident occurred, everything went according to clockwork" and that "once the incident occurred, the system worked".&lt;ref name="This Week system worked"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-napolitano-gibbs-mcconnell/story?id=9428037&amp;page=2|title='This Week' Transcript: Napolitano, Gibbs, McConnell|date=December 27, 2009|work=This Week|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the attack, the U.S. [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|House Homeland Security Committee]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee]] both announced that they would hold hearings in January 2010 to investigate how the device passed through security, and whether further restrictions should be placed on air travel; the Senate hearings began on January 21.&lt;ref name="FOX News"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/26/lawmakers-attempted-airline-attack-disturbing-pledge-hold-hearings/|title=Congress to Probe Attempted Airline Attack, Consider Added Security Precautions|date=December 26, 2009|author=Levine, Mike; Herridge, Catherine; Wolff, Sarah|publisher=Fox News| accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/25/AR2009122501355.html|title=Airports intensify security measures worldwide in wake of failed bomb attack aboard U.S.-bound jetliner|date=December 26, 2009|author=D.

Four days after the attack, Obama said publicly that Abdulmutallab's ability to board the aircraft was the result of a systemic failure that included an inadequate sharing of information among U.S. and foreign government agencies. He called the situation "totally unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8434275.stm |title=US President Obama notes "system failure" over jet bomb |publisher=BBC News|date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered that a report be delivered detailing how some government agencies had failed to share or highlight potentially relevant information about the suspect before he allegedly tried to blow up the airliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/30/AR2009123003229.html?hpid=topnews |title=Obama to get report on intelligence failures in Abdulmutallab case | author=Karen DeYoung |publisher=The Washington Post|date=December 31, 2009 | accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later Obama received the briefing, which included statements that information about the suspect had failed to cross agency lines, and that the failures to communicate within the U.S. government had led to the threat posed by Abdulmutallab not being known by certain agencies until the attack. Obama said he would meet with security officials and specifically question why Abdulmutallab was not placed on the U.S. [[no-fly list]], despite the government having received warnings about his potential al-Qaeda links.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8436459.stm |title=Obama briefed on plane bomb security lapses |publisher=BBC News|date=December 31, 2009|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 2010, an official from the U.S. State Department said that Abdulmutallab's visa was not revoked because federal authorities believed that it would have compromised a larger investigation. The official, [[Patrick F. Kennedy]], said intelligence officials had told the State Department that letting Abdulmutallab keep his visa would allow for a greater chance of exposing the terrorist network.&lt;ref name="Detroit News kept visa"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20100127/NATION/1270405/Terror-suspect-kept-visa-to-avoid-tipping-off-larger-investigation|title=Terror suspect kept visa to avoid tipping off larger investigation|title2=Terror suspect's visa kept valid for larger probe, hearing told|author=Hurst, Nathan|date=January 27, 2010|work=The Detroit News|publisher=The Detroit News|accessdate=March 26, 2010|archiveurl=http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=S3wcGUjH|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg56189/html/CHRG-111hhrg56189.htm|title=Flight 253 : learning lessons from an averted tragedy : hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, second session, January 27, 2010.|author=United States House Committee on Homeland Security.|date=January 27, 2010|publisher=[[US GPO|United States Government Printing Office]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65cE9axWR?url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg56189/html/CHRG-111hhrg56189.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2012|deadurl=no|quote=We were ready to revoke the visa.

===Alleged subsequent plot===
On May 7, 2012, American officials claimed that they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253.&lt;ref name="cushman"&gt;Cushman, John H. Jr., "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/world/middleeast/us-says-terrorist-plot-to-attack-plane-foiled.html U.S. Thwarted New Qaeda Plot to Attack Plane, Officials Say]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, and would have been deployed near the anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.&lt;ref name=cushman /&gt;

An American official told ''[[MSNBC]]'' that the bomb was received by American security personnel in April, "was never near a plane" and "never posed a risk." They speculated that the bomb might have been constructed by [[Ibrahim al-Asiri]], who is accused of constructing the explosives used by [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;NBC News, "[http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/07/11583173-cia-foiled-al-qaida-plot-to-destroy-us-bound-airliner?lite CIA foiled al-Qaida plot to destroy US-bound airliner] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509071431/http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/07/11583173-cia-foiled-al-qaida-plot-to-destroy-us-bound-airliner?lite |date=May 9, 2012 }}, 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ruleta de la Muerte'' (1998)''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] event produced by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) that took place on July 18, 1998 in [[Palacio de los Deportes]], [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]]. The show featured the ''Ruleta de la Muerte''¨([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Roulette of Death") tournament, in which [[tag team]]s face off in a single elimination tournament, but unlike traditional tournaments it is the winning team that advances in the tournament. The losing team in the final match must wrestle each other in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' match, where either their [[wrestling mask|mask]] or their hair is on the line. The Tournament featured 16 teams, most of them created for the tournament. The show featured no additional matches outside the 15 tournament matches and the ''Lucha de Apuesta'' match.

==Background==
The event featured 16 [[professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[script (recorded media)|scripted]] feuds or [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portray either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] (referred to as ''Rudos'' in Mexico) or [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]] (''Técnicos'' in Mexico) as they compete in wrestling matches with pre-determined outcomes.

[[File:Diensthund.jpg|thumb]]
The term '''shock collar''' is a term used in order to describe a family of [[Dog training|training]] collars (also called '''e-collars''', '''Ecollars''', '''remote training collars''', '''Zap collars''', or '''electronic collars''') that deliver [[electrical shock]]s of varying intensity and duration to the neck of a dog (they can also be applied to other places on the dog's body, to achieve various training effects) via a radio-controlled electronic device incorporated into a dog collar. Some collar models also include a tone or vibrational setting, as an alternative to or in conjunction with the shock. Others include integration with Internet mapping capabilities and GPS to locate the dog or alert an owner of his/her whereabouts.

Originally used in the late 1960s to train hunting dogs, early collars were very high powered. Many modern versions are capable of delivering very low levels of shock.  Shock collars are now readily available and have been used in a range of applications, including behavioral modification, obedience training, and pet containment, as well as military, police and service training.  While similar systems are available for other animals, the most common are the collars designed for [[domestic dog]]s.

==Types of devices==

===Pet containment systems===
The most common use of shock collars is pet containment systems that are used to keep a dog inside the perimeter of the residence without the construction of a physical barrier. This use of shock collars is increasingly popular in areas where local laws or homeowners' associations prohibit the construction of a physical fence.  Available systems include: in-ground installation to preserve the aesthetics of the yard; above ground installation to reinforce an existing barrier that was not sufficient in containing the dog; and wireless systems to allow for indoor use. Most pet containment systems work by installing a wire around the perimeter of the yard. The wire carries no current (as opposed to electric fences which do carry a current at high voltage that may be lethal in the event of unauthorized or defective installation or equipment) but forms a closed loop with a circuit box that transmits a radio signal to the receiver collar worn by the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lindsay|2005|p=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the dog approaches the perimeter the collar will activate.

===Bark control collars===
Bark control collars are used to curb excessive or nuisance barking by delivering a shock at the moment the dog begins barking. Bark collars can be activated by microphone or vibration, and some of the most advanced collars use both sound and vibration to eliminate the possibility of extraneous noises activating a response.

===Training collars or remote trainers===
Training collars can be activated by a handheld device. Better quality remote trainers have a large variety of levels and functions, can give varying duration of stimulation, better quality stimulation, and have a beep or vibration option useful for getting the dog’s attention.  Proper training is an imperative for remote collar use, as misuse can cause negative behavioral fallout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Polsky|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many recommend consulting a behaviorist or a certified training professional who is experienced with shock collars for successful usage and application.

Shock collars may be used in conjunction with [[positive reinforcement]] and / or utilizing other principles of [[operant conditioning]], depending on the trainer's methods either as a form of [[positive punishment]], where the shock is applied at the moment an undesired behavior occurs, in order to reduce the frequency of that behavior; or as a form of [[Reinforcement (psychology)|negative reinforcement]], where a continuous stimulation is applied until the moment a desired behavior occurs, in order to increase the frequency of that behavior.

==Frame of reference==
[[Electrical shock]] is the physiological reaction, sensation, or injury caused by electric current passing through the body. It occurs upon contact of a body part with any source of electricity that causes a sufficient current through the skin, muscles, or hair.

Commenting in his textbook on training and behaviour, Steven Lindsay wrote about the public perception of the term "shock" and its application in the description of training aids; "At low levels, the term shock is hardly fitting to describe the effects produced by electronic training collars, since there is virtually no effect beyond a pulsing tingling or tickling sensation on the surface of the skin ... the word shock is loaded with biased connotations, images of convulsive spasms and burns, and implications associated with extreme physical pain, emotional trauma, physiological collapse, and laboratory abuses ... the stimulus or signal generated by most modern devices is highly controlled and presented to produce a specific set of behavioral and motivational responses to it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the trade magazine "Office for veterinary service and food control", Dr. Dieter Klein compared the effects of shock collars with other electrical stimulation products; "Modern devices ... are in a range in which normally no organic damage is being inflicted. The electric properties and performances of the modern low current remote stimulation devices ... are comparable to the electric stimulation devices used in human medicine. Organic damage, as a direct impact of the applied current, can be excluded.” &lt;ref&gt;Klein, Dieter R., 2000, How Dangerous are Remote Stimulation Devices for the Training of Dogs?” Amtstierärztlicher Dienst und Lebensmittelkontrolle&lt;/ref&gt;

"At 0.914 joules the electric muscle stimulation and contractions a human receives from an 'abdominal energizer' fitness product is exponentially stronger — more than 1,724 times stronger— than the impulse a dog receives from a pet containment collar set at its highest level."&lt;ref name="Radio Systems White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices |url=http://www.joeyspetoutfitters.com/Portals/0/Files/Electronic-Training-Devices.pdf?ver=2014-08-28-165933-417 |publisher=Radio Systems |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical considerations==
Electric shock can be characterised in terms of voltage, current, waveform, frequency (of waveform), pulse rate and duration. 
Although voltage, current and duration of shock can be used to calculate the amount of energy applied (in [[Joules]]), these are not indicators of the intensity of the stimulus or how it may be perceived by the recipient.  Static electric shocks that are experienced in daily life are of the order of 20,000 to 25,000 volts, and yet are not painful or physically damaging because they are of very low current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Binns |first1=Corey |title=The Shocking Truth Behind Static Electricity |url=https://www.livescience.com/4077-shocking-truth-static-electricity.html |website=LiveScience |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on design, shock collars can be set so that the shock delivered is only mildly uncomfortable.  Variable settings of this kind are essential, so that the shock collar can be adjusted to the level that the dog requires, as situations change.

Shock collars are sometimes referred to as delivering a "static shock"; however, static electricity is [[direct current]] and carries little energy (order of millijoules). Shock collars make use of [[alternating current]]. It is therefore inappropriate to refer to shock collars as delivering a static shock.

In order to deliver consistent shocks, good contact must be made between the collar electrodes and the dog's skin (the collar must be fitted according to the manufacturer's instructions). Local humidity and individual variation in coat density, skin thickness and surface conductivity, will also affect the delivery of the shock.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The waveform, its frequency, the pulse rate, current, voltage and impedance are important determinants of likely response. "Many e−collars appear to shift intensity levels by altering the pulse duration or repetition rate while keeping the output current and voltage relatively constant, depending on the electrode−skin load." (Lindsay 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;573).

Individual variations in temperament, pain sensitivity and susceptibility to startle of dogs, means that shock settings must be carefully adjusted to produce a shock that is perceived by the dog as only just aversive enough to stop the dog engaging in the unwanted behaviour.  Normally salient stimuli, such as noises, commands and even shocks, may have no effect on a dog that is highly aroused and focused on an activity such as hunting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Potential to cause harm==
In 1980 (revised 1987), the US [[Center for Veterinary Medicine]] (CVM), a branch of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), concurred in regulatory action against a manufacturer of a bark collar, stating "Complaints received, which were later corroborated by our own testing, included severe burns in the collar area and possible personality adjustment injuries to the dogs. The shocking mechanism was found to be activated not only by barking but by vehicle horns, slamming doors or any other loud noise. CVM concurred in regulatory action against the device since it was deemed to be dangerous to the health of the animal.".&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074684.htm | title= FDA Compliance enforcement| author=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standing policy of the US FDA is that "Dog collars which are activated by the noise of barking to produce an electric shock are considered as hazardous to the health of the animal."&lt;ref name="FDA"/&gt;

No regulations exist specifying the performance characteristics or reliability of these devices, so there is considerable variation in shock level and waveform characteristics between manufacturers, and perhaps even between batches of collars from a single manufacturer. The lack of regulation or standards, and the fact that some of the safety features of shock collars are patented by specific manufacturers,&lt;ref name="Innotek Patent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everypatent.com/comp/pat6184790.html | title= Innotek patent| author=Innotek}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that the safety and operational characteristics of individual products cannot be verified.

== Training effectiveness ==
[[File:Shock collar.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shock%20collar.jpg|thumb|Shock Collar]]{{Cleanup section|reason=has footnotes that aren't inline citations|date=June 2018}}

The debate over the effectiveness of shock collars is highly debated, however it is not one sided. Each side has a wide variety of backers and activists from professors, to activists, and trainers. 

According to Pat Nolan, who has been training dogs for over thirty years, shock training is a key and effective use to train dogs (Nolan, 2011). According to his methods described in his book regular and fair use is key in shock training. He goes into detail about what fair use is, stating that keeping a regular training schedule is key and to set some boundaries your pet will understand (Nolan, 2011).

== Deterring predation in the wild ==
The Wildlife Society article addresses the use of shock collars as a way to prevent sheep from being preyed upon by wild [[coyote]]s. According to (Phillips, 1999)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andelt|first=William F.|last2=Phillips|first2=Robert L.|last3=Gruver|first3=Kenneth S.|last4=Guthrie|first4=Jerry W.|date=1999|title=Coyote Predation on Domestic Sheep Deterred with Electronic Dog-Training Collar|jstor=3783933|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin (1973-2006)|volume=27|issue=1|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; they tested these collars on coyotes for a four-month period and found that the collars stopped thirteen attacks on sheep herds. This also is said to deter future attacks by the tested coyotes. Collars have also been used on wolves for similar reasons. This document is the assessment of the shock collar on wolves’ long-term behavior. The article talks about trying to alter [[wolves]]’ behavior over an extended period of time using the collar. The consensus was while it did have an effect while in use and temporally after it was removed, the study concluded that longer exposure would be needed in order to have any substantial evidence (Hawley, 2008). As far as non-lethal alternatives these two sources both concluded that shock collars are the most effective deterrence to predators. Both groups continued their research and the [[The Wildlife Society|Wildlife Society]] has developed a new and improved version that eliminates the risk of neck injury when used on animals that previous versions caused. They have increased battery life and the durability of the unit. They devised a unit that is worn like a back pack for the animal. Previous versions caused excessive rubbing and soreness as well as being irritating for the animal to the point were they would try to take the harness off.

==Scientific studies==

===Christiansen et al study (2001a)===
Christiansen et al., looked at behavioural differences between three breeds of dogs when confronted by domestic sheep (138 dogs; Elkhounds, hare hunting dogs and English setters).&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Frank O. 2001, pp. 115-129"&gt;Christiansen, Frank O., Bakkenb, Morten, Braastadb, Bjarne O., 2001, Behavioural differences between three breed groups of hunting dogs confronted with domestic sheep . Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Volume 72(2), pp. 115-129. .&lt;/ref&gt; Two testing procedures were used and shock collars were used to deter attacks on sheep. The first, a path test, involved observing the dogs' reactions to a set of novel stimuli (rag pulled across the track, bundle of cans thrown down, tethered sheep at 5m) as it was walked. The second test involved monitoring the dog's reaction to a free-roaming sheep flock in a field. In this study they identified several factors that predicted a high hunting motivation and attack severity. These were lack of previous opportunity to chase sheep, low fearfulness towards gunshots and unfamiliar people and general interest in sheep when encountering them. Younger dogs (&lt;3 years of age) showed more pronounced initial hunting motivation and more frequent attacks. Elkhounds showed more hunting behaviour, more attacks and were more frequently given electric shocks during the tests. A shock collar was used to deter attacks on the sheep during the experiments. Shocks (3000V, 0.4A, duration 1 second) were delivered when dogs came within a distance of 1-2m of the sheep, and were repeated until the dogs left the area. The objective was to suppress an attack, but not to damage the hunting ability of the dogs. Despite frequently initiated chases and attacks, few shocks were delivered. This was because few dogs approached closer than 1–2 m, and the intention was to deter proximity to sheep rather than to associate hunting behaviour with an aversive shock, which would impair future hunting behaviour in other contexts.

===Christiansen et al. study (2001b)===
The dogs used in the first study were re-tested using the same procedures in order to assess the long-term impact of the training on their reaction to sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Frank O., Bakkenb, Morten, Braastadb, Bjarne O., 2001, Behavioural changes and aversive conditioning in hunting dogs by the second-year confrontation with domestic sheep. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Volume 72, pp. 131-143. .&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, in the free-running tests the dogs were fitted with a shock collar, which was used to deter approaches to within 1-2m of the sheep. Dogs that had previously been shocked in year 1 showed a significant increased in latency to approach a person during the path test (p&lt;0.001), even though this was not a condition under which shocks had been delivered. Owners reported behavioral differences between year 1 and 2 in 24 of the dogs. 18 of the 24 dogs had shown no interest in sheep during that period, even though they had been interested in them during the first year tests. However, only one of those dogs had received shocks, so the change in behaviour could not be attributed to the use of the shock collar. When comparing owners’ reports for the two years, the dogs showed a weaker inclination for chasing sheep and other prey than previously (p &lt; 0:001), but this variable was not affected by shock experience. Dogs that had shown interest in sheep in year 1 showed a persistent interest in year 2. No dogs chased or attacked sheep as their first response, while half of them did so the first year. During the entire test period, the proportion of dogs attacking sheep was reduced to almost one fourth. The number of shocks administered per dog was reduced by the second year, and only one of the dogs which received el. shocks the first year needed el. shocks also the second year.The observations that both receivers and non-receivers of el. shocks the first year showed a reduction in the probability of chasing sheep, but the receivers showing a larger reduction, show that el. shock treatment provides an additional learning response. No adverse effects on the dogs were observed with this training procedure, but in their discussion the authors commented "In order to ensure no negative effects, we recommend that the electronic dog collar may be used for such purposes only if it is used by skilled trainers with special competence on dog behaviour, learning mechanisms, and of this particular device."

===Salgirli dissertation (2008)===

The aim of Salgirli's study was "...to investigate whether any stress is caused by the use of specific conditioned signal, quitting signal, and/or pinch collars as alternatives to electric training collars, and if they do so, whether the stress produced in the process is comparable to the one with electric training collars.".&lt;ref name="elib.tiho-hannover.de"&gt;http://elib.tiho-hannover.de/dissertations/salgirliy_ws08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study population were a group of 42 adult police dogs. The quitting signal was a conditioned frustration equivalent to [[negative punishment]]. It was conditioned by associating failure to obtain an anticipated food reward with a specific vocal signal. In the test, dogs were walked past a "provocateur" who attempted to taunt the dog into a reaction. If the dog reacted, it was punished, and if it failed to react on subsequent provocations then the punishment was deemed to have had a learning effect. The study is therefore a comparison of negative and positive punishment methods, and not a comparison of punishment with positive reinforcement. Learning effect was measured by assessing the number of dogs that learned to quit a behaviour after application of the punishing stimulus. There was no statistical difference in learning effect between the pinch and shock collar, but the quitting signal produced a significantly poorer learning effect compared to shock or pinch collars (p &lt; 0.01 in both cases). "Although the pinch collar caused more behavioral reactions, in the form of distress, than the electronic training collar, the electronic training collar elicits more vocal reactions in dogs than the pinch collars"; the explanation for increased vocalisation in the shock collar group was that this was due to a startle response rather than pain reactions.

Salivary cortisol was monitored to measure the stress levels of the dogs, but this data was not presented in the dissertation; behavioral observation was the sole measure of stress.  The study concluded that the electronic training collar induces less distress and shows stronger “learning effect” in dogs in comparison to the pinch collar. Commenting on the quitting signal, the author stated "It should particularly be mentioned, that the quitting signal training was implied only on adult dogs within the frame of this study. Therefore, the results should not be interpreted as that the quitting signal can not be a suitable method in police dog training. As previously stated training of the quitting signal requires a hard and a structured procedure. Thus, if the training, namely the conditioning, begins in puppyhood, the quitting signal can also be an effective method in police dog training". Comparing the effects of the three punishment methods; "These results can probably be explained by that electronic training collar complies completely with the punishment criteria, which were defined by TORTORA (1982), in case of proof of the proficient and experienced user. On the other hand when applying the pinch collar, these criteria can not be met even though perfect timing is applied since reactions of the dog and effectiveness of the method depends on several different factors such as the willingness, strength and motivation of the handler, as well as his/her proficiency. In addition to that, the visibility of the administrator and, thus, of the punishment is another important factor influencing the efficiency of the pinch collar because the dog directly links the punishment with its owner. Therefore this method does not satisfy the ‘‘punishment criteria’’ at all. The quitting signal on the other hand requires criteria, such as good timing and structured training procedure, on account of complete conditioning in order to achieve effective results. Even if these criteria are met, the personality trait of the dog is another factor, which influences the efficiency of the signal."&lt;ref name="elib.tiho-hannover.de"/&gt;

===Schalke et al. study (2007)===

Schalke et al. conducted a 7-month study to investigate the effect of shock collars on stress parameters, in a series of different training situations.&lt;ref&gt;Schalke, E., Stichnoth, J., Ott, S., Jones-Baade, R., 2007, Clinical signs caused by the use of electric training collars on dogs in everyday life situations. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 105, pp. 369-380.&lt;/ref&gt; Heart rate and saliva cortisol were used to determine the stress levels in three groups of dogs. Group A received the electric shock when they touched the "prey" (a rabbit dummy attached to a motion device), Group H ("here" command) received the electric shock when they did not obey a previously trained recall command during hunting, and Group R (random) received random shocks that were unpredictable and out of context.  Group A did not show a significant rise in cortisol levels; the other two groups (R &amp; H) did show a significant rise, with group R showing the highest level of cortisol. Salivary cortisol was measured, as this procedure is less likely to cause stress related rise in cortisol.

From this the researchers concluded that the dogs who could clearly associate the shock with their action (i.e. touching the prey) and as a result were able to predict and control whether they received a shock, did not show considerable or persistent stress.  The evidence of increased stress in the other groups was felt to support earlier findings that poor timing and/or inappropriate use of a shock collar puts the dog at high risk of severe and ongoing stress.  They conclude that "The results of this study suggest that poor timing in the application of high level electric pulses, such as those used in this study, means there is a high risk that dogs will show severe and persistent stress symptoms. We recommend that the use of these devices should be restricted with proof of theoretical and practical qualification required and then the use of these devices should only be allowed in strictly specified situations."

===Schilder &amp; van der Borg study (2004)===

Schilder and van der Borg conducted a study to compare the behavior of police service dogs that had previously been trained using a shock collar (Group S) with those which had not (Group C).&lt;ref&gt;Schilder, M.B.H., van der Borg, J.A.M, 2004, Training dogs with help of the shock collar: short and long term behavioral effects. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 85, pp. 319-334.&lt;/ref&gt; In the training test no shocks were applied, but the animal's behavior was observed during training tasks. The intention was to investigate whether shock collar based training might have a long-term effect on stress-related behavior even in the absence of shock, and whether this related to specific features of the training context. Behaviors recorded included recognised indicators of stress (panting, lip-licking, yawning, paw lifting and body posture) as well as yelping, squealing, snapping and avoidance. During free walks on the training grounds, groups S dogs showed significantly more stress related behaviors and a lower body posture than group C dogs. During training, the same differences were found. The difference between the groups was more significant when training took place on the familiar training ground, indicating a contextual effect. The presence of the trainer was considered to be part of this context. The authors concluded "We concluded that shocks received during training are not only unpleasant but also painful and frightening."

Lindsay says of this study, "Schilder and Van der Borg (2004) have published a report of disturbing findings regarding the short-term and long- term effects of shock used in the context of working dogs that is destined to become a source of significant controversy.... The absence of reduced drive or behavioral suppression with respect to critical activities associated with shock (e.g., bite work) makes one skeptical about the lasting adverse effects the authors claim to document. Although they offer no substantive evidence of trauma or harm to dogs, they provide loads of speculation, anecdotes, insinuations of gender and educational inadequacies, and derogatory comments regarding the motivation and competence of IPO trainers in its place."  &lt;ref name="Lindsay 2005 611–612"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|pages=611–612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steiss et al. study (2007)===
Steiss, et al., conducted a four-week study of adult shelter dogs’ physiological and behavioral responses to bark control collars. Plasma cortisol was used as the stress measure. Dogs were randomly assigned to either a shock collar, a spray collar, or a dummy collar (control group). Dogs that were known to bark at an unfamiliar dog were used for the study. Test conditions involved presentation of an unfamiliar dog. Dogs wore activated collars for period of 30 minutes per day for three days in two consecutive weeks. The amount of barking was significantly reduced starting on the second day with both the spray and shock collars. There was no significant difference in effect between the two collar types. The treatment group dogs showed a mild yet statistically significant increase in blood cortisol level (an indicator of stress) only on the first day of wearing the collars (as compared to the Control Group.)&lt;ref&gt;Steiss, J.E., Schaffer, C., Ahmad, H.A., and Voith, V.L., 2007, Evaluation of Plasma Cortisol Levels and Behavior in Dogs Wearing Bark Control Collars. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 106, pp. 96-106.&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the study, Dr. Steiss and her team concluded that "In the present study, with dogs wearing bark control collars intermittently over a 2-week period, the collars effectively deterred barking without statistically significant elevations in plasma cortisol, compared to controls, at any of the time points measured."

===Tortora Study (1983)===

Tortora applied a method called "safety training" to treat aggression in 36 cases exhibiting a form of "instrumental aggression", selected after screening a population of 476 cases. "Instrumental aggression" was defined as describing aggressive acts that "do not have a clear evolutionary significance, are not directly related to emotional arousal, do not have specific releasing stimuli, are not directly modulated by hormones, and do not have an identifiable focus in the brain". Tortora states that in the context of the article "instrumental aggression" was specifically defined as "aggressive responses that have "a specifiable learning history, show a growth function over time and are modulated by their consequences. These dogs had few operant alternatives to gain reinforcement by compliance and were channeled down a path that allowed their innate aggressiveness to come under the control of the negatively reinforcing contingencies in the environment". The dogs initially behaved as though they "expected" aversive events and that the only way to prevent these events was through aggression. The dogs were therefore a highly selected subset that had not learned strategies for coping with threat.

Each dog was trained to respond to a set of 15 commands taken from the AKC standard for CDX obedience. The commands were selected to provide control over the dog, and included "heel", "stand" "go", "come", "hold", "drop" and "sit". These behaviors were termed "safety behaviors". Training was divided into 9 stages, each of which was composed of 5-20 twice daily training sessions. Dogs could only progress to the next stage after passing a test. On average, dogs took 10-15 sessions to complete each stage. After training basic commands, the dogs were trained to perform the behaviors they had already learned in order to avoid progressively increasing electric shock. After that, they were conditioned to perform a safety behavior in order to avoid a "safety tone" that allowed them to anticipate the shock. In the later stages of training, dogs were exposed to provocation by a distractor dog, and were punished using full intensity shock if they failed to perform a safety behavior or if they showed aggression. After training was complete, and the dogs were choosing to perform the safety behaviors instead of aggression, owners were taught to use the shock collar and the training was transferred into everyday situations. The training resulted in a long-lasting and complete suppression of aggressive behaviour in the dogs. Dogs were followed up 3 years after the end of training, and the reduction in aggression were maintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1984-03181-001&amp;CFID=7872469&amp;CFTOKEN=51050078&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) opposes the use of shock collars, stating "Dogs wearing shock collars can suffer from physical pain and injury (ranging from burns to cardiac fibrillation) and psychological stress, including severe anxiety and displaced aggression. Individual animals vary in their temperaments and pain thresholds; a shock that seems mild to one dog may be severe to another. The anxiety and confusion caused by repeated shocks can lead to changes in the heart and respiration rate or gastrointestinal disorders. Electronic collars can also malfunction, either administering nonstop shocks or delivering no shocks at all".&lt;ref name="PETA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/living/companion-animals/caring-animal-companions/dogs/electric-fences-shock-collars/ | title= Electric Fences and Shock Collars| author=PETA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CABTSG (The Companion Animal Behaviour Therapy Study Group), an affiliate group of the BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association), produced a policy statement on the use of shock collars, stating "Their effectiveness depends upon the pain and fear experienced by the animal, but to use them correctly requires detailed understanding of behaviour and its motivation, as well as very precise timing. Few operators are able to achieve any reliable success with these devices and the consequences of failure can be a worsening of the problem behaviour. The indiscriminate use of shock collars therefore poses a threat to the safety of the general public, as well as to the welfare of the animal. We believe that sufficient alternative methods of treatment exist that such electronic training devices are redundant. Therefore, as an association affiliated to BSAVA, it is our duty to recommend that shock collars and all other related training and control aids should be banned from sale or use".&lt;ref name="CABTSG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doghavendogs.com/Companion%20Animal%20Behaviour%20Therapy%20Study%20Group%20-%20Electronic%20training%20aids.pdf | title= CABTSG Policy Statement| author=CABTSG}}&lt;/ref&gt; CABTSG has been renamed the British Veterinary Behaviour Association.

The BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association) produced a statement on the risks associated with collars "In principle, the BSAVA opposes the use of electronic shock collars for training and containment of animals. Shocks received during training may not only be acutely stressful, painful and frightening for the animal but also may produce long term adverse effects on behavioural and emotional responses.".&lt;ref name="BSAVA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsava.com/Resources/Positionstatements/Aversivetrainingmethods.aspx | title= BSAVA Statement| author=BSAVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the advice of the RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and other welfare groups, the ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers)banned the use of shock collars for police dog training by all UK police forces. The current ACPO Police Dogs Manual of Guidance states "Equipment that is not approved for use in the training of police dogs includes remote training collars designed to give an electric shock and Pinch Collars" .&lt;ref name="ACPO"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/uniformed/2011/201103UOPDogsMoG1.1.pdf |title=ACPO Police Dogs Manual of Guidance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702042548/http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/uniformed/2011/201103UOPDogsMoG1.1.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSPCA commissioned a review of the effects of shock collars from the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Bristol University, which is available online. It states "Given the lack of scientific evidence for the efficacy of behavioural modification using shock collars, particularly in the long term, in addition to the potential for mistakes or deliberate abuse and the difficulty in correcting such errors, the widespread use of these devices must be carefully considered." &lt;ref name="RSPCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&amp;assetId=1232713013325&amp;mode=prd | title= RSPCA Review| author=Casey and Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Kennel Club]] has an ongoing campaign to achieve a ban on the sale and use of shock collars; "The Kennel Club is against the use of any negative training methods or devices. The Kennel Club believes that there are many positive training tools and methods that can produce dogs that are trained just as quickly and reliably, with absolutely no fear, pain, or potential damage to the relationship between dog and handler." "The Kennel Club in calling upon the Government and Scottish Parliament to introduce an outright ban on this barbaric method of training dogs.".&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/banshockcollars | title= Kennel Club Campaign| author=Kennel Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two British members of the World Union of German Shepherd Clubs (WUSV) have joined the Kennel Club in calling for a complete ban on shock collars, and passed a motion to exclude this equipment from any of its training branches during official club training times.&lt;ref name="WUSV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?d=pndpr&amp;f=pnfpr&amp;h=241&amp;id=729 |title=WUSV Ban |author=WUSV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325061026/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?d=pndpr&amp;f=pnfpr&amp;h=241&amp;id=729 |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSUS ([[Humane Society of the United States]]) provides the following comment on the use of aversive collars (choke chains, pinch collars and shock collars): "Some trainers use aversive collars to train "difficult" dogs with correction or punishment. These collars rely on physical discomfort or even pain to teach the dog what not to do. They suppress the unwanted behavior but don't teach him what the proper one is. At best, they are unpleasant for your dog, and at worst, they may cause your dog to act aggressively and even bite you. Positive training methods should always be your first choice." They go on to comment on shock collars specifically: "The least humane and most controversial use of the shock collar is as a training device. The trainer can administer a shock to a dog at a distance through a remote control. There is a greater chance for abuse (delivery of shocks as punishment) or misuse (poor timing of shocks). Your dog also may associate the painful shock with people or other experiences, leading to fearful or aggressive behavior".&lt;ref name="HSUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/dogs/tips/collars.html | title= HSUS statement| author=HSUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCAE (Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics) "recommends the introduction of a ban electric training collars and similar remote-controlled or automatic electronic devices that cause your dog substantial discomfort. It should nevertheless be granted an exemption for such training carried out by authorized persons in order to prevent hunting of livestock and wildlife."  &lt;ref name="Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radetfordyreetikk.no/1996/02/elektriske-dressurmidler-hund/ | title=Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics| author=NCAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APDT (Association of Professional Dog Trainers) says, "[Electronic] training collars should not be used by novice dog owners or by trainers who are not properly instructed in their use. Use of electronic training collars can result in trauma to your dog and generally are not recommended by positive reinforcement trainers".&lt;ref name="APDT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdt.com/petowners/choose/equipment.aspx | title=APDT| author=APDT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AVSAB (American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior) has produced a position statement titled "The use of punishment for behavior modification in animals", the opening paragraph of which reads "AVSAB’s position is that punishment (e.g. choke chains, pinch collars, and electronic collars) should not be used as a first-line or early-use treatment for behavior problems. This is due to the potential adverse effects which include but are not limited to: inhibition of learning, increased fear-related and aggressive behaviors, and injury to animals and people interacting with animals." &lt;ref name="AVSAB Position Statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avsabonline.org/uploads/position_statements/Combined_Punishment_Statements.pdf |title=AVSAB Position Statement|author=AVSAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise==
In his 2005 textbook on training and behavior, Steven Lindsay writes "Instead of instilling social aversion and anxiety ... animal and human research supports the notion that competent shock [collar] training appears to promote positive social attachment, safety, and reward effects that may be provided and amplified via affectionate petting and reassuring praise. The preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that [electrical stimulation] escape/avoidance and pain reduction should promote long-term effects that are incompatible with fear and stress, making the trainer an object of significant extrinsic reward that actually enhances the dog's welfare via an improved capacity for social coping, learning, and adaptation".&lt;ref name="Lindsay 2005 611–612"/&gt; Steven Lindsay states "If minimizing the intensity, duration, and frequency of aversive stimulation during training is recognized as a significant factor in the definition of humane dog training, then the radio controlled e-collar must be ranked as one of the most humane dog-training tools currently available" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The International Association of Canine Professionals (IACP) strongly opposes legislation that bans or limits the humane use of any training tool, saying It is our conviction that limiting the humane use of training tools would result in a higher incidence of nuisance and dangerous dog behavior, and more dogs being surrendered to already over-burdened public shelters.... Dog training is a very diverse field with a single common thread: communication. Dogs are trained for many different tasks such as assisting the disabled, police work, herding, hunting, protection, competition and companionship. Professional trainers achieve these training goals by using a wide variety of tools to communicate with the dog, both at close range, and over long distances. Done effectively, this communication increases desirable behaviors and reduces the incidence of problem behaviors in dogs.... Any efforts to ban or limit the use of training tools would hinder this communication, and our ability to train dogs would suffer. Working dogs would no longer be able to achieve highly specialized tasks, and families with pet dogs would have fewer options available to correct behavioral problems.... Training tools, when properly utilized, are safe and humane".&lt;ref name="IACP Position Paper on Training Tools"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.canineprofessionals.com/assets/docs/iacp%20training%20tools%20position%20statement-1.pdf | title=IACP Position Paper on Training Tools| author=IACP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randall Lockwood PhD, Senior Vice President, Anti-cruelty Initiatives and Legislative Services, The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was quoted in a 2007 White Paper titled "The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices," produced by Radio Systems, a manufacturer of shock collars, "We recognize that older products were often unreliable and difficult to use humanely. But we feel that new technology employed by responsible manufacturers has led to products that can be and are being used safely and effectively to preserve the safety and well-being of many dogs and strengthen the bond with their human companions."&lt;ref name="Radio Systems White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices |url=http://www.joeyspetoutfitters.com/Portals/0/Files/Electronic-Training-Devices.pdf?ver=2014-08-28-165933-417 |publisher=Radio Systems |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public control==
The use of shock collars is banned in [[Scotland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/kennel-club-campaigns/electric-shock-collars/ | work=Kennel Club UK | title=Electric Shock Collars}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some territories of [[Australia]], including [[New South Wales]] and Southern Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/Is-the-use-of-electronic-dog-collars-legal_279.html | work=RSPCA Australia | title=Is the use of electronic dog collars legal? | date=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the [[Welsh Assembly]] voted to ban the use of shock collars in [[Wales]]. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8584028.stm |title=Wales the first part of the UK to ban pet shock collars |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was unsuccessfully challenged by Petsafe, a manufacturer of these devices, and the Electronic Collar Manufacturers' Association, who claimed that it breached Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="EU Court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2010/11/23/electric-shock-pet-collar-ban-did-not-breach-human-rights/ | title= Welsh Ban Challenge| author=Welsh Ban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, it was announced that shock collars for cats and dogs would be banned in England. The [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment secretary]] [[Michael Gove]] said that shock collars caused unacceptable "harm and suffering". Animal charities, including the [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]], the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCC]] and the [[Dogs Trust]], welcomed the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-45320038|title=Ban on electric shock collars for pets|date=2018-08-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal cases involving shock collars==
The potential for shock collars to have a negative impact on behaviour has been recognised by the UK courts. In 2001 Ostarra Langridge was prosecuted after one of her dogs attacked and killed a [[Shih Tzu]] whilst on a walk. A control order, rather than a destruction order, was imposed as the magistrates accepted the defense that Ms. Langridge's dog's aggressive behaviour was attributable to the effects of the shock collar. "Ms. Langridge sought the help of a behaviourist when her dogs started to run away from her on their walks along the beach. The dogs were given shock collars, which Miss Langridge was told to keep on for three months and activate whenever they misbehaved. But the first time the dogs got a shock was by mistake, after a small dog they were walking past made Miss Langridge jump. From then on her pets associated the shocks with small dogs and became afraid of them. When Miss Langridge described the day in July when her dogs turned on a Shih Tzu she had tears in her eyes.". She stated ""They connected the pain of the electric shock with little dogs because of the first time I used the collar. The day that machine came in this house I regret." &lt;ref name="Legal case"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/archive/2001/10/25/6771344.Collars__turned_dogs_into_killers_/?ref=arc| title=Collars turned dogs into killers| author=The Argus| deadurl=bot: unknown| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024152825/http://www.theargus.co.uk/archive/2001/10/25/6771344.Collars__turned_dogs_into_killers_/?ref=arc| archivedate=2014-10-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2011, a 48-year-old man from [[Ogmore-by-Sea]] became the first person convicted of illegal use of a shock collar in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13042363 | work=BBC News | title=Shock collar found on pet dog roaming on Vale beach | date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently fined £2,000 and assessed £1,000 for court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-14181927 | work=BBC News | title=Ogmore illegal shock collar dog owner gets £2,000 fine | date=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the RSPCA, Victoria (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) lost a defamation lawsuit to Orion Pet Products, a shock collar manufacturer, and was ordered to pay $100,00 in damages.  The RSPCA had falsely claimed that shock collars can cause burns and delivered 3,000 volt shocks to dogs.  They made the "fanciful claim" that the current from a shock collar had caused a 60 Kilogram dog to perform backflips and resulted in brain damage.  Justice Weinberg also found that the RSPCA claims that these collars caused epileptic fits, vomiting, seizures, burning and bleeding were misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dogfight nets RSPCA chief $30,000 |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/dogfight-nets-rspca-chief-30-000-20020706-gdud8l.html |website=The Age |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RSPCA's senior inspector had falsified evidence in an attempt to demonstrate that shock collars can cause burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orion Pet Products Pty Ltd v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Vic) |url=http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2002/860.html |website=Federal Court of Australia |publisher=Federal Court of Australia |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Cyrus the Great}}
In the '''Siege of Sardis (547/546 BC)''', the last decisive conflict after the [[Battle of Thymbra]], which was fought between the forces of [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]] and [[Cyrus the Great]], Cyrus followed Croesus to his city. He laid siege to it for 14 days, and then captured it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briant|first1=Pierre|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=9781575061207|page=36|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=siege+sardis+cyrus+croesus&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=siege%20sardis%20cyrus%20croesus&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Background ==
In the previous year king [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], impelled by various considerations, invaded the kingdom of [[Cyrus the Great]]; he hoped to quell the growing power of [[Achaemenid Persia]]; to expand his own dominions; and revenge the deposition of his brother-in-law [[Astyages]];&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', (Penguin Books, 1983), I. pp. 57, 69&lt;/ref&gt; also, he thought himself certain of success, deluded by the ambiguous assurances of the apparently reliable oracle of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I. pp. 58-60&lt;/ref&gt;
Croesus crossed the [[Halys River|Halys]] and met Cyrus at [[Battle of Pteria|Pteria]] in [[Cappadocia]], but after a drawn-out battle against superior forces in which neither side obtained the victory Croesus resolved to fall back for the winter, summon new allies, and renew the war reinforced in the next spring.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I., p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, he disbanded his army and returned to Sardis, expecting Cyrus to hang back after the sanguinary battle in Cappadocia. But the energetic Cyrus, as soon as he heard that Croesus' forces were dispersed, crossed the Halys and advanced with such speed that he had arrived at the Lydian capital, Sardis, before Croesus had any word of his approach.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I., p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Undaunted, Croesus mustered his available troops and met Cyrus in the [[battle of Thymbra]] outside the walls. Cyrus was victorious, having contrived to deprive the Lydians of their last resource, their [[cavalry]] (in which the Lydians allegedly surpassed all other nations at the time), by frightening off their horses with the sight of his [[camels]]. The remnants of the Lydian army were driven within the city and promptly besieged.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I., p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Siege ==
Croesus was still confident in his chances because [[Sardis]] was a well-fortified city consecrated by ancient prophecies to never be captured. Additionally, he had sent for immediate aid from [[Sparta]], the strongest state in Greece and his firm ally, and he hoped to enlist the Egyptians, the [[Babylonians]] and others in his coalition against Persia as well. In fact, however, the Spartans were then occupied in a war with neighboring [[Argos]], and neither they nor any other of Croesus' allies would assemble in time.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I. p. 73, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyrus, meantime, stimulated his troops by the offer of large rewards to the first soldiers who should ascend the battlements; but repeated Persian attacks were repulsed with loss. According to [[Herodotus]], the city ultimately fell by the agency of a Persian soldier, who climbed up a section of the walls which was neither adequately garrisoned, nor protected by the ancient rites which had dedicated the rest of the cities' defenses to impregnability; the steepness of the adjoining ground outside the walls was responsible for this piece of Lydian Hubris. Hyroeades, the Persian soldier, saw a Lydian soldier climbing down the walls to retrieve a dropped helmet, and tried to follow the example. The success of his ascent set the example to the rest of Cyrus' soldiers and these swarming over the exposed wall, the city was promptly taken.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I., p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Sardes citadel, seen from the west.jpg|thumb|The Sardis citadel, seen from the West.]]
[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] had previously issued orders for [[Croesus]] to be spared, and the latter was hauled a captive before his exulting foe. Cyrus' first intentions to burn Croesus alive on a pyre were soon diverted by the impulse of mercy for a fallen foe, and according to ancient versions, by divine intervention of [[Apollo]], who caused a well-timed rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I., p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition represents the two kings as reconciled thereafter; Croesus succeeded in preventing the worst rigors of a sack by representing to his captor that it was ''his'', not Croesus' property being plundered by the Persian soldiery.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, I., p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; 

The kingdom of [[Lydia]] came to an end with the fall of Sardis, and her subjection was confirmed in an unsuccessful revolt in the following year, promptly crushed by Cyrus' lieutenants. The [[Aeolis|Aeolian]] and [[Ionia]]n cities on the coast of [[Asia-Minor]], formerly tributaries of Lydia, were likewise conquered not long after, establishing the circumstances for Greco-Persian animosity, which would last till the outbreak of the [[Persian Wars]] in the succeeding century.

==Summary==
In 1781, [[Ichabod Crane]] works for [[George Washington]] as a [[double agent]]. Crane beheads a [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Horseman]], who doesn't die; in desperation, Crane wins with a mutual blow. However, Crane next awakes in 2013 Sleepy Hollow with Washington's bible to guide him; he meets Lt. Abigail  Mills, and learns the Horseman is back. Crane learns he and Abbie are the Witnesses and the Horseman is [[Death]]; should he get his head back, or his master, [[Moloch]], be released from [[Purgatory]], the End of Days will occur. Crane also learns his wife, Katrina, was a witch banished to Purgatory for saving him as his blunder linked his life with the Horseman's. Fighting off Moloch's army of demons, Crane learns the  Horseman of War is his own son Jeremy Crane/Henry Parish, who loathes him and Katrina for abandoning him; he also learns "Headless" is his former friend Abraham Von Brunt. They manage to defeat Moloch, but at the cost of releasing everything trapped in Purgatory, including demons looking for a replacement for Moloch. Henry gets Katrina to side with him to awaken the descendants of their coven, but both are regretfully killed by Crane.

In the following months, Crane investigates all myths regarding the Witnesses, learning that Moloch was the first of the Seven Tribulations. The second comes in the form of Pandora, and her master the Hidden One, an ancient Sumerian god. As Moloch is dead (and thus cannot end the world), Crane gives the Horseman back his head, allowing him to destroy Pandora; however, the head is sucked into her box, which is destroyed. This battle cost Abigail her soul. Learning that there will always be two Witnesses, Crane vows to find her replacement to face the last five Tribulations.

Relocating to Washington D.C., Crane discovers the next Witness is a little girl named Molly; Crane works with her mother Agent Diana Thomas of Homeland Security to combat supernatural threats until Molly is old enough to help. Crane also allies with Agency 355 agents Jake Wells and Alex Norwood, taking command of the organization as Washington wished. The third tribulation comes in the form of Malcolm Dreyfuss, who sold his soul to build his business; he seeks immortality to avoid dying. After Dreyfuss becomes immortal, he decides to assemble the Four Horsemen to kill the president and takeover America. A woman named Lara arrives from the future Dreyfuss wishes to create, revealing herself to be an alternate version of Molly; as a result of being in her prime, Lara gains the Witness title from Molly, freeing her past self from the burden. Crane is forced to make a [[deal with the devil]] for a piece of the [[philosophers' stone]] to strip Dreyfuss of his immortality, sending Dreyfuss to hell. While Lara goes on a journey to discover her place in the world, Crane continues working with Agent Thomas to combat supernatural threats with the hope he can escape his bargain with the devil.

'''Structuring''', also known as '''smurfing''' in [[banking industry|banking]] [[jargon]], is the practice of executing [[financial transaction]]s such as making bank deposits in a specific pattern, calculated to avoid triggering [[financial institution]]s to file reports required by law, such as the United States' [[Bank Secrecy Act]] (BSA) and [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 6050I (relating to the requirement to file Form 8300). Structuring may be done in the context of [[money laundering]], [[fraud]], and other [[financial crime]]s. Legal restrictions on structuring are concerned with limiting the size of domestic transactions for individuals.

==Definition==
Structuring is the act of parceling what would otherwise be a large financial transaction into a series of smaller transactions to avoid scrutiny by regulators and law enforcement.&lt;ref name="linn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linn|first1=Courtney J.|title=Redefining the Bank Secrecy Act: Currency Reporting and the Crime of Structuring|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|date=2010|volume=50|issue=2|pages=407–513|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&amp;context=lawreview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically each of the smaller transactions is executed in an amount below some statutory limit that normally does not require a [[financial institution]] to file a report with a government agency. Criminal enterprises may employ several [[agent (law)|agents]] ("smurfs") to make the transaction.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Structuring appears in federal indictments related to [[money laundering]], [[fraud]], and other [[financial crime]]s.

The term "smurfing" is derived from the image of the comic book characters, [[the Smurfs]], having a large group of many small entities.

Legal restrictions on structuring are concerned with limiting the size of domestic transactions for individuals, and somewhat limiting the outbound foreign currency transfers of firms or company entities.{{cn|date=March 2008}} This should not be confused with [[capital controls]], which are regulatory limits on the money that one can take out of a nation and generally regulate how much money can leave a country at any given time.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Both can have some of the same economic effects in some economies, as structuring controls effectively limit the flow of capital by magnitude and duration, and can apply equally to taking money out of a nation as well as putting money into its financial system.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] requires [[currency transaction report]]s (CTRs) to be filed for transactions valued at more than $10,000; it applies to both U.S. and foreign currencies.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|31|5313}}, {{usc|31|5324}}, 31 C.F.R. sec. 1010.311, and 31 C.F.R. sec. 1010.314.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial institutions suspecting deposit structuring with intent to avoid the law are required to file a [[suspicious activity report]] (SAR).&lt;ref&gt;See generally 31 C.F.R. sec. 1010.320.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the [[U.S. Congress]] enacted section 5324 of Title 31 of the [[United States Code]],&lt;ref&gt;See section 1354(a) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Public Law No. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207, at 3207-22 (27 Oct. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; which provides (in part):

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section 5313 (a) or 5325 or any regulation prescribed under any such section, the reporting or record keeping requirements imposed by any order issued under section 5326, or the record keeping requirements imposed by any regulation prescribed under section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or section 123 of Public Law 91–508—[...]

(3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 5324 further provides that a violation of this provision may be punished by a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.&lt;ref&gt;See 31 USC section 5324(d)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The filing of Form 8300 is required under [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 6050I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Internal Revenue Service | chapter=Part IV Examining Process; Chapter 26 Bank Secrecy Act; Section 13 Structuring | title=Internal Revenue Manual | location=Washington, D.C. | publisher=US Treasury Department | url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/index.html | chapterurl=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/ch25s17.html | date=2006-06-01 | oclc=37305546 | accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sums of money resulting from deposits of less than $10,000 may be seized after a warrant is issued based on a [[suspicious activity report]]. Legal proceedings, which may cost in the vicinity of $20,000 or more, may be required for an innocent party to retrieve his or her money. Reports in October 2014 by ''[[The New York Times]]'' of arbitrary seizures resulted in modification of [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) practice to focus on investigations that "closely align" with IRS "mission and key priorities". Banks are not permitted to warn or advise customers unless the customer asks, but sometimes bank tellers will informally warn customers.&lt;ref name = NYT102514 &gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/law-lets-irs-seize-accounts-on-suspicion-no-crime-required.html "Law Lets I.R.S. Seize Accounts on Suspicion, No Crime Required"] article by Sahaila Dewan in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 25 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term "smurfing" is also applied to activity associated with [[controlled substance]]s such as [[pseudoephedrine]].&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/18862/ndic_2009.pdf |format=PDF |title=DEA |page=16 |publisher=Justice.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017093604/http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/18862/ndic_2009.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the agent will make purchases of small, legal amounts from several drug and grocery stores, with the intent to aggregate the lot for use in the illegal production of [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;  Also, since the monthly [[pseudoephedrine]] purchase limits in US are too low for mass meth production, this practice often involves using multiple "smurfs".

As Robert Pennal of the Fresno Meth Task Force explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then we started seeing "smurfing." Remember how the smurfs were little gatherers? We started getting calls from different retail stores that people were buying two or three packs — that's the most you can buy — and they went to one store, they bought three, they went to another store, bought three. We're seeing [[blister packs]] everywhere because they're sitting in the car, they're punching the pills out of the blister packs, they're putting them in the freezer bags and they're turning them over to chemical brokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meth/etc/script.html|title=Transcript - The Meth Epidemic - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=FRONTLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Teatro dei Rozzi''' is a live-performance theater located on Piazza Indipendenza #15, in the city of [[Siena]], region of [[Tuscany]], Italy; while this structure was inaugurated in 1817, the sponsoring organization dated to 1531.

==History==
In 1531, a group of artisans created the ''Congregation of Rozzi'' dedicated to mainly oral performances of secular poetry, often during festivals. At this "academy", intellectuals and literati of the town attempted to refine the more popular forms of theater into more sophisticated art. By some it was called the ''Academy of the Uncouth'' for its avoidance of Latin texts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3uq0bObScHMC Cambridge History of Italian Literature], by Peter Brand and Lino Pertile, page 230.&lt;/ref&gt; The group took on an emblem and symbol, the cork tree which draws from the ground. It is said among those attending performances were [[Pope Leo X]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=cons&amp;Chiave=2845 Siena Archives of Beni Culturali], curated entry by Barbara Maria Affolter (2006) with a bibliography including: 1) M. Marcucci, N. Crevani, Accademie e istituzioni culturali in Toscana, Firenze 1988, 447-453; 2) "L'archivio dell'Accademia [dei Rozzi]. Inventario", a cura di M. De Gregori, Siena 1999, and 3) R. Alonge, "Il Teatro dei Rozzi di Siena", Firenze 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portale Teatro dei Rozzi Siena.JPG|thumb|left|The gate of the theatre with Rozzi's coat of arms]]
During the middle decades of the 17th century, the Rozzi specialized in readings of pastoral drama, while later in the 17th century, it was occupied with the satirical comedies by [[Girolamo Gigli]] (1660-1722) and the comedies of character by [[Jacopo Angelo Nelli]] (1673-1767), and works of [[Pietro Fortini]].&lt;ref&gt;Brand and Pertile, page 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

The congregation was transformed into the ''Academy of the Rozzi'' in 1690, to which Francesco de' Medici, granted use of rooms in the [[Palazzo Pubblico of Siena]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries it became a more prestigious cultural institution in town, fostering a number of dramatists, including [[Benvenuto Flori]], [[Agostino Gallini]], and [[Girolamo Ronconi]].

The Accademia dei Rozzi established to build a theater in 1807, designed by [[Alessandro Doveri]]. The project was forsaken because it took from the Academies meeting rooms. A new locale, the present one, was obtained leading to construction of this theater in 1815 by the same architect using a different design. The Theater hall was inaugurated in 1817, with the musical play ''L'Agnese di Fitzenry'' by [[Ferdinando Paer]].

In 1873, the architect Corbi remodeled the theater, which remained open until 1945, when damage from the Second World War caused it to close. It was later refurbished again and reopened to the public in 1998, as a theater with 499 seats, three rows of boxes and a gallery open houses and theatrical activities, music and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comune.siena.it/La-Citta/Cultura/Teatri/TEATRO-DEI-ROZZI/LA-STORIA Comune of Siena], history of Teatro dei Rozzi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1c1iAAAAcAAJ Cenni storico-artistici di Siena e suoi suburbii], Ettore Romaganoli, 1840, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Accademia dei 'Rozzi''' still maintains a library and archive of it past works and functions.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Maria Affolter (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Chairman's Ear''''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Ucho Prezesa'') is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[political satire]] [[web series]] broadcast since 9 January 2017 on [[YouTube]], and since 15 February 2017 on [[Showmax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wirtualnemedia.pl/artykul/nowe-odcinki-ucho-prezesa-showmax-youtube |title=Nowe odcinki Ucho Prezesa ShowMax YouTube |publisher=Wirtualnemedia.pl |date=2017-02-15 |accessdate=2017-03-21 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is created by Robert Górski, the lead member of the ''Kabaret Moralnego Niepokoju''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wirtualnemedia.pl/artykul/ucho-prezesa-kabaret-moralnego-niepokoju-przygotowuje-internetowy-serial-satyryczny-wideo |title=Ucho Prezesa - Kabaret Moralnego Niepokoju przygotowuje internetowy serial satyryczny (wideo) |publisher=Wirtualnemedia.pl |date=2017-01-03 |accessdate=2017-03-21 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The series follows the chairman of the ruling political party in Poland (Mr Chairman). The narrative takes place primarily in his office where, joined by his assistant Mariusz, he hosts numerous visitors, including government officials and other public office holders. While Mr Chairman does not hold any elected office himself, it is clear that key political decisions are made in this office, and not in the [[Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland|Chancellery of the Prime Minister]] (who herself frequents the office). The plot is deeply rooted in contemporary Polish politics, with each character having a real-life counterpart, with whom they share first names (their surnames are never revealed). The titular character of Mr Chairman is based on [[Jarosław Kaczyński]], the leader of the governing [[Law and Justice]] party.

''The Chairman's Ear'' is a continuation of a series of cabaret scenes named ''Government meeting'' (Polish: ''Posiedzenie rządu'') in which Robert Górski and other cabaret artists impersonated the members of the [[Civic Platform]] and the [[Polish People's Party]].

'''''The Hound of Florence: A Novel''''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Der Hund von Florenz}}) is a 1923 novel written by [[Felix Salten]]. It is best known today for partly inspiring (and even mentioned in) the 1959 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film, ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', as well as a sequel and remakes. The novel was first translated into English in 1930 by [[Huntley Paterson]], and the translation has illustrations by [[Kurt Wiese]].

''The Hound of Florence'' is an adventure story for young readers, set in early eighteenth-century [[Austria]] and Italy. The adolescent Lukas Grassi has lost his parents and lives in [[Vienna]] in great poverty, longs for his native Italy, and would like to study art in [[Florence]]. By magic, his wish is granted, but every other day he must take the form of a dog, Kambyses,&lt;ref&gt;In the English translation, the names are spelled "Lucas Grassi" and "Cambyses."&lt;/ref&gt; that belongs to the Archduke Ludwig; and alternating daily between human and canine form, he travels from Vienna to Florence along with the Archduke's troops, and there has to lead a unique double life. This is the only book of Salten in which [[supernatural]] elements occur, and they may show influence of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ehness | first=Jürgen | title=Felix Saltens erzählerisches Werk: Beschreibung und Deutung | location=Frankfurt am Main | publisher=Peter Lang | date=2002 | isbn=3-631-38178-6 | page=221 | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has some "overtly" autobiographical background. In 1890s the journalist Salten had become a friend and confidant of the Austrian archduke [[Archduke Leopold Ferdinand of Austria|Leopold Ferdinand]], and in his novel, Salten makes use of his experiences with the archduke and his brothers. He carried the material for twenty-five years before he dared to write the story. In 1907 he mentioned [[Arthur Schnitzler]] that he was then about to finish the manuscript. However it was not until 1921 when the manuscript was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=Beverley Driver |date=2010 |title=Felix Salten: Man of Many Faces |location=Riverside (Ca.) |publisher=Ariadne Press |pages=33, 87–89, 131, 195–196, 204–205 |isbn=978-1-57241-169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain recurring motifs in Saltens œuvre appear also in this book: the deep cleavage between the very rich and the very poor, and the critique of the [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehness (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Salten's biographer Beverley Driver Eddy, the strength of ''The Hound of Florence'' lies in the depiction of the dog Kambyses – a "brilliant portrayal of a dog's character."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy (2010), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Salten himself was a passionate dog lover and kept dogs most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy (2010), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hound of Florence'' is written as one piece. There are no chapter divisions. The 1920s German-language editions, set in [[Fraktur]], however use an embellished dash to divide the text into large sections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1980s edition uses [[asterisk]]s for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Stuttgart | publisher=Klett-Cotta | isbn=3-608-95400-7 | series=Cotta's Bibliothek der Moderne, 42 | year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of the book differs greatly in the original language and in the English translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of. In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages&lt;ref&gt;From page 230 on, the English translation diverts from and expands the German text.&lt;/ref&gt; has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]]. Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

The English-language edition of ''The Hound of Florence'' was out of print for a long time. Only 2014 was a new edition published, this time illustrated by [[Richard Cowdrey]], using the alternate ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence | location=New York | publisher=Aladdin | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4424-8749-9 | others=Illustrated by Richard Cowdrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was translated into [[French language|French]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Le chien de Florence | location=Bruxelles | publisher=Éditions de la Paix | year=1952 | others=Traduit de l’allemand par Maurice Muller-Straus | language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finnish language|Finnish-language]] edition from 2016 includes both endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Koiramme Firenzessä | location=Helsinki | publisher=Books on Demand GmbH | date=2016 | isbn=978-952-330-150-4 | language=Finnish | translator=Markus Lång }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Twelve Dreams Of The Sun''' was a concert held by musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]] on the Pyramids of [[Giza]], [[Egypt]] starting on December 31, 1999 and carrying overnight to January 1, 2000. It was attended by 120,000 people. The concert consisted of two parts, the Main Concert and a Sunrise Concert. The concert cost approximately $9,500,000 and it originated when Jean-Michel Jarre was contacted by the Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] with a special project to celebrate the dawn of the new Millennium at the foot of the only remaining monument of the original 7 Wonders of the World - the Great Pyramids.

Jarre's team had developed giant projections to be displayed on the faces of the Great Pyramids, however a heavy cloud of fog made the pyramids almost invisible, so most of the projections were discarded. Parts of the concert were broadcast live on TV stations around the world.

'''Three Mile Oak''' got its name because it was three miles from the [[Maryland State House]].   Prominent visitors were met at the tree, on the outskirts of [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], and escorted into the city.

==History==
The Three Mile Oak was last a tree stump from the 18th century. Presumably a [[white oak]], about six feet in diameter, and originally located three miles from Annapolis in Parole, Anne Arundel County. The tree was struck by [[lightning]], became hollow, was killed by fire, and finally blew down on May 22, 1909. At the site where the tree stood, a delegation is reported to have met [[George Washington]] en route to [[Annapolis, Maryland]] (then the U.S. capital) to resign his commission on December 19, 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/catalog/cfm/dsp_number.cfm?speccol=5998|title=Three Mile Oak Collection MSA SC 5998 |publisher=Maryland State Archives|date=|accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|Washington resigned as commander-in-chief]] on December 23.&lt;ref name=aoc&gt;{{cite web|title=General George Washington Resigning His Commission|url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/historic-rotunda-paintings/general-george-washington-resigning-his-commission|publisher=[[Architect of the Capitol]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plaque at Original Tree Site==
While on display outdoors for many years, the Three Mile Oak was exhibited with a plaque erected in 1967 by the Four Rivers Garden Club, Rotary of Annapolis, explaining its significance.
The plaque states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Mile Oak|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/Anne%20Arundel/AA-895.pdf|publisher=[[Maryland Historical Trust]]|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Under this tree passed General George Washington December 19, 1783 on his way to Annapolis to resign his Commission as Commander-In-Chief of the Continental Armies, and it is thought that General Smallwood accompanied by General Gates and distinguished citizens of Annapolis met General Washington at this spot.

General Lafayette passed here December 17, 1824 to visit the friends of revolutionary days.
}}
[[File:Three-Mile-Oak-Original-Marker.png|thumb|Original plaque]]
The plaque and tree trunk originally sat at the corner of West Street and Route 178 (Generals Highway).
[[File:Three Mile Oak With Concrete Block.jpg|thumb|Three Mile Oak Stump with Rebar through Concrete Block]]
The concrete block that held the twisted stump of the tree is still located at that spot, just outside the parking lot of Toys R Us, diagonally from the Applebee's at the Annapolis Mall.  The twisted rebars rising out of the concrete block protected the rotting trunk of the tree.
[[File:Original Block for Three Mile Oak.JPG|thumb|Concrete Block that held stump of Three Mile Oak]]

==Moving the Plaque==
The plaque was moved in 1967 down the road, approximately 500 feet, across from the Red Lobster and the former Famous Dave's Restaurants (now Uncle Julio’s). Local citizens feared that it would be destroyed by traffic if left unprotected at the corner of West Street and Defense Highway.   A new oak tree was planted close to the relocated plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annapolis.patch.com/blog_posts/blog-three-mile-oak-tree-in-parole|publisher=Annapolis Patch|date=2012-03-08|accessdate=2012-09-14|title=BLOG: Three Mile Oak Tree in Parole|author=Laura McMarlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A new plaque was placed over the dismounted and moved original plaque.  It reads:

:This oak tree planted in 1967 perpetuates the memory of the original Three Mile Oak which stood nearby as explained in the marker below.

'''Vogue''', or '''voguing''', is a highly stylized, modern [[house dance]] originating in the late 1980s that evolved out of the [[Harlem]] [[ballroom scene]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863223074|title=Voguing and the house ballroom scene of New York City 1989-92|last=Stuart.|first=Baker,|date=2011-01-01|isbn=9780955481765|oclc=863223074}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained [[mainstream]] exposure when it was featured in [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song and video "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" (1990), and when showcased in the 1990 documentary ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]'' (which went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the 1991 [[Sundance Film Festival]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becquer|first=Marcos|last2=Gatti|first2=Jose|date=1991-09-01|title=Elements of Vogue|journal=Third Text|volume=5|issue=16-17|pages=65–81|doi=10.1080/09528829108576327|issn=0952-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its modern form, this dance has become a global phenomenon that continues to evolve both stylistically and demographically.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/22/arts/dance/20150726-vogue.html|title=Vogueing Is Still Burning Up the Dance Floor in New York|last=Schaefer|first=Brian|date=2015-07-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-01|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the style of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs and the famous model poses of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine, voguing is characterized by model-like poses integrated with angular, linear, and rigid arm, leg, and body movements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This style of dance arose from [[Harlem]] [[Ball culture|ballrooms]] by [[African-American]] drag queens of the early 1960s and their tradition in throwing "shade," or a subtle insult directed to other queens in order to impress the judges. It was originally called "presentation" and later "performance".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Jonathan David|date=Autumn 2002|title=The Social World of Voguing|url=http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/12.2/12-2TheSocial_Jackson26-42.pdf|journal=Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement|volume=12.2|pages=26–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the dance evolved into the more intricate and acrobatic form that is now called "vogue".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-upadhye/vogue-not-madonnas-dance_b_1613478.html|title=Vogue: Not Madonna's Dance|last=Upadhye|first=Janet|date=2012-06-21|website=HuffPost|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise origins of voguing are disputed. Although many cite the story in which [[Paris Dupree]] takes out a Vogue magazine and mimics the pose at the beat (and other queens subsequently following), there are other accounts that note voguing may have originated from black gay prison inmates of [[Rikers Island]] for the attention of other men and throwing shade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voguing is continually developed further as an established dance form that is practiced in the LGBT [[ballroom scene]] and clubs in major cities throughout the United States and around the globe—mainly New York City and Paris.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/french-drag-queen-dance-battles|title=French Drag Queen Dance Battles|last=Veine|first=France|date=March 13, 2014|website=VICE|access-date=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently three distinct styles of vogue: ''Old Way'' (pre-1990); ''New Way'' (post-1990); and V''ogue Fem'' (circa 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tara|first=Susman,|date=2000-01-01|title=The Vogue of Life: Fashion Culture, Identity, and the Dance of Survival in the Gay BalIs|journal=disClosure: A Journal of Social Theory|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.13023/disclosure.09.15|issn=1055-6133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old way ===
Old way is characterized by the formation of lines, symmetry, and precision in the execution of formations with graceful, fluid-like action. Egyptian hieroglyphs and fashion poses serve as the original inspirations for old way voguing. In its purest, historical form, old way vogue is a duel between two rivals. Traditionally, old way rules dictated that one rival must "pin" the other to win the contest. Pinning involved the trapping of an opponent so that he or she could not execute any movements while the adversary was still in motion (usually voguing movements with the arms and hands called "hand performance" while the opponent was "pinned" against the floor doing "floor exercises" or against a wall).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Livingston|first=Jennie|title=Paris Is Burning|date=1991-08-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100332/|first4=Paris|accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New way ===
New way is characterized by rigid movements coupled with "clicks" (limb contortions at the joints) and "arms control" (hand and wrist illusions, which sometimes includes tutting and [[Locking (dance)|locking]]). New way can also be described as a modified form of [[mime]] in which imaginary geometric shapes, such as a box, are introduced during motion and moved progressively around the dancer's body to display the dancer's dexterity and memory. New way involves incredible flexibility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Vogue Fem ===
Vogue Fem ("Fem" is derived from the French word ''{{lang|fr|femme}}'', meaning "woman") is fluidity at its most extreme with exaggerated [[Femininity|feminine]] movements influenced by [[ballet]], [[jazz dance|jazz]] and [[modern dance]]. Styles of Vogue Fem performances range from Dramatics (which emphasizes stunts, tricks, and speed) to Soft (which emphasizes a graceful, beautiful, and easy flow continuations between the five elements). There are currently five elements of Vogue Fem:
* '''Duckwalk''': The duck walk receives its name from the appearance the name references (a duck walking) that involves squatting on your heels and kicking your feet out as you move forward on the beat.
* '''Catwalk ''': Catwalking is an exaggerated feminine walk where the legs are crossed over each other, the hips are thrust from side to side, and the hands are thrown forward in opposition to the legs.
* '''Hands''': In performance, the hands of the performer often told a story. This is the component of performing used to throw shade. For example, miming an expression of horror at the way the opponents face looks.
* '''Floorwork''': This component demonstrates the competitors' sensuality as they roll, twist, and otherwise move on the ground in such a way as to capture the attention of the judges.
* '''Spins and Dips''': This is the showiest component of vogue. These are the turns on beat, and the drops to the floor. A spin or dip is only done correctly when executed with the climax happening on the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Oxygen Media|title=The 5 Elements of Vogue with Leiomy Maldonado - In Progress {{!}} Oxygen|date=2016-06-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3c7Gv5RHaw|accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scenes and chapters ==
The ballroom scene has evolved into a national and international underground [[dancesport]] with major balls and dance competitions being held in different regions of the United States and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=streetstar|title=STREETSTAR 2013 - Vogue Femme Final Battle Lasseindra (FRA) vs Ida"Inxi" Holmlund (FIN)|date=2013-08-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhhd_tEaJEQ|accessdate=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York State continues to be the mecca of the ballroom scene as well as the dance style, but regional voguing "capitals" exist—Chicago and Detroit for the Midwest. Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Miami for the South. Los Angeles and Las Vegas for the West Coast. Baltimore, D.C, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh. and Virginia for the East Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Butch queens up in pumps : gender, performance, and ballroom culture in Detroit|last=1969-|first=Bailey, Marlon M.,|isbn=9780472051960|oclc=820123691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International cities in Western Europe (the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Sweden), Eastern Europe, Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica) and Asia Pacific (Japan and New Zealand) have sprouted and held competitions inspired by voguing from the original balls of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/voguing-europe-ewen-spencer-clive-martin|title=Inside Eastern Europe's Wild, Competitive Voguing Scene|website=Vice|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catchnews.com/lite/youtube-sensation-japan-aya-sato-bambi-voguing-madonna-nicky-minaj-vogue-magazine-1453190072.html|title=Watch: Aya-Bambi, the Japanese dancing couple who will leave you hypnotised|work=''CatchNews.com''|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morton |first=Frances |date=May 9, 2017 |title=Inside New Zealand's Radical Pacific Queer Community |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/785bmb/vogueing-for-survival-inside-new-zealands-radical-pacific-queer-community |work=Vice |location=New Zealand |access-date=Sep 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Villegas |first=Richard |year=2016 |title=How voguing and ballroom became cool in Latin America. |url=http://remezcla.com/features/music/rise-of-ballroom-culture-latin-america/|work=Remezcla |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
[[File:VogueBlondAmbitionUndergGround.jpg|thumb|[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and her dancers vogueing on the 1990 [[Blond Ambition World Tour]]. The singer brought global exposure to the then-underground dance.]]
Several notable pop celebrities and artists were influenced by Voguing. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Rihanna]], [[Willow Smith]], [[FKA Twigs]], [[Ariana Grande]], and [[Azealia Banks]] have all taken inspiration from voguing from dances of past and contemporary voguers, while also incorporating the beats traditionally attached to the dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/nov/18/-sp-vogueing-dance-came-back-into-vogue-madonna|title=How voguing came back into vogue|last=Hunt|first=Kenya|date=2014-11-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-02|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/lifestyle/inspiring-latina/leiomy-maldonado-vogue-choreographer|title=Meet Leiomy Maldonado, the Trans Latina Vogue Dancer Whose Hair Flip Inspired Beyoncé &amp; More |work=LATINA|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afropunk.com/profiles/blogs/new-music-azealia-banks-new-vogue-worthy-track-the-big-big-beat|title=NEW MUSIC: Azealia Banks' new Vogue-worthy track "The Big Big Beat" is an instant-hit|website=''afropunk.com''|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/2017/01/leiomy-maldonado-on-famous-hair-flip/|title=Leiomy Maldonado Talks Signature Hair Flip That Inspired Beyoncé|date=2017-01-25|work=Vibe|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recent influences of voguing (and [[Ball culture]]) comes from the documentary film ''[[Kiki (2016 film)|Kiki]]'', in which contemporary Balls and Voguing is represented through the scenes and styles that now exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/movies/kiki-review.html|title=Review: 'Kiki': The Vogueing Scene, Still a Refuge for Gay and Transgender Youth|last=Kenny|first=Glenn|date=2017-02-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-02|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MovieZine|title=Kiki (2016) - Trailer|date=2016-06-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixeDKdMLRHw|accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the dance culture of New York travelled to Berlin, many people went to clubs to show off their best moves. At a time when discrimination was very severe especially for those exploring their identities, these clubs offered people a space to avoid those struggles. People focused on their dance and outdoing their peers and competitors rather than society's rejection of minority groups. The House of Melody was the first German voguing house. It brought together people passionate for voguing. They emphasized ignoring people's backgrounds and instead understanding everyone's shared belief in love for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehouseofmelody.com/|title=the house of melody - HOME|website=''thehouseofmelody.com''|language=de|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clubs were important for people who might have been looking for a place to escape the challenges that they faced on the streets or at home. The empowerment that was generated in these spaces transferred into contributing to a broader movement that would tend to the struggles of minorities in Germany.

The '''WeatherTech SportsCar Championship''' is a [[sports car racing]] series based in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and organized by the [[International Motor Sports Association]] (IMSA). It is a result of a merger between two existing North American sports car racing series, the [[American Le Mans Series]] and [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]. At its inception, the name was United SportsCar Championship &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United SportsCar Racing To Debut In 2014|url=http://www.alms.com/articles/united-sportscar-racing-debut-2014|publisher=[[American Le Mans Series]]|accessdate=14 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318004312/http://www.alms.com/articles/united-sportscar-racing-debut-2014|archive-date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which subsequently changed to the '''Tudor United SportsCar Championship''' when [[Rolex SA]] signed their [[Tudor (watch)|Tudor]] brand to a title sponsorship deal.&lt;ref name="Tudor"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sportscar365.net/uscr/tudor-named-title-sponsor/ | title = Tudor Named Title Sponsor | publisher = John Dagys Media, LLC | website = Sportscar 365 | date = 12 September 2013 | accessdate = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WeatherTech later signed a deal to take over title sponsorship of the series starting in 2016, rebranding the series.&lt;ref name="WeatherTech"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sportscar365.com/imsa/tusc/weathertech-named-new-title-sponsor-of-imsa-sportscar/ | title = WeatherTech Named New Title Sponsor of IMSA SportsCar | publisher = John Dagys Media, LLC | website = Sportscar365 | last = DiZinno | first = Tony | date = 8 August 2015 | accessdate = 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season begins with its premier race, the [[24 Hours of Daytona|Rolex 24 at Daytona]], the last weekend of January and ends with the [[Petit Le Mans]], another North American Endurance Cup race, in early October.

==History==
On September 5, 2012 it was announced that the [[Grand-Am Road Racing]] sanctioning body would be merging with the [[Braselton, Georgia|Braselton]] based  [[International Motor Sports Association]], and as such both bodies would be merging their premiere sports car series, the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and [[American Le Mans Series]] respectively, with plans to debut in 2014. On November 20, 2012 the merger committee announced that [[SME Branding]] were selected to develop the name, logo and identity of the new series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SME Branding Selected To Develop Identity for GRAND-AM, ALMS Merger|url=http://www.alms.com/articles/sme-branding-selected-develop-identity-grand-am-alms-merger|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2014 Sahlen's Six Hours of The Glen at Watkins Glen International.jpg|thumb|left|2014 Sahlen's Six Hours of the Glen]]
On January 8, 2013, the two series' announced a preliminary class structure for the new merged series. Grand-Am's [[Daytona Prototype]] category and IMSA's [[Le Mans Prototype|P2]] would combine into a single prototype class, with allowances for the unique [[DeltaWing]] to also compete in the new class. The [[Le Mans Prototype Challenge]] class of [[One-Design|single spec]] cars from the American Le Mans Series would continue as is, although the cars will switch to Grand-Am's [[Continental AG|Continental Tires]].&lt;ref name="Continental"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/alms-continental-named-spec-pc-tire/ | title = ALMS: Continental Named New Spec PC Tire | publisher = [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS Communications]] | date = 1 March 2013 | accessdate = 14 March 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130304000737/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/alms-continental-named-spec-pc-tire/ | archivedate = 4 March 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GT class of the American Le Mans Series would remain unchanged, while Grand-Am's GT class will form another GT class, and be combined with the American Le Mans GTC category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GRAND-AM, ALMS Announce 2014 Class Structure |url=http://www.alms.com/articles/grand-am-alms-announce-2014-class-structure |publisher=American Le Mans Series |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504092445/http://www.alms.com/articles/grand-am-alms-announce-2014-class-structure |archive-date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only category of cars not represented in the new series is the American Le Mans Series' P1 category.

The reveal date for the new series was March 14, 2013 at the Chateau Élan Hotel and Conference Center at [[Sebring International Raceway]], two days before the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. American Le Mans CEO Scott Atherton announced the new sanctioning body would remain [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] while Ed Bennett revealed the new titles for the series' five classes.  SME Branding Senior Partner Ed O'Hara then announced the new United SportsCar Racing title and logo, a name submitted through a contest won by Louis Satterlee of Florida, a racer in the Florida Karting Championship Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kartingnewsworldwide.com/usa/2012/7/7/louis-satterlee-2012-florida-karting-championship-series-rev.html | title = LOUIS SATTERLEE - 2012 FLORIDA KARTING CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES REVIEW | publisher = Karting News Worldwide | date = 7 July 2012 | accessdate = 2 February 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140218222943/http://www.kartingnewsworldwide.com/usa/2012/7/7/louis-satterlee-2012-florida-karting-championship-series-rev.html | archivedate = 18 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2013, [[Fox Sports 1]] announced it had signed a TV contract with IMSA to televise the entire USCC season between 2014 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/fox-sports-1-to-air-united-sportscar-racing-080913 | title = FOX to air United SportsCar Racing | publisher = Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC | date = 9 August 2013 | accessdate = 9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on September 12, 2013, [[Tudor watch|Tudor]] was announced as the title sponsor for the series, which was named the United SportsCar Championship.  On August 8, 2015, WeatherTech was announced as the new title sponsor for the series, renaming the series to the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, starting with the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imsa.com/weathertech-joins-imsa-multiyear-partnership-title-sponsor-top-series | title = WeatherTech Joins IMSA In Multiyear Partnership | publisher = [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] |place= Daytona Beach, FL | date = 8 August 2015 | accessdate = 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the 2019 season the series is covered exclusively by [[NBC Sports]] in the United States. The NBC broadcast network will air 9 hours of coverage annually, with the majority of the coverage airing on [[NBCSN]]. [[CNBC]] and the NBC Sports app will provide supplemental coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://racer.com/2018/04/30/imsa-moving-to-nbc-sports-in-2019/ |title=IMSA moving to NBC Sports in 2019 |website=Racer |last=Pruett |first=Marshall |date=30 April 2018 |publisher=Racer Media and Marketing, Inc. |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sportscar365.com/imsa/iwsc/imsa-moves-to-nbc-sports-in-new-six-year-tv-deal/|title=IMSA Moves to NBC Sports in New Six-Year TV Deal – Sportscar365|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Michelin Pilot Challenge ==
{{main|Michelin Pilot Challenge}}
Originally based on a Canadian series before being acquired by Grand-Am, the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge (originally known as Grand-Am Cup) is a production-based [[Touring car racing|touring car]] series. The series is split into two classes known as Grand Sport (GS), intended for large capacity GT-style cars, and Street Tuner (ST), consisting of smaller sedans and coupes, some of which are [[front-wheel drive]]. The IMSA Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge until 2013 supported some Rolex Series races but also headlined some of its own dates. This series continued with the [[United SportsCar Championship]] after the merger and is somewhat comparable to the old [[Trans Am Series]].

==Class structure==
There are three different classes in the United SportsCar Championship series, featuring one [[sports prototype]] category and two [[grand tourer]] classes:

* '''Prototype''' ('''P'''): the flagship class. Originally combined Grand-Am's [[Daytona Prototype]] with the American Le Mans Series [[Le Mans Prototype|P2]] prototypes and the [[DeltaWing]], all built to 2014 specifications. Starting in 2017 the class features [[Daytona Prototype|Daytona Prototype international]] and [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP2]] cars.
* '''GT Le Mans''' ('''GTLM'''): a continuation of the ALMS GT class, consisting of cars matching the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]]'s [[LM_GTE|GTE]] specification.
* '''GT Daytona''' ('''GTD'''): a class that combined the Grand-Am GT &amp; GX classes with the [[Porsche 911 GT3|Porsche 911 GT3 Cup]] cars from the ALMS GTC class. Starting in the 2016 season the class adopted full [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group GT3|GT3]] specifications.

Some races may only use selected classes of cars, for example: Any class car may be permitted entry into the Rolex 24, while at the [[Grand Prix of Long Beach]] only the Prototype (P) and GT Le Mans (GTLM) will be entered.&lt;gallery&gt;

'''''White Wilderness''''' is an American-Canadian [[nature documentary]] produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] in 1958 noted for its propagation of the misconception of [[lemming]] suicide.

The film was directed by [[James Algar]] and narrated by [[Winston Hibler]]. It was filmed on location in [[Canada]] over the course of three years. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/54345/White-Wilderness/details |title=NY Times: White Wilderness |accessdate=November 8, 2008|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

''White Wilderness'' contains a scene that supposedly depicts a mass lemming migration, and ends with the lemmings leaping into the [[Arctic Ocean]].  The narrator of the film states that the lemmings are likely not committing suicide, but rather are in the course of migrating, and upon encountering a body of water are attempting to cross it. If the body of water the lemmings encounter is too wide, they can suffer exhaustion and drown as a result.

In 1982, the [[CBC Television]] news magazine program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]'' broadcast a documentary about animal cruelty in Hollywood called "Cruel Camera", focusing on ''White Wilderness'', as well as the television program ''[[Wild Kingdom]]''. [[Bob McKeown]], the host of the CBC program, discovered that the lemming scene was filmed at the [[Bow River]] near downtown [[Calgary]], and not in the Arctic Ocean as implied by the film. McKeown interviewed a lemming expert, who claimed that the particular species of lemming shown in the film is not known to migrate, much less commit mass suicide. Additionally, he revealed that footage of a [[polar bear]] cub falling down an Arctic ice slope was really filmed in a Calgary film studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/cruelcamera/video2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615205717/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/cruelcamera/video2.html|title=Watch Video: Cruel Camera (May 5, 1982)|publisher=[[CBC News]]|archivedate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lemmings.asp |title= Snopes.com suicides|accessdate=July 12, 2009 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though it was legal in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedisneyfilms.com/2010/01/white-wilderness-1958.html&lt;/ref&gt;, it was unlikely to be authorized or approved by Walt himself. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/491121/White-Wilderness/articles.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
''White Wilderness'' was the inspiration for 1988 [[Dead Kennedys]] song "[[Bedtime for Democracy|Potshot Heard Round the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadkennedys.com/albums_bed.html|title=Welcome To The Official Website For Dead Kennedys|website=www.deadkennedys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene of lemmings leaping off a cliff in ''White Wilderness'' was used as political metaphor in a campaign ad promoting [[Andrew Monroe Rice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrewforoklahoma.com|title=Andrew Rice campaign website|website=andrewforoklahoma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Oklahoma candidate in the 2008 US Senate race.

'''''zbCOMMA''''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 早报逗号) is a [[Singapore]]-based [[Chinese language]] [[newspaper]] owned by [[Singapore Press Holdings]] (SPH). It used to be known as ''Friday Weekly'' (星期5周报). 

==History==
''Friday Weekly'' was launched on 22 February 1991 by Senior Minister Mr [[Lee Kuan Yew]]. It was published weekly every Friday. Its main target readers are secondary school students and teenagers.

On January 7, 2009, the new student paper ''zbCOMMA'' was launched. It is the revamped product of ''Friday Weekly''. Unlike ''Friday Weekly'', ''zbCOMMA'' is distributed to schools together with ''[[Lianhe Zaobao]]'' on Wednesdays. It consists of follow-ups on news on ''Lianhe Zaobao'', articles written by ''Zaobao'' reporters and blurbs for ''Zaobao'' news that serve to connect students with ''Zaobao''.
