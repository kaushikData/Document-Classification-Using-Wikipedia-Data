[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|280px|''Aeneas flees burning Troy'', [[Federico Barocci]], 1598 ([[Galleria Borghese]], Rome, Italy)]]

In [[Greco-Roman]] [[mythology]], '''Aeneas''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|n|iː|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aeneas |title=Aeneas |website=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2015-07-14 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Αἰνείας, ''Aineías'', possibly derived from Greek {{lang|grc|αἰνή}} meaning "praised") was a [[Troy|Trojan]] [[hero]], the son of the prince [[Anchises]] and the goddess [[Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]). His father was a first [[cousin]] of King [[Priam]] of Troy (both being grandsons of [[Ilus#Ilus (son of Tros)|Ilus]], founder of [[Troy]]), making Aeneas a second cousin to Priam's [[List of children of Priam|children]] (such as [[Hector]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]). He is a character in [[Greek mythology]] and is mentioned in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Aeneas receives full treatment in [[Roman mythology]], most extensively in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]],'' where he is cast as an ancestor of [[Romulus and Remus]]. He became the first true hero of Rome. [[Snorri Sturluson]] identifies him with the Norse [[Æsir]] [[Vidarr]].&lt;ref&gt;The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlson Translated by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur [1916] Prologue II at Internet Sacred Texts Archive. Accessed 11/14/17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Aeneas is the [[Latin language|Latin]] spelling of [[Greek language|Greek]] Αἰνείας (''Aineías''). In the Homeric Hymn to [[Aphrodite]], Aeneas is first introduced with Aphrodite naming him Αἰνείας (''Aineías'') for the αὶνóν ἄχος ("terrible grief") he caused her, where ''Aineías'' derives from the adjective αὶνóν (''ainon'', meaning "terrible").&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Nagy (Translator), ''[http://www.uh.edu/~cldue/texts/aphrodite.html#_ftn18 Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite]'' 198-199: "His name will be Aineias [Aeneas], since it was an unspeakable [ainos] ''akhos'' that took hold of me—grief that I had fallen into the bed of a mortal man."&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular etymology for the name, apparently exploited by Homer in the Iliad.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Faulkner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VuATDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=aeneas%20etymology&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite: Introduction, Text, and Commentary]'' (2008) p.257&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the Medieval period there were writers who held that, because the Aeneid was written by a philosopher it is meant to be read philosophically.&lt;ref&gt;Marilynn Desmond, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2b1qK94kbgIC&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=aeneas%20etymology%20ennos%20demas&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Reading Dido: Gender, Textuality, and Medieval Aeneid]'' (1994) pp. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt; As such, in the "natural order", the meaning of Aeneas' name combines Greek ''ennos'' ("dweller") and ''demas'' ("body"), which becomes ''ennaios'', meaning "in-dweller" (i.e. as a god inhabiting a mortal body).&lt;ref&gt;[[John of Salisbury]], ''Polycraticus'' 8.24-25; [[Bernardus Silvestris|Bernard Sylvestris of Tours]], ''Commentum supra sex libros Eneidos Vergilii''&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no certainty regarding the origin of his name.

===Epithets===
In imitation of the ''Iliad'', Virgil borrows epithets of Homer, including; Anchisiades, ''magnanimum'', ''magnus'', ''heros'', and ''bonus''. Though he borrows many, Virgil gives Aeneas two epithets of his own in the ''Aeneid:'' ''pater'' and ''pius''. The epithets applied by Virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of Homer, for whilst Odysseus is ''poikilios'' ("wily"), Aeneas is described as ''pius'' ("pious"), which conveys a strong moral tone. The purpose of these epithets seems to enforce the notion of Aeneas' divine hand as father and founder of the Roman race, and their use seem circumstantial: when Aeneas is praying he refers to himself as pius, and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission. Likewise, Aeneas is called ''pater'' when acting in the interest of his men.&lt;ref&gt;Milman Parry (Author), Adam Parry (Editor), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cbvyswUgSnEC&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;ots=9KObiMHxbR&amp;dq=aeneas%20epithets&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry]'' (1971) p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek myth and epos==

===Homeric ''Hymn to Aphrodite''===
[[File:William Blake Richmond - Venus and Anchises - Google Art Project.jpg|Painting ''Venus and Anchises'' by [[William Blake Richmond]] (1889 or 90)|thumb|400px]]

The story of the birth of Aeneas is told in the "Hymn to Aphrodite", one of the major [[Homeric Hymns]]. Aphrodite has caused [[Zeus]] to fall in love with mortal women. In retaliation, Zeus puts desire in her heart for Anchises, who is tending his cattle among the hills near [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]]. When Aphrodite sees him she is smitten. She adorns herself as if for a wedding among the gods and appears before him. He is overcome by her beauty, believing that she is a goddess, but Aphrodite identifies herself as a [[Phrygia]]n princess. After they make love, Aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and Anchises fears what might happen to him as a result of their liaison. Aphrodite assures him that he will be protected, and tells him that she will bear him a son to be called Aeneas. However, she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with a goddess. When Aeneas is born, Aphrodite takes him to the [[nymph]]s of Mount Ida. She directs them to raise the child to age five, then take him to Anchises.&lt;ref&gt;"Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite." trans by Gregory Nagy, University of Houston.&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, Anchises later brags about his encounter with Aphrodite, and as a result is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by Zeus. Thereafter he is lame in that foot, so that Aeneas has to carry him from the flames of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''The Aeneid''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homer's ''Iliad''===
[[File:Aineias Ankhises Louvre F118.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Aeneas carrying [[Anchises]], black-figured [[oinochoe]], ca. 520–510 BC, [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]] (F 118)]]
Aeneas is a minor character in the ''[[Iliad]]'', where he is twice saved from death by the gods as if for an as-yet-unknown destiny, but is an honorable warrior in his own right. Having held back from the fighting, aggrieved with Priam because in spite of his brave deeds he was not given his due share of honour, he leads an attack against Idomeneus to recover the body of his brother-in-law Alcathous at the urging of [[Deiphobus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2199/2199-h/2199-h.htm Homer, ''The Iliad'', Book XIII, (Samuel Butler, trans.)]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the leader of the Trojans' [[Dardanians (Trojan)|Dardanian]] allies, as well as a second cousin and principal lieutenant of [[Hector]], son of the Trojan king [[Priam]]. Aeneas's mother [[Aphrodite]] frequently comes to his aid on the battlefield, and he is a favorite of [[Apollo]]. Aphrodite and Apollo rescue Aeneas from combat with [[Diomedes]] of [[Argos]], who nearly kills him, and carry him away to [[Pergamos]] for healing. Even [[Poseidon]], who normally favors the Greeks, comes to Aeneas's rescue after he falls under the assault of [[Achilles]], noting that Aeneas, though from a junior branch of the royal family, is destined to become king of the Trojan people. Bruce Louden presents Aeneas as a "type" in the tradition of [[Utnapishtim]], [[Baucis and Philemon]], and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]; the just man spared the general destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://camws.org/meeting/2006/abstracts/louden.html Louden, Bruce. "Aeneas in the Iliad: the One Just Man", 102nd Annual Meeting of CAMWS, Classical Association of the Middle West and South, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Apollodorus explains that "...the Greeks let him alone on account of his piety".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DEpitome%3Abook%3DE%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D21 Apollodorus, ''Epitome'', (James G. Frazer ed.), Chap.V, 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sources===
The Roman mythographer [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (c. 64 BCE – CE 17) in his ''Fabulae''&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''[[Fabulae]]'' 115.&lt;/ref&gt; credits Aeneas with killing 28 enemies in the Trojan War. Aeneas also appears in the Trojan narratives attributed to [[Dares Phrygius]] and [[Dictys of Crete]]

==Roman myth and literature==

[[File:Denier frappé sous César célébrant le mythe d'Enée et d'Anchise.jpg|thumb|Aeneas and Anchises]]

The history of Aeneas was continued by Roman authors. One influential source was the account of Rome's founding in [[Cato the Elder]]'s ''[[Origines]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stout|first=S.E.|year=1924|title=How Vergil Established for Aeneas a Legal Claim to a Home and a Throne in Italy|journal=[[The Classical Journal]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=152–60|jstor=3288552}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aeneas legend was well known in Virgil's day and appeared in various historical works, including the ''Roman Antiquities'' of the Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (relying on [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]), ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' by [[Livy]] (probably dependent on [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]], fl. 200 BCE), and [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] (now extant only in an epitome by [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]).

===Virgil's ''Aeneid''===
[[File:Venus as Huntress Appears to Aeneas.jpg|thumb|''Venus as Huntress Appears to Aeneas'', by [[Pietro da Cortona]]]]

The ''[[Aeneid]]'' explains that Aeneas is one of the few Trojans who were not killed or enslaved when Troy fell. Aeneas, after being commanded by the gods to flee, gathered a group, collectively known as the [[Aeneads]], who then traveled to [[Italy]] and became progenitors of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Aeneads included Aeneas's trumpeter [[Misenus]], his father [[Anchises]], his friends [[Achates]], [[Sergestus]], and [[Acmon, the Aenead|Acmon]], the healer [[Iapyx]], the helmsman [[Palinurus]], and his son [[Ascanius]] (also known as Iulus, Julus, or Ascanius Julius). He carried with him the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to Italy.

Several attempts to find a new home failed; one such stop was on [[Sicily]], where in [[Trapani|Drepanum]], on the island's western coast, his father, Anchises, died peacefully.

[[File:Guérin Énée racontant à Didon les malheurs de la ville de Troie Louvre 5184.jpg|thumb|right|Aeneas tells Dido about the fall of Troy, by [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]]]]

After a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s request, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at [[Carthage]] after six years of wanderings.  Aeneas had a year-long affair with the Carthaginian queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (also known as Elissa), who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. A marriage of sorts was arranged between Dido and Aeneas at the instigation of Juno, who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants. Aeneas's mother [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (the Roman adaptation of Aphrodite) realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come. However, the messenger god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Venus to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, compelling him to leave secretly. When Dido learned of this, she uttered a curse that would forever pit Carthage against Rome, an enmity that would culminate in the [[Punic Wars]]. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave Aeneas when they first met.

After the sojourn in Carthage, the Trojans returned to Sicily where Aeneas organized [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] to honor his father, who had died a year before. The company traveled on and landed on the western coast of Italy. Aeneas descended into the underworld where he met Dido (who turned away from him to return to her husband) and his father, who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of Rome.

[[File:Aeneas and Turnus.jpg|thumb|left|325px|Aeneas defeats [[Turnus]], by [[Luca Giordano]], 1634–1705. The ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of Aeneas is shown ascendant, looking into the light of the future, while that of Turnus is setting, shrouded in darkness]]

[[Latinus]], king of the Latins, welcomed Aeneas's army of exiled Trojans and let them reorganize their lives in [[Latium]]. His daughter [[Lavinia]] had been promised to [[Turnus]], king of the [[Rutuli]], but Latinus received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land &amp;mdash; namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy, and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of Juno, who was aligned with King [[Mezentius]] of [[Etruscan civilization|the Etruscans]] and Queen [[Amata]] of the Latins. Aeneas's forces prevailed. Turnus was killed, and Virgil's account ends abruptly.

===Other sources===
The rest of Aeneas's biography is gleaned from other ancient sources, including Livy and Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''. According to Livy, Aeneas was victorious but Latinus died in the war. Aeneas founded the city of [[Lavinium]], named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, [[Anna Perenna]], who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy. After Aeneas's death, Venus asked Jupiter to make her son immortal. Jupiter agreed. The river god [[Numicus]] cleansed Aeneas of all his mortal parts and Venus anointed him with ambrosia and nectar, making him a god. Aeneas was recognized as the god [[Jupiter Indiges]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy01.html Titus Livius. ''The History of Rome'', (Rev. Canon Roberts, trans.), Vol. I, J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., London, 1905]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval accounts==
[[Snorri Sturlason]] in the Prologue of [[The Prose Edda|The Edda]], tells of the world as parted in three [[continents]]: [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and the third part called [[Europe]] or Enea &lt;ref&gt; The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlson Translated by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur [1916] Prologue II at Internet Sacred Texts Archive.

Snorri also tells of a Trojan named [[Munon]] or [[Menon (Trojan)|Menon]], who marries the daughter of the [[High King]] (Yfirkonungr) [[Priam]] called [[Troan]] and travels to distant lands, marries the [[Sibyl|Sybil]] and got a son, Tror, who, as Snorri tells, is identical to [[Thor]]. This tale resemble some episodes of the Aeneid &lt;ref&gt; The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlson Translated by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur [1916] Prologue III at Internet Sacred Texts Archive. Accessed 11/14/17&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Continuations of Trojan matter in the Middle Ages had their effects on the character of Aeneas as well. The 12th-century French ''[[Roman d'Enéas]]'' addresses Aeneas's sexuality. Though Virgil appears to deflect all homoeroticism onto [[Nisus and Euryalus]], making his Aeneas a purely heterosexual character, in the Middle Ages there was at least a suspicion of homoeroticism in Aeneas. The ''Roman d'Enéas'' addresses that charge, when [[Amata|Queen Amata]] opposes Aeneas's marrying [[Lavinia]], claiming that Aeneas loved boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eldevik|first=Randi|year=1991|title=Negotiations of Homoerotic Tradition|journal=[[Publications of the Modern Language Association|PMLA]]|volume=106|issue=5|pages=1177–78|jstor=462692|doi=10.2307/462692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval interpretations of Aeneas were greatly influenced by both Virgil and other Latin sources. Specifically, the accounts by Dares and Dictys, which were reworked by 13th-century Italian writer [[Guido delle Colonne]] (in ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]''), colored many later readings. From Guido, for instance, the [[Pearl Poet]] and other English writers get the suggestion&lt;ref name=tolkien/&gt; that Aeneas's safe departure from Troy with his possessions and family was a reward for treason, for which he was chastised by [[Hecuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colonne|first=Guido delle|authorlink=Guido delle Colonne|editor=Griffin, N. E.|title=Historia destructionis Troiae|url=http://www.medievalacademy.org/resource/resmgr/maa_books_online/griffin_0026.htm|series=Medieval Academy Books|volume=26|year=1936|publisher=Medieval Academy of America|location=Cambridge|pages=218, 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' (late 14th century) the Pearl Poet, like many other English writers, employed Aeneas to establish a genealogy for the foundation of Britain,&lt;ref name=tolkien&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tolkien, J.

==Family and legendary descendants==
[[File:B. PINELLI, Enea e il Tevere.jpg|thumb|right|Aeneas and the god [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiber]], by [[Bartolomeo Pinelli]]]]

Aeneas had an extensive family tree. His [[wet-nurse]] was [[Caieta]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vergil]] ''[[Aeneid]]'' 7.1-4&lt;/ref&gt; and he is the father of [[Ascanius]] with [[Creusa (wife of Aeneas)|Creusa]], and of [[Silvius (mythology)|Silvius]] with Lavinia. Ascanius, also known as [[Iulus]] (or Julius),&lt;ref&gt;[[Vergil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1983 1.267&lt;/ref&gt; founded [[Alba Longa]] and was the first in a [[Latin kings of Alba Longa|long series of kings]]. According to the mythology outlined by Virgil in the ''Aeneid,'' Romulus and Remus were both descendants of Aeneas through their mother Rhea Silvia, making Aeneas the progenitor of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. L'Homond ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SlYZAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=YZDcVTj7k9&amp;dq=kings%20alba%20longa%20fill%20the%20gap&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=kings%20alba%20longa%20fill%20the%20gap&amp;f=false Selections from Viri Romae]'' p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Some early sources call him their father or grandfather,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4literature.net/Plutarch/Romulus/ Romulus by Plutarch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but considering the commonly accepted dates of the fall of Troy (1184 BC) and the founding of [[Rome]] (753 BC), this seems unlikely. The [[Gens Julia|Julian family]] of Rome, most notably [[Julius Cæsar]] and [[Augustus]], traced their lineage to Ascanius and Aeneas,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] ''Roman Antiquities'' I.70.4&lt;/ref&gt; thus to the goddess Venus. Through the Julians, the [[Palemonids]] make this claim. The legendary [[List of legendary kings of Britain|kings of Britain]] – including [[King Arthur]] – trace their family through a grandson of Aeneas, [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Selby ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LSFXAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=jBrFHXrHn9&amp;dq=house%20of%20brutus%20sylvius&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Events to be Remembered in the History of Britain]'' p.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character and physical appearance==
[[File:Affresco romano - Enea e di.jpg|thumb|[[Dido]] and Aeneas, from a Roman fresco, [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Third Style]] (10 BC - 45 AD), [[Pompeii]], Italy]]
Aeneas's consistent epithet in Virgil and other Latin authors is ''pius'', a term that connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness.

In the ''Aeneid'', Aeneas is described as strong and handsome, but neither his hair colour nor complexion are described.&lt;ref&gt;''What Does Aeneas Look like?'', Mark Griffith, Classical Philology, Vol. 80, No. 4 (Oct., 1985), p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; In late antiquity however sources add further physical descriptions. The ''De excidio Troiae'' of [[Dares Phrygius]] describes Aeneas as ‘‘auburn-haired, stocky, eloquent, courteous, prudent, pious, and charming.’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/DaresPhrygius.html |title=Classical E-Text: Dares Phrygius, The Fall Of Troy |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a brief physical description found in 6th century AD [[John Malalas]]' ''Chronographia'': ‘‘Aeneas: short, fat, with a good chest, powerful, with a ruddy complexion, a broad face, a good nose, fair skin, bald on the forehead, a good beard, grey eyes.’’&lt;ref&gt;Lowden, John. ''Illuminated prophet books: a study of Byzantine manuscripts of the major and minor prophets'' Penn State Press, 1988, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern portrayals==

===Literature===

Aeneas and [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] are the main characters of a 17th-century [[broadside (music)|broadside]] [[ballad]] called "[[The Wandering Prince of Troy]]." The ballad ultimately alters Aeneas's fate from traveling on years after Dido's death to joining her as a spirit soon after her suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/search_combined/?ss=the+wandering+prince+of+troy English Broadside Ballad Archive], ballad facsimile and full text&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern literature, Aeneas is the speaker in two poems by [[Allen Tate]], "Aeneas at Washington" and "Aeneas at New York." He is a main character in [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'', a re-telling of the last six books of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' told from the point of view of [[Lavinia]], daughter of King [[Latinus]] of [[Latium]].

Aeneas appears in [[David Gemmell]]'s ''Troy'' series as a main heroic character who goes by the name [[Helikaon]].

In [[Rick Riordan]]'s book series, ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', Aeneas is regarded as the first Roman demigod, son of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] rather than Aphrodite.

===Opera, film and other media===
Aeneas is a title character in [[Henry Purcell]]'s opera ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (c. 1688), and one of the principal roles in [[Hector Berlioz]]' opera ''[[Les Troyens]]'' (c. 1857). Canadian composer [[James Rolfe (composer)|James Rolfe]] composed his opera ''Aeneas and Dido'' (2007; to a libretto by [[André Alexis]]) as a companion piece to Purcell's opera.

Despite its many dramatic elements, Aeneas's story has generated little interest from the film industry. Portrayed by [[Steve Reeves]], he was the main character in the 1961 [[sword and sandal]] film ''[[Guerra di Troia]]'' (''The Trojan War'').  Reeves reprised the role the following year in the film ''[[The Avenger (1962 film)|The Avenger]]'', about Aeneas's arrival in [[Latium]] and his conflicts with local tribes as he tries to settle his fellow Trojan refugees there.

The most recent cinematic portrayal of Aeneas was in the film ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'', in which he appears as a youth charged by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] to protect the Trojan refugees, and to continue the ideals of the city and its people. Paris gives Aeneas Priam's sword, in order to give legitimacy and continuity to the royal line of Troy – and lay the foundations of Roman culture. In this film, he is not a member of the royal family and does not appear to fight in the war.

In the role-playing game ''[[Vampire: The Requiem]]'' by White Wolf Game Studios, Aeneas figures as one of the mythical founders of the [[Ventrue Clan]].

in the action game ''[[Warriors: Legends of Troy]]'', Aeneas is a playable character. The game ends with him and the Aeneans fleeing Troy's destruction and, spurned by the words of a prophetess thought crazed, goes to a new country (Italy) where he will start an empire greater than Greece and Troy combined that shall rule the world for 1000 years, never to be outdone in the tale of men (The Roman Empire).

In the 2018 TV miniseries ''[[Troy: Fall of a City]]'', Aeneas is portrayed by [[Alfred Enoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/troy-fall-of-a-city-cast-bella-dayne-louis-hunter-joseph-mawle-frances-oconnor-david-threlfall-bbc-netflix-1202055633/|title=‘Troy: Fall Of A City’: Bella Dayne, Louis Hunter &amp; More Join BBC/Netflix Epic|date=March 30, 2017|publisher=Deadline|language=en-US|access-date=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions in art==
Scenes depicting Aeneas, especially from the Aeneid, have been the focus of study for centuries. They have been the frequent subject of art and literature since their debut in the 1st century.

===Villa Valmarana===
The artist [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] was commissioned by Gaetano Valmarana in 1757 to fresco several rooms in the Villa Valmarana, the family villa situated outside [[Vicenza]]. Tiepolo decorated the ''palazzina'' with scenes from epics such as Homer's ''Iliad'' and Virgil's ''Aeneid''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Collins, Elise K. Kirk ed. ''Opera and Vivaldi'' p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrea Pia Yates''' (née '''Kennedy'''; born July 2, 1964) is a former resident of [[Houston, Texas]], who confessed to drowning her five children in their bathtub on June 20, 2001.&lt;ref name="Spitz, 2006"&gt;Spitz, D.J.

She was represented by Houston criminal defense attorney George Parnham. [[Chuck Rosenthal (district attorney)|Chuck Rosenthal]], the district attorney in [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], asked for the death penalty in her 2002 trial. Her case placed the [[M'Naghten Rules]], along with the [[Irresistible Impulse]] Test, a legal test for sanity, under close public scrutiny in the United States. She was convicted of [[capital murder]]. After the guilty verdict, but before sentencing, the State abandoned its request for the death penalty in light of false testimony by one of its expert psychiatric witnesses. She was sentenced to [[life in prison]] with the possibility of [[parole]] after 40 years. The verdict was overturned on [[appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6794098/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/convictions-overturned-mom-who-drowned-kids|title=Andrea Yates' murder convictions overturned|publisher=MSNBC|date=2005-01-06|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2006, the Texas jury in her retrial found that Yates was [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. She was consequently committed by the court to the [[North Texas State Hospital]], Vernon Campus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/26/ng.01.html "Not Guilty Verdict for Andrea Yates"], [[CNN]], July 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a high-security mental health facility in [[Vernon, Texas|Vernon]], where she received medical treatment and was a roommate of [[Dena Schlosser]], another woman who committed [[infanticide]] by killing her infant daughter.

==Background==
Yates was born in [[Hallsville, Texas]], the youngest of the five children of Jutta Karin Koehler, a [[Germans|German immigrant]], and Andrew Emmett Kennedy, whose parents were [[Irish people|Irish immigrants]]. She suffered from [[bulimia]] during her teenage years. She also suffered from depression, and at 17 she spoke to a friend about suicide.&lt;ref name="omalley"/&gt;

She graduated from [[Milby High School]] in 1982. She was the [[valedictorian|class valedictorian]], captain of the swim team, and an officer in the [[National Honor Society]].&lt;ref name="Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy"&gt;[http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?10+Duke+J.+Gender+L.+&amp;+Pol%27y+1#H2N1], ''Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy''.&lt;!-- author, ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Yates completed a two-year pre-nursing program at the [[University of Houston]] and graduated from the [[University of Texas School of Nursing at Houston|University of Texas School of Nursing]]. From 1986 until 1994 she worked as a [[registered nurse]] at the University of Texas [[M.D. Anderson Cancer Center]]. In summer 1989 she met Russell "Rusty" Yates, two months her junior, at the Sunscape Apartments in Houston. They soon moved in together and were married on April 17, 1993.&lt;ref name="TQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/00803/Yates_Frameset.htm|title=Andrea Yates|publisher=Library.thinkquest.org|accessdate=2012-03-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023060706/http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/00803/Yates_Frameset.htm|archivedate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They announced that they "would seek to have [[Quiverfull|as many babies as nature allowed]]", and bought a four-bedroom house in [[Friendswood, Texas]]. Their first child, Noah, was born in February 1994, just before Rusty accepted a job offer in [[Florida]], so they relocated to a small trailer in [[Seminole, Florida|Seminole]]. By the time of the birth of their third child, Paul, they moved back to Houston and purchased a GMC motor home.&lt;ref name="TQ"/&gt;

Following the birth of her fourth child, Luke, Yates became [[clinical depression|depressed]]. On June 16, 1999, Rusty found her shaking and chewing her fingers. The next day, she attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on pills. She was admitted to the hospital and prescribed [[antidepressant]]s. Soon after her release, she begged Rusty to let her die as she held a knife up to her neck. Once again hospitalized, she was given a cocktail of medications including [[Haldol]], an anti-psychotic drug. Her condition improved immediately and she was prescribed it on her release. After that, Rusty moved the family into a small house for the sake of her health. She appeared temporarily stabilized.&lt;ref name="TQ"/&gt;

In July 1999, Yates suffered a [[nervous breakdown]], which culminated in two suicide attempts and two psychiatric hospitalizations that summer. She was diagnosed with [[postpartum psychosis]].&lt;ref name="Lancet"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLellan|first=Faith|title=Mental health and justice: the case of Andrea Yates|journal=[[The Lancet]]| volume=368|issue=9551|pages=1951–54|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=[[Amsterdam]]|date=2 December 2006|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606697894/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69789-4|accessdate=2008-04-10|pmid=17146865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yates's first psychiatrist, Dr. Eileen Starbranch, testified that she urged her and Rusty not to have any more children, as it would "guarantee future psychotic depression". They conceived their fifth and final child approximately 7 weeks after her discharge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,202606,00.html "Doctor: I Warned Andrea Yates Not to Have Any More Children"], [[Fox News Channel]], July 7, 2006; retrieved October 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She stopped taking [[Haldol]] in March 2000 and gave birth to her daughter, Mary, on November 30, 2000. She seemed to be coping well until the death of her father on March 12, 2001.&lt;ref name="crime.about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crime.about.com/od/current/p/andreayates.htm|title=Andrea Yates profile|publisher=Crime.about.com|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yates then stopped taking medication, [[self-harm|mutilated herself]], and read the [[Bible]] feverishly. She stopped feeding Mary.&lt;ref name="TQ"/&gt; She became so incapacitated that she required immediate hospitalization. On April 1, 2001 she came under the care of Dr. Mohammed Saeed. She was treated and released. On May 3, 2001, she degenerated back into a "near [[catatonia|catatonic]]" state and filled the bathtub in the middle of the day; she would later confess to police that she had planned to drown the children that day, but had decided against doing it then. She was hospitalized the next day after a scheduled doctor visit; her psychiatrist determined she was probably suicidal and had filled the tub to drown herself.&lt;ref name="crime.about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="omalley"/&gt;

==Killings==
At the time of the murders, Yates' family was living in the Houston suburb of [[Clear Lake City]]. She continued under Dr. Saeed's care until June 20, 2001, when Rusty left for work, leaving her alone to watch the children against Dr. Saeed's instructions to supervise her around the clock.&lt;ref name="chron.com"&gt;Leron, Dale. [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/drownings/4044790.html Yates not Grossly Psychotic before Drownings Dietz testifies], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', July 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Dora Yates, had been scheduled by him to arrive an hour later to take over for her. In the space of that hour, she drowned all five children.&lt;ref name="Houston Chon"&gt;Rendon, Ruth. [http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2001_3319302 "Brother: Yates thought drownings 'best thing'/He says sister felt she was a bad mom"], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', July 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

She started with John, Paul, and Luke, and then laid them in her bed. She then drowned Mary, whom she left floating in the tub. Noah came in and asked what was wrong with Mary. He then ran, but she soon caught and drowned him. She left him floating in the tub and laid Mary in John's arms in the bed. She then called the police repeatedly saying she needed an officer but would not say why. Then she called Rusty, telling him to come home right away.&lt;ref name="TQ"/&gt;

==Trials==
Yates confessed to drowning her children. Prior to her second trial, she told Dr. [[Michael Welner]] that she waited for Rusty to leave for work that morning before filling the bathtub because she knew he would have prevented her from harming them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/Story?id=2245394&amp;page=2|title=Dr. Michael Welner, who examined her, lists 68 reasons she knew right from wrong|publisher=Abcnews.go.com|date=2006-07-27|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the murders, police found the family dog locked up; Rusty advised Welner that it had normally been allowed to run free, and was so when he had left the house that morning, leading the psychiatrist to allege that she locked it in a cage to prevent it from interfering with her killing the children one by one. Rusty got a family friend, George Parnham, to act as her attorney.&lt;ref name=Ramsland&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine|title=Andrea Yates: Ill or Evil?|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/women/andrea_yates/3.html|publisher=[[TruTV]]|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the defense's expert testimony agreed that Yates was psychotic, Texas law requires that, in order to successfully assert the [[insanity defense]], the defendant must prove that he or she could not discern right from wrong at the time of the crime. In March 2002, a jury rejected the insanity defense and found her guilty. Although the prosecution had sought the [[death penalty]], the jury refused that option. The trial court sentenced her to [[life imprisonment]] in the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] with eligibility for [[parole]] in 40 years.&lt;ref name="roche"/&gt;

On January 6, 2005, a [[Texas Court of Appeals]] reversed the convictions, because California psychiatrist and prosecution witness Dr. [[Park Dietz]] admitted he had given materially false testimony during the trial. In his testimony, Dietz had stated that shortly before the murders, an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' had aired featuring a woman who drowned her children and was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/11/court.archive.yates2/index.html Andrea Yates case: Witness at heart of appeal explains error], December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Author, and later Yale University lecturer, Suzanne O'Malley, was covering the trial for ''[[O: The Oprah Magazine]]'', ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''&lt;!-- date, page(s), etc., needed --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Standing by His Woman'", ''The New York Times Magazine'', March 3, 2002, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NBC News]]. She had previously been a writer for ''Law &amp; Order'' and immediately reported that no such episode existed;&lt;ref&gt;"'Law &amp; Order' saved Yates", ''New York Post'', March 22, 2002, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 2004, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' did air the episode "[[Magnificat (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent episode)|Magnificat]]", based in part on Yates's case. The appellate court held unanimously that the jury might have been influenced by Dietz's false testimony and therefore a new trial would be necessary. On January 9, 2006, Yates again entered pleas of not guilty by reason of insanity. On February 1, 2006, she was granted release on [[bail]] on the condition that she be admitted to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental health treatment facility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc5.com/money/9546260/detail.html "Psychiatrist: Yates Thought Drownings Were Right"], nbc5.com, July 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2006, after three days of deliberations, Yates was found not guilty by reason of insanity, as defined by the state of Texas. She was thereafter committed to the [[North Texas State Hospital|North Texas State Hospital–Vernon Campus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jury finds Yates insane, not guilty|publisher=Houston Chronicle|date=2006-07-26|url=http://www.chron.com/news/article/Jury-finds-Yates-insane-not-guilty-1857308.php|accessdate=2006-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, she was moved to the [[Kerrville State Hospital]], a low security mental facility in Kerrville, TX.&lt;ref name="CNN - Fast Facts"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Library |first1=CNN |title=Andrea Yates Fast Facts |url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/25/us/andrea-yates-fast-facts/index.html |accessdate=3 October 2018 |work=CNN |publisher=Cable News Network |date=21 June 2018 |quote=January 2007-present - Yates is transferred from North Texas State Hospital Vernon Campus to the Kerrville State Hospital in Kerrville, Texas, where she currently resides.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abclocal.go.com"/&gt; 

Although psychiatrists for both Texas's state prosecutors and her defense lawyers agreed that she was severely mentally ill with one of several psychotic diseases at the time she killed her children,&lt;ref name="omalley"&gt;O'Malley, Suzanne. "Are You There Alone?", ''The Unspeakable Crime of Andrea Yates'', pp. 20, 23, 78, 143–45, 175-77, 217, 236, 246.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, publisher needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the state of Texas asserted that she was by legal definition aware enough to judge her actions as right or wrong despite her mental defect. The prosecution further implied spousal revenge as motive for the killings, despite the conclusion of defense experts that there was no evidence to support such a motive.&lt;ref&gt;Gesalman, Anne Belli. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/74967?tid=relatedcl "Psychosis Or Vengeance?"], ''Newsweek'', March 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original jury believed she was legally aware of her actions, they disagreed that her motive was spousal-revenge.&lt;ref name="omalley"/&gt;

===Rusty Yates===
According to trial testimony in 2006, Dr. Saeed advised Rusty, a former NASA engineer, not to leave Yates unattended. However, he began leaving her alone with the children in the weeks leading up to the drownings for short periods of time, apparently to improve her independence.&lt;ref name="chron.com"/&gt; He had announced at a family gathering the weekend before the drownings that he had decided to leave her home alone for an hour each morning and evening, so that she would not become totally dependent on him and his mother for her maternal responsibilities.&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt;

Yates's brother, Brian Kennedy, told [[Larry King]] on a broadcast of [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' that Rusty expressed to him in 2001 while transporting her to Devereux treatment facility that all depressed people needed was a "swift kick in the pants" to get them motivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0501/16/lkl.01.html Transcript], CNN-Larry King Live, January 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Jutta Kennedy, expressed shock when she heard of Rusty's plan while at the gathering with them, saying Yates wasn't stable enough to care for the children. She noted that Yates demonstrated she wasn't in her right mind when she nearly choked Mary by trying to feed her solid food.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Cynthia, [http://members.aol.com/niek02/KTRKArchives/AndreaYatesMotherRecallsConversationDaysBefore_Mar18_2002.htm "Andrea Yates’s Mother Recalls Conversation Days before Drownings"], KTRK News, January 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to authors [[Suzy Spencer]] and Suzanne O'Malley, who investigated her story in great detail, it was during a phone call Dr. Saeed made to Rusty during the breaking news of the killings that Saeed first learned that she was not being supervised full-time.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="omalley"/&gt; Yates's first psychiatrist, Dr. Eileen Starbranch, says she was shocked to disbelief when, during an office visit with the couple, they expressed a desire to discontinue her medications so she could become pregnant again. She warned and counseled them against having more children, and noted in the medical record two days later, "Apparently patient and husband plan to have as many babies as nature will allow! This will surely guarantee future psychotic depression."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/28/national/main502440.shtml "Yates's husband takes stand"], CBSNews.com, February 26, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Yates became pregnant with her fifth child, Mary, only 7 weeks after being discharged from Dr. Starbranch's care on January 12, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/drownings/1274920.html Yates Timeline], ''Houston Chronicle'', January 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rusty stated to the media he was never told by psychiatrists that his wife was psychotic nor that she could harm the children, and that, had he known otherwise, he would have never had more children. "'If I'd known she was psychotic, we'd never have even considered having more kids', he told the ''[[Dallas Observer]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Langford, Terri. [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/drownings/3733316.html "Rusty Yates's actions puzzle acquaintance"], ''Houston Chronicle'', June 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stowers, Carlton. [http://www.dallasobserver.com/2003-01-23/news/tracks-of-his-tears/full "Tracks of His Tears"], ''Dallas Observer'', January 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Laura. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/03/18/usat-yates.htm "Rusty Yates 'didn't know' wife was psychotic"], USAToday.com, March 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she revealed to her prison psychiatrist, Dr. Melissa Ferguson, that prior to their last child, "she had told Rusty that she did not want to have sex because Dr. Starbranch had said she might hurt her children." Rusty, she said, simply asserted his procreative religious beliefs, complimented her as a good mother, and persuaded her that she could handle more children.&lt;ref&gt;A few months before November 6, 2001, she had recalled that prior to Mary's birth, she had told her husband she did not want to have sex because Dr. Starbranch had said she might hurt her children. He had said, "The Lord tells us to go forth and multiply. You're a good mother. You can handle more children." After recounting this, she asked Dr. Ferguson, "Did I do the right thing?" [Interview with Dr. Melissa Ferguson, M.D., November 6, 2001.] [http://www.parkdietzassociates.com/files/Report_of_Dr._Park_Dietz_re._Andrea_Yates__2002.pdf ''Forensic Psychiatric Evaluation by Dr. Park Dietz''], parkdietzassociates.com, February 25, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Malley highlighted Rusty's continuing sense of unreality regarding having more children: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the trial, he'd successfully maintained the position that Yates would be found innocent. He had fantasies of having more children with her after she was successfully treated in a mental health facility and released on the proper medication. He worked his way through various fixes for their damaged lives, such as a surrogate motherhood and adoption (horrifying her family, attorneys and Houston psychiatrists) before giving in to reality.&lt;ref name="omalley"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Medical community===
Rusty contended that as a psychiatrist, Dr. Saeed was responsible for recognizing and properly treating Yates's psychosis, not a medically untrained person like himself.&lt;ref&gt;''"My God, we went – I couldn't see this. We went to a doctor two days before this happened. I mean, we went – the children passed away on June 20. We went to a doctor on June 18. He's a trained professional who is supposed to be able to recognize these kinds of things. I'm not. I'm just a guy. So ..."''&lt;br&gt; [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/18/lkl.00.html Transcript of Larry King interview with Rusty Yates (aired March 18, 2002)], cnn.com; accessed January 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yates claimed that, despite his urging to check her medical records for prior treatment, Dr. Saeed had refused to continue her regimen of the antipsychotic [[Haldol]], the treatment that had worked for her during her first breakdown in 1999.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real question to me is: How could she have been so ill and the medical community not diagnose her, not treat her, and obviously not protect our family from her ... Rusty testified that he never knew that she had visions and voices; he said he never knew she had considered killing the children. Neither did Dr. Saeed, even though the delusions could have been found in medical records from 1999 ... he reluctantly prescribed Haldol, the same drug that worked in a drug cocktail for her in 1999. But after a few weeks, he took her off the drug, citing his concerns about side effects ... though her condition seemed to be worsening two days before the drownings, when Rusty drove her to Dr. Saeed's office, he testified, the doctor refused to try Haldol longer or return her to the hospital.&lt;ref name="roche"&gt;Roche, Timothy.[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,218445-1,00.html "Andrea Yates, More to the Story"], ''Time Magazine'' (pp. 1-3), March 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

He added that his wife was too sick to be discharged from her last stay in the hospital in May 2001. He said he noticed the staff lower their heads as if in shame and embarrassment, turning away without saying a word. The hospital had no other choice due to the ten-day psychiatric hospitalization insurance constraints of their provider, [[Blue Cross Blue Shield]], subcontracted by Magellan Health Services.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="omalley"/&gt;

===Anti-depressants and homicidal ideation===
Rusty and his birth family claimed a combination of antidepressants improperly prescribed by Dr. Saeed in the days before the tragedy was responsible for Yates's violent, psychotic behavior.&lt;ref name="carolchristian"&gt;Christian, Carol. [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/drownings/1360510.html 'Harmful treatment' - Family files complaint against Andrea Yates's psychiatrist], ''Houston Chronicle'', April 11, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; "Andrea was on 450 mg of Effexor (Venlafaxine hydrochloride), among other medications, and was in his opinion, severely overmedicated. The psychiatrist said he would reduce the Effexor from 450 mg to 300 mg. He protested and quoted his own extensive research on the antidepressant. He said he read it shouldn't be reduced by more than 75 mg every three or four days, not 150 mg in one day."&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;[[Suzy Spencer|Spencer, Suzy]]. ''Breaking Point'', St. Martin's Press, c. 2002, pp. 119-20, 300.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Moira Dolan, executive director of the Medical Accountability Network, "[[homicidal ideation]]" was added to the warning label of the antidepressant drug [[Effexor]] as a rare adverse event, in 2005. Yates, she said, had been taking 450&amp;nbsp;mg, twice the recommended maximum dose, for a month before killing her children. Dolan reviewed her medical record at the request of Rusty. "Yates had been prescribed Effexor in varying doses since shortly after her first suicide attempt in 1999, said Dolan, who reviewed her medical records after her first trial at the request of Rusty. A month before the murders, her daily dose had increased to 450 milligrams, twice the recommended maximum dose, Dolan said."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Angela K. [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/4035681.html "Group warns of drug she took before deaths"], ''Houston Chronicle'', July 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grneeded"&gt;Grinczel, Steve. "They Needed Jesus", ''The Grand Rapids Press'', March 9, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Lucy Puryear, an expert witness hired by Yates's defense team, countered their contention regarding the administration of her antidepressants, saying the dosages prescribed by Dr. Saeed are not uncommon in practice and had nothing at all to do with her re-emergent psychosis. She suggested rather that her psychosis returned as a result of the Haldol having been discontinued by her doctor two weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="carolchristian"/&gt; The oral form of [[haloperidol]] (Haldol) takes 4–6 days after discontinuation to reach a terminal plasma level of under 1.5%—a medical standard for "complete" elimination of a drug from the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/s/Serenacetaboralsolninj.htm Haldol Data Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207145347/http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/s/Serenacetaboralsolninj.htm|date=February 7, 2008}}; [http://gargoyle.arcadia.edu/psychology/blustein/neuro/Lecture_Notes/Psychopharmacology_II_Lecture_Notes.pdf Half life drug standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529181600/http://gargoyle.arcadia.edu/psychology/blustein/neuro/Lecture_Notes/Psychopharmacology_II_Lecture_Notes.pdf|date=May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious influences===
Media outlets alleged that [[Michael Peter Woroniecki|Michael Woroniecki]], an itinerant preacher whom Rusty had met while attending [[Auburn University]], bears some responsibility for the deaths due to his "[[fire and brimstone]]" message and certain teachings found in his newsletter ''The Perilous Times'' that they had received on occasion and which was entered into evidence at the trial.&lt;ref name="ABC20020327"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=126222&amp;page=1|title=I Shared Jesus With Them|date=2002-03-27|work=Good Morning America|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=March 10, 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NW20020318"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Examining a spiritual leader's influence|last=Gesalman|first=Anne Belli|date=2002-03-18|work=Newsweek|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;Teachy, Lisa.

The office of Nigerian President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] released the following statement following the stampede: "President Buhari commiserates with the Nigerian Guild of Editors and the Nigerian Union of Journalists on the sad loss of Hajiya Bilkisu, an exemplary, dedicated, knowledgeable, very credible, highly-respected, outstanding editor and columnist who, even in death, will remain a glittering role model for journalists, within and outside Nigeria."&lt;ref name=dailyindependentnig /&gt;&lt;ref name=president /&gt;

Jibrin Ibrahim, director of the [[Centre for Democracy and Development]] described Yusuf as "great humanist, advocate, journalist, networker and above all a devoted Muslim, who died in the course of serving God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realnewsmagazine.net/passage/exit-of-journalism-icon-bilkisu-yusuf/|title=Exit of Journalism Icon, Bilkisu Yusuf|author=|work=Realnews Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Oby Ezekwesili, director of Bring Back Our Girls and a former minister of Education in Nigeria, said, "Bilkisu fought all her life for child education. She has been consistent on her advocacy. She never wearied until it was time to go. We celebrate the great strides of our sister. We were delighted to have her as part of our extended family."&lt;ref name=bbog&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://leadership.ng/chibokgirls/464035/bbog-group-mourns-hajiya-bilkisu-yusuf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103013014/http://www.leadership.ng/chibokgirls/464035/bbog-group-mourns-hajiya-bilkisu-yusuf# |archive-date=2015-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=realnewsmagazine /&gt;

Aliyu Muktar, a former editor at Triumph newspaper who worked with Yusuf, said, "She was for me a role model; an excellent career woman, very thorough and unassuming.

'''William Matthew "Bill" Tilghman Jr.''' (July 4, 1854 – November 1, 1924) was a career lawman and gunfighter during the Wild West days of Kansas and Oklahoma. He was city marshal in Dodge City, participated in the Kansas County Seat Wars, and moved on to Oklahoma where he participated in the [[land rush]]es, including the [[Land Run of 1893|Cherokee Strip Land Rush]]. He served as a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Oklahoma and was celebrated for capturing the outlaw [[Bill Doolin]]. Tilghman never achieved the household-word status of his close friends [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Bat Masterson]] but released his memoirs in a film that he directed and starred in as himself. He died at the age of seventy, after being shot down on the streets of Cromwell, Oklahoma. The fame that Bill Tilghman did achieve was largely due to the efforts of his second wife, who wrote his biography in 1949.

==Early years==

William Matthew Tilghman Jr. was born on July 4, 1854, in Fort Dodge, Iowa. He was the third of six children born to William Matthew Tilghman Sr. (1820–1908) and his wife Amanda Shepherd (1830–1915).&lt;ref&gt;Bill Tighman's five siblings were Richard Lloyd Tilghman (1847-1900), Mary Tilghman (1851-1900), Franklin Tilghman (1856-1929), Harriet "Hattie"Tilghman (1860-1905) and Josephine "Josie" Tilghman (1861-1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1857, the Tilghman family relocated to Kansas and settled on a farm near Atchison. At the age of seventeen, Bill Tilghman won a contract to supply buffalo meat to the men building the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. From  September 1, 1871, to April 1, 1872, Tilghman was supposed to have killed 3,300 buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Texas Tradition|last=Phares|first=Ross|publisher=[[Pelican Publishing]]|year=1954|isbn=9781455612932|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLkTdaqEmUQC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would claim this was the "all time record" in later years.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} According to Zoe Tilghman, his second wife, he killed two Cheyenne braves when they confronted him, as he feared they would torture him.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite journal|title='My husband helped tame the West'|last=Tilghman|first=Zoe|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|volume=46|issue=20|date=May 18, 1959|pages=105–112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dodge City, Kansas==

===First marriage===

According to his second wife, Tilghman first became a lawman during September 1874, when he signed on as a deputy under Sheriff Charles E. Bassett (1847–1896) of Ford County, Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;Tilghman, Zoe A. ''Marshal of the Last Frontier'' - pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his second wife's claim, there is no record of Tilghman serving as Bassett's deputy.{{OR|date=December 2015}} Sometime during the summer 1877, 23 year-old Bill Tilghman married&lt;ref group=note&gt;The exact date is unknown, since no wedding certificate has been found.&lt;/ref&gt; a 16-year-old widow named Flora (Kendall) Jefferson (1861–1900).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Flora F. Kendall was born in Doniphan, Kansas on May 26, 1861. She married John Jefferson (1851-1877) on April 5, 1877. He died shortly after the wedding from an unknown cause.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=life/&gt; The marriage was an unhappy one almost from the start, but nonetheless produced four children: Charles,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Charles Augustus Tilghman was born on November 22, 1878. He married Ione Conklin (1884-1973), with whom he had two children. He died on March 13, 1972 at the age of 93&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Dorothy "Dot" Tilghman was born on May 22, 1881. She married Daniel J. Norton, with whom she had three children. She died on October 20, 1973 at the age of 92.&lt;/ref&gt; William &lt;ref group=note&gt;William Tilghman was born on April 3, 1886 in Dodge City. He died on July 29, 1952 at the age of 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and Viona.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Viona "Vonie" Tilghman was born on December 14, 1890. She married Frederick Lee Sikes (1888-1967), with whom she had a daughter. She died on July 7, 1927 at the age of 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace Saloon===

Early in 1877 Tilghman and Henry Garris opened the Crystal Palace Saloon in Dodge City. A local paper reported during the summer that "Garris and Tilghman's Crystal Palace is receiving a new front and an awning, which will tend to create a new attraction towards the never ceasing fountains of refreshment flowing within."&lt;ref&gt;''Dodge City Times'', July 21, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; During the spring of 1878, Tilghman and his partner, Henry Garris, sold the Crystal Palace Saloon.&lt;ref&gt;''Dodge City Times'', May 11, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deputy sheriff of Ford County, Kansas===

Bill Tilghman's first documented service as a lawman began on January 1, 1878, when he became a deputy under Sheriff [[Bat Masterson]]. Within a month of his appointment, Tilghman was charged with being an accessory to an attempted train robbery.&lt;ref&gt;''Dodge City Times'', February 9, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 12, 1878, the charges against Tilghman were dropped for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Dodge City Times'', February 16, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tilghman was again suspected of a crime only two months later, on April 16, 1878, when he was arrested by his boss, Masterson, on a charge of horse theft. Once again the charges were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ford County Globe'', April 23, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; Troubles of a different sort came up on March 8, 1879, when Masterson had to sell his deputy's Dodge City house, at auction, to satisfy a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''Dodge City Times'', March 8, 1879.&lt;/ref&gt;

===City Marshal of Dodge City===

On November 6, 1883, Patrick F. Sughrue (1844–1906) was elected sheriff of Ford Conty, Kansas, and Bill Tilghman became his deputy. During this period, Tilghman also owned a Dodge City saloon called the Oasis, which he sold to his brother Frank during early April 1884. According to a local paper, "William Tilghman, Esq, proprietor of the 'Oasis,' has sold out to his brother Frank, who will refit and fix up and make everything smooth and harmonious to the visitor."&lt;ref&gt;''Dodge City Democrat'', April 5, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilghman gained his first important lawman's position on April 10, 1884, when he was appointed city marshal of Dodge City.&lt;ref&gt;''Dodge City Times'', April 17, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2, 1884, the citizens of Dodge presented Tilghman with a solid gold badge.&lt;ref&gt;''Ford County Globe'', May 6, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Tilghman's widow, in her biography of her husband, wrote that City Marshal Bill Tilghman and Assistant Marshal Ben Daniels ran "Mysterious Dave Mather" out of Dodge during late July 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Tilghman, Zoe A. ''Marshal of the Last Frontier'' pp. 163–165.&lt;/ref&gt; Mather's 1992 biographer said the story does not add up for many reasons. The most obvious is that Mather was scheduled to stand trial for murder, which raises the question why Dodge City's marshal and assistant marshal would run out an indicted man.&lt;ref&gt;DeMattos, Jack. ''Mysterious Gunfighter: The Story of Dave Mather''. College Station, TX: Creative Publishing Company, 1992 pp. 156–157. {{ISBN|0-932702-95-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 9, 1886, Tilghman resigned as city marshal of Dodge City to tend to his ranch. The great blizzard of 1886 wiped out the livestock on many ranches in the area, including a ranch that Tilghman owned.

===The killing of Ed Prather===

Tilghman still held a commission as a Ford County deputy sheriff. Law enforcement duties brought him to Farmer City, Kansas, on his thirty-fourth birthday – July 4, 1888 – when he shot and killed a man named Ed Prather. The local paper reported that Prather "made frequent threats against Wm. Tilghman, the deputy sheriff, who took all the abuse from the excited man without offering any retaliation ... in conversation with  Mr. Tilghman, he became very abusive and threatened to put an end to him right there, and suiting action to his words, he threw his hand upon his revolver; but Mr. Tilghman was too quick for him and held a revolver in his face. Mr. T. ordered him three times to take his hand off his gun, and would have disarmed him if he had been near enough; but Prather sought a better position, but Tilghman pulled the trigger and Prather was a dead man. A coroner's jury ... after a thorough examination of the circumstances, returned a verdict of justifiable killing." &lt;ref&gt;''Farmer City Western Farmer'', July 5, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

===County seat warrior===

During January 1889, Bill Tilghman was one of several Dodge City gunfighters involved in the [[Gray County War]], a [[county seat war]] fought between the rival Kansas towns of [[Ingalls, Kansas|Ingalls]] and [[Cimarron, Kansas|Cimarron]]. During a pitched battle between the two factions, one man was killed and five were wounded. Tilghman escaped with nothing more serious than a sprained ankle.&lt;ref name=oneal&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters|last=O'Neal|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill O'Neal|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=1991|isbn=9780806123356|page=325|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5KLrfdOrI78C&amp;pg=PA325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oklahoma lawman==

===Land rushes===

On April 22, 1889, the [[Land Rush of 1889|first of the celebrated Oklahoma land rushes]] took place. The city of Guthrie, which had not existed the day before, had an instant population of 15,000. One member of that population was Bill Tilghman, who built a commercial structure on his Oklahoma Avenue lot and used the rent from it to help re-establish himself as a rancher. For the remaining thirty-five years of his life, Tilghman would be an Oklahoman. Another land rush was held on September 22, 1891, and Bill Tilghman established a ranch. During this period, Oklahoma was suffering from the depredations of numerous outlaws, most notably [[Bill Doolin]] and his gang, the [[Wild Bunch]]. During May 1892, Tilghman was appointed a deputy U.S. marshal. Tilghman joined forces with fellow deputy marshals such as Heck Thomas, Chris Madsen, Frank Canton, and Bud Ledbetter to wage total war on the outlaws active in the territory.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

The [[Land Run of 1893|Cherokee Strip land rush]] happened on September 16, 1893. The new town of Perry, Oklahoma, was created, and Bill Tilghman was appointed city marshal of Perry on October 21, 1893. Heck Thomas was hired as assistant marshal. Both Tilghman and Thomas retained their commissions as deputy U.S. marshals. Once law and order was established in Perry, Tilghman went back on the trail of the Doolin gang.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; There is a famous, and totally fictional, story told about how Tilghman entered a "dugout" on January 8, 1895. Tilghman supposedly detected the tips of several rifles pointed at him, from hidden positions in the dugout. According to this story, one of the hidden outlaws attempted to shoot Tilghman in the back, but was prevented from doing so by Bill Doolin himself, who stated: "Bill Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back."&lt;ref group=note&gt;This much-repeated tale had its origin in a 1915 pamphlet, sold in conjunction with Tilghman's motion picture ''The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws''. In 1937, Chris Madsen, Tilghman's fellow marshal, commented on the yarn as follows: "I like Bill Tilghman ... but Bill, when he got into the moving picture business, had to make a record whether it was right or not ... Bill was a little inclined to be romantic."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prassel&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great American Outlaw: A Legacy of Fact and Fiction|last=Prassel|first=Frank Richard|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=1996|isbn=9780806128429|pages=187–188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9jLOv_r_asC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slow but sure, the Doolin gang was exterminated. Chris Madsen's posse killed "Tulsa Jack" Blake on April 4, 1895. George "Bitter Creek" Newcomb and Charley Pierce were killed on May 2. Then on September 6, 1895, Tilghman and two other deputy marshals tracked down William F. "Little Bill" Raidler. After being ordered to surrender, Raidler opened fire and was brought down by a blast from Tilghman's shotgun. The outlaw survived his wounds and was sentenced to ten years.

===Capture of Bill Doolin and destruction of his gang===

The high point of Tilghman's career came on January 15, 1896, when he single-handedly captured  Bill Doolin. Tilghman had trailed Doolin to the health resort of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Tilghman entered a bath house, and spotted Bill Doolin seated in the lobby. Doolin failed to recognize Tilghman, who suddenly began wrestling with the outlaw. After a brief struggle, Tilghman subdued Doolin without a shot being fired.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; Once Doolin was in custody, Tilghman wired U.S. Marshal Evett Dumas Nix at Guthrie, Oklahoma: "I have him. We will be there tomorrow. Tilghman." The following day, some 2,000 people jammed the Guthrie railroad station to see Tilghman bring in Doolin.

The remainder of the Doolin gang was soon killed or captured. A posse killed George "Red Buck" Waightman on March 4, 1896 and "Dynamite Dick" Clifton was rounded up shortly afterward. Tilghman's glory for capturing Bill Doolin quickly evaporated on July 5, when Doolin escaped from jail. Doolin was finally tracked down by Heck Thomas and his posse and was shot to death on August 24, 1896. Tilghman never received the reward money for Doolin's capture, which Oklahoma refused to pay after Doolin escaped. The last two members of the Doolin gang were accounted for when "Dynamite Dick" Clifton was killed on November 7, 1897, followed by  the death of "Little Dick" West on April 8, 1898.&lt;ref group=note&gt;West had been cornered by a posse consisting of Tilghman, Heck Thomas, Albert Thomas (Heck's son), Ben Miller, Frank Rinehart and William D. Fossett. When ordered to surrender, West fired three shots from his revolver. Both Rinehart and Fossett returned fire. A coroner's jury ruled that West came to his death "at the hands of officer Fossett while resisting arrest."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheriff of Lincoln County, Oklahoma===

During 1899, Tilghman established the Oakland Stock Farm which bred thoroughbred horses. Bill traveled to Kentucky for two of his studs. One of them was "Chant," the winner of the 1894 Kentucky Derby. Prosperous and popular, Tilghman won an easy election as sheriff of Lincoln County, Oklahoma in 1900. He was re-elected two years later. Flora Kendall Tilghman died at the age of thirty-nine on October 12, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;''Guthrie Leader'', October 13, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; Bill and Flora Tilghman had an unhappy marriage, and were living apart at the time of her death. Contrary to latter day reports, there is no evidence that they were divorced at the time of her death.

===Second marriage===

On July 15, 1903, the 49 year-old Bill Tilghman married for a second time.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; The bride, Zoe Agnes Stratton (1880–1964), was twenty-six years younger and a graduate of the University of Oklahoma. Bill and Zoe Tilghman had three sons named Tench,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Mayo Tench Tilghman was born on September 26, 1905. He married Doris Roselyn Tucker (1910-1992) on July 15, 1939. They had one daughter. He died on August 13, 1970 at the age of sixty-four.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard, &lt;ref group=note&gt;Richard Lloyd "Dick" Tilghman was born on September 20, 1907 and died at the age of twenty-two on October 28, 1929. He had attempted to hold up a dice game, and suffered a fatal wound when he was shot through the liver.&lt;/ref&gt; and Woodrow.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Woodrow Wilson "Woodie" Tilghman was born on October 23, 1912. He was a career criminal who spent most of his life behind bars. He was shot and wounded at Oklahoma City during a fight with his girlfriend. He died on March 1, 1981 at the age of sixty-eight.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politician===

The 19th Democratic Party Convention was held in St. Louis between July 6–9, 1904. [[Alton Brooks Parker]] (1852–1926) received the nomination for President. Tilghman was part of the Oklahoma delegation, and was part of a group of Democrats who journeyed to Parker's home to inform him of his nomination. While in New York, Tilghman looked up his old friend Bat Masterson, who was now a journalist working for  the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gunfighter in Gotham: Bat Masterson's New York City Years|last=DeArment|first=Robert K.|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=2013|isbn=9780806189116|page=xliii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgpNALfBSCAC&amp;pg=PR43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bat introduced Tilghman to President Theodore Roosevelt, who defeated Alton Brooks Parker in the 1904 election. Tilghman's being a Democrat probably accounted for his failure to receive the appointment from Roosevelt that he coveted above all others – United States Marshal of Oklahoma.{{OR|date=December 2015}} Roosevelt had offered the position to Bat Masterson, who turned it down. For a while Roosevelt considered Chris Madsen (who had served with the Rough Riders), but the appointment finally went to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gunfighter in Gotham: Bat Masterson's New York City Years|chapter=6: A Badge for 'Our Homicidal Friend'|last=DeArment|first=Robert K.|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=2013|isbn=9780806189116|at=first page|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgpNALfBSCAC&amp;pg=PP72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tilghman was never in the running. President Roosevelt remained fond of Tilghman, however, and invited him to be his special guest at the inauguration of William Howard Taft on March 4, 1909. With his powerful political connections, Tilghman easily won election as an Oklahoma state senator in 1910. Following his term in the senate, Tilghman became chief of police in Oklahoma City on May 8, 1911. He served two years and helped rid Oklahoma City of much of its criminal element.

===Movie star===

Instead of writing his memoirs, Tilghman recounted his Oklahoma adventures in the form of a film. On January 18, 1915, Tilghman, Evett Dumas Nix, and Chris Madsen formed the Eagle Film Company. Nix had the title of president, Tilghman was vice-president and treasurer and Chris Madsen was designated as secretary. After a screenwriter, cameraman and cast were hired, filming began on ''[[The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws]]''. The film had its premier in Chandler, Oklahoma, on May 25, 1915. Tilghman took the film on the road for several years, during which he appeared on stage and gave lectures.&lt;ref name=prassel/&gt; ''The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws'' originally ran for about 96 minutes.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Surviving posters and newspaper advertising for the film describe it as being "Complete in Six Parts" - meaning it contained six reels. With the hand-cranked cameras of the silent movie era, a reel of film usually ran for about 16 minutes, meaning that the six reels of ''Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws'' probably ran about 96 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, only thirteen minutes of the film survive.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The 35mm negative of the surviving 13 minutes has been preserved by the Library of Congress (AFI/Claire Conrad Collection), with video tinting approximating the original print colors.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilghman produced with Nix and Madsen, directed with Kent, wrote with Lute P. Stover, and starred in the film as himself.  Nix, Madsen, and Roy Daugherty also appeared as themselves.  Academic Frank Richard Prassel called the film "a major source of popular disinformation", as it features staged scenes purported by the filmmakers to be real.&lt;ref name=prassel/&gt;

===Death===

In 1924, at the age of seventy, Tilghman entered [[Cromwell, Oklahoma]], as a special investigator. He had previously clashed there with a corrupt U.S. prohibition agent, [[Wiley Lynn]], and confronted him when he heard that Lynn was drunkenly discharging his gun.&lt;ref name=oneal/&gt;  Tilghman attempted to take Lynn into custody without using his own pistol, and, with the help of a bystander, disarmed Lynn.  However, Lynn pulled a second pistol and shot Tilghman several times, killing him.  In a controversial trial, Lynn was acquitted of murder after pleading self-defense.&lt;ref name=owens&gt;{{cite book|title=Oklahoma Justice: The Oklahoma City Police, a Century of Gunfighters, Gangsters and Terrorists|last=Owens|first=Owen|publisher=[[Turner Publishing Company]]|year=1995|isbn=9781563112805|pages=89–90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPGXGXgk0P0C&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn was later shot and killed in a gunfight in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/article/3355413|title=Re-enacting showdown in Madill|last=Etter|first=Jim|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=March 22, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor [[Martin E. Trapp]] (1877–1951) directed that Tilghman's body lie in state in the rotunda of the Oklahoma capitol building and be attended by an honor guard. Tilghman's pall bearers included Governor Trapp, former Governor [[James B. A. Robertson|J.B.A Robertson]], Oklahoma Attorney General George Short, and U.S. Marshal Alva McDonald. He is the third person ever and first police officer to have received such honors. His burial was in [[Chandler, Oklahoma]]. A park in the town is named for him.&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;

==Film and television portrayals==

In 1956, actor Donald "Don" Kennedy (b. 1920) played "Deputy Bill Tillman" in an episode called "Dodge City Gets a New Marshal " on the syndicated television series ''[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0447999/?ref_=tt_cl_t5 The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]''.

On February 13, 1960, actor [[Brad Johnson (actor, born 1924)|Brad Johnson]] played Tilghman in an episode called "The Wedding Dress" on the [[Television syndication|syndicated television series]] ''[[Death Valley Days]]'' (Season 8, Episode 18).

In 1981, Tilghman was portrayed by Rod Steiger (1925–2002) in ''[[Cattle Annie and Little Britches]]'', a 97-minute film which also starred Burt Lancaster (1913–1994) as Bill Doolin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A02EFD61138F936A25756C0A967948260|title=Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981)|last=Canby|first=Vincent|authorlink=Vincent Canby|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1981|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 1999, TNT broadcast the made-for-television film ''[[You Know My Name (film)|You Know My Name]]'', which starred Sam Elliott (1944- ) as Bill Tilghman, Carolyn McCormick (1959- ) as Zoe Tilghman and Arliss Howard (1954- ) as Wiley Lynn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/article/2664686|title=Movie About Famed State Lawman Shows Contrast of Old, New West|last=Cathey|first=David|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=August 22, 1999|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a highly fictionalized account of Tilghman's final months and death.

On 5 March 1953, at 21:50 [[Eastern European Time|EET]], [[Joseph Stalin]], the second [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]], died at the [[Kuntsevo Dacha]] aged 74 after suffering a [[stroke]]. After four days of national mourning, Stalin was given a [[state funeral]] and then buried in [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] on 9 March. [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Georgy Malenkov]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]] were in charge of organizing the funeral.

After the speeches, pallbearers carried the coffin to the mausoleum. As Stalin's body was being put into the mausoleum, a military band played the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union|Soviet National Anthem]]. After the anthem played, a military parade of the [[Moscow Military District|Moscow Garrison]] was held in Stalin's honor.

'''Edward Butler''' (1862–1940) was an English inventor who produced an early three-wheeled petrol automobile called the Butler Petrol Cycle, which is accepted by many as the first British car.

Butler showed plans for his three-wheeled petrol vehicle at the [[Stanley Cycle Show]] in London in 1884, two years earlier than [[Karl Benz]], who is generally recognized as the inventor of the modern automobile. Butler's vehicle was also the first design to be shown at the 1885 Inventions Exhibition, also in London.

==Butler Petrol Cycle==
[[File:Butler's Patent Velocycle.jpg|thumb|Butler's Patent Velocycle 1887]]
Built by the [[Merryweather &amp; Sons|Merryweather Fire Engine]] company in [[Greenwich, England|Greenwich]], in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage 1886–1930'' (London: Grange-Universal, 1990), p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; the Butler Petrol Cycle (first recorded use of the term)&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.22"&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]], p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; was a three-wheeled petrol vehicle. The rear wheel was directly driven by a &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm})&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.22"/&gt; flat twin [[four-stroke]] engine (with [[magneto ignition]] replaced by coil and battery),&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.22"/&gt; equipped with [[rotary valves]] and a float-fed [[carburettor]] (five years before [[Wilhelm Maybach|Maybach]]),&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.22"/&gt; and [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackermann steering]],&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]], p.20 cap.&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were state of the art at the time. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a [[radiator]] over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a [[throttle]] valve lever. The driver was seated between the front wheels.&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.22"/&gt;

The vehicle featured in an article in the 14 February 1891 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', where it was stated that one gallon of fuel in the form of petroleum or benzolene could propel the vehicle for forty miles (5.9 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) at a speed of 3–10&amp;nbsp;mph (5–16&amp;nbsp;km/h).{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Butler improved the specifications of his vehicle over the years, but was prevented from adequately testing it due to the 1865 [[Red Flag Act]], which legislated a maximum speed for self-propelled road vehicles of 2&amp;nbsp;mph (3&amp;nbsp;km/h) in built up areas and 4&amp;nbsp;mph (6.5&amp;nbsp;km/h) in rural areas. Additionally, the vehicle had to be attended by three people, one of whom had to proceed in front of the vehicle waving a red flag.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Butler wrote in the magazine ''[[The English Mechanic]]'' in 1890, "The authorities do not countenance its use on the roads, and I have abandoned in consequence any further development of it."{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Due to general lack of interest, Butler broke up his machine for scrap in 1896, and sold the patent rights to [[Harry J. Lawson]] who continued manufacture of the engine for use in motorboats.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Instead, Butler turned to making stationary and marine engines.&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.22"/&gt; His motor tricycle was in advance of its better-known contemporaries on several points.&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.22"/&gt;

'''Elizabeth Nyaruai''' (born appr. 1917) was [[Kenya|Kenya's]] first [[female]] [[Kenya Police|police]] officer. Nyaruai lives alone in a mud hut on an 89 [[acre]] piece of land given to her in the late 1960s by President [[Jomo Kenyatta]] in the semi-arid parts of [[Nyeri|Nyeri South District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Wangui | first =Bancy | title =Kenya: Pioneer Scout And First Policewoman | date =2007-07-29| url =http://allafrica.com/stories/200707290026.html | accessdate =2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==

Nyaruai was born in 1917 and was brought up on a white settler's farm where her father worked as a herds boy.

==Scouting==

Nyaruai was one of the first Kenyan women to join the [[Scouting]] movement. After a white settler noticed her generosity, she convinced Nyaruai to become a Scout. Nyaruai was 10 years old. Nyaruai met [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]], the founder of Scouting and is expected to attend ceremonies at his graveside in 2007 commemorating [[Scouting 2007 Centenary|100 years of Scouting]].

'''Eugen Dobrogeanu''' (17 October 1913 – 18 February 1992) was a [[Romania]]n officer ([[colonel]] retd.), the first [[Bibliography|bibliographer]] of the Romanian [[criminology]] and active participant in [[Operation Autonomous]].

== School and professional career ==
After finishing elementary school in 1925, Eugen Dobrogeanu attended the high school [[Gheorghe Sincai]] in [[Bucharest]] and acquired bachelor's degree in 1932. In the same year he was admitted to the [[gendarmerie]] officer school, which he graduated from in 1935. Subsequently he acted as an instructor at the non-commissioned gendarmerie officer school in [[Focşani]], where he lectured on criminology and forensic science until 1940.

As a graduate of law high school – faculty of jurisprudence – and holder of the antedoctorate oral examination in economy policy, Eugen Dobrogeanu published numerous studies about scientific police, criminology and applied criminology. In his work "The forensic science in the Romanian bibliography" ("The modern police", Focsani 1940) he emphasised, among other things, the merits of professors Drs. [[Nicolae Minovici]] and [[Mina Minovici]], whose activity, within the scope of the forensic medicine research in Bucharest, put the basis of the Romanian forensic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Lazǎr Cârjan ''"Eugen Dobrogeanu – primul bibliograf al criminalisticii române"'' (in "Analele Universitaţii Spiru Haret – Seria Stiinţe Juridice – Anul 8, 2010, Vol. I Editura Fundaţiei România de mâine, pp. 11-29)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1941 Eugen Dobrogeanu was transferred to the supervisory office of the gendarmerie in Bucharest where he was appointed chief of the department for the pursuit of the [[Legionary Movement]]. In this function he conducted centralisation and systematisation of everyday information bulletins.

== Participation in Operation Autonomous ==
Between 1943–1944 major Eugen Dobrogeanu was directly involved in the [[Operation Autonomous]] by order of general [[Constantin Tobescu]], as a member of the military guard in charge with the custody of three English officers: [[Alfred Gardyne de Chastelain]], [[Ivor Porter]] and [[Silviu Meţianu]], parachutists taken and held captive in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Porter ''"Operation Autonomous: with [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] in Wartime Romania"'', Chatto and Windus 1989, pp. 120, 122, 140, 184, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of all dangers Eugen Dobrogeanu maintained amicable relations with the prisoners while he helped them and delivered to them information about everyday events. Finally, he helped the English officers even in the procurement of the information which was to help them escape. Unfortunately, the plan could not be brought to execution as Eugen Dobrogeanu was suddenly transferred to the East front to Odessa.&lt;ref&gt;Cristian Troncotă ''"Eugen Cristescu – asul serviciilor secrete româneşti"'' Editura Roza Vânturilor, 1994 – p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Direcţia Generală a Arhivelor Statului, Centrul de Studii şi cercetări de istorie şi teorie militară. ''"23 August 1944 – Documente, Raport de lt. colonel De Chastelaine adresat Foreign Office-ului, privind evenimentele din perioada şederii sale în România, December 1943 – 23 August 1944"'' Editura Stiinţifică şi Enciclopedică Bucureşti, 1984 – p. 804&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postwar and later years ==
Between April, 1946 and March, 1948 Eugen Dobrogeanu worked as assistant chief commander of the gendarmerie officer school where he lectured on forensic science as well as methods of scientific police and fight against criminal economic activities. Afterwards he was recalled in the security of the capital city where he performed extensive work, not only by disclosure of the legionary organizations but also in the fight against the criminal economic activities.

From September, 1948 to January, 1949 – after the dissolution of the gendarmerie – Eugen Dobrogeanu acted as a member of the Organizing committee of the Romanian [[militia]]. Then he was appointed as manager to the department of public security and maintenance of order, as well as head of the committee's office, and advanced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

On 31 March 1951 Eugen Dobrogeanu was arrested under the accusation of "crime and intensive activity against the working class and revolutionary movement".  After nearly 5 years of investigation he was acquitted according to the court decision No. 114/1956, found not guilty and declared innocent, under abolition of all imposed punishments and actions.

Released from prison in 1956, Eugen Dobrogeanu worked first as a helper in a service transport company, then as an economist with the international trading agency "Romtrans" in Bucharest, from which post he went into retirement.

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] lieutenant-colonel Eugen Dobrogeanu was rehabilitated and was promoted to the rank of colonel retd. He died on 18 January 1992.

'''Gertruda Sekaninová-Čakrtová''', born '''Stiassny''' (May 21, 1908 - December 29, 1986) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] and [[Czechoslovak]] lawyer, politician and diplomat of Jewish origin, later also a [[dissident]] and signatory of the [[Charter 77]]. She is most renowned for being one of the four deputies of the [[:cs:Národní shromáždění Československé socialistické republiky|National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] who voted against the agreement on the temporary stay of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia in the fall of 1968, following the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

== Early years, before World War II ==
She was born in 1908 in [[Budapest]] (then [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), as Gertruda Stiassny, to a wealthy [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name="novinky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/290631-syn-politicky-sekaninove-cakrtove-ma-narok-na-jeji-majetek-rozhodl-soud.html|title=Syn političky Sekaninové-Čakrtové má nárok na její majetek, rozhodl soud|date=18 January 2013|publisher=[[novinky.cz]] (originally [[ČTK]])|language=Czech|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://is.muni.cz/th/125620/ff_m/Podnikatelske_rodiny_v_NB_1850-1950.pdf|title=Podnikatelské rodiny v Německém Brodě 1850-1950|last=Kamp|first=Michal|year=2009|publisher=[[Masaryk University in Brno]]|pages=79|language=Czech|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the eldest of four children.&lt;ref name="novinky2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/zena/styl/302041-gertruda-sekaninova-cakrtova-zena-ktera-vzdorovala-osudu.html|title=Gertruda Sekaninová-Čakrtová: žena, která vzdorovala osudu|last=Šiška|first=Miroslav |date=20 May 2013|publisher=novinky.cz (originally Právo)|language=Czech|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Richard and Alžběta Stiassny, moved to [[Hungary]] from [[Bohemia]] to manage family textile manufacture. Her father died when she was 12 years old.&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; One of her brothers was Josef "Pepek" Stiassny (Joseph "Joe" Stiassny) (1916-1944), who later became known as a guardian and tutor of boys in the [[Theresienstadt Ghetto]], where he contributed to the magazine [[Vedem]]. In 1910, the family moved back to [[Havlíčkův Brod|Havlíčkův (then German) Brod]], where Gertrude studied and graduated from [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (1922–27).&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; She continued her studies at the Law Faculty of [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]]. During her studies she began collaborating with [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] students and worked in various left-wing organizations&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; (Society for the Economic and Social Rapprochement with the USSR, [[Kostufra]], Syndicate of Working Women Intelligence etc.). In 1932, she joined the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. In the same year she graduated and began working as a clerk in the law office of Dr. Ivan Sekanina, whom she married in 1935.&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; In 1938, she passed the [[bar exam]] and began practicing law. As an advocate, she took part in the international processes with representatives of the left-wing.

Ivan Sekanina was known, among other things, as an advocate of [[Ernst Torgler]] and [[Georgi Dimitrov]], accused of [[Reichstag fire|igniting the German Reichstag]], which earned him the hatred of [[Nazis]].&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; On 16 March 1939, the day after Germans started the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupation of Czechoslovakia]], Ivan Sekanina was arrested. He was executed in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] on 21 May 1940, on the day of 32nd birthday of his wife.&lt;ref name="novinky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt;

== World War II ==
After the arrest of her husband, she continued to practice law. She was forced to quit in 1940, due to the enhanced application of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. Then she worked as a nurse in children's shelters. In October 1942, she was transported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto. She worked as a governess of teenaged [[Geltungsjude]] girls.&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/cz/cz014.htm |title=Nové přírůstky do oddělení holocaustu |year=2001 |publisher=[[Jewish Museum in Prague]], Zpravodaj 2001/4 |language=Czech |accessdate=21 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923003813/http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/cz/cz014.htm |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, she was deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where she was selected for [[forced labor]] in Kurzbach (a branch of the [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]]).&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; On 21 January 1945, the camp was evacuated due to the approaching [[Red Army]]. She left the camp in a [[death march]] heading toward the concentration camp at [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. She managed to escape, along with several other prisoners. She was liberated by the [[U.S. Army]] in [[Regis-Breitingen]] after several months of hiding as forced laborer in [[Saxony]]. Most of her extended family perished during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="novinky"/&gt;

== Activities in post-war Czechoslovakia ==
After the war, she worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as a permanent delegate of Czechoslovakia to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; The 8th Congress of the Communist Party selected her as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (ÚV KSČ). She worked in the Central Committee until 1949. After returning from the USA in 1949, she became the First Deputy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Vladimír Clementis]].&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; She married a second time in 1948, this time to Kazimír Čakrt, who worked at the Ministry of Finance. They had one son, Michal Čakrt (born in 1948).&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt;

Sekaninová-Čakrtová escaped the party purges, although according to historians she exactly fell into the category of hidden [[Class enemy|class enemies]], classified by the Soviet advisors (she was Jewish, of bourgeois origin, well educated and had close personal connections to persons prosecuted in political processes).&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; It is possible that friendship with many officials of the regime whom she had known from the pre-war period helped her. In 2013, it became known that at that time she had to give up the property inherited from her parents, under the threat of persecutions.&lt;ref name="novinky"/&gt; In 1957, she and her husband were investigated for alleged espionage and financial fraud committed by a cousin of her husband, Jan Čakrt. These fabricated charges resulted in suicide of her husband. According to another version, Kazimír Čakrt was arrested at the request of the Finance Minister [[:cs:Július Ďuriš|Július Ďuriš]], who believed that Čakrt helped Austrian delegation during the negotiations about financial and legal settlement between Czechoslovakia and Austria after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kzhp.cz/soubory/polensko/2002-2.pdf|title=Sebevražda dr.

As a former concentration camp inmate, she testified in the 1963 process with a co-author of the Nuremberg Laws, [[Hans Globke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1964ns/stenprot/002schuz/s002010.htm|title=Poslanecká sněmovna Parlamentu České republiky, Čtvrtek 24. září 1964|publisher=[[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic]]|language=Czech|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[:cs:Volby do Národního shromáždění 1964|elections held in 1964]], she returned to politics as a member of the National Assembly. She supported the [[Draft Bill|draft bill]] excluding [[statute of limitations]] for war crimes committed during the World War II. During the [[Prague Spring]], she supported the abolition of censorship.

From 1968 to 1969, she served as Vice-President of the Czechoslovak Union of Women.

In April 1968, she was awarded the Order of the Republic.&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt;

== After 1968 ==
During 1968, Sekaninová-Čakrtová gradually started to grow disillusioned with the communist ideology and politics. After the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968, she voted as one of the four members of the National Assembly against the agreement on the temporary stay of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/ostruvek-v-mori-komunismu-d0j-/kultura.aspx?c=A080125_091058_ln_kultura_nev|title=Ostrůvek v moři komunismu|last=Horák|first=Ondřej|date=25 January 2008|work=[[Lidové noviny]]|publisher=lidovky.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested their complete withdrawal from Czechoslovak territory (the other deputies were [[František Kriegel]], František Vodsloň and Božena Fuková&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vzpominani-na-frantiska-kriegela-dq2-/domaci.aspx?c=A130825_120431_domaci_cen|title=František Kriegel se nepodvolil.

Because of these attitudes, she was, along with other rebelling members of the National Assembly, deprived of their mandate and expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="novinky"/&gt;

She spent the rest of her life working in [[dissent]]. She signed Charter 77,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libpro.cts.cuni.cz/charta/sekaninova_cakrtova_getruda.htm |title=Signature of Gertruda Sekaninová-Čakrtová under Charter 77 |publisher=Libri Prohibiti (Charles University) |language=Czech |accessdate=21 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928183000/http://libpro.cts.cuni.cz/charta/sekaninova_cakrtova_getruda.htm |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was involved in the [[Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted]]&lt;ref name="novinky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt; and supported the persecuted musicians from the band [[The Plastic People of the Universe]]. For her attitude she was harassed by [[StB|State Security]] (StB). She was labelled by the State Security as ''"... a person with hostility directed against the Soviet Union ... she does not accept the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and with her conduct she attempts to undermine the positive results of internal and foreign policy of Czechoslovakia."''&lt;ref&gt;Archiv bezpečnostních složek, Složka SEO KS SNB Praha číslo 21045 (in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sekaninová-Čakrtová spent her later years in [[Polná]] near [[Jihlava]]. She died in 1986 in Jihlava, due to injury. Shortly before her death, the StB noted: ''"Her attitudes towards real socialism remain hostile ...".''&lt;ref name="novinky2"/&gt;

'''Heber Chase Kimball''' (June 14, 1801 &amp;ndash; June 22, 1868)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LZJ8-CWG/heber-c.-kimball-1801-1868|title=Heber C. Kimball (1801-1868) {{!}} FamilySearch|website=ancestors.familysearch.org|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a leader in the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. He served as one of the original twelve [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] in the early [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of the Latter Day Saints]], and as first counselor to [[Brigham Young]] in the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) for more than two decades, from 1847 until his death.

Agreeing to take on [[plural marriage]], then part of church doctrine, Kimball eventually married forty-three women, but some relationships were for caretaking. He had a total of sixty-six children by seventeen of his wives.

==Early life==
Heber Chase Kimball was born in [[Sheldon, Vermont|Sheldon]], [[Franklin County, Vermont]] in 1801. He was a descendant of the Kimball immigrants to Massachusetts from England in 1634. He was named after a judge Heber Chase, who had helped the family in their efforts to settle in the area. Due to the embargo on trade with Britain preceding the [[War of 1812]], his father lost his investments and the family moved into western New York. They settled in [[West Bloomfield, New York]], [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]], around 1811.

===Education and training===
Kimball left school at age 14, trained as a blacksmith and potter, and moved with his brother about 1820 to [[Mendon, New York|Mendon]], [[Monroe County, New York]]. There he married his first wife, Vilate Murray, in 1822.

After purchasing his brother's [[pottery]] business, for the next 10 years, he carried out his trades. He acquired five and a half acres (22,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of land, built a house and a barn, and planted an orchard.

===Masonry===
{{see also|Mormonism and Freemasonry}}
In 1823, Kimball received the three craft degrees of [[Freemason]]ry in the lodge at [[Victor Flats, New York|Victor Flats]], [[Ontario County, New York]]. In 1824, he sent a petition to the chapter at [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]], to receive the [[York Rite]] degrees of Royal Arch Masonry. His petition was accepted, although, as he reported, [[Anti-Masons]] had burned down the chapter building in Canandaigua. Many years later, Kimball reminisced of his New York masonic experiences and stated: "I wish that all men were masons and would live up to their profession, then the world would be in a much better state than it is now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitney|first=Orson F.|title=Life of Heber C. Kimball: Apostle, Father and Founder of the British Mission|year=1888|publisher=Kimball Family|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|page=27|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jdkRAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] established itself in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], Kimball was one of the original petitioners to establish a Freemasonry lodge there. He served as Nauvoo Lodge U.D.'s first Junior Deacon. He remained active in Freemasonry throughout his stay in Nauvoo, but was not active once he moved to [[Utah Territory]]. There was no lodge in Utah in his lifetime that would admit Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;The first time Mormons were admitted to the Freemasons in Utah was 1984. State lodges excluded even those persons who had previously been admitted to other lodges prior to the [[Mormon Exodus]] to the west. &lt;br/&gt;See: {{citation |url= http://www.fairlds.org/fair-conferences/2005-fair-conference/2005-the-message-and-the-messenger-latter-day-saints-and-freemasonry |title= The Message and the Messenger: Latter-day Saints and Freemasonry |first= Greg |last= Kearney |year= 2005 |work= 2005 FAIR Conference |publisher= [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] }};&lt;br/&gt; {{citation |url= http://www.wasatchlodge.org/publish/lodge-history/ |title= The Lodge: Brief History of Wasatch Lodge |work= WasatchLodge.org |publisher= Wasatch Lodge #1 Free &amp; Accepted Masons }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early family life===
Several of Kimball's close family members died of [[tuberculosis]] within a few years: his mother in February 1824, his father in the spring of 1826, followed by his brother Charles C. and his brother's wife shortly thereafter.

His son [[William Henry Kimball|William Henry]] was born in Mendon, April 10, 1826; he was Kimball's first child to survive infancy. His daughter [[Helen Mar Kimball|Helen Mar]] was born August 22, 1828. She was the only daughter to survive.

===Signs in the heavens===
Kimball claims to have witnessed a miraculous event on September 22, 1827. According to his autobiography, he subsequently learned that it "took place the same evening that [[Joseph Smith]] received the records of the Book of Mormon from the [[Angel Moroni]]." He had seen "a white smoke" arising on the horizon, growing "clear and transparent of a bluish cast" to reveal an army on the move "in platoons":

&lt;blockquote&gt;We could see distinctly the muskets, bayonets, and knapsacks of the men, who wore caps and feathers like those used by the American soldiers in the last war with Britain; also their officers with their swords and equipage, and heard the clashing and jingling of their instruments of war and could discover the form and features of the men. The most profound order existed throughout the entire army, when the foremost man stepped, every man stepped at the same time: I could hear the step. When the front rank reached the Western horizon a battle ensued, as we could distinctly hear the report of the arms and the rush. No man could judge of my feelings when I beheld that army of men, as plainly as I ever saw armies of men in the flesh it seemed as though every hair of my head was alive. This scenery was gazed upon for hours, until it began to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Latter-day Saints Millennial Star|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xy8EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA472|year=1864|page=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Joining the Latter Day Saint movement==
While in New York, Kimball joined the local [[Baptist Church]] and was eventually baptized. Three weeks later, three elders from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], the original name of the [[Latter Day Saint]] church founded by [[Joseph Smith]], visited the house of his friend, [[Phinehas Young]]. Kimball visited the house at this time and was impressed with church teachings. He also witnessed the speaking of tongues and the interpretation of tongues during this visit. He claims to have been visited by the power of God.

During this time, Kimball said that he and several of the Young family saw a vision opened of the "gathering of the Saints to Zion." He was inspired to travel to Pennsylvania where he could visit at length with the elders, and was accompanied by some of the Youngs. They stayed six days with the elders and witnessed more miracles, such as [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]] and the interpretation of tongues.

On April 16, 1832 Kimball was baptized by Alpheus Gifford.&lt;ref&gt;Orson F. Whitney, ''The Life of Heber C. Kimball'' (Salt Lake City, Bookcraft, 1945) p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;  After the confirmation, the elder offered to ordain Kimball to the priesthood, but Kimball refused it as he felt he was unready. Thirty more people were baptized in Mendon and formed a branch of the church there.

About this time, people began calling Kimball "crazy," although he claims he was "clothed in the right mind." He claims the scriptures unfolded for him. Local clergy and members of other faiths soon became antagonistic towards the small Latter-day Saint branch and its members. Kimball had several people make executions on his property to recall considerable debts, which he was nevertheless able to pay off in full.&lt;!--What does this mean - "executions on his property"? sounds like a dated term  --&gt;

==Church service==
Shortly after his baptism, Kimball was ordained an elder by [[Joseph Young]]. He began proselyting in the neighboring areas with Joseph and [[Brigham Young]]. This part of New York became known as the "burnt over district" because of the numerous religious sects that sprang up during the 19th century. The Youngs baptized many people and built up branches of the church. Kimball said that one day Ezra Landon baptized some 20 people but wanted him to confirm them. He did so, and immediately they began speaking in tongues and interpreting them.

In 1833, Kimball relocated his family to church headquarters in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. He marched with [[Zion's Camp]] in 1834. From 1832 until 1840, Kimball served eight missions for the Church, requiring him to be apart from his family for months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley B. Kimball, "Heber C. Kimball" in Arnold K. Garr, Donald Q. Cannon and Rochard O. Cowan, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of LDS Church History'', p. 607&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quorum of the Twelve==
On February 14, 1835, Kimball was ordained a member of [[The Quorum of Twelve Apostles]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of the Latter Day Saints]] (renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&lt;!-- Do not change this name to "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints". In the original text of the revelation, as referenced in this article, Smith wrote the name of the church "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" --&gt;&lt;ref name = 1838name1&gt;''Manuscript History of the Church'', LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in Dean C. Jessee (comp.) (1989). ''The Papers of Joseph Smith: Autobiographical and Historical Writings'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) '''1''':302–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 1838name2&gt;H. Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). ''Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1838). He was one of the original twelve members of the Quorum, being 4th in seniority.

[[Joseph Smith]] called Kimball to lead a group of missionaries to England in 1837. The mission began work in [[Preston, Lancashire]], England.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial baptisms in Preston, the missionaries expanded their efforts to the Ribble Valley. By the time Kimball departed for the United States in 1838, about 1,500 people had been baptized.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Whitaker and James R. Moss, "Missions of the Twelve to the British Isles", in [[Daniel H. Ludlow]], ed. ''Selections from the Encyclopedia of Mormonism:  Church History'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1995) p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimball returned with a small party to make travel arrangements for the groups and discovered the Latter Day Saints were undergoing considerable strife and pressure in the state of [[Missouri]].

While Smith was imprisoned in the [[Liberty Jail]], Brigham Young (now ranking leader of the Quorum) and Kimball organized the removal of approximately 12,000 Latter Day Saint refugees across the border into [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Kimball, "Heber C. Kimball" in Daniel H. Ludlow, ed., ''Selections from the Encyclopedia of Mormonism: Church History'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; There the church founded the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and built [[Nauvoo Temple|a temple]].

In September 1839, Kimball left Nauvoo for another mission to England.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Kimball'' p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; He did not reach Indiana until October.  He made stops at Kirtland to encourage the remaining Saints there to move to Nauvoo and other places and had a long layover in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 271-275&lt;/ref&gt;  He sailed from New York on December 19, reaching Liverpool on April 6.  Kimball spent 1840 and some of 1841 in England, initially in the area in and around Preston, and later working as a missionary in London.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  The missionaries began organizing groups of British converts to travel to the United States, beginning in 1840, and to join the main body of the church.

After [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith was killed]] in 1844, succession to the leadership of the church was a divisive issue. Young led the majority of church members across the state line into Iowa and eventually to the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Kimball stood next in leadership in the Quorum to Young.

==First Presidency==
Kimball became a member of the new [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] in 1847. Kimball led one of three large companies to the Salt Lake Valley in the summer of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, "Kimball", ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

He established his families in [[Utah Territory]] (he had three wives) and supported them by farming, ranching, milling at the [[Heber C. Kimball Gristmill]] and freighting, in addition to church responsibilities.

While in the First Presidency, Kimball received special assignments to supervise the ongoing British Mission and to conduct temple ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, "Kimball", ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  He also worked to encourage economic independence for Utah.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Kimball, ''Kimball'', ''Encyclopedia of LDS Church History'', p. 607&lt;/ref&gt;  He had one slave, [[Green Flake]], who was given to the church for [[Tithing (Latter Day Saints)|tithing]], whom he used as his personal driver.&lt;ref name=new_wilderness&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_6783958|title=Utah settlers' black slaves caught in 'new wilderness'|author=Kristen Rogers-Iversen|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|title=Slavery in Utah Territory: 1847-1865|author=Don B. Williams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbnQ6doL2U8C|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government service==
When the provisional government of the [[State of Deseret]] was organized in spring 1849, Kimball was appointed the chief justice and lieutenant governor of the proposed state.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimball served in the [[Utah Territorial Legislature]] in the upper house (the Territorial Council) from 1851 until 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.utah.gov/research/guides/legislative-assembly-rosters.pdf ''Territory of Utah: Legislative Rosters'' compiled by the Utah State Archives Staff, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was president of the Council during the session beginning in March 1851, but later served as a regular member of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:HeberCKimballGraveSouth.jpg|right|thumb|Grave marker of Heber C. Kimball.]]
One night at family prayers, Kimball said that "the [[angel Moroni]] had visited him the night before and informed him that his work on this earth was finished, and he would soon be taken."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news| last=Pettit |first=Tom |title = Moroni Appeared to 17 Different People! | work = Living Heritage Tours | url = http://www.livingheritagetours.com/moroni-appeared-to-17-different-people/ | accessdate = 2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimball died the following day on June 22, 1868, at age 67, in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah Territory, from the effects of a carriage accident. He was buried in the [[Kimball-Whitney Cemetery]] (40.772949, -111.889755), located on the south slope of what's now known as [[Capitol Hill (Salt Lake City)|Capitol Hill]], an area then called "Heber's Bench" after him.

==Family==
Kimball received private instruction from Joseph Smith on [[plural marriage]] (polygamy). Initially reluctant{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, Kimball accepted the responsibility and married a second wife, Sarah Noon. His first wife, Vilate Murray Kimball, accepted plural marriage and welcomed the additional wives as sisters. Heber and Vilate agreed and gave their 14-year-old daughter Helen Marr as a plural wife of Joseph Smith. Kimball considered the marrying of multiple wives an expression of his faith in and obedience to God: "I have noticed that a man who has but one wife, and is inclined to that doctrine, soon begins to wither and dry up, while a man who goes into plurality [of wives] looks fresh, young, and sprightly. Why is this? Because God loves that man, and because he honors His work and word."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' vol. 5, p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wives and children===
[[File:117 MSS P 24 B2 F1.jpg|thumb|Heber C. Kimball around 1862]]

Kimball eventually married a total of forty-three women, although it is stated that many of these marriages were merely caretaking arrangements lacking physical intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, "Kimball", ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; Kimball had sixty-six children by seventeen of his wives.

'''Ian Mantle''' (1920-2010) was a motor vehicle engineer and motor trade entrepreneur who became an important post war influence in the development of touring caravans. He was also a notable rally driver of the Berkeley Sports Car made by [[Berkeley Cars]], whose fibre glass frame prospered in races during the 1950s. During the 1960s Mantle  specialised in caravan rallying winning the [[Ken Wharton]] Memorial Five Nations championship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Times, 31 August, obituary of Ian Mantle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and War Service==

Ian Mantle was born in [[Biggleswade]] in 1920 the son of a local businessman who had started a motor vehicle company.He was educated at [[Bedford Modern School]] before joining the automobile engineering firm [[Caffyns]] in Brighton, East Sussex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Mantle served with the [[Royal Air Force]] employed as an engineer tasked with solving logistical problems of keeping vehicles and armaments serviceable during the difficult campaigns of Italy and North Africa. On demobilization in 1945, he took over the family business in Biggleswade.

== Entrepreneurial and sporting career ==

Mantle spent the remainder of the 1940s and the 1950s establishing the Mantle Group to include dealerships for cars, caravans and mobile home parks in the [[Home Counties]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A man prepared to innovate he worked with Sam Alper to improve and develop touring caravans making them more stable and easier to control through chassis, suspension and wheel design

In partnership with [[Sprite Caravans]] he established a world towing endurance record at [[Monza]] in Italy. This involved a [[Ford Zodiac]] towing a Sprite caravan around the aerodrome at Monza for 24 hours at an average speed of 70&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of Records,&lt;/ref&gt; Mantle enjoyed rallying caravans and was good enough to win the Caravan Road Rally four times during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
In the Mid 50’s Mantle was part of a team of engineers led by [[Lawrence "Lawrie" Bond|Lawrie Bond]] of [[Bond Cars]] notoriety who developed the Berkeley, a small sporting vehicle powered by an [[air-cooled]] motorcycle engine. [[Berkeley Cars]] were manufactured at the Berkeley Coachworks owned by Charles Panter in Biggleswade. The fibreglass structure proved an advantage and for some years the Berkeley won some important races including one at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] in September 1956 where it was driven by [[Stirling Moss]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Mantle was behind the wheel in the Netherlands Tulip Rally when the Berkeley engine failed whilst he was in the lead. Mantle’s association with Berkeley lasted until the firm was liquidated in 1960.

Mantle was a good enough rally driver to win a number of important races including the British Rallycross Driving Association Flather Star Autotest Championship in 1956. [[Autotesting]] involves a series of tests, generally around [[traffic cones]], to measure precision driving skills and Mantle excelled captaining the England team in the [[Ken Wharton]] Memorial Five Nations championship on BBC [[Grandstand]] during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Mantle retired in 1990 and was succeeded by his son John Mantle as managing director of the Mantle Group. Mantle served as a magistrate in Biggleswade and from 1986 to 1991 he was chairman of the organising committee of the Caravan and Camping Exhibition at [[Earls Court]].

'''Isabel Marion Seymour''' (born 1882) was a UK suffragette who was employed by the [[Women's Social and Political Union]]. She undertook speaking tours in Europe. She later became a [[Councillor]].

==Life==
Seymour was born in 1882 in Middlesex. Her parents were Philip and Mary Seymour&lt;ref name="Cowman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krista Cowman|title=Women of the right spirit: paid organisers of the women's social and political union (WSPU) 1904-18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VEvAAAAYAAJ|date=15 July 2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-7002-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she became a fluent speaker in both English and German. She was introduced to the Women's Social and Political Union by her friends [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Frederick]] and [[Emmeline Pethick Lawrence]]. She was employed by the WSPU and was involved in administering the accommodation and bail that was required by WSPU members.&lt;ref name=ii/&gt; She was a confident speaker in English and German and she went on a speaking tour in Germany and Russia on behalf of the WSPU. In 1909, she was honoured with an invitation to [[Eagle House (suffragette's rest)|Eagle House]] in Somerset.&lt;ref name=ii/&gt; This was the home of Colonel Linley and [[Emily Blathwayt]]. They supported their daughter [[Mary Blathwayt]] and the other WSPU members by providing accommodation for recovering suffragette's. In addition Emily had constructed an arboretum of trees where each new tree was planted by a suffragette. The Blathwayts would also create a plaque and photographs would be taken to record the planting. Seymour planted a holly bush on 24 October 1909.&lt;ref name="Hammond2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cynthia Imogen Hammond|title="Architects, Angels, Activists and the City of Bath, 1765?965 ": Engaging with Women's Spatial Interventions in Buildings and Landscape|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FikxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT262|date=5 July 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-57612-3|pages=262–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James McKeen Cattell''' (May 25, 1860 – January 20, 1944), [[United States|American]] [[psychology|psychologist]], was the first professor of psychology in the United States, teaching at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and long-time editor and publisher of scientific journals and publications, most notably the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as [[Society for Science &amp; the Public]] (or SSP), from 1921–1944.

At the beginning of his career, many scientists regarded psychology at best a minor field of study, or at worst a [[pseudoscience]] such as [[phrenology]].  Perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, Cattell helped establish psychology as a legitimate science, worthy of study at the highest levels of the academy.  At the time of his death, ''The New York Times'' hailed him as "the dean of American science."  Yet Cattell may be best remembered for his uncompromising opposition to American involvement in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="baron2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/history/cattelltext.htm|title=History: Cattell at Penn|author=Jonathan Baron|year=2006|accessdate=2014-09-24}} Baron cites C. S. Gruber (1972), "Academic freedom at Columbia University: The case of James McKeen Cattell", ''AAUP Bulletin'', Autumn, pp. 297-305, with respect to Cattell's views on the war and place in the debate on academic freedom.&lt;/ref&gt;  His public opposition to the draft led to his dismissal from his position at [[Columbia University]], a move that later led many American universities to establish [[tenure]] as a means of protecting unpopular beliefs.&lt;ref name="baron2006"/&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] in 1860, Cattell grew up the eldest child of a wealthy and prominent family.  His father, William Cassady Cattell, a [[Presbyterian]] minister, became president of [[Lafayette College]] in Easton shortly after James' birth.  William Cattell could easily provide for his children, as he had married Elizabeth "Lizzie" McKeen in 1859; together they shared Lizzie's substantial inheritance.  To this picture of the family's success one could add political power as well, as James' uncle [[Alexander Gilmore Cattell]] represented [[New Jersey]] in the [[United States Senate]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Cattell entered [[Lafayette College]] in 1876 at the age of sixteen, and graduated in four years with the highest honors.  In 1883 the faculty at Lafayette awarded him an M.A., again with highest honors.  Despite his later renown as a scientist, he spent most of his time devouring [[English literature]], although he showed a remarkable gift for [[mathematics]] as well. Cattell said [[Francis Andrew March]], a [[philologist]], was a great influence during his time at Lafayette.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Cattell, James McKeen|year=1973|volume=Supplement Three (1941-1945)|author=Dorothy Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell did not find his calling until after he arrived in [[Germany]] for graduate studies, where he met [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at the [[University of Leipzig]].  He also studied under [[Hermann Lotze]] at the [[University of Göttingen]], and an essay on Lotze won him a fellowship at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he left Germany to study in October 1882.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; The fellowship was not renewed,&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; and he returned to [[Leipzig]] the next year as Wundt's assistant.

The partnership between Wundt and Cattell proved highly productive, as the two helped to establish the formal study of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].  Under Wundt, Cattell became the first American to publish a dissertation in the field of psychology. The title of his German dissertation was ''Psychometrische Untersuchungen'' (''Psychometric Investigation''). The dissertation was accepted by the University of Leipzig in 1886.  More controversially, Cattell tried to explore the interiors of his own mind through the consumption of the then-legal drug [[hashish]].  Under the influence of this drug, Cattell once compared the whistling of a schoolboy to a [[symphony orchestra]].  While [[recreational drug use]] was not uncommon among early psychologists, including [[Freud]], Cattell's experimentation with hashish reflected a willingness to go against conventional opinion and morality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The main street in the College Hill Neighborhood of Easton, Pennsylvania, home to Lafayette College, is named after Cattell.

==Academic career==
After completing his Ph.D. with Wundt in Germany in 1886, Cattell took up a lecturing post at the [[University of Cambridge]] in England, and became a 'Fellow Commoner' of St John's College, Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CTL886JM|name=Cattell, James McKeen}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made occasional visits to America where he gave lectures at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 1889 he returned to the United States to take up the post of Professor of Psychology in Pennsylvania, and in 1891 moved to [[Columbia University]] where he became Department Head of Psychology, [[Anthropology]], and [[Philosophy]]; He became President of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1895.

From the beginning of his career, Cattell worked hard to establish psychology as a field as worthy of study as any of the "hard" physical sciences, such as chemistry or physics.  Indeed, he believed that further investigation would reveal that the intellect itself could be parsed into standard units of measurements. He also brought the methods of Wilhelm Wundt and [[Francis Galton]] back to the United States, establishing the mental testing efforts in the U.S.

In 1917, Cattell and English professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Dana (grandson of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[Richard Henry Dana Jr.]]) were fired from Columbia University for opposing the United States’ conscription policy during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Current Literature|Current Opinion]]'', November 1917, p.294&lt;/ref&gt; Years later he sued the university and won an annuity. In 1921, he used the money that he had gained from the settlement in order to start [[Harcourt Assessment|The Psychological Corporation]] to foster his interest in the field of applied psychology. Because he was never able to really explain how psychologists can apply their work, the organization failed until taken over by other psychologists who had experience in applied psychology. Towards the end of his life, Cattell still edited and published his journals. To help himself in the process, he created the Science Press Printing Company in order to produce his journals. He continued his work on the journals until his death in 1944 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

==Eugenicist beliefs==

Like many eminent scientists and scholars of the time, Cattell's thought was influenced by belief in [[eugenics]], defined as the "applied science or the bio-social movement which advocates the use of practices aimed at improving the genetic composition of a population, usually referring to human populations."&lt;ref&gt;"Eugenics", Unified Medical Language System (Psychological Index Terms), National Library of Medicine, 26 Sep. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell's belief in eugenics was heavily influenced by the research of [[Charles Darwin]], whose [[theory of evolution]] motivated Cattell’s emphasis on studying “the psychology of [[individual differences]]”.&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benjamin |first=L.T., Jr. |authorlink=Ludy T. Benjamin|year=1993 |title=A history of psychology in letters |location=Dubuque, IA |publisher=Wm. C. Brown |oclc=26931839 |isbn= 978-0697129802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with his eugencist beliefs, Cattell's own research found that men of science were likely to have fathers who were clergymen or professors. Incidentally, Cattell's father was both.&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sokal | first1 = M. M. | year = 1980 | title = Science and James McKeen Cattell, 1894 to 1945 | url = | journal = Science | volume = 209 | issue = 4452| pages = 43–52 | doi=10.1126/science.7025202 | pmid=7025202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell believed that he had “inherited ability", but he also credited the influence of his environment, saying "it was my fortune to find a birthplace in the sun. A [[germplasm]] fairly well compounded [good genes] met circumstances to which it was unusually fit to react”.&lt;ref name="Sokal"/&gt; Cattell’s belief in eugenics even motivated him to offer his own children monetary gifts of $1,000 if they married the offspring of a university professor or academic professional.&lt;ref name="Thorne"&gt;Thorne, B. M., Henley, T. (2001). ''Connections in the history and systems of psychology''.  Boston: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental tests==
Cattell’s research on individual differences played a significant role in introducing and emphasizing the experimental technique and importance of methodology in experimentation in America.&lt;ref name="Pillsbury"&gt;Pillsbury, W.B. (1947). ''Biographical Memoir of James McKeen Cattell 1860-1944. National Academy of the Sciences''. http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/cattell-james-m.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the beginnings of his mental tests, in Leipzig, Cattell independently began to measure “simple [[mental processes]]”&lt;ref name="Thorne"/&gt; Between 1883 and 1886, Cattell published nine articles discussing human [[reaction time]] rates and [[individual differences]].&lt;ref name="Thorne"/&gt; As professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Cattell administered a battery of ten tests to student volunteers, and for the first time introduced the term “mental tests” as a general term for his set of tests which included measures of sensation, using weights to determine just-noticeable differences, reaction time, [[human memory]] span, and rate of movement.&lt;ref name="Thorne"/&gt; When Cattell moved to Columbia University, the battery of tests became compulsory for all freshmen. Cattell believed that his mental tests were measuring intelligence; however, in 1901 [[Clark Wissler]], a student of Cattell, demonstrated that there was no [[Correlation|statistical relationship]] between scores on Cattell's tests and academic performance. The tests were finally rendered irrelevant with the development of [[Alfred Binet]]’s [[intelligence measurement]]s.&lt;ref name="Thorne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Applied History"&gt;Applied History of Psychology/Models of Testing. Wikibooks. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Applied_History_of_Psychology/Models_of_Assessment&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==

Cattell was well known for his involvement in creating and editing scientific journals. He was so involved in owning and publishing journals, that his research productivity declined. He founded the journal ''[[Psychological Review]]'' in 1894 along with [[James Mark Baldwin]].  He also acquired the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and, within five years, made it the official publication of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], 1895-1900.  In 1900, he purchased ''Popular Science Monthly'' from [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]].  In 1915, the title was purchased from him and became ''[[Popular Science]]''. He, in turn, founded and edited ''[[The Scientific Monthly]]'', which went to the subscribers of the old ''Popular Science Monthly'' as a substitute.&lt;ref name="Pillsbury"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "PSM Sep 1915"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cattell | first = James McKeen | title = The Scientific Monthly and the Popular Science Monthly | journal = Popular Science Monthly | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–310 |date = September 1915| url = https://books.google.com/?id=QqUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell was the editor of ''Science'' for nearly 50 years. During that time, he did much to promote psychology as a science by seeing to it that empirical studies in psychology were prominently featured in the journal.&lt;ref name="Thorne"/&gt; Regarding his impact on the development of psychology as a science, [[Ludy T. Benjamin]] wrote of Cattell's editorship “there is no denying that it significantly enhanced psychology’s visibility and status among the older sciences.”&lt;ref name="Benjamin"/&gt;{{rp|56}}

==Skepticism==

Cattell was skeptical of [[paranormal]] claims and [[spiritualism]]. He had dismissed the medium [[Leonora Piper]] as a fraud. He was involved in a debate over Piper with the psychologist [[William James]] in the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' journal.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, J. M. (1898). ''Mrs. Piper, the medium''. ''Science'' 7: 534-535.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1898). ''Mrs. Piper, "the medium".'' ''Science'' 7: 640-641.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, J. M. (1898). ''Mrs. Piper, "the medium"''. ''Science'' 7: 641-642.&lt;/ref&gt; He took issue with James's support for [[Parapsychology|psychical research]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, Gregory A; Wertheimer, Michael; White, Charlotte. (2013). ''Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology''. Psychology Press. p. 23. {{ISBN|0-8058-0620-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to James he wrote that the "[[Society for Psychical Research]] is doing much to injure psychology".&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, C. James. (2015). ''A History of Modern Psychology''. Wiley. p. 154. {{ISBN|978-1-118-83375-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He married Josephine Owen, the daughter of an English merchant, in 1888. Their seven children got their pre-college educations at home with their parents as instructors.  The whole family shared in Cattell's editorial work.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; One daughter, [[Psyche Cattell]] (b. 1893) followed in her father's footsteps, established a small child psychology practice in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and developed tests to assess the intelligence of infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cattell|first1=Psyche|title=The Measurement of Intelligence of Infants and Young Children|date=1940|publisher=The Psychological Corporation|location=New York, New York|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joey DiPaolo''' (born September 5, 1979) is an American [[AIDS]] activist who is [[HIV positive]].

DiPaolo contracted [[HIV]] during a [[heart]] [[surgery]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=James |first1=George |title=A Question of Blood and AIDS;Infected Youth Sues Doctor Over '84 Transfusion |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/02/nyregion/a-question-of-blood-and-aids-infected-youth-sues-doctor-over-84-transfusion.html |accessdate=30 September 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=December 2, 1995 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930021910/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/02/nyregion/a-question-of-blood-and-aids-infected-youth-sues-doctor-over-84-transfusion.html |archivedate=30 September 2018 |location=New York, New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; He required a [[blood transfusion]], and the blood given to him came from an HIV-infected donor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alterio |first1=Julie Moran |title=Bronxville woman's camp to aid Staten Island kids |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24149103/joey_dipaolo/ |work=The Journal News |date=November 14, 2012 |location=New York, White Plains |page=A 5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 29, 2018 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiPaolo had been diagnosed with [[Atrial septal defect|ASD]], a type of heart disease, and surgery was needed to save his life.

From 1985 to 1988, DiPaolo went through several episodes of sickness; although none of them were related to his heart. DiPaolo spent many days and nights suffering from different kinds of symptoms during that period.

In 1988, DiPaolo was diagnosed with HIV. At the time, doctors gave him only one year to live. Doctors told the DiPaolo family that it would be best for them to hide his condition.

DiPaolo, nevertheless, became a very active boy in school with the help of medicines, and he made friendships. He experienced a health improvement in 1989, and seemed to live the normal life that other children led.

In 1990, DiPaolo once again faced death: He became so ill early during that year that, at one point, doctors gave him only two days to live. He recovered, and later on, he was able to attend an AIDS funds gala, where he met [[NFL]] football player [[Lawrence Taylor]]. Taylor [[autograph]]ed a ball for DiPaolo, and the two had a photo taken together. DiPaolo had decided to uncover his secret about being HIV positive.

DiPaolo could not possibly imagine what kinds of problems the photo would bring him when it was published by a [[List of newspapers|newspaper]] the next day: He was met with disdain by many of his schoolmates and their parents. Parents protested because they did not want DiPaolo to attend school with their children, and family friends turned their backs on the DiPaolo family, on the belief that by befriending the DiPaolo's, they had put their own lives at risk. Eventually, many of those that initially abandoned the family returned to be friends with the DiPaolos.

DiPaolo faced crowds of protesters in front of his school for a period after he voluntarily took the step of disclosing his disease. A long, legal battle ensued between the DiPaolo family and parents of children of the school that DiPaolo went to. The parents were afraid that their kids could catch AIDS by being in contact with Joey, and they wanted Joey out of the school. At one point, Joey's father planned to move to [[New Jersey]], where, he figured, Joey would be accepted to a new school.

Eventually, a New York court decided that DiPaolo would stay in the educational center he attended.

The DiPaolo case made headlines internationally, and it was covered by different types of media. In 1992, [[HBO]] aired the ''[[Lifestories: Families in Crisis]]'' special "Blood Brothers: The Joey DiPaolo Story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lifestories 03: Bloodbrothers–The Joey Dipaolo Story |url=https://www.films.com/id/116296 |website=FilmsMediaGroup |accessdate=30 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930021600/https://www.films.com/id/116296 |archivedate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, DiPaolo won a lawsuit against the center from which the [[blood]] with which he was contaminated came. 

DiPaolo is an AIDS activist who meets and talks with many other AIDS patients yearly. In 2000 he founded Camp TLC (Together Living a Challenge) for youngsters who cannot attend regular summer camps because of AIDS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

DiPaolo resides in Staten Island, with his wife Lauren and daughter Joey Jayde, and operates DiPaolo's Barber Shop in Tottenville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Feeney |first1=Sheila Anne |title=AIDS advocate and survivor Joey DiPaolo is a life lesson in positive living |url=https://www.amny.com/news/joey-dipaolo-aids-advocate-survivor-to-marry-lauren-pisani-ex-jets-cheerleader-1.10688835 |accessdate=30 September 2018 |work=amNewYork |date=July 29, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930020603/https://www.amny.com/news/joey-dipaolo-aids-advocate-survivor-to-marry-lauren-pisani-ex-jets-cheerleader-1.10688835 |archivedate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Händlern]], [[Bavaria]], Kollmer was a farmer by trade. He became a member of the SS on January 1, 1935 after having previously spent several years in the German police force. He joined the [[Nazi party]] in May 1937. In October 1941 he was drafted into the [[Waffen-SS]] and was assigned to Auschwitz, where he commanded various guard companies until October 1943. He then temporarily transferred to [[Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp]], but returned to Auschwitz in May 1944. Initially he commanded the guard company at Auschwitz main camp, then later the one at [[Monowitz concentration camp]] from August to October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=1_xmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=josef+kollmer+auschwitz&amp;dq=josef+kollmer+auschwitz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ6YSy3OPZAhVmrVQKHQCkA4UQ6AEITjAH|title=Commander's and Headquarter's Orders in the Concentration Camp Auschwitz 1940--1945|last=Frei|first=Norbert|date=2000|publisher=K.

Kollmer was tried by the [[Supreme National Tribunal]] at the Auschwitz Trial in [[Kraków]] and was sentenced to [[Capital punishment|death]]. His sentence was carried out by [[hanging]] in [[Montelupich Prison]], Kraków.

The '''Karenni Army''' ({{lang-my|ကရင်နီ တပ်မတော်}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''KA''', '''KnA''' or '''KiA''') is the armed wing of the [[Karenni National Progressive Party]] (KNPP), and operates in eastern [[Kayah State]] (also known as Karenni State), [[Myanmar]] (Burma).&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Soldiers in Non-State Armed Groups |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/burma1007/7.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janes"&gt;[http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Insurgency-and-Terrorism/Karenni-Army-KA-Myanmar.html Karenni Army (KA) (Myanmar), GROUPS - ASIA - ACTIVE]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2012, the government of Myanmar signed a ceasefire agreement with the KNPP, in the presence of international observers from the [[UN High Commission for Refugees]], [[British Council]] and the [[Embassy of the United States, Rangoon|American embassy]].&lt;ref name="uca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/08032012-burma-government-rebels-sign-ceasefire/|title=Burma: Government, Rebels Sign Ceasefire|date=8 March 2012|work=UCA News|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar ceasefire deal was signed in 1995, but it was dissolved within three months.&lt;ref name="uca"/&gt;

==History==
The British government recognised and guaranteed the independence of the [[Karenni States]] in a treaty with the Burmese King [[Mindon Min]] in 1875, by which both parties recognised the area as belonging to neither to the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] ([[Kingdom of Burma]]) nor to the [[British Empire]]. Consequently, the Karenni States were never fully incorporated into British Burma. The Karenni States were recognised as tributary to British Burma in 1892, when their rulers agreed to accept a stipend from the British government.&lt;ref name="Karenni"&gt;[http://www.karenni.org Karenni Independence Through Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution of the [[Union of Burma]] in 1947 proclaimed that the three Karenni States be united into a single constituent state of the union, called Karenni State. It also gave the possibility of secession from the union after 10 years if the state's leaders were not satisfied with the central government. In August 1948, the Karenni leader U Bee Htu Re was assassinated by a pro-central government militia for his opposition to the inclusion of the Karenni States in the Union of Burma.&lt;ref name="Karenni" /&gt;

Since 1957,&lt;ref name="MMPeace" /&gt; the Karenni Army has been fighting government forces in an attempt to create an independent Karenni state, apart from a brief ceasefire in 1995.&lt;ref name="Janes" /&gt; The KNPP have also fought left-wing groups such as the [[Kayan New Land Party]] (KNLP), and the [[Karenni National People's Liberation Front]] (KNPLF), both of which are now allied with the [[Tatmadaw]] (Myanmar Armed Forces). The group has been accused of using [[child soldiers]], a claim that they have not denied, saying that the children had volunteered willingly, because their parents had been killed during fighting between the KA and government soldiers.&lt;ref name="hrw" /&gt;

He is best known for his angry demeanour and belligerent comedic style, in which he often simulates having a mental breakdown. His comedy routines often escalate into angry rants about history, politics, religion, or any other cultural trends. He hosted the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Lewis Black's Root of All Evil]]'' and makes regular appearances on ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Trevor Noah]]'' delivering his "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Back in Black with Lewis Black|Back in Black]]" commentary segment, which he has been doing since ''The Daily Show'' was hosted by [[Craig Kilborn]].

When not on the road performing, Black resides in [[Manhattan]], but also maintains a residence in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]]. He is also a spokesman for the [[Aruba]] Tourism Authority, appearing in television ads that first aired in late 2009 and 2010, as well as the voice of Anger in 2015's [[Pixar]] film, ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''. He was voted 51st of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time by [[Comedy Central]] in 2004; he was voted 5th in [[Comedy Central]]'s Stand Up Showdown in 2008 and 11th in 2010. Black has served as an "ambassador for voting rights" for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], since 2013.&lt;ref name="aclu_ambassador"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/organization-news-and-highlights/aclu-names-celebrity-ambassadors-key-civil-liberties-issues|title=ACLU Names Celebrity Ambassadors for Key Civil Liberties Issues|date=October 29, 2013|accessdate=December 25, 2014|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Black was born in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= About Lewis: Who is Lewis Black? |work= Lewis Black Official Website |accessdate= March 4, 2015 |url= https://www.lewisblack.com/about-lewis }}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Jeannette, a teacher, and Sam Black, an artist and mechanical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/11/Lewis-Black.html |title=Lewis Black Biography (1948–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a middle-class Jewish family in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]],&lt;ref name="Black1"&gt;{{cite news |last =|first =|title =Lewis Black Is One Angry Comic|pages=|publisher =|date =2006-11-05 |url =http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/05/sunday/main2153629.shtml|accessdate =2006-12-13 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating from [[Springbrook High School]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= On Stage: A Comic Comes Home |work= The Washington Post |date= May 19, 2007 |page= C12 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/410189285/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black recounts in his book ''Nothing's Sacred'' that he scored highly on the math section of his SAT exam and later applied to [[Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Amherst College|Amherst]], [[Williams College|Williams]], and [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]]. Every college he applied to except Georgetown rejected him, and by that point he had decided he did not want to go there, so he spent a year at [[University of Maryland]] before transferring to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. There, he studied playwriting and was a brother of [[Pi Lambda Phi]] International [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and a member of Student Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arts – Back in Black|first=Nick |last=Parker |date=February 7, 2002 |newspaper=[[Daily Tar Heel]]|location=University of North Carolina |url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/02/07/3c6289dbc0b6c?in_archive=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220174555/http://www.dailytarheel.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/02/07/3c6289dbc0b6c?in_archive=1 |archivedate=2003-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1970, he returned to Washington, where he worked at the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]], wrote plays, and performed stand-up comedy at the [[Brickskeller]] in [[Dupont Circle]].&lt;ref name= rage/&gt;

He earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degree at the [[Yale School of Drama]] in 1977, and was married for ten months when he was 26 years old.&lt;ref name= rage/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nothing's Sacred"&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Lewis|title=Nothing's Sacred|year=2005|publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment|isbn=0-689-87647-5|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's career began in theater as a playwright. He served as the playwright-in-residence and associate artistic director of Steve Olsen's [[West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in New York City, where he collaborated with composer and lyricist [[Rusty Magee]] and artistic director Rand Foerster on hundreds of one-act plays from 1981 to 1989. Also with Rusty Magee, Black wrote the musical ''The Czar of Rock and Roll'', which premiered at Houston's [[Alley Theatre]] in 1990. Black's stand-up comedy began as an opening act for the plays; he was also the [[Master of Ceremonies|master of ceremonies]]. After a management change at the theater, Black left and began working as a comedian, as well as finding bit parts in television and films.

==Comedic style==
Black's style of comedy is that of a man who, in dealing with the absurdities of life and contemporary politics, is approaching his personal limits of sanity.  His techniques include [[sarcasm]], [[hyperbole]], [[profanity]], [[shouting]] and his trademark angry finger-shaking, which bring emphasis to his topics of discussion. He once described his humor as "being on the ''Titanic'' every single day and being the only person who knows what is going to happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Lewis Black Is Not An Asshole |first= Johnny |last= Firecloud |date= August 22, 2008 |work= Antiquiet |url= http://www.antiquiet.com/interviews/2008/08/lewis-black-is-not-an-asshole/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black has described his political affiliation as:
"I'm a [[Socialism|socialist]], so that puts me totally outside any concept...the Canadians get it. But seriously, most people don't get it. The idea of [[Taxation in the United States|capping people's income]] just scares people. 'Oh, you're taking money from [[Upper class|the rich]].' Ooh, what a horrifying thing. These people really need $200 million".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gotorenotahoe.com/news/stories/html/2006/06/29/2432.php |title=Lewis Black’s back to comment on what ails society |date= May 18, 2006 |work=(GotoRenoTahoe) |publisher=''[[Reno Gazette-Journal]]'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706162616/http://www.gotorenotahoe.com/news/stories/html/2006/06/29/2432.php|archivedate=2006-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black lists his comedic influences as [[George Carlin]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Bill Hicks]], [[Bob Newhart]] and [[Shelley Berman]].&lt;ref name="Gillette1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin.avclub.com/content/node/49217 |title=Interview: Lewis Black |publisher=''[[The Onion]]'' |work=[[The A.V.

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
In 1998, Black starred in his first comedy special on the series ''[[Comedy Central Presents]].'' He starred in two additional episodes of the series in 2000 and 2002. He starred in another special for the network in 2002, titled ''Taxed Beyond Belief''.

From 2003 to 2005, Black hosted the "World Stupidity Awards" ceremony at Montreal's [[Just for Laughs]] comedy festival.

In 2004, he had an [[HBO]] stand-up special titled ''[[Black on Broadway]].'' Black hosted [[Comedy Central]]'s ''Last Laugh '07'', which aired on December 2, 2007 along with [[Dave Attell]] and [[D.L. Hughley]].

In 2006, Black performed at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theatre]] in Washington, D.C. for an [[HBO]] special, ''Red, White, and Screwed''. It aired in June and a DVD was released in October. When explaining his choice of venue, Black said that "some asshole" was paid to count the number of times the word "fuck" was said in his previous HBO special, ''Black On Broadway'', and that the original location, the [[Kennedy Center]], wanted him to cut back on its use. Black was told the number was 42, when actually it was approximately 78.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Black received a 2007 Grammy award for "Best Comedy Album" for his album ''[[The Carnegie Hall Performance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/49th_show/list.aspx#20 |title=Grammy Awards |publisher=Grammy.com |date=September 30, 2006 |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061220160454/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |archivedate=December 20, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black hosted the [[Comedy Central]] television series ''[[The Root of All Evil (TV show)|The Root of All Evil]]'' in 2008. The show pitted two people or pop-culture topics against each other as a panel of comedians argued, in the style of a court trial, which is more evil, e.g., "[[Paris Hilton]] vs. [[Dick Cheney]]" and "Internet Porn vs. YouTube". After hearing arguments from both sides, Black, acting as judge, made the final decision as to which is more evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/825/825095p1.html "Comedy Central Gets Angry With Lewis Black"]. IGN.com. October 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Black hosted ''[[History of the Joke]] with Lewis Black'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;content_type_id=57883&amp;display_order=3&amp;mini_id=57887 |title=About 'History of the Joke'|publisher= [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225042037/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;content_type_id=57883&amp;display_order=3&amp;mini_id=57887 |archivedate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2-hour comedy-documentary on The History Channel.

[[Comedy Central]]'s "Stand-Up Month" in 2008 featured specials originally presented on [[HBO]] by Black, along with programs featuring [[Dane Cook]] and [[Chris Rock]].  That year, as part of [[Comedy Central]]'s "Stand-Up Month", Black's routine finished at #5 on "Stand-Up Showdown 2008", a viewer-based countdown of the top Comedy Central Presents routine.

In 2009, Black filmed two shows at the Fillmore Theater in Detroit, Michigan. These were the basis for the concert film ''Stark Raving Black'', which appeared in theaters for a limited time in October, and was released on video the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewisblack.com/news.aspx |title=News |publisher=Lewisblack.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031162146/http://lewisblack.com/news.aspx |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2009, Black returned to the History Channel to host ''Surviving the Holidays with Lewis Black'', in which he discussed the year-end pressures of Thanksgiving, Channukah, Christmas, and New Year's.

In 2011, Black filmed two shows at the [[State Theatre (Minneapolis)|State Theatre]] in Minneapolis, MN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.citypages.com/dressingroom/2011/05/lewis_black_at_state_theatre.php  "Lewis Black rants about Michele Bachmann, Farmville, Twitter"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507074108/http://blogs.citypages.com/dressingroom/2011/05/lewis_black_at_state_theatre.php |date=2011-05-07 }}. Citypages.com. May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The shows were used for Black's comedy special "In God We Rust". The special premiered on [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/02/28/epix-seeing-black-in-2012-lewis-blacks-in-god-we-rust-premieres-march-17-86503/20120228epix01/ |title= Breaking News |date= February 28, 2012 |work= The Futon Critic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extended and uncensored version of the special broadcast on Epix HD was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2012/082012-lewis-black-in-god-we-rust-ntp-cd-dvd.jhtml|title=IN BLACK WE TRUST! LEWIS BLACK RETURNS TO COMEDY CENTRAL...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Black recorded his ninth stand-up special ''Old Yeller: Live at the [[Borgata]]''. ''Deadline'' reported that Black and the company that was releasing the stand-up special, ''[[Image Entertainment]],'' would later air it in the form of [[pay-per-view]] and [[video on demand|VOD]], making it the first comedy special to air simultaneously on all cable, satellite and telco platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/lewis-black-old-yeller-standup-special-august-24/|title=Distributors Play Nice For Lewis Black Stand-Up Special|date=July 30, 2013|last=Team|first=Deadline|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and television career===
Black appeared in episode 25 "Aria" (1991) of ''Law and Order'' as porn director Franklin Frome, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' episode "Obscene" (2004) as a [[shock jock]],  and in ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' episode "[[The Jiminy Conjecture]]" (2009) as Professor Crawley, an [[entomology|entomologist]]. He also released his autobiography, ''[[Nothing's Sacred (book)|Nothing's Sacred]]'', in 2005. Since November 9, 2005, Black has been making appearances in small segments on ''[[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]].'' In December 2005, he appeared in an animated holiday special ''[[The Happy Elf]]'', as the voice of the extremely tightly wound elf, Norbert.

In the film ''[[Accepted]]'', a film about high school graduates who create a college when they fail to get accepted into any, he played Dean Ben Lewis of the school "South Harmon Institute of Technology". He also appeared in the 2006 films ''[[Man of the Year (2006 film)|Man of the Year]]'' and ''[[Unaccompanied Minors]]''. Black hosted [[Comedy Central]]'s ''Last Laugh '06'', which aired on December 10, 2006.

===Voice acting===
Black was the voice of "Manobrain" during the third season of the Cartoon Network series "[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]". He was the inventor of a diet pill which was stolen while he was in college. He blamed the theft on his college friend Dr. I. Q. Hi, not realizing that the actual thief was Duck Dodgers. The theft set Manobrain on the path of evil.

Black provided the voice of the Deadly Duplicator in four episodes of the [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]'' and in the [[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law (video game)|video game based on the show]].

Black provided the voice of [[oxpecker]] Ted in the ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'' episode, "Hornbill and Ted's Bogus Journey". The character is portrayed in the same fashion as his comedy shows, though without profanity. In addition, the bird's clothes, looks, and mannerisms match those of himself. He also voiced Mr. E/Ricky Owens in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' and in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' a middle-aged man named Vic who is kidnapped by the Krang and mutated into a spider-like monster called "Spider-Bytez" by Michelangelo. He also voiced Anger in the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''. He also guest starred as the voice of [[Santa Claus]] in the [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] episode, "Goons on the Moon."

===Tours===
On June 18, 2007, he sat in with [[Southern rock]]/[[Jam band]] [[Gov't Mule]] at the 6th annual [[Bonnaroo]] music festival, where he had performed earlier that weekend, for what was to be a quick joke. A member of the audience threw a bottle at Black, which [[bottling (concert abuse)|struck him]]. Black was upset and he encouraged the audience to boo the heckler before leaving the stage in disgust, while shouting obscenities at the heckler. This act was seen in an episode of ''[[Lewis Black's Root of All Evil]]'' titled "YouTube vs. [[Pornography|Porn]]".

On June 29, 2007, Black gave a benefit show at [[Springbrook High School]], his alma mater, in the school's auditorium for 1,100 alumni, faculty, and students. He performed in his usual style, stopping at points to remark how good it felt to use that language on that particular stage. At the end of the show he was given a Springbrook football jersey, and cursed at one teacher for giving him a B and causing him not to graduate first in his class.

In mid-December 2007, Black went with [[Robin Williams]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Lance Armstrong]] and [[Rachel Smith]], Miss USA 2007, on a [[USO]] trip to support the troops in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]. The last show was on 22 December at the U.S Naval Station in Rota, Spain.

Black helped create the annual Carolina Comedy Festival at his alma mater, the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In 2008, Black went on tour to promote his book ''Me of Little Faith''.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhart, John Mark (May 29, 2008).

==The Naked Teen Voyeur Bus==
[[File:Black, Lewis (USGov).jpg|thumb|Lewis Black at "Stand Up for Heroes"]]
In 2000, Black and fellow comedian [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]] were arrested for their involvement with "The Naked Teen Voyeur Bus",&lt;ref&gt;Trunk, Russell A. [http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=587 "Lewis Black: The Carnegie Hall Performance"] ([[Anne Carlini]]) website.&lt;/ref&gt; a specially designed bus with [[acrylic glass]] walls containing numerous 18- and 19-year-old topless women. This bus was driven around [[Manhattan]] while reports about it were broadcast on the [[Opie and Anthony]] radio show. The radio station management did not inform the O&amp;A show that the bus's route was also the route that President Clinton was using that day. Twenty-eight hours after their arrest, Black and Norton were released. Black appeared on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' the following night where he stated he was exercising his constitutional rights. He then joked that the location of this particular right was unclear, but that it was "between 'all men are created equal' and 'don't shit where you eat.'{{-"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ajvhzw/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-back-in-black---jail-time|title=Back in Black – Jail Time |format=video |date=December 6, 2000| publisher=The Daily Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Astell''' (Newcastle upon Tyne, 12 November 1666 – London, 11 May 1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]]. Her advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]] has earned her the title "the first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie, "[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=168 Mary Astell]". ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. 21 March 2002. Accessed 6 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Few records of Mary Astell's life have survived. As biographer Ruth Perry explains: "as a woman she had little or no business in the world of commerce, politics, or law. She was born, she died; she owned a small house for some years; she kept a bank account; she helped to open a charity school in Chelsea: these facts the public listings can supply."&lt;ref&gt;Perry, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Only four of her letters were saved and these because they had been written to important men of the period. Researching the biography, Perry uncovered more letters and manuscript fragments, but she notes that if Astell had not written to wealthy aristocrats who could afford to pass down entire estates, very little of her life would have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Astell was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] on 12 November 1666, to Peter and Mary (Errington) Astell.&lt;ref name="smith2"&gt;Smith, ''Mary Astell'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents had two other children, William, who died in infancy, and Peter, her younger brother.&lt;ref name="smith2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Eloquence'', xi.&lt;/ref&gt; She was baptized in St. John's Church in Newcastle.&lt;ref name="Marry Astell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Astell |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/astell.html |publisher=Oregon State |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221153142/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/astell.html |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family was upper-middle-class and lived in Newcastle throughout her early childhood. Her father was a conservative royalist Anglican who managed a local coal company.&lt;ref name="litencyc"/&gt; As a woman, Mary received no formal education, although she did receive an informal education from her uncle when she was eight, an ex-clergyman named Ralph Astell whose bouts with alcoholism prompted his suspension from the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Donawerth, Jane|title=Rhetorical Theory by Women before 1900: an anthology|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-7425-1717-9|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though suspended from the Church, he was affiliated with the [[Cambridge]]-based philosophical school that based its teachings around philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], and [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref name="Astell, Mary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Astell, Mary|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Mary_Astell.aspx#1|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died when she was 12 years old,&lt;ref name="litencyc"/&gt; leaving her without a dowry.  With the remainder of the family finances invested in her brother's higher education, Mary and her mother relocated to live with Mary's aunt.

== Career ==
After the death of her mother and aunt in 1688, Astell moved to [[Chelsea, London]], where she was fortunate enough to become acquainted with a circle of literary and influential women, including [[Lady Mary Chudleigh]], [[Elizabeth Thomas (poet)|Elizabeth Thomas]], [[Judith Drake]], [[Elizabeth Elstob]], and [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].&lt;ref&gt;Sowaal, Alice. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/astell/ "Mary Astell"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (2005), 16 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These women assisted in the development and publication of her work. She was also in contact with the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[William Sancroft]], who was known for his charitable works; Sancroft assisted Astell financially and, furthermore introduced her to her future publisher.

She was one of the first English women, following [[Bathsua Makin]], to advocate the idea that women were just as rational as men, and just as deserving of education. First published in 1694, her ''Serious Proposal to the Ladies for the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest'' presents a plan for an all-female college where women could pursue a life of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/womenLit/education/Astell_L.htm "Mary Astell"]. Women in the Literary Marketplace 1800–1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1700, Astell published ''Some Reflections upon Marriage''.&lt;ref&gt;Astell, Mary, 1668–1731, [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/astell/marriage/marriage.html ''Some Reflections Upon Marriage, Occasioned by the Duke and Dutchess of Mazarine's Case; Which is Also Considered''], London: Printed for John Nutt, near Stationers-Hall, 1700.&lt;/ref&gt; She wittily critiques the philosophical underpinnings of the institution of marriage in 1700's England, warning women of the dangers of a hasty or ill-considered choice. The Duchess of Mazarine is used as an example of "the dangers of an ill Education and unequal Marriage". Astell argues that education will help women to make better matrimonial choices and meet the challenges of the married state: "She has need of a strong Reason, of a truly Christian and well-temper'd Spirit, of all the Assistance the best Education can give her, and ought to have some good assurance of her own Firmness and Vertue, who ventures on such a Trial".

Astell warns that disparity in intelligence, character, and fortune may lead to misery, and recommends that marriage be based on lasting friendship rather than short-lived attraction. A woman should look for "a good Understanding, a Vertuous Mind, and in all other respects let there be as much equality as may be." Astell expanded on this theme in response to critics in the third edition of ''Some Reflections upon Marriage''.&lt;ref name="Astell, Mary"/&gt;

After withdrawing from public life in 1709, she founded a charity school for girls in Chelsea as a token of the [[Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge]], organizing the school's curriculum herself with likely financial support from her patrons [[Lady Catherine Jones]] and [[Lady Betty|Lady Elizabeth Hastings]]. When she was 60 years old, Astell was invited to live with Lady Catherine Jones, where she resided until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donawerth|first=|title=Rhetorical Theory by Women Before 1900|year=2002|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astell died in 1731, a few months after a [[mastectomy]] to remove a cancerous right breast. In her last days, she refused to see any of her acquaintances and stayed in a room with her coffin, thinking only of God; she was buried in the churchyard of Chelsea Church in London.&lt;ref name="Marry Astell"/&gt;

Astell is remembered for her ability to debate freely with both contemporary men and women, and particularly for her groundbreaking methods of negotiating the position of women in society by engaging in philosophical debate ([[René Descartes|Descartes]] was a particular influence) rather than basing her arguments in historical evidence as had previously been attempted. Descartes' theory of dualism, a separate mind and body, allowed Astell to promote the idea that women as well as men had the ability to reason, and subsequently they should not be treated so poorly: "If all Men are born Free, why are all Women born Slaves?"&lt;ref&gt;Astell, ''Reflections'', 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
[[File:AstellProposal.jpg|thumb|right|Title page from the third edition of ''A Serious Proposal'']]
All of Mary Astell's works were published anonymously. Astell's two best known books, ''A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest'' (1694) and ''A Serious Proposal, Part II'' (1697), outline her plan to establish a new type of institution for women to assist in providing women with both religious and secular education. She suggests extending women's career options beyond mother and nun. Astell wanted all women to have the same opportunity as men to spend eternity in heaven with God, and she believed that for this they needed to be educated and to understand their experiences. The 'nunnery' style education she proposed would enable women to live in a protected environment, without the influences of the external patriarchal society.

Her proposal was never adopted because critics said it seemed "too Catholic" for the English. Later her ideas about women were satirized in ''[[The Tatler]]'' by the writer [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Astell|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Mary_Astell.aspx#3|work=The Columbia Encyclopedia|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the writer [[Daniel Defoe]] admired the first part of Astell's proposal, he believed that her recommendations were "impracticable." However, Patricia Springborg notes that Defoe's own recommendation for an academy for women as detailed in his ''[[Essay Upon Projects]]'' did not significantly differ from Astell's original proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Astell|first=Mary|title=A Serious Proposal to the Ladies|editor=Patricia Springborg|year=2002|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough|isbn=978-1-55111-306-7 |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, she was still an intellectual force in London's educated classes.

A few years later, Astell published the second part of ''A Serious Proposal'', detailing her own vision of women's education for courtly ladies. She broke away from the contemporary rhetorical style of the period where orators spoke before an audience for learning, and instead offered a conversational style of teaching "neighbors" the proper way of behavior. She referred only to the [[Port-Royal Logic]] as a source of contemporary influence, though still relied upon classical rhetorical theories as she presented her own original ideas. In her presentation, she offered that rhetoric, as an art, does not require a male education to be master, and listed the means of which a woman could acquire the necessary skills from natural logic, which established Astell as a capable female rhetorician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donawerth|first=|title=Rhetorical Theory by Women Before 1900|year=2002|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1690s Astell entered into correspondence with [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] of [[Bemerton]], after reading Norris's ''Practical Discourses, upon several Divine subjects''. The letters illuminate Astell's thoughts on God and theology. Norris thought the letters worthy of publication and had them published with Astell's consent as ''Letters Concerning the Love of God'' (1695). Her name did not appear in the book, but her identity was soon discovered and her rhetorical style was much lauded by contemporaries.

'''Alexander Nero''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe. The character was created by [[Judd Winick]] and [[Darryl Banks]] in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 3) #132 (January 2001).

==Fictional character biography==
Nero was a destructive and mentally disturbed artist who was given a yellow power ring by the [[Qward]]ians, similar to [[Sinestro]]'s. During his stint in the mental asylum, he was treated for several mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[Paranoia|paranoid delusions]], and [[Bipolar disorder|bi-polar disorder]]. Nero claimed his parents were abusive, although, given his state of mind, such assessments should not be taken at face value.

Nero was the second attempt by the Qwardians to take down the new Green Lantern [[Kyle Rayner]], the first being [[Fatality (comics)|Fatality]]. In order to find someone with the same imagination and artistic skill as Rayner, the Qwardians found Nero, who had a history of drawing violent and dark pictures in his asylum. Nero was designed as the "archenemy" of Kyle Rayner, seeing how both are artists with limitless imagination. He escaped from the asylum, only to be confronted by a combination of both the original Green Lantern [[Alan Scott]] and Kyle Rayner. A battle ensued and Alan Scott was seriously wounded by Nero, forcing Kyle to retreat and call upon the assistance of the JLA. Kyle Rayner asked the JLA not only to stop Nero but to be prepared to kill him, reasoning that Nero's ring was one of the most powerful weapons in the universe and his insanity made him a profound threat. While the JLA declined his request, they were unable to stop him in several skirmishes of hit-and-run. In the end, the [[Wally West|Flash]] found tapes of his parents and Kyle played the images. Eventually, the images consumed Nero, traumatising him and resulting in his defeat.

Nero returned a short time later when the residual Central Power Battery energy made itself known (it was left in the sun following the sacrificial reignition by [[Hal Jordan]] in the crossover ''[[Final Night|The Final Night]]''). Both Kyle and Nero's power levels were greatly increased and they waged war in space to see who would lay claim to the power. Kyle was eventually able to defeat Nero and claim the power (which caused him to become Ion for the first time) and it was believed that Nero was taken or rescued by the Qwardians.

Nero was seen when the villainous [[Ultra-Humanite]] (I) imprisoned all super-powered beings of Earth and brainwashed them into becoming his private army.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
Alex Nero returned, revealed as having masqueraded as Kyle during previous issues by Hal Jordan, who confronted him for his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Ion - Guardian of the Universe'' #4 (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Nero was presumed responsible for the massacres once thought to have been committed by Kyle. After a battle with Kyle and Hal Jordan, he was rendered into a vegetative state after being overwhelmed by Ion's power. Before he became totally vegetative, he revealed that he was forced to masquerade as Ion by an unknown group. Kyle proceeded to [[Oa]] to seek answers from the [[Guardians of the Universe]], bringing Nero with him.&lt;ref&gt;''Ion - Guardian of the Universe'' #5 (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Nero awoke on Oa in the Guardians' presence, he seemed to spontaneously release a massive amount of energy, as if exploding.&lt;ref&gt;''Ion - Guardian of the Universe'' #6 (November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Held captive by the Guardians of the Universe, still broken and unstable but now conscious again, Nero revealed that he couldn't name his mysterious contractors. The Guardians confirmed that the same foe or foes that set Alex Nero (and [[Effigy (DC Comics)|Effigy]]) against Kyle had altered Alex's mind, expunging all his knowledge about the mysterious group.&lt;ref&gt;''Ion - Guardian of the Universe'' #8 (January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero was released from his sciencell along with Superboy-Prime and others during the [[Sinestro Corps]]' assault on Oa. Nero hid and eluded capture before finding and confronting Kyle and [[Sodam Yat]] near Oa in the ''Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Ion Special''. During the battle, it was revealed that the Sinestro Corps had been the ones responsible for manipulating Nero into impersonating Kyle. Working together, Kyle and Sodam Yat were able to defeat the mad artist and return him to his sciencell. Despite possessing a yellow ring, Nero is not a member of the [[Sinestro Corps]].

Following his participation in a sciencell riot, Nero was executed by the [[Green Lantern Corps#The Alpha Lanterns|Alpha Lanterns]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #38 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The pool of blood left over was later approached by a black power ring, which reconstituted Nero's entire body, turning him into a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #40 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
As with the Green Lantern power ring, Nero is able to make solid light constructs at will using his yellow power ring, except that it is powered by the yellow energy of emotional spectrum based from fear. Nero's mental disabilities and psychosis allow him to use his raw imagination, creating constructs in numbers and complexity that dwarf those of most Green Lanterns, including Kyle Rayner. Rayner implied to the JLA that since his power ring can split an atom and cause an atomic explosion, Nero's ring might be capable of performing the same feat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">'''Ngawang Wangyal''' ({{bo|t=ངག་དབང་དབང་རྒྱལ་|w=Ngag-dbang Dbang-rgyal}}) (October 15, 1901 - January 30, 1983), popularly known as "Geshe Wangyal," was a [[Buddhist]] priest and scholar of [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] origin who was born in the [[Astrakhan province]] in southeast [[Russia]] sometime in 1901.

Geshe Wangyal was the youngest of four children and had chosen at age six to enter the monastery as a novice monk. After the [[Russian Civil War]], Geshe Wangyal went to [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]], where he studied at the Gomang College of [[Drepung]] Monastic University in Lhasa until 1935 when he decided to return to his homeland to obtain financial support to complete his studies.  

Due to Communist persecution of religious clergy, Geshe Wangyal decided to end his return trip home. Instead, he found a job in [[Peking]], China, comparing different editions of the Tibetan collections of Buddha's word ([[Kanjur]]) and of the treatises of Indian commentators ([[Tanjur]]). In 1937, Geshe Wangyal left Peking to return to Tibet via [[India]] after earning enough money to support himself until he received his [[geshe]] degree from Drepung.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.shambhala.com/snowlion_articles/labsum-shedrub-ling/|title=Geshe Wangyal and Labsum Shedrub Ling|date=2017-03-06|work=Shambhala|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in [[Calcutta]], Geshe Wangyal was hired as a translator to [[Charles Alfred Bell|Sir Charles Bell]], a well-known British statesman, scholar and explorer, and accompanied him on a trip through China and [[Manchuria]] before returning to Tibet. Afterwards, he received his geshe degree in Lhasa and used his remaining earnings and many newly established contacts to raise funds for the purpose of assisting poor scholars to obtain their geshe degree, especially [[Mongolians in India]], who, like him, were cut off from support from a Communist home country.

When the Communist Chinese invaded Tibet in the early 1950s, Geshe Wangyal escaped to India. Then in 1955, he went to the United States&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to work as a priest among the [[Kalmyk American]]s who were newly resettled in [[New Jersey]], New York and [[Pennsylvania]] as refugees from Central Europe. 

In 1958, Geshe Wangyal established and built a Buddhist monastery in [[Washington, New Jersey]] called ''[[Labsum Shedrub Ling]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njskylands.com/clbuddhist.htm Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center in New Jersey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He served as the monastery's head teacher until his death in January, 1983. He taught many students of Western background and contributed greatly to the spread of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] in the United States. 

Geshe Wangyal later taught at [[Columbia University]] and during the 1960s and 1970s, he sponsored visits by several monks and [[lama]]s from the Tibetan emigre settlement in [[India]] and instructed them in English so they could serve the Buddhist community in the United States. 

In 1972, the [[American Institute of Buddhist Studies]] was founded as suggested by the Dalai Lama and Geshe Ngawang Wangyal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibs.columbia.edu/history.shtml History]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225171812/http://www.aibs.columbia.edu/history.shtml |date=February 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Wangyal translated two volumes of popular Tibetan and [[Sanskrit]] stories illustrative of [[Buddhist]] teachings, ''The Door of Liberation'' and ''The Prince Who Became a Cuckoo.'' With [[Brian Cutillo]], he also translated the "Illuminations of Sakya-Pandita" published by (LOTSAWA 1988). The book is now out-of-print. {{ISBN|0-932156-05-3}}

Among his students were [[Robert A. F.

Shubin was born in Tbilisi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsru.com/crime/19mar2008/lipetzk_maniak.html Липецкого маньяка, убившего не меньше 11 человек, отправили на лечение] // NEWSru.com, 19 марта 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Shubin was hospitalized in the [[Voronezh]] Regional Clinical Psychoneurogical Dispensary with a diagnosis of [[neurasthenia]].

Shubin was arrested in October 2006, after policemen detained him in connection with the disappearance of a local pensioner named Mescheryakov. He had disappeared after going to the park to play a game of [[chess]] with Shubin. At the interrogation, Shubin immediately confessed to the murder and showed where he buried the body. During the investigation, he began to talk about another murder committed by him. Every week, he reported on his previous killings, and showed the locations where the bodies were buried. Shubin always disoriented his victims with a strong blow to the head, then bound their hands and feet with wire, and finally strangling them a striker, which he always carried with him. He did not express any shame from his crimes and told about them proudly and very confidently.&lt;ref name="LRNews"&gt;[http://lrnews.ru/news/full/7376/ «Директора кладбища» направили на принудительное лечение] // LRNews, 18 марта 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Shubin called himself the "Cemetery Director". The motive for the murders was simple - a quarrel or a loss at a game in chess.&lt;ref name="Regnum"&gt;[http://regnum.ru/news/973527.html Липецкого маньяка, убившего 13 человек, направили на принудительное лечение] // Информационно агентство Regnum, 19 марта 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation, Shubin was examined, and was diagnozed with a continuous type of [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Because of this court, the court found him [[Insanity defense|unfit to stand trial]] and sentenced him to [[compulsory treatment]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2442">'''Oscar''' (''oscara'' = "deer friend") is a figure in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. He is the son of [[Oisín]] (the son of the epic hero [[Fionn mac Cumhail]]) and [[Niamh (mythology)|Niamh]], and the brother of [[Plor na mBan]]. Though possibly a later addition to the cycle, Oscar was a popular character, and appeared prominently in several later Fenian tales, serving his grandfather as one of the [[fianna]]. 

In Bruidhean Chaorthainn (Fairy Palace of the Quicken Trees), Oscar swept off the head of Sinsar, the King of the World, in the battle on the ford of Shannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timelessmyths.com/celtic/fianna.html|title=Fianna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His death is described in the story ''[[Cath Gabhra]]'' (''The Battle of Gabhra''), which pits the increasingly corrupt Fianna against the army of [[High King of Ireland|High King]] [[Cairbre Lifechair]]. Cairbre, aided by defected Fianna warriors loyal to [[Goll mac Morna]], receives his death blow from Oscar, but mortally wounds him with his steel chains as his final act. Oscar's death causes Fionn to weep for the only time in his life, and serves as the final blow to the fianna's strength.

==Namesake==
Oisín had a second son who was named Oscar, born between him and [[Niamh (mythology)|Niamh]] in [[Tir na nÓg]].&lt;ref name=mackillop/&gt; Together the couple had three children, the other son who was named Finn, and a daughter named [[Plor na mBan]]. The account occurs in the poem, "The Lay of Oisin on the Land of the Young", attributed to Mícheál Coimín in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Coimín |first=Mícheál Coimín |editor-last=Comyn |editor-first=David (trans.) |title=The Lay of Oisin on the Land of the Young |script-title=Laoiḋ Oisín Air Ṫír Na N-Óg |place=Dublin |publisher=A.

'''Rachel de Beer''' ({{IPA-nl|raˈχelki də ˈbiər|}}, 1831–1843) (sometimes known by the diminutive form, ''Racheltjie'') is an [[Afrikaner]] [[hero]]ine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antonites|first=Alex|date=June 2008|title=Suid-Afrika na dertien jaar (1994 -2007) |journal=Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe|volume=48|issue=2|pages=159, 164|language=Afrikaans|hdl=2263/6057}}&lt;/ref&gt; who gave her life in order to save that of her brother, Dirkie de Beer. She was the daughter of George Stephanus de Beer (b. 1794).&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated at the Fireside, Spearhead 2004, {{ISBN|0-86486-558-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
In the winter months of 1843 Rachel was part of a trek from the [[Orange Free State]] to the south-eastern [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. During one of their nightly stopovers, the members of the trek realised that a [[calf]] called Frik, much-beloved by their children, was missing.

A search party was formed, in which Rachel and her six-year-old brother also took part. However, during the gathering [[dusk]] Rachel and her brother got separated from the search party and became lost. As the night progressed it got very cold and started [[snow]]ing.

Realizing that their chances of survival were slim, Rachel found an [[anthill]] hollowed out by an [[aardvark]], took off her clothes, put them on her brother and commanded him to get into the hollowed-out anthill. She then lay in front of the opening of the anthill in order to keep out the cold.

The children were found the next morning by the trekking party. Rachel was dead, but her brother had survived.

It is possible that neither of the children existed,&lt;ref name="Nieuwoudt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nieuwoudt |first=Stephanie |title=Racheltjie: ware heldin of versinsel?|newspaper=[[Die Burger]]|date=2002-10-01|language=Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt; however. The history of the period is not well documented. To date no undisputed proof has been presented to substantiate any claims regarding Racheltjie de Beer.

Fiction or not, Rachel de Beer is entrenched in the Afrikaner culture, which is evident by the number of streets and schools named after her.

==Genealogical perspective==
In the very comprehensive genealogical work “The De Beer Family – Three centuries in South Africa”&lt;ref&gt;Page 72-77, Die De Beer-Familie – Drie Eeue in Suid-Afrika, First edition, June 2000, Dawid W. de Beer &amp; Jaleen de Beer, {{ISBN|0-620-26029-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; several pages are devoted to the Rachel de Beer story, looking at all the possibilities from the available genealogical data.

It turns out that there was a De Beer family that fits the names and ages as mentioned in the original story quite closely. However, they lived 60 years later. If the incident happened in 1903 instead of 1843, this family would fit the facts quite nicely. It would also better explain why there is no mention of this story before the early 1900s.

By the third edition of the work&lt;ref&gt;Page 80-85, Die De Beer-Familie – Drie Eeue in Suid-Afrika, Third edition (CD only), March 2005, Dawid W. de Beer &amp; Jaleen de Beer, {{ISBN|0-620-33884-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; more information has come to light to also eliminate this last possible scenario. The Rachel de Beer in this instance has been confirmed to have lived well into adulthood.

Based on this research it seems unlikely that the story of Rachel de Beer is factual.

==Historicity debate==
In October 2012, two Afrikaans journalists published their findings that the story of Racheltjie de Beer bears many similarities to that of the American heroine [[Hazel Miner]]. They wrote about it in the tabloid ''By'', a weekly supplement of the three Afrikaans newspapers ''Die Burger'', ''Beeld'', and ''Volksblad''.&lt;ref&gt;Was Racheltjie eintlik ’n Amerikaner?
http://www.dieburger.com/By/Nuus/Was-Racheltjie-eintlik-n-Amerikaner-20121006&lt;/ref&gt; The very first story about Rachel appeared in print only about a month or three after the ''North Dakota Children's Home Finder'' gave Hazel Miner's (true) story the wider publicity that it had deserved. The Afrikaans journalists also posted a more elaborate paper on their findings to the web under the title ''Die laaste rits bewyse: Racheltjie is bloot 'n afspieëling van Hazel Miner (The last series of evidences: Little Rachel is merely a mirror image of Hazel Miner)''.&lt;ref&gt;Racheltjie is bloot 'n afspieëling van Hazel Miner {{cite web |url=http://mysite.mweb.co.za/residents/dugeot/rachel_hazel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003241/http://mysite.mweb.co.za/residents/dugeot/rachel_hazel.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roanoke''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|ə|ˌ|n|oʊ|k}}), also spelled '''Roanoac''', were a Carolina [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking people whose territory comprised present-day [[Dare County]], [[Roanoke Island]] and part of the mainland at the time of English exploration and [[colonization]]. They were one of the numerous [[Carolina Algonquian]] tribes, which may have numbered [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|5,000-10,000]] people in total in eastern North Carolina at the time of English encounter.&lt;ref name="nps-enc"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fora/forteachers/indian-towns-and-buildings-of-eastern-north-carolina.htm "Indian Towns and Buildings of Eastern North Carolina"], ''Fort Raleigh National Historic Site'', National Park Service, 2008, accessed 24 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The last known [[tribal chief|chief]] of the Roanoke was [[Wanchese (chief)|Wanchese]], who traveled to England with colonists in 1584.  The smaller [[Croatan]] people may have been a branch of the Roanoke or a separate tribe allied with it.&lt;ref name="nps-enc" /&gt;  

==History==
The Roanoke may have had their capital on the western shore of [[Croatan Sound]], at ''Dasamonguepeuk''.  This was one of the significant towns noted by the English colonists in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="nps-enc" /&gt;

Numerous place names were derived from the Roanoke.

===Controversy===
In January 2015, Pure Food and Wine and One Lucky Duck staff walked out en masse due to Melngailis' failure to pay employees a month's worth of owed wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ny.eater.com/2015/1/13/7539521/pure-food-wine-is-dark-tonight-as-staff-walks-out-over-unpaid-wages|title=Union Square's Pure Food &amp; Wine Currently Closed, After Staff Walks Out En Masse|last= Ferst|first= Devra|date=13 January 2015|work=Eater}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second time in a year a month's worth of wages had been withheld from employees, the first happening in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2015/01/13/pure_food_and_wine_walkout.php|title=Pure Food And Wine Employees Walk Out Over Unpaid Wages|last=Casey|first=Nell|date=13 January 2015|work=Gothamist|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211120648/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/13/pure_food_and_wine_walkout.php|archivedate=11 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2015 Melngailis addressed the walkout and closure in a blog post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sarmaraw.oneluckyduck.com/2015/02/happened/|title=WHAT HAPPENED?|last=Melingailis|first=Sarma|date=8 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209082050/http://sarmaraw.oneluckyduck.com/2015/02/happened/|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She apologized for the incident, but the blog post was subsequently removed. In an interview with Well+Good, Melngalis said that the delayed wages were due to slim margins caused by debts and expensive ingredients, and that she had also previously missed her own rent payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wellandgood.com/2015/02/10/exclusive-sarma-melngailis-strike-at-pure-food-and-wine/|title=Exclusive: Sarma Melngailis opens up about what’s going on at Pure Food and Wine|last=Held|first=Lisa Elaine|work=Well+Good|date=February 10, 2015|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ordeal, Melingailis provided employees a different explanation, blaming the situation on changing banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Marguerite|title=What's Going On at Pure Food &amp; Wine, Where Staff Remains Unpaid and Owner Is MIA|url=http://ny.eater.com/2015/1/16/7556849/whats-going-on-at-pure-food-wine-where-staff-remains-unpaid-and-owner|publisher=Eater NY|date=Jan 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again in July 2015, the staff of Pure Food and Wine as well as One Lucky Duck walked out due to unpaid wages. The Restaurant has been permanently shut down.

'''Sonya Haddad''' (November 9, 1936 – June 15, 2004) was a [[libretto]] translator and [[surtitles|surtitler]] for the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York.

== Life and career ==
Haddad was born in [[Canton, Ohio]], on November 9, 1936, and grew up in [[Akron]]. She graduated from the [[Eastman School of Music]] at the [[University of Rochester]] in 1958. She subsequently worked in the classical music division of [[Columbia Records]], and at ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} radio station [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]]. From 1960 until the early 1970s she worked at the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]], Italy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During that time, she also lived part-time in Rome where she worked as an interpreter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She acted as courier with the kidnappers of [[John Paul Getty III]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=ON /&gt;
{{External media|image1=[https://www.operanews.com/_uploaded/image/article/obits.jpg Sonya Haddad]}}
Haddad was fluent in German, Italian and French. She began working at the Metropolitan Opera in 1994. was referred to in her obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "one of the country's leading practitioners of her art".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/23/us/sonya-haddad-67-translator-for-met-opera-s-titling-system.html|title=Sonya Haddad, 67, Translator For Met Opera's Titling System|last=Zinoman|first=Jason|authorlink=Jason Zinoman|date=June 23, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote surtitles or subtitles for the [[Washington National Opera]], [[La Scala]] in Milan, and the [[Public Broadcasting Service]]'s series ''[[Great Performances]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She joined the editorial staff of ''[[Opera News]]'' in 1998,&lt;ref name=ON&gt;[https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2004/9/Departments/Obituaries.html "Obituaries – Sonya Haddad" (with picture)] by Brian Kellow, ''[[Opera News]]'', vol. 69, no. 3, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and was a research associate for the magazine until her death in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2012/6/Departments/Viewpoint__Summer_Memories.html|title=Viewpoint: Summer Memories|work=[[Opera News]]|access-date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her death, she lived in [[The Bronx]].

[[Brian Kellow]] said of her in an obituary in ''Opera News'' that "As a titlist, her standards were high: she took pains to avoid the cute, the coy, the anachronistic; her titles were as precise and elegant and clearly thought out as her own prose."&lt;ref name="ON" /&gt; William Romano, in an article partly based around documentation supplied by Haddad, said of her work that "by extending the text's exposure in live performance by a fraction of a second, the titleist imperceptibly adjusts the viewer's engagement with the words'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romano|first=William|date=Summer 2010|title=Reading at the Opera|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/394137|journal=University of Toronto Quarterly|volume=79|pages=3|via=[[Project MUSE]]}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to argue that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Titling challenges titleists and the houses that employ them not only to translate but to make the best case for awkward and weak librettos. The brief, repetitious texts and credulity-straining plots of the bel canto repertory, with their attenuated melodic lines and spectacular runs, can pose more challenges to a titleist than do the complex texts of an opera by Strauss or Wagner. Titling, like any aspect of performance, is a dynamic technical skill, and a titleist may return to an opera in subsequent seasons, adjusting and refining both word choice and the technical aspects of delivery. However the titleist resolves these questions, the resulting version becomes the audience's live-time reading matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Operas for which Haddad did the translation and surtitling in the course of her career include: [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' in 1995;&lt;ref name="ON" /&gt; Prokofiev's ''[[War and Peace (opera)|War and Peace]]''; [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/460328/Falstaff/|title=TCM synopsis of ''Falstaff''|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[I vespri siciliani]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/4771294|title=''I Vespri siciliani'' [videorecording] : opera in five acts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-07/entertainment/ca-4642_1_strauss-final-opera|title=TV Review : A Welcome Production of Strauss' Final Opera|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[La donna del lago]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/4771782|title=''La donna del lago'' [videorecording] : opera in two acts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]''; [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]]'s ''[[Lo frate 'nnamorato]]'' and [[Conrad Susa]]'s ''[[The Dangerous Liaisons]]''.

"'''Stakeknife'''" is the code name of a high-level [[Espionage|spy]] who successfully infiltrated the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) while working for the top secret [[Force Research Unit]] (FRU) of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=|first=|title=Focus: Scappaticci's past is secret no more |pages=|publisher=[[The Times]] |date=18 May 2003 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2091-683795,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070311005439/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2091-683795,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 March 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-11|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grauniad, 2003" /&gt; Reports claim that Stakeknife worked for British intelligence for 25 years.&lt;ref name="Grauniad, 2003"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Cowan |first=Rosie |title=He did the IRA's dirty work for 25 years - and was paid £80,000 a year by the government |pages=|publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 May 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,953842,00.html |accessdate=2007-02-11

Scappaticci has denied that he is the notorious spy.&lt;ref name="telegraph30912018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Farmer |first1=Ben |title=Army spy 'Stakeknife' who was head of IRA's internal security is arrested in investigation over murders |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/30/army-spy-stakeknife-head-iras-internal-security-arrested-investigation/ |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Telegraph |date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
"Stakeknife" had his own dedicated handlers and agents, and it was suggested that he was important enough that [[MI5]] set up an office dedicated solely to him. Rumours suggested that he was being paid at least £80,000 a year and had a bank account in [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name="theguardian2003"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cowan |first1=Rosie |title=He did the IRA's dirty work for 25 years - and was paid £80,000 a year by the government |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/12/northernireland.northernireland1 |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=12 May 2003 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious allegations have emerged to the effect that the [[British government]] allowed up to 40 people to be killed via the IRA's [[Internal Security Unit]] or "Nutting Squad" to protect his cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=|first=|title=Murder fear after naming of IRA spy |pages=|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=12 May 2003 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1429810/Murder-fear-after-naming-of-IRA-spy.html |accessdate=2007-02-11|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Purported exposure==
In 1987, [[Sam McCrory (loyalist)|Sam McCrory]], an [[Ulster Defence Association]]/"Ulster Freedom Fighters" member, killed the 66-year-old [[Francisco Notarantonio]] at his home in [[Springfield Road, Belfast|Ballymurphy]] in West Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ian S. ''Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA''. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. p.125&lt;/ref&gt; The UDA/UFF had discovered that a senior IRA member was working for the FRU. It has been alleged that FRU agent [[Brian Nelson (Northern Irish loyalist)|Brian Nelson]] gave Notarantonio's name to the UDA/UFF to protect the identity of the real spy.

On 11 May 2003, several newspapers named [[Freddie Scappaticci]] as Stakeknife. Scappaticci, born in Belfast to Italian parents, denied the claims and launched an unsuccessful legal action to have the British government state he was not their agent.&lt;ref name="theguardian2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Oliver |first=Ted |title='Stakeknife' loses bid to quash spy claim |pages=|publisher=The Guardian |date=19 August 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,,1021579,00.html |accessdate=2007-02-11|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later left Northern Ireland and was rumoured to be living in [[Cassino, Italy|Cassino]], Italy. There were also reported sightings in [[Tenerife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Harkin|first=Greg|title=British spy hunted by IRA flees refuge|pages=|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=9 April 2006|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/ulster/article356668.ece|accessdate=2007-02-11|location=London|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314015841/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/ulster/article356668.ece|archivedate=14 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report in a February 2007 edition of the ''[[Belfast News Letter]]'' reported that a cassette recording allegedly of Scappaticci talking about the number of murders he was involved in via the "Nutting Squad", as well as his work as an Army agent, had been lodged with the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|PSNI]] in 2004 and subsequently passed to the [[Stevens Inquiries|Stevens Inquiry]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=|first=|title=Stakeknife tape emerges after News Letter probe |pages=|publisher=Belfast Today |date=5 February 2007 |url=http://www.belfasttoday.net/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=3425&amp;ArticleID=2023120 |accessdate=2007-02-11 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The former British Intelligence agent who worked in the FRU known as "[[Martin Ingram]]" has written a book titled ''Stakeknife'' since the original allegations came to light in which it says Scappaticci was the agent in question.

In October 2015 it was announced that Scappaticci was to be investigated by the Police Service of Northern Ireland over at least 24 murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Stakeknife: Army's most high ranking agent within the IRA to be quizzed about 24 murders |publisher=BBC News |date=21 October 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-34594175 |accessdate=2015-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016 it was announced that this investigation would be carried out by [[Bedfordshire Police]] and would examine the possible involvement of members of the RUC, Army and MI5 in murders carried out by the IRA, and their knowledge of them through the information supplied via Stakeknife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Stakeknife: Actions of IRA members, agents, Army and police to be examined |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=10 June 2016 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-36494590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scappaticci was arrested in connection with Operation Kenova in January 2018.&lt;ref name="telegraph30912018"/&gt;

[[File:Kelileh va Demneh.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A page from ''Kelileh o Demneh'' dated 1429, from [[Herat]], a [[Persian language|Persian]] translation of the ''Panchatantra'' derived from the [[Arabic]] version – ''Kalila wa Dimna'' – depicts the manipulative jackal-vizier, Dimna, trying to lead his [[Asiatic lion|lion-king]] into war.]]
'''Vishnu Sharma''' ([[Sanskrit]]: विष्णुशर्मन् / विष्णुशर्मा) was an Indian scholar and author who is believed to have written the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' collection of fables.&lt;ref name="ref67hafuh"&gt;{{Citation | title=71 Golden Tales of Panchatantra | author=Santhini Govindan | publisher=Unicorn Books, 2007 | isbn=9788178060866 | url=
https://books.google.com/books?id=4evdJNxWatMC | quote=''... credited to Pandit Vishnu Sharma somewhere between 1200 BC and AD 300. Many stories may have existed long before then, but Vishnu Sharma put them together as a single unit ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact period of the composition of the ''Panchatantra'' is uncertain, and estimates vary from 1200 BCE to 300 CE.&lt;ref name="ref67hafuh"/&gt; Some scholars place him in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jacobs|1888}}, Introduction, page xv; {{Harvnb|Ryder|1925}}, Translator's introduction, quoting Hertel: "that the original work was composed in Kashmir, about 200 B.C. At this date, however, many of the individual stories were already ancient."&lt;/ref&gt;

Panchatantra is one of the most widely translated non-religious books in history. The ''Panchatantra'' was translated into Middle Persian/[[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] in 570 CE by [[Borzūya]] and into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in 750 CE by [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa]] as ''Kalīlah wa Dimnah'' ({{lang-ar|كليلة و دمنة}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Knatchbull|1819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Falconer|1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Baghdad, the translation commissioned by [[Al-Mansur]], the second Abbasid Caliph, is claimed to have become "''second only to the Qu'ran in popularity.''"&lt;ref name="ref19majex"&gt;{{Citation | title=Human Drama: World History: From 500 to 1450 C.E., Volume 2 | author=Jean Johnson, Donald James Johnson | publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers, 2005 | isbn=978-1-55876-220-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZs1fN7QIMoC | quote=''... reached al-Mansur, the second Abbasid caliph ... he ordered it translated into Arabic ...

Its range has extended from [[Java]] to [[Iceland]].''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edgerton|1924|p=3}}. "reacht" and "workt" have been changed to conventional spelling.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, "''at least eleven Panchatantra tales are included in the work of [[Jean de La Fontaine]]''."&lt;ref name="ref19majex"/&gt;

==Legend==
The prelude to the ''Panchatantra'' identifies Vishnu Sharma as the author of the work. Since there is no other independent external evidence about him, "it is impossible to say whether he was the historical author . . .or is himself a literary invention".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Olivelle|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on analysis of various Indian [[recension]]s and the geographical features and animals described in the stories, [[Kashmir]] is suggested to be his birthplace by various scholars.&lt;ref name="ref65joyeh"&gt;{{Citation | title=Orissa review, Volume 22 | author= | publisher=Home Department, Government of Orissa, 1965 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZFiYtIcYycC | quote=''... He has concluded Kashmir as the birthplace of Vishnu Sharma taking into account the geographical features and the animals ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prelude narrates the story of how Vishnu Sharma supposedly created the ''Panchatantra''. There was a king called Sudarshan{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} who ruled a kingdom, whose capital was a city called Mahilaropya (महिलारोप्य), whose location on the current map of India is unknown.&lt;ref name="comppanch3242"&gt;{{Citation | title=सम्पूर्ण पञ्चतन्त्र (The Complete Panchatantra) | author=Acharya Vishnu Sharma | publisher=Parampara Books | isbn= | url=http://pustak.org/bs/home.php?bookid=5780 | quote=''... भारत की दक्षिण दिशा में स्थित महिलारोप्य नामक नगर किसी राज्य की राजधानी था (located in the south of India was a city named Mahilaropya, the capital of some kingdom)...'' | access-date=1 November 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006064226/http://pustak.org/bs/home.php?bookid=5780 | archive-date=6 October 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The king had three sons named Bahushakti, Ugrashakti and Anantashakti.&lt;ref name="ref03rofud"&gt;{{Citation | title=Secrets of Leadership: Insights from the Pancha Tantra | author=Luis S.R.Vas, Anita Vas | publisher=Pustak Mahal, 2004 | isbn=978-81-223-0802-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxU-Gi2bB8AC | quote=''... a king called Amarshakti. He had three sons – Bahushakti, Ugrashakti and Anantshakti – all dullards ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the king himself was both a scholar and a powerful ruler, his sons were "''all dullards''."&lt;ref name="ref03rofud"/&gt; The king despaired of his three princes' inability to learn, and approached his ministers for counsel. They presented him with conflicting advice, but the words of one, called Sumati, rang true to the king.&lt;ref name="ref53pibam"&gt;{{Citation | title=Story of Panchtantra | author=Pustak Mahal – Editorial Group / Bloomsbury | publisher=Pustak Mahal, 1999 | isbn=978-81-223-0454-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tPuMbMZQTcC | quote=''... One of them named Sumati advised the ruler to hand over the princes to the care of the renowned teacher Acharya Vishnu Sharma ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the sciences, politics and diplomacy were limitless disciplines that took a lifetime to master formally. Instead of teaching the princes scriptures and texts, they should somehow be taught the wisdom inherent in them, and the aged scholar Vishnu Sharma was the man to do it.&lt;ref name="ref75qipuv"&gt;{{Citation | title=Secrets of Leadership: Insights from the Pancha Tantra | author=Luis S.R.Vas, Anita Vas | publisher=Pustak Mahal, 2004 | isbn=978-81-223-0802-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxU-Gi2bB8AC | quote=''... a wise man named Sumati. He came up with the idea that the princes should not be taught the scriptures but only the wisdom in them. There is a man called Vishnu Sharma ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vishnu Sharma was invited to the court, where the king offered him a hundred land grants if he could teach the princes.&lt;ref name="ref92yibir"&gt;{{Citation | title=Children and Literature | author=Shubha Tiwari | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp;amp; Distributors, 2006 | isbn=978-81-269-0583-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TtfjO6dezAC | quote=''... In return the king promised to pay a hundred land grants but Vishnu Sharma replied: 'Naham vidyavikrayam shasanshatenapi karomi.' Translated, 'I am not the man to sell good learning for a hundred land grants.' ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnu Sharma declined the promised award, saying he did not sell knowledge for money, but accepted the task of making the princes wise to the ways of politics and leadership within six months.&lt;ref name="ref75qipuv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref92yibir"/&gt; Vishnu Sharma knew that he could never instruct these three students through conventional means. He had to employ a less orthodox way, and that was to tell a succession of animal fables – one weaving into another – that imparted to them the wisdom they required to succeed their father. Adapting stories that had been told for thousands of years in India, panchatantra was composed into an entertaining five part work to communicate the essence of diplomacy, relationships, politics and administration to the princes.&lt;ref name="ref75qipuv"/&gt; These five discourses — titled "The Loss of Friends", "The winning of friends", "Of Crows and Owls", "Loss of Gains" and "Imprudence" — became the ''Panchatantra'', meaning the five (''pancha'') treatises (''tantra'').

'''Winarti Partaningrat''' (September 21, 1922 &amp;ndash; May 8, 1978) was an early contributor to Indonesian librarianship, particularly the establishment of special libraries among government agencies.

==Education and government career==
After receiving a medical degree in Indonesia, Partaningrat attended [[Columbia University]] where she received a Master’s degree in [[library science]] in 1958. From 1946 to 1951, she worked at the Foreign Broadcasting of [[Radio Republik Indonesia]], followed by seven years with the [[Voice of America]] for [[United Nations Radio]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Library Services"&gt;{{cite book|title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services|year=1986|publisher=American Library Association|isbn=0-8389-0427-0|pages=640–641}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as the Head of the Bureau of Documentation for the Council of Sciences of Indonesia and the [[Indonesian Institute of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Library Services" /&gt;

===National Network System of Library Documentation and Information Systems===
Partaningrat was a leader in the creation of a special library networking system to allow information sharing among government departments. The organization also laid the foundations of library science within the fields of science, technology, biology, agriculture, medicine and humanities. By connecting these specialized  libraries and implementing standardized practices, special libraries became pivotal in providing technical function and services within Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Widharto|title=Libraries and Librarians in Indonesia in the Information Age: Challenges and Risks|publisher=University of the Philippine Institute of Library and Information Science|location=Indonesia|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/11274/1/Paper-widharto_4_CONSAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
