'''''A Small Act''''' is a [[documentary film]] produced by Harambee Media and [[HBO]] and directed by Jennifer Arnold. The documentary chronicles Chris Mburu's search for his benefactor, whose [[Child sponsorship|sponsorship]] allowed him to continue secondary school in Kenya. He would go on to earn degrees from the University of Nairobi and Harvard Law School.

==Plot==
Chris Mburu is a [[United Nations]] human rights advocate. As a child in Kenya, he was a good student, but would not have been able to enter [[secondary school]], as only [[Primary School]] is free of cost in Kenya. Due to his outstanding grades, Chris was selected for a direct scholarship, provided to him by a Swedish woman named Hilde Back, who had fled Nazi Germany because of her Jewish heritage.

In the present day, Mburu has decided to create a scholarship program of his own, and names it after his former benefactor, Hilde Back. In Kenya, Three gifted students, Kimani, Ruth, and Caroline are vying for a scholarship that may be their only chance to continue school. Kimani, Ruth and Caroline take the [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]] Test, a nationwide standard that will determine their eligibility for Mburu's scholarship program. However, the violence and mayhem of the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis]] may jeopardize the students' dreams.

Due to a lack of students meeting the predetermined threshold on the tests, Kimani is given a scholarship.  Unfortunately, Ruth and Caroline do not receive scholarships, but it is revealed in the closing credits that they have been sponsored to continue schooling by the documentary film crew.

The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival and went on to win the Humanitas Prize for Documentary, a NAMIC Vision Award and was nominated for the Best Documentary Emmy Award.

The rippling effect theory has never been easily proven, than in this particular story. The "drop" in the "ocean" literally formed waves across the vast ocean. From Sweden to Kenya.

The AEU has a membership of over 188,000 educators who work in public schools, colleges, early childhood and vocational settings in all states and territories of Australia. Members include teachers and allied educational staff, principals and administrators mainly in government school and TAFE systems.   Teachers working in the private schools system are covered by the [[Independent Education Union of Australia]] (IEU).  In some states the AEU shares coverage of some members with the [[National Tertiary Education Union]], [[Community and Public Sector Union]] and [[LHMU]].  Through the Federation of Education Unions, the AEU works closely with the two other Federal unions which cover educators in non-government schools and universities. The AEU is also internationally affiliated to the [[Education International]], which the AEU claims is "the largest non-government organisation in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeufederal.org.au/about/organisation|title=AEU Organisation|website=www.aeufederal.org.au|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National organisation==

The Federal Office sees its core business as, "the maintenance of comprehensive industrial protection and representation through industrial awards and agreements in all industrial tribunals in Australia. This involves industrial research, negotiation and advocacy over a wide range of matters including salaries and teaching and learning conditions."

==History==
In the 19th century the Colonial governments, which would later form the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] as states, established a variety of state schools.  These schools were both demanded by the Australian trade union and labour movement, for the [[free education]] of the working class, and also used as a way to control the education and free time of the children of the Australian working class.  Schools systems were highly stratified, with most children only receiving infants or primary education.  Selection for Technical or Academic high school was highly competitive, and biased towards the children of agriculturalists, industrialists, business owners and professionals.  Teachers were low-paid government employees and controlled by a series of moral codes that restricted their professional, personal and sexual conduct.  Teachers were primarily educated in Technical colleges, fully funded by the governments, and [[indentured]] to Government employment in rural or remote districts for a long period.  Buildings and teaching materials were notoriously bad, and often resulted in injuries to teachers or children.  University educated teachers were a rarity, and tended to go into the private schools system.

The private school system itself was split between two main groups: a British-style system of schools for the elite, and a massively underfunded Catholic church-run system. The Catholic education system usually shared the poor working and teaching conditions of the state schools.

During the 1950s teachers in the state school system became more unionised and better organised. These women and men had received free University education on the condition that they teach in the state school system, or had received University training as a result of their status as [[Second World War]] veterans and had chosen to teach.  These teachers, and those following them, campaigned to increase teacher's salaries, to transform the structure of Australian education, and to improve the curriculum.

This militancy achieved its peak in the 1970s when teachers won salaries equivalent to state parliament [[backbenchers]], a massive and systemic initiative for building improvements, and massive curriculum reform.

The Australian Teachers Union was established in 1984, and following a series of union mergers with the ACT Teachers' Federation, the Northern Territory Teachers' Federation, the South Australian Institute of Teachers and the Australian Teachers' Federation, changed its name to the Australian Education Union in 1993.&lt;ref name=ERIC/&gt;&lt;ref name="atf"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Australian Trade Union Archives]]|url=http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0253b.htm |title=Australian Teachers Federation (1937–1987) |accessdate=4 July 2014|work=Australian Trade Union Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAIT"&gt;{{cite web | author=Australian National University archives | url=http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/south-australian-institute-of-teachers | title=South Australian Institute of Teachers | date=24 January 2013| accessdate=26 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous education==
The AEU has a designated Indigenous position on its Federal Executive, an Indigenous observer position on the AEU TAFE Executive, and runs an annual seminar on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aeufederal.org.au/Atsi/index2.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 November 2010 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060811211535/http://www.aeufederal.org.au/Atsi/index2.html |archive-date=11 August 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the AEU made a submission&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.mceecdya.edu.au/verve/_resources/IEAP2010Sub-Australian_Education_Union.pdf AEU submission on the draft 'Indigenous Education Action Plan 2010–2014']&lt;/ref&gt; (authorised by Angelo Gavrielatos, AEU Federal President) to the Australian Government's draft Indigenous Education Action Plan 2010–2014. The submission included 40 recommendations on improving Indigenous education, and stated: "The realistic timeframe that should be considered to achieve outcomes for Indigenous people equal to the rest of the community is to focus on the outcomes that should be expected for the children to be born in 20 to 25 years from today".

It is of general scientific or engineering interest and is given by an invited guest, often from overseas, at several of the major centres on [[South Africa]]. The main lecture and accompanying dinner are usually held at the [[University of Witwatersrand]] and it is also presented in the space of one week at other centres, typically Cape Town, Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth.

The Lecture is named in memory of the eminent electrical engineer [[Bernard Price]]. The first Lecture was held in 1951 and it has occurred as an annual event ever since.

'''Bess Bolden Walcott''' (1886-1988) was an [[African American]] educator, librarian, museum curator and activist who helped establish the historical significance of the [[Tuskegee University]]. Recruited by Booker T. Washington to help him coordinate his library and teach science, she remained at the institute until 1962, but continued her service into the 1970s. Throughout her fifty-four year career at Tuskegee, she organized Washington's library, taught science and English at the institute, served as founder and editor of two of the major campus publications, directed public relations, established the Red Cross chapter, curated the George Washington Carver collection and museum and assisted in Tuskegee being placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. 

In addition to her work at the school, Walcott was an active suffragist and member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, serving in the early 1960s as the national vice president of the organization. Walcott was recognized for her contributions to the state of Alabama in 2003, when she was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Bessie Adeline Bolden was born on November 4, 1886 in [[Xenia, Ohio]] to Fannie A. (née Bizzell) and William P. Bolden.{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}}{{sfn|Greene County Ohio Marriages|1885|p=425}}{{sfn|''Xenia Daily Gazette''|1910|p=14}}{{sfn|U.S. Census|1900|p=125-A}} Around 1900, the family moved to [[Painesville, Ohio|Painesville]] in [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]].{{sfn|U.S. Census|1900|p=125-A}}{{sfn|U.S. Census|1910|p=4-A}} In June, 1908, Bolden graduated from [[Oberlin College]] and secured employment at [[Tuskeegee Institute]].{{sfn|''Xenia Daily Gazette''|1908|p=10}}{{sfn|Oberlin College Archives|2012}}

==Career==
Bolden began her career as a science teacher at Tuskeegee{{sfn|''Xenia Daily Gazette''|1908|p=10}} and helped [[Booker T. Washington]] organize his library.{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}} In 1911, she married William Holbrook Walcott, who was also a professor at the Institute.{{sfn|''Xenia Daily Gazette''|1911|p=10}}{{sfn|Gates|Higginbotham|2008|p=47}} In 1918, she began teaching English at the high school of the Institute.{{sfn|Hall|1932|p=90}} That same year, she pushed for the charter for a Red Cross chapter at Tuskegee. It would be the first black chapter granted in the United States. While Walcott was not the chairman, as executive director she was the driving force behind the organization. The initial chairman was [[Robert Russa Moton]] and the vice presidency was shared by Moton's wife [[Jennie Moton|Jennie]] and Booker T. Washington′s wife, [[Margaret Murray Washington|Margaret]]. Jennie, Margaret and Walcott also were members of the Tuskegee Woman's Club.{{sfn|Lane|2001|p=250}} The club was active in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffrage movement]] and when women earned the right to vote, Walcott and three friends immediately went to register to vote.{{sfn|Alexander|1995|p=94}} 

Walcott's Red Cross work kept her extremely busy, assisting in the war effort as well as the [[1918 flu pandemic]].{{sfn|Hall|1932|p=90}}{{sfn|Lane|2001|p=250}} In 1931, Walcott transferred to the principal's office, where she directed the school’s press service and worked with newspaper publicity.{{sfn|Hall|1932|p=90}} She also founded and edited two of the largest campus publications,{{sfn|Alabama Women's Hall of Fame|2005}} the ''Tuskegee Messenger'' and ''Service''. During the [[Great Depression]], Walcott led the Red Cross chapter's effort to distribute food and goods to poverty-stricken black farm families with grant funds secured from the national chapter.{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}} In 1936, she chaired the 40th anniversary celebration committee in honor of [[George Washington Carver]]'s work at Tuskegee.{{sfn|Alabama Women's Hall of Fame|2005}} 

In 1941, during World War II, Walcott became the first African American to serve as an Acting Field Director for the Red Cross.{{sfn|''The Tuskegee News''|March 6, 2003|p=A-2}}{{sfn|Alabama Women's Hall of Fame|2005}} Between 1942 and 1946, she served as the Public Relations Director of Tuskegee{{sfn|Alabama Women's Hall of Fame|2005}} and much of her work focused on chronicling the development and reputation of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]].{{sfn|''The Tuskegee News''|March 6, 2003|p=A-2}} To promote the war effort, Walcott traveled extensively and sold [[War bond#United States|war bonds]]. In 1946, she was reappointed as the Acting Field Director, serving until 1947. Her duties in the post required that she oversee aid to returning veterans and assist with training of Red Cross volunteers.{{sfn|Alabama Women's Hall of Fame|2005}} During the same period, she joined the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF), along with other noted African American women leaders like, [[Sadie Sawyer Hughley]], [[Shirley Chisholm]], [[Coretta Scott King]], and many others.{{sfn|Blackwell|2004|p=146}}

In 1947, Walcott and her husband divorced, after having had four children.{{sfn|Gates|Higginbotham|2008|p=47}} She served as the curator of [[The George Washington Carver Museum]] between 1951 and 1962,{{sfn|''The Tuskegee News''|March 13, 2003|p=A-5}} when she retired from Tuskegee.{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}} In 1962, Walcott was elected as the national vice president of WILPF and went as the American delegate to the 15th Triennial Congress held in [[San Francisco]].{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}} She also participated in lectures for WILPF, speaking at events on Civil Rights, such as the conference held in [[Estes Park, Colorado]] in 1963, where she presented a lecture ''Next Steps Toward Integration, North and South''.{{sfn|''The Sunday Oak Leaves''|1963|p=29}}  

Between 1964 and 1965, Walcott traveled to [[Liberia]], acting as a consultant for the proposed {{ill|Tubman Centre of African Culture|de}}. [[William Tubman]], [[President of Liberia]] and namesake of the center, honored her as a knight of the [[Humane Order of African Redemption]].{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}} At Tuskegee, she meticulously gathered and conserved artistic and historic materials created by Carver, including his correspondence. Her preservation efforts documented the pivotal role Tuskegee played in both the state and national history, preparing the path for the Tuskegee Institute’s designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}} Walcott's work as a curator of the museum led to its becoming a [[National Park Service]] site{{sfn|''The Tuscaloosa News''|2003}} and in the 1970s, she assisted the Park Service in the restoration of Booker T. Washington′s home, [[The Oaks (Colbert County, Alabama)|The Oaks]].{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}} 

==Death and legacy==
Walcott died on April 18, 1988 in [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]], [[Macon County, Alabama]].{{sfn|National Women's History Museum|2010}} In 2003, she was inducted into the [[Alabama Women's Hall of Fame]] for her contributions in the state and her profession.{{sfn|''The Tuscaloosa News''|2003}}

The '''Campaign for Real Education''' is a right-wing pressure group and [[non-profit organisation]] in the United Kingdom that advocates for [[traditional education]], greater parental choice in schooling, and less [[state regulation]] of subjects that children study.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-lqQAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=real+education#v=snippet&amp;q=real%20education&amp;f=false Dictionary of British Education]'', Peter Gordon and Denis Lawton (2004) Routledge, p34&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CRE was established in 1987 by a group of 14 parents and teachers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cre.org.uk/about_us.html About Us] Campaign for Real Education&lt;/ref&gt; although it was effectively a one-man organisation led by Nick Seaton, who ran it from a bedroom in his home near [[York]].&lt;ref name=TES&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6312372 Obituary – Nick Seaton, 1936–2012] Times Education Supplement, 4 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It gained national attention after intervening in a dispute at [[Priory School, Lewes|Lewes Priory School]] over whether pupils should sit [[GCE Ordinary Level|O Levels]] or [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]]. Two teachers that pressed for students to sit the O Level were sacked, with one of them, Chris McGovern, later becoming a headteacher in the independent sector and the CRE's chairman.&lt;ref name=TES/&gt;

==Views==
The group campaigns to "press for higher standards and more [[School choice|parental choice]] in  state education," and supports [[grammar school]]s. Among its concerns are [[truancy]], low educational and behavioural standards, mismanagement of school funding, and what it describes as "faddish" teaching methods such as [[Student-centred learning|child-centred learning]]. It opposes the teaching of [[sociology]] and [[politics]]. It has been critical of anti-racism and anti-sexism campaigns,&lt;ref name=RSS&gt;Roberta S. Sigel, Marilyn B. Hoskin (2013) ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q5doKnc2wJoC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Campaign+for+Real+Education+right+wing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zl-dzdPC_N&amp;sig=A1PNbMSiGATvCfsmHN4KwCyulfA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-KOFVbn9F4HXUfaOgeAB&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Campaign%20for%20Real%20Education%20right%20wing&amp;f=false Education for Democratic Citizenship: A Challenge for Multi-ethnic Societies]'', Routledge, p41&lt;/ref&gt; though chairman Chris McGovern has stated that "children should be taught to have respect for their peers, whatever their background or colour".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Dean (2014-02-24).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26147">The '''Clore Leadership Programme''' is the first initiative of its kind in the UK aimed at developing and strengthening leadership across the cultural and creative sectors. The Programme was initiated in 2003 by the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation] and is sustained by a partnership between private philanthropy and public funding. The organisation invests in individuals, drawing on their creative potential to raising the game in the arts and creative sectors.

The Programme awards its flagship Clore Fellowships annually to exceptional individuals drawn from across the UK and beyond, and runs a choice of programmes tailored to the leadership needs of arts professionals at different stages of their career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=31&lt;/ref&gt; The participants are drawn from a range of specialisms including the visual and performing arts, film and digital media, libraries, museums, archives and heritage, and cultural policy. In the last 10 years, over 250 fellowships have been awarded and nearly 1000 leaders have attended the Short Courses, enabling the participants to form a well-networked and connected arts leadership sector. Graduates of the scheme dot the salient points of the cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Industry, 16 May 2008, By Simon Tait&lt;/ref&gt;

The Programme has inspired other initiatives in the UK and beyond, in particular the [http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/ Clore Social Leadership Programme].

==Background==
Initiated by the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation], and sustained by the Foundation's generous support, the Programme is the UK's first cross-disciplinary leadership programme for the cultural and creative sector. It was established as an independent organisation in 2004, after Dame [[Vivien Duffield]] had instigated research into the need for leadership training in the cultural programme.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Industry, 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; That research discovered that leadership development was often a question of accident rather than design, and that – without getting in the way of serendipity – it was time to put some of the design in place.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2011/dec/14/culture-leaders-clore-leadership&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the vision of its Founding Director [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], the Programme focused initially on the Fellowship Programme, aimed at shaping creative leaders through in-depth learning, and tailored as far as possible to the needs, aspirations and circumstances of between 20 and 30 individuals a year. The structure of the Fellowship programme is based on recommendations which were made to the Clore Duffield Foundation by John Holden and [[Robert Hewison]], (see [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/cms/user_files/files/CLP%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report%20Full.pdf their report]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, and the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/cms/user_files/files/CLP%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report%20Summary.pdf Executive Summary]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). The course is unique outside the US, and includes workshops and residential courses, an extended placement, individually-selected training, mentoring and coaching, as well as opportunities for research and the development of skills.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was first established, the Clore Leadership Programme has been a pioneer in leadership development, a source of expert advice and an inspirational example for other initiatives in the UK and beyond, including the [http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/ Clore Social Leadership Programme].

Developments in the Programme since 2004 have included:

•	Intensive fortnight-long residential Short Courses

•	A Board Development programme, to strengthen governance in the cultural sector

•	The extension of the Fellowships to a small number of international participants

•	One- and two-day follow-up courses (Clore Plus)

•	An association with the University of Hong Kong to create Asia’s first Advanced Cultural Leadership Programme 
 
•	One-week courses for Emerging Leaders

•	The creation of consortia of large-scale national cultural organisations, to support the Fellowship programme

•	The introduction of leadership development days, run in partnership with other organisations

==Founders==
The founding Director of the Clore Leadership Programme was [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], who from 1997–2001 had been Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.  In July 2008 he stepped down and was succeeded as Director by Sue Hoyle. The current Chair is [[Sandy Nairne]], former Director of the National Portrait Gallery.

==Courses==
From freelancers, entrepreneurs to heads of established institutions, the Clore Leadership Programme nurtures dynamic and diverse leaders. Each year, the Programme awards fellowships and designs programmes tailored to the varied leadership needs of arts professionals at different stages of their career. These include awarding the Clore Fellowship (annually), and running four residential Short Courses (each runs for a fortnight), an Emerging Leaders’ Course (a week’s residential programme) and a number of Clore Plus days (follow-up courses for those who have been through the various programmes at Clore). The Programme also works in partnership with others to deliver leadership development days.

===The Clore Fellowship Programme===

The flagship [http://www.cloreleadership.org/fellowships.aspx Clore Fellowship] is offered to arts and creative industries’ practitioners drawn primarily from the UK. The Fellowship spans a year of intense activity, and includes residential courses, group workshops, projects, and a customised programme of personal and professional development. Each Fellow embarks on a programme of tuition, research, training and secondment, tailored to their specific cultural sector, interests and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 19 Jan 2008, By Peter Aspden&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main features that distinguishes Clore from other leadership programmes is the cross-cultural element. People doing the programme are drawn from the arts and culture sector in its widest sense, and Fellows are seconded to other cultural organisations rather than other libraries or organizations similar to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Impact, Journal of Career Development Group | Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme offers a number of [http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=53 International Fellowships] to exceptional individuals from prioritised countries outside the UK. These include Chevening Scholarships on the Clore Leadership Programme funded by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office in countries such as India, China, Jordan and Egypt, and the Hong Kong Scholarships on the Clore Leadership Programme funded by the [http://www.hab.gov.hk/ Home Affairs Bureau] of the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

The Clore Duffield Foundation supports the core costs of the Fellowship programme. Individual fellowships are supported by a range of public funders, philanthropic foundations, Consortia partners  and international partners, and are awarded to 25 and individual participants every year. The Programme also  occasionally accepts self-funded Fellowships.

===Short Course on Cultural Leadership===
[http://www.cloreleadership.org/short-courses.aspx Short Courses] offer numerous opportunities every year for ambitious and creative individuals to undergo a two-week intensive residential training course structured to deliver essential knowledge and skills required by cultural leaders today. The Short Course Programme is supported by [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England], through a three-year commissioned grant to develop resilient leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cloreleadership.org/short-courses.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerging Leaders’ Course===
The [http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=36 Emerging Leaders Programme] is a 5-day residential course aimed at people in the early stages of their career. This Programme is funded by [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England] through a commissioned grant to develop resilient leadership.

==Partners==

==Impact and Alumni==

The Clore Fellows and course participants have gone from strength to strength, steering new projects, establishing innovative arts organisations, enabling higher growth and assuming key leadership positions in the arts sectors all over the world. The results have been extraordinarily successful — Clore graduates are now in top jobs at the likes of the Royal Academy and the Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; Innumerable cultural leaders from the UK and abroad have walked through its doors and on to better jobs, including Gavin Reid, previously a trumpet player, who since undertaking the programme is now Director of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/observations-clore-leadership-programme-provides-a-step-up-for-future-royal-ballet-supremos-1764846.html&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is rooted in the belief that organisations which deliberately foster leadership and support their future leaders, do better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/2014/05/22/wheres-next-generation-music-leaders/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529214430/http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/2014/05/22/wheres-next-generation-music-leaders/ |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other luminaries include Axel Rüger, formerly Curator of Dutch Paintings for the National Gallery, who has made the leap to Director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam while Moira Sinclair, previously Director of Vital Arts, an arts and health initiative, is now Executive Director, Arts Council London.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/observations-clore-leadership-programme-provides-a-step-up-for-future-royal-ballet-supremos-1764846.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is predicted that their expertise will  play a major role in helping the arts weather the stormy years ahead.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme draws on the creative potential of leaders to raise the game in the arts and creative sectors. The idea behind initiating the Programme was to transform the cultural sector as a whole through the actions of emerging leaders and the work they do, both individually and collaboratively. As [[Nick Merriman]],  Director, Manchester Museum, University of Manchester, said:  “It (Clore Leadership Programme) has helped everyone take investment in leadership much more seriously and to think realistically about succession planning.” &lt;ref&gt;Museums Journal, June 2013, by John Holt&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside leadership development, the Programme has also had a positive impact on the sustainability of the entire sector  and is seen to have been a key player in “a silent revolution in the arts in Britain, where they are now incomparably better managed than they’ve ever been before.” &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;  “Thirty years ago, when faced with severe cuts, the sector almost collapsed. This is not the case now and that reflects the quality of the leadership we have. Clore has been a key part of that," said Mark Taylor, Director of the Museums Association.&lt;ref&gt;Museums Journal, June 2013, by John Holt&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme has not only succeeded in creating a cadre of creative and cultural leaders,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/270/article/generous-leadership&lt;/ref&gt; but has stimulated investment in leadership on the part of governments, agencies, foundations and charities. The Programme has inspired other initiatives in the UK and beyond, including the Clore Social Leadership Programme for leaders from the social sector, Asia’s first [http://www.culture.hku.hk/ Advanced Cultural Leadership Programme] in Hong Kong, and a capacity-building course for arts managers in South Asia ([http://www.arthinksouthasia.org/ ARThink South Asia Fellowship]) created by a graduate of the Clore Programme.

'''Computer-assisted language learning (CALL), British, or Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI)/Computer-Aided Language Instruction (CALI), American'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=John|date=1983|title=Computer assisted language learning|url=|journal=Language Teaching|volume=16(2)|pages=102-114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''',''' is briefly defined in a seminal work by Levy (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;1) as "the search for and study of applications of the computer in language teaching and learning".&lt;ref name=levy1997&gt;Levy M. (1997) ''CALL: context and conceptualisation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; CALL embraces a wide range of [[information and communications technology]] applications and approaches to teaching and learning foreign languages, from the "traditional" drill-and-practice programs that characterised CALL in the 1960s and 1970s to more recent manifestations of CALL, e.g. as used in a [[virtual learning environment]] and Web-based [[distance learning]]. It also extends to the use of [[#Corpora and concordancers|corpora and concordancers]], interactive whiteboards,&lt;ref name=schmidcutrim2009&gt;Schmid Euline Cutrim (2009) ''Interactive whiteboard technology in the language classroom: exploring new pedagogical opportunities'', Saarbrücken, Germany: VDM Verlag Dr. Müller.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-mediated communication (CMC),&lt;ref name=lamyhampel&gt;Lamy M.-N. &amp; Hampel R.

(eds.) (2008) Special edition of ''ReCALL'' (20, 3) on ''Mobile Assisted Language Learning''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CALI (computer-assisted language instruction) was in use before CALL, reflecting its origins as a subset of the general term CAI (computer-assisted instruction). CALI fell out of favour among language teachers, however, as it appeared to imply a teacher-centred approach (instructional), whereas language teachers are more inclined to prefer a student-centred approach, focusing on learning rather than instruction. CALL began to replace CALI in the early 1980s (Davies &amp; Higgins 1982: p.&amp;nbsp;3)&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. &amp; Higgins J. (1982) ''Computers, language and language learning'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now incorporated into the names of the growing number of [[#Professional associations|professional associations]] worldwide.

An alternative term, technology-enhanced language learning (TELL),&lt;ref&gt;Bush M. &amp; Terry R. (1997) (eds.) ''Technology-enhanced language learning'', Lincolnwood, Illinois: National Textbook Company.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged around the early 1990s: e.g. the TELL Consortium project, University of Hull.

The current philosophy of CALL puts a strong emphasis on student-centred materials that allow learners to work on their own. Such materials may be structured or unstructured, but they normally embody two important features: interactive learning and individualised learning. CALL is essentially a tool that helps teachers to facilitate the language learning process. It can be used to reinforce what has already been learned in the classroom or as a remedial tool to help learners who require additional support.

The design of CALL materials generally takes into consideration principles of language pedagogy and methodology, which may be derived from different learning theories (e.g. behaviourist, cognitive, constructivist) and second-language learning theories such as Stephen Krashen's [[monitor hypothesis]].

A combination of face-to-face teaching and CALL is usually referred to as [[blended learning]]. Blended learning is designed to increase learning potential and is more commonly found than pure CALL (Pegrum 2009: p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref&gt;Pegrum M. (2009) ''From blogs to bombs: The future of digital technologies in education'', Perth: University of Western Australia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

CALL dates back to the 1960s, when it was first introduced on university mainframe computers. The PLATO project, initiated at the University of Illinois in 1960, is an important landmark in the early development of CALL (Marty 1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marty | first1 = F | year = 1981 | title = Reflections on the use of computers in second language acquisition | url = | journal = System | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 85–98 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(81)90023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the microcomputer in the late 1970s brought computing within the range of a wider audience, resulting in a boom in the development of CALL programs and a flurry of publications of books on CALL in the early 1980s.

Dozens of CALL programs are currently available on the internet, at prices ranging from free to expensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=12 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other programs are available only through university language courses.

There have been several attempts to document the history of CALL. Sanders (1995) covers the period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, focusing on CALL in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders R. (ed.) (1995) ''Thirty years of computer-assisted language instruction'', Festschrift for John R. Russell, ''CALICO Journal'' Special Issue, 12, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Delcloque (2000) documents the history of CALL worldwide, from its beginnings in the 1960s to the dawning of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Delcloque P. (2000) ''History of CALL'' [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/History_of_CALL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Davies (2005) takes a look back at CALL's past and attempts to predict where it is going.&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2005) ''Computer Assisted Language Learning: Where are we now and where are we going?'' [ Online]: http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/docs/UCALL_Keynote.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard (2009) offers a compilation of 74 key articles and book excerpts, originally published in the years 1988-2007, that give a comprehensive overview of the wide range of leading ideas and research results that have exerted an influence on the development of CALL or that show promise in doing so in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard P. (2009) (ed.) ''Computer-assisted language learning'', Volumes I-IV, Routledge: London and New York: http://www.stanford.edu/~efs/callcc/&lt;/ref&gt; A published review of Hubbard's collection can be found in ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 14, 3 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' (2010) 14, 3, pp. 14-18 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/issues/october2010/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler-Pascoe (2011) looks at the history of CALL from a different point of view, namely the evolution of CALL in the dual fields of educational technology and second/foreign language acquisition and the paradigm shifts experienced along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Butler-Pascoe M. E. (2011) "The history of CALL: the intertwining paths of technology and second/foreign language teaching", ''International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching (IJCALLT)'' 1, 1: 16-32: http://www.igi-global.com/ijcallt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology and phases==

During the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to establish a CALL typology. A wide range of different types of CALL programs was identified by Davies &amp; Higgins (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. &amp; Higgins J. (1985) ''Using computers in language learning: a teacher's guide'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones &amp; Fortescue (1987),&lt;ref&gt;Jones C. &amp; Fortescue S. (1987) ''Using computers in the language classroom'', Harlow: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardisty &amp; Windeatt (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Hardisty D. &amp; Windeatt S. (1989) ''CALL'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Levy (1997: pp.&amp;nbsp;118ff.).&lt;ref name=levy1997/&gt; These included gap-filling and Cloze programs, multiple-choice programs, free-format (text-entry) programs, adventures and simulations, action mazes, sentence-reordering programs, exploratory programs—and "total Cloze", a type of program in which the learner has to reconstruct a whole text. Most of these early programs still exist in modernised versions.

Since the 1990s, it has become increasingly difficult to categorise CALL as it now extends to the use of [[blogs]], [[wikis]], [[social networking]], [[podcasting]], [[Web 2.0]] applications, [[#Virtual worlds|language learning in virtual worlds]] and [[interactive whiteboards]] (Davies et al. 2010: Section 3.7).&lt;ref name=davieswalkeretal/&gt;

Warschauer (1996)&lt;ref name=warschauer96&gt;Warschauer M. (1996) "Computer-assisted language learning: an introduction". In Fotos S. (ed.) ''Multimedia language teaching'', Tokyo: Logos International [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/warschauer.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Warschauer &amp; Healey (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warschauer | first1 = M. | last2 = Healey | first2 = D. | year = 1998 | title = Computers and language learning: an overview | url = | journal = Language Teaching | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 57–71 | doi=10.1017/s0261444800012970}}&lt;/ref&gt; took a different approach. Rather than focusing on the typology of CALL, they identified three historical phases of CALL, classified according to their underlying pedagogical and methodological approaches:

* Behavioristic CALL: conceived in the 1950s and implemented in the 1960s and 1970s.
* Communicative CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Integrative CALL: embracing Multimedia and the Internet: 1990s.

Most CALL programs in Warschauer &amp; Healey's first phase, Behavioristic CALL (1960s to 1970s), consisted of drill-and-practice materials in which the computer presented a stimulus and the learner provided a response. At first, both could be done only through text. The computer would analyse students' input and give feedback, and more sophisticated programs would react to students' mistakes by branching to help screens and remedial activities. While such programs and their underlying pedagogy still exist today, behaviouristic approaches to language learning have been rejected by most language teachers, and the increasing sophistication of computer technology has led CALL to other possibilities.

The second phase described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Communicative CALL, is based on the [[communicative approach]] that became prominent in the late 1970s and 1980s (Underwood 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Underwood J. (1984) ''Linguistics, computers and the language teacher: a communicative approach'', Rowley, Massachusetts: Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; In the communicative approach the focus is on using the language rather than analysis of the language, and grammar is taught implicitly rather than explicitly. It also allows for originality and flexibility in student output of language. The communicative approach coincided with the arrival of the PC, which made computing much more widely available and resulted in a boom in the development of software for language learning. The first CALL software in this phase continued to provide skill practice but not in a drill format—for example: paced reading, text reconstruction and language games—but the computer remained the tutor. In this phase, computers provided context for students to use the language, such as asking for directions to a place, and programs not designed for language learning such as [[Sim City]], ''Sleuth'' and [[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]] were used for language learning. Criticisms of this approach include using the computer in an ad hoc and disconnected manner for more marginal aims rather than the central aims of language teaching.

The third phase of CALL described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Integrative CALL, starting from the 1990s, tried to address criticisms of the communicative approach by integrating the teaching of language skills into tasks or projects to provide direction and coherence. It also coincided with the development of multimedia technology (providing text, graphics, sound and animation) as well as Computer-mediated communication (CMC). CALL in this period saw a definitive shift from the use of the computer for drill and tutorial purposes (the computer as a finite, authoritative base for a specific task) to a medium for extending education beyond the classroom. Multimedia CALL started with interactive laser videodiscs such as ''Montevidisco'' (Schneider &amp; Bennion 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Schneider E.W. &amp; Bennion J.L. (1984) "Veni, vidi, vici, via videodisc: a simulator for instructional courseware". In Wyatt D.H. (ed.) ''Computer-assisted language instruction'', Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A la rencontre de Philippe'' (Fuerstenberg 1993),&lt;ref&gt;Fuerstenberg G. (1993) ''A la rencontre de Philippe'': Videodisc, Software, Teacher's Manual and Student Activities Workbook: Yale University Press [Online]: http://web.mit.edu/fll/www/projects/Philippe.html&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were simulations of situations where the learner played a key role. These programs later were transferred to CD-ROMs, and new [[role-playing games]] (RPGs) such as ''Who is Oscar Lake?'' made their appearance in a range of different languages.

In a later publication Warschauer changed the name of the first phase of CALL from Behavioristic CALL to Structural CALL and also revised the dates of the three phases (Warschauer 2000):&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer M. (2000) "CALL for the 21st Century", IATEFL and ESADE Conference, 2 July 2000, Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Structural CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Communicative CALL: 1980s to 1990s.
* Integrative CALL: 2000 onwards.

Bax (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bax | first1 = S | year = 2003 | title = CALL – past, present and future | url = | journal = System | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 13–28 | doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(02)00071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; took issue with Warschauer &amp; Haley (1998) and Warschauer (2000) and proposed these three phases:

* Restricted CALL – mainly behaviouristic: 1960s to 1980s.
* Open CALL – i.e. open in terms of feedback given to students, software types and the role of the teacher, and including simulations and games: 1980s to 2003 (i.e. the date of Bax's article).
* Integrated CALL – still to be achieved. Bax argued that at the time of writing language teachers were still in the Open CALL phase, as true integration could only be said to have been achieved when CALL had reached a state of "normalisation" – e.g. when using CALL was as normal as using a pen.

See also Bax &amp; Chambers (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bax | first1 = S. | last2 = Chambers | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Making CALL work: towards normalisation | url = | journal = System | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 465–479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bax (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Bax S. (2011) "Normalisation revisited: the effective use of technology in language education", ''International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching (IJCALLT)'' 1, 2: 1-15: http://www.igi-global.com/ijcallt&lt;/ref&gt; in which the topic of "normalisation" is revisited.

==Flashcards==

A basic use of CALL is in vocabulary acquisition using [[flashcard]]s, which requires quite simple programs. Such programs often make use of [[spaced repetition]], a technique whereby the learner is presented with the vocabulary items that need to be committed to memory at increasingly longer intervals until long-term retention is achieved. This has led to the development of a number of applications known as spaced repetition systems (SRS),&lt;ref&gt;Mounteney M. ''Spaced repetition learning systems (SRS):'' http://www.omniglot.com/language/srs.php. Accessed 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; including the generic [[Anki (software)|Anki]] or [[SuperMemo]] package and programs such as BYKI&lt;ref&gt;BYKI (Before You Know It): A personalized language-learning system, designed to promote language proficiency by expanding the learner's vocabulary. The system makes use of a flashcard interface and tracks everything that has been learned, automatically presenting and re-presenting the material at appropriate intervals: http://www.byki.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and phase-6,&lt;ref&gt;phase-6: A flashcard system that presents vocabulary at phased intervals, aiding long-term retention. http://www.phase-6.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which have been designed specifically for learners of foreign languages.

==Software design and pedagogy==

Above all, careful consideration must be given to [[pedagogy]] in designing CALL software, but publishers of CALL software tend to follow the latest trend, regardless of its desirability. Moreover, approaches to teaching foreign languages are constantly changing, dating back to [[grammar-translation]], through the [[direct method (education)|direct method]], [[Audio-lingual method|audio-lingualism]] and a variety of other approaches, to the more recent [[communicative approach]] and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] (Decoo 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Decoo W. (2001) ''On the mortality of language learning methods''. Paper given as the James L. Barker lecture on 8 November 2001 at Brigham Young University [Online]: https://web.archive.org/web/20080208190123/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Designing and creating CALL software is an extremely demanding task, calling upon a range of skills. Major CALL development projects are usually managed by a team of people:

* A subject specialist (also known as a content provider) – usually a language teacher – who is responsible for providing the content and pedagogical input. More than one subject specialist is required for larger CALL projects.
* A programmer who is familiar with the chosen programming language or authoring tool.
* A graphic designer, to produce pictures and icons, and to advise on fonts, colour, screen layout, etc.
* A professional photographer or, at the very least, a very good amateur photographer. Graphic designers often have a background in photography too.
* A sound engineer and a video technician will be required if the package is to contain substantial amounts of sound and video.
* An instructional designer. Developing a CALL package is more than just putting a text book into a computer. An instructional designer will probably have a background in cognitive psychology and media technology, and will be able to advise the subject specialists in the team on the appropriate use of the chosen technology (Gimeno &amp; Davies 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Gimeno-Sanz A. &amp; Davies G. (2010) CALL software design and implementation. Module 3.2 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

CALL inherently supports [[learner autonomy]], the final of the eight conditions that Egbert et al. (2007) cite as "Conditions for Optimal Language Learning Environments". Learner autonomy places the learner firmly in control so that he or she "decides on learning goals" (Egbert et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;8).&lt;ref&gt;Egbert J., Chao C.-C., &amp; Hanson-Smith E. (2007) Introduction: Foundations for Teaching and Learning. In Egbert J. &amp; E. Hanson-Smith (eds.) '' CALL environments: Research, practice, and critical issues '' (2nd edition). Alexandria, VA: TESOL. (pp. 1-14).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is all too easy when designing CALL software to take the comfortable route and produce a set of multiple-choice and gap-filling exercises, using a simple authoring tool (Bangs 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Bangs P. (2011) Introduction to CALL authoring programs. Module 2.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but CALL is much more than this; Stepp-Greany (2002), for example, describes the creation and management of an environment incorporating a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] and [[whole language]] philosophy. According to constructivist theory, learners are active participants in tasks in which they "construct" new knowledge derived from their prior experience. Learners also assume responsibility for their learning, and the teacher is a facilitator rather than a purveyor of knowledge. Whole language theory embraces constructivism and postulates that language learning moves from the whole to the part, rather than building sub-skills to lead towards the higher abilities of comprehension, speaking, and writing. It also emphasises that comprehending, speaking, reading, and writing skills are interrelated, reinforcing each other in complex ways. Language acquisition is, therefore, an active process in which the learner focuses on cues and meaning and makes intelligent guesses. Additional demands are placed upon teachers working in a technological environment incorporating constructivist and whole language theories. The development of teachers’ professional skills must include new pedagogical as well as technical and management skills. Regarding the issue of teacher facilitation in such an environment, the teacher has a key role to play, but there could be a conflict between the aim to create an atmosphere for learner independence and the teacher's natural feelings of responsibility. In order to avoid learners’ negative perceptions, Stepp-Greany points out that it is especially important for the teacher to continue to address their needs, especially those of low-ability learners.&lt;ref name=steppgreany&gt;Stepp-Greany J. (2002) "Student perceptions on language learning in a technological environment: implications for the new millennium", ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 6, 1: 165-180 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol6num1/steppgreany/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia==

Language teachers have been avid users of technology for a very long time. Gramophone records were among the first technological aids to be used by language teachers in order to present students with recordings of native speakers’ voices, and broadcasts from foreign radio stations were used to make recordings on reel-to-reel tape recorders. Other examples of technological aids that have been used in the foreign language classroom include slide projectors, film-strip projectors, film projectors, videocassette recorders and DVD players. In the early 1960s, integrated courses (which were often described as multimedia courses) began to appear. Examples of such courses are ''Ecouter et Parler'' (consisting of a coursebook and tape recordings)&lt;ref&gt;Côté D., Narins Levy S. &amp; O'Connor P. (1962) ''Ecouter et Parler'', Paris: Librairie Marcel Didier.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Deutsch durch die audiovisuelle Methode'' (consisting of an illustrated coursebook, tape recordings and a film-strip – based on the Structuro-Global Audio-Visual method).&lt;ref&gt;Burgdorf I. Montani K., Z. Skreb Z. &amp; Vidovic M. (1962) ''Deutsch durch die audio-visuelle Methode'', New York: Holt Rinehart and Winston 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s standard microcomputers were incapable of producing sound and they had poor graphics capability. This represented a step backwards for language teachers, who by this time had become accustomed to using a range of different media in the foreign language classroom. The arrival of the multimedia computer in the early 1990s was therefore a major breakthrough as it enabled text, images, sound and video to be combined in one device and the integration of the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing (Davies 2011: Section 1).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm&gt;Davies G. (2011) Introduction to multimedia CALL. Module 2.2 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers'' (ICT4LT), Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of CALL programs for multimedia computers that were published on CD-ROM and DVD from the mid-1990s onwards are described by Davies (2010: Section 3).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt; CALL programs are still being published on CD-ROM and DVD, but Web-based multimedia CALL has now virtually supplanted these media.

Following the arrival of multimedia CALL, multimedia language centres began to appear in educational institutions. While multimedia facilities offer many opportunities for language learning with the integration of text, images, sound and video, these opportunities have often not been fully utilised. One of the main promises of CALL is the ability to individualise learning but, as with the language labs that were introduced into educational institutions in the 1960s and 1970s, the use of the facilities of multimedia centres has often devolved into rows of students all doing the same drills (Davies 2010: Section 3.1).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt; There is therefore a danger that multimedia centres may go the same way as the language labs. Following a boom period in the 1970s, language labs went rapidly into decline. Davies (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;28) lays the blame mainly on the failure to train teachers to use language labs, both in terms of operation and in terms of developing new methodologies, but there were other factors such as poor reliability, lack of materials and a lack of good ideas.&lt;ref name=davieslessons&gt;Davies G. (1997) "Lessons from the past, lessons for the future: 20 years of CALL". In Korsvold A-K. &amp; Rüschoff B. (eds.) ''New technologies in language learning and teaching'', Strasbourg: Council of Europe, p. 28. Also on the Web in a revised edition (2009): http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/coegdd1.htm/&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing a multimedia language centre requires not only staff who have a knowledge of foreign languages and language teaching methodology but also staff with technical know-how and budget management ability, as well as the ability to combine all these into creative ways of taking advantage of what the technology can offer. A centre manager usually needs assistants for technical support, for managing resources and even the tutoring of students. Multimedia centres lend themselves to self-study and potentially self-directed learning, but this is often misunderstood. The simple existence of a multimedia centre does not automatically lead to students learning independently. Significant investment of time is essential for materials development and creating an atmosphere conducive to self-study. Unfortunately, administrators often have the mistaken belief that buying hardware by itself will meet the needs of the centre, allocating 90% of its budget to hardware and virtually ignoring software and staff training needs (Davies et al. 2011: ''Foreword'').&lt;ref name=daviesmmlc&gt;Davies G., Hamilton R., Weidmann B., Gabel S., Legenhausen L., Meus V. &amp; Myers S. (2011) Managing a multimedia language centre. Module 3.1 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self access language learning centers|Self-access language learning centres]] or independent learning centres have emerged partially independently and partially in response to these issues. In self-access learning, the focus is on developing learner autonomy through varying degrees of self-directed learning, as opposed to (or as a complement to) classroom learning. In many centres learners access materials and manage their learning independently, but they also have access to staff for help. Many self-access centres are heavy users of technology and an increasing number of them are now offering online self-access learning opportunities. Some centres have developed novel ways of supporting language learning outside the context of the language classroom (also called 'language support') by developing software to monitor students' self-directed learning and by offering online support from teachers. Centre managers and support staff may need to have new roles defined for them to support students’ efforts at self-directed learning: v. Mozzon-McPherson &amp; Vismans (2001), who refer to a new job description, namely that of the "language adviser".&lt;ref&gt;Mozzon-McPherson M. &amp; Vismans R. (eds.) (2001) ''Beyond language teaching towards language advising'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==

The emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] (now known simply as "the Web") in the early 1990s marked a significant change in the use of communications technology for all computer users. [[Email]] and other forms of [[electronic communication]] had been in existence for many years, but the launch of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], the first graphical [[Web browser]], in 1993 brought about a radical change in the ways in which we communicate electronically. The launch of the Web in the public arena immediately began to attract the attention of language teachers. Many language teachers were already familiar with the concept of [[hypertext]] on stand-alone computers, which made it possible to set up non-sequential structured reading activities for language learners in which they could point to items of text or images on a page displayed on the computer screen and branch to any other pages, e.g. in a so-called "stack" as implemented in the [[HyperCard]] program on Apple Mac computers. The Web took this one stage further by creating a worldwide hypertext system that enabled the user to branch to different pages on computers anywhere in the world simply by pointing and clicking at a piece of text or an image. This opened up access to thousands of authentic foreign-language websites to teachers and students that could be used in a variety of ways. A problem that arose, however, was that this could lead to a good deal of time-wasting if Web browsing was used in an unstructured way (Davies 1997: pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43),&lt;ref name=davieslessons/&gt; and language teachers responded by developing more structured activities and online exercises (Leloup &amp; Ponterio 2003).&lt;ref&gt;LeLoup J. &amp; Ponterio R. (2003) "Interactive and multimedia techniques in online language lessons: a sampler", ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 7, 3 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol7num3/net/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Davies (2010) lists over 500 websites, where links to online exercises can be found, along with links to online dictionaries and encyclopaedias, concordancers, translation aids and other miscellaneous resources of interest to the language teacher and learner.&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2010) [http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/websites.htm Graham Davies's Favourite Websites]&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the (free) ''[[Hot Potatoes]]'' (Holmes &amp; Arneil) authoring tool, which was first demonstrated publicly at the EUROCALL 1998 conference, made it possible for language teachers to create their own online interactive exercises. Other useful tools are produced by the same authors.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes M. &amp; Arneil S. ''Hot Potatoes'', University of Victoria, Canada. Downloadable from: http://hotpot.uvic.ca: A library of Clipart for use with ''Hot Potatoes'' and other authoring tools is also available at the University of Victoria site: http://hcmc.uvic.ca/clipart/&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days the Web could not compete seriously with [[multimedia]] CALL on CD-ROM and DVD. Sound and video quality was often poor, and interaction was slow. But now the Web has caught up. Sound and video are of high quality and interaction has improved tremendously, although this does depend on sufficient bandwidth being available, which is not always the case, especially in remote rural areas and developing countries. One area in which CD-ROMs and DVDs are still superior is in the presentation of listen/respond/playback activities, although such activities on the Web are continually improving.

Since the early 2000s there has been a boom in the development of so-called [[Web 2.0]] applications. Contrary to popular opinion, Web 2.0 is not a new version of the Web, rather it implies a shift in emphasis from Web browsing, which is essentially a one-way process (from the Web to the end-user), to making use of Web applications in the same way as one uses applications on a desktop computer. It also implies more interaction and sharing. Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 2.1)&lt;ref name=introinternet&gt;Walker R., Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to the Internet. Module 1.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; list the following examples of Web 2.0 applications that language teachers are using:

* Image storage and sharing
* [[Social bookmarking]]
* Discussion lists, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[social networking]]
* [[Chat room]]s, [[MUD]]s, [[MOO]]s and [[MUVE]]s (virtual worlds)
* [[Podcasting]]
* Audio tools
* [[Video sharing]] applications and [[screen capture (disambiguation)|screen capture]] tools (referring to both video screen capture tools and screenshot tools)
* Animation tools – comic strips, movies, etc.
* [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|Mashup]]s
* Blog assisted language learning (BALL)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esp-world.info/Articles_26/push%20button%20publishing%20ward%202004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no doubt that the Web has proved to be a main focus for language teachers, who are making increasingly imaginative use of its wide range of facilities: see Dudeney (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Dudeney G. (2007) ''The Internet and the language classroom'', Second Edition, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. (2008) ''Handbook of research on Web 2.0 and second language learning'', Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, the use of Web 2.0 tools calls for a careful reexamination of the role of the teacher in the classroom (Richardson 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Richardson W. (2006) ''Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and the Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms''. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corpora and concordancers==

Corpora have been used for many years as the basis of linguistic research and also for the compilation of dictionaries and reference works such as the Collins Cobuild series, published by HarperCollins.&lt;ref&gt;HarperCollins: http://www.harpercollins.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Tribble &amp; Barlow (2001),&lt;ref&gt;Tribble C. &amp; Barlow M. (eds.) (2001) ''Using corpora in language teaching and learning'', Special Issue, ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 5, 3 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num3/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair J. (ed.) (2004) ''How to use corpora in language teaching'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt; and McEnery &amp; Wilson (2011)&lt;ref name=mcenerywilson&gt;McEnery A. &amp; Wilson A. (2011) Corpus linguistics. Module 3.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; describe a variety of ways in which corpora can be used in language teaching.

An early reference to the use of electronic concordancers in language teaching can be found in Higgins &amp; Johns (1984: pp.&amp;nbsp;88–94),&lt;ref&gt;Higgins J. &amp; Johns T. (1984) ''Computers in language learning'', London: Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; and many examples of their practical use in the classroom are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2010).&lt;ref name = lamyklarskov/&gt;

It was Tim Johns (1991), however, who raised the profile of the use of concordancers in the language classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL).&lt;ref&gt;Johns T. (1991) "From printout to handout: grammar and vocabulary teaching in the context of Data Driven Learning". In Johns T. &amp; King P. (eds.) ''Classroom concordancing'', Special issue of ''ELR Journal'' 4, University of Birmingham, Centre for English Language Studies: 27-45.&lt;/ref&gt; DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of concordancers and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2011).&lt;ref name=lamyklarskov&gt;Lamy M-N. &amp; Klarskov Mortensen H. J. (2011) Using concordance programs in the Modern Foreign Languages classroom. Module 2.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Robb (2003) shows how it is possible to use Google as a concordancer, but he also points out a number of drawbacks, for instance there is no control over the educational level, nationality, or other characteristics of the creators of the texts that are found, and the presentation of the examples is not as easy to read as the output of a dedicated concordancer that places the key words (i.e. the search terms) in context.&lt;ref&gt;Robb T. (2003) "Google as a Quick 'n Dirty Corpus Tool", ''TESL-EJ'' 7, 2 [Online]: http://tesl-ej.org/ej26/int.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual worlds==

[[Virtual worlds]] date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example [[Colossal Cave Adventure]], a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. Language teachers discovered that it was possible to exploit these text-only programs by using them as the basis for discussion. Jones G. (1986) describes an experiment based on the Kingdom simulation, in which learners played roles as members of a council governing an imaginary kingdom. A single computer in the classroom was used to provide the stimulus for discussion, namely simulating events taking place in the kingdom: crop planting time, harvest time, unforeseen catastrophes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = G | year = 1986 | title = Computer simulations in language teaching – the KINGDOM experiment | url = | journal = System | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 179–186 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(86)90007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early adventure games and simulations led on to multi-user variants, which were known as [[MUDs]] (Multi-user domains). Like their predecessors, MUDs were text-only, with the difference that they were available to a wider online audience. MUDs then led on to [[MOO]]s (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding: see Donaldson &amp; Kötter (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Kötter | first2 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Language learning in cyberspace: teleporting the classroom into the target culture | url = | journal = CALICO Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 531–558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (Shield 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. (2003) "MOO as a language learning tool". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major breakthrough in the history of virtual worlds was the graphical user interface. [[Habitat (video game)|Lucasfilm's Habitat]] (1986), was one of the first virtual worlds that was graphically based, albeit only in a two-dimensional environment. Each participant was represented by a visual avatar who could interact with other avatars using text chat.

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as Traveler and [[Active Worlds]], both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. Traveler included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars who were represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of Active Worlds as an arena for constructivist learning.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson P. (2003) "Virtual worlds as arenas for language learning". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D world of [[Second Life]] was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another [[role-playing game]] (RPG), it began to attract the interest of language teachers with the launch of the first of the series of SLanguages conferences in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;SLanguages: http://www.slanguages.net/home.php&lt;/ref&gt; Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 14.2.1)&lt;ref name=introinternet/&gt; and Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2010)&lt;ref name=molka&gt;Molka-Danielsen, J. &amp; Deutschmann, M. (eds.) (2009) ''Learning and teaching in the virtual world of Second Life'', Trondheim, Norway: Tapir Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a number of experiments and projects that focus on language learning in Second Life. See also the Wikipedia article [[Virtual world language learning]].

To what extent Second Life and other virtual worlds will become established as important tools for teachers of foreign languages remains to be seen. It has been argued by Dudeney (2010) in his ''That's Life'' blog that Second Life is "too demanding and too unreliable for most educators". The subsequent discussion shows that this view is shared by many teachers, but many others completely disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Second Life – The Long Goodbye: http://slife.dudeney.com/?p=446&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the pros and cons of Second Life, language teachers’ interest in virtual worlds continues to grow. The joint EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group: http://virtualworldssig.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2009, and there are now many areas in Second Life that are dedicated to language learning and teaching, for example the commercial area for learners of English, which is managed by Language Lab,&lt;ref&gt;LanguageLab: http://www.languagelab.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and free areas such as the region maintained by the Goethe-Institut&lt;ref&gt;Goethe-Institut: http://www.goethe.de/frm/sec/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the EduNation Islands.&lt;ref&gt;EduNation Islands: http://edunation-islands.wikispaces.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of simulations created specifically for language education, such as those produced by the EC-funded NIFLAR&lt;ref&gt;Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research (NIFLAR): http://niflar.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; and AVALON&lt;ref&gt;Access to Virtual and Action Learning live ONline (AVALON): http://avalon-project.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; projects. NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|Opensim]].

==Human language technologies==

Human language technologies (HLT) comprise a number of areas of research and development that focus on the use of technology to facilitate communication in a multilingual information society. Human language technologies are areas of activity in departments of the European Commission that were formerly grouped under the heading [[language engineering]] (Gupta &amp; Schulze 2011: Section 1.1).&lt;ref name=guptaschulze&gt;Gupta P. &amp; Schulze M. (2011) Human Language Technologies (HLT). Module 3.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts of HLT that is of greatest interest to the language teacher is [[natural language processing]] (NLP), especially [[parsing]], as well as the areas of [[speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]].

Speech synthesis has improved immeasurably in recent years. It is often used in electronic dictionaries to enable learners to find out how words are pronounced. At word level, speech synthesis is quite effective, the artificial voice often closely resembling a human voice. At phrase level and sentence level, however, there are often problems of intonation, resulting in speech production that sounds unnatural even though it may be intelligible. Speech synthesis as embodied in [[text to speech]] (TTS) applications is invaluable as a tool for unsighted or partially sighted people. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 4.1) list several examples of speech synthesis applications.&lt;ref name=guptaschulze/&gt;

Speech recognition is less advanced than speech synthesis. It has been used in a number of CALL programs, in which it is usually described as [[automatic speech recognition]] (ASR). ASR is not easy to implement. Ehsani &amp; Knodt (1998) summarise the core problem as follows:

"Complex cognitive processes account for the human ability to associate acoustic signals with meanings and intentions. For a computer, on the other hand, speech is essentially a series of digital values. However, despite these differences, the core problem of speech recognition is the same for both humans and machines: namely, of finding the best match between a given speech sound and its corresponding word string. Automatic speech recognition technology attempts to simulate and optimize this process computationally."&lt;ref name=ehsaniknodt&gt;Ehsani F. &amp; Knodt E. (1998) "Speech technology in computer-aided language learning: strengths and limitations of a new CALL paradigm", ''Language Learning and Technology'' 2, 1: 45–60 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol2num1/article3/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs embodying ASR normally provide a native speaker model that the learner is requested to imitate, but the matching process is not 100% reliable and may result in a learner's perfectly intelligible attempt to pronounce a word or phrase being rejected (Davies 2010: Section 3.4.6 and Section 3.4.7).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt;

Parsing is used in a number of ways in CALL. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 5) describe how parsing may be used to analyse sentences, presenting the learner with a tree diagram that labels the constituent parts of speech of a sentence and shows the learner how the sentence is structured.&lt;ref name=guptaschulze/&gt;

Parsing is also used in CALL programs to analyse the learner's input and diagnose errors. Davies (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2002) Article on CALL in the ''Good Practice Guide'' at the website of the Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies (LLAS), University of Southampton [Online]: http://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/61&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

"Discrete error analysis and feedback were a common feature of traditional CALL, and the more sophisticated programs would attempt to analyse the learner's response, pinpoint errors, and branch to help and remedial activities. ... Error analysis in CALL is, however, a matter of controversy. Practitioners who come into CALL via the disciplines of [[computational linguistics]], e.g. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human Language Technologies (HLT), tend to be more optimistic about the potential of error analysis by computer than those who come into CALL via language teaching. [...] An alternative approach is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to parse the learner's response – so-called ''intelligent CALL'' (ICALL) – but there is a gulf between those who favour the use of AI to develop CALL programs (Matthews 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matthews | first1 = C | year = 1994 | title = Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning as cognitive science: the choice of syntactic frameworks for language tutoring | url = | journal = Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 533–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the other extreme, those who perceive this approach as a threat to humanity (Last 1989:153)".&lt;ref&gt;Last R.W. (1989) ''Artificial intelligence techniques in language learning'', Chichester: Ellis Horwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Underwood | first1 = J | year = 1989 | title = On the edge: Intelligent CALL in the 1990s | url = | journal = Computers and the Humanities | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 71–84 | doi=10.1007/bf00058770}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heift &amp; Schulze (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Heift T. &amp; Schulze M. (eds.) (2007) ''Errors and intelligence in CALL: parsers and pedagogues'', New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; present a more positive picture of AI.

Research into speech synthesis, speech recognition and parsing and how these areas of NLP can be used in CALL are the main focus of the NLP Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL NLP Special Interest Group: http://siglp.eurocall-languages.org/&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[European Association for Computer-Assisted Language Learning|EUROCALL]] professional association and the ICALL Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;CALICO ICALL Special Interest Group: http://purl.org/calico/icall&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]] professional association. The EUROCALL NLP SIG also maintains a Ning.&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL NLP Special Interest Group Ning: http://nlpsig.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The question of the impact of CALL in language learning and teaching has been raised at regular intervals ever since computers first appeared in educational institutions (Davies &amp; Hewer 2011: Section 3).&lt;ref name=ict4ltmod11&gt;Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to new technologies and how they can contribute to language learning and teaching. Module 1.1 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Recent large-scale impact studies include the study edited by Fitzpatrick &amp; Davies (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick A. &amp; Davies G. (eds.) (2003) ''The impact of Information and Communications Technologies on the teaching of foreign languages and on the role of teachers of foreign languages'', EC Directorate General of Education and Culture.&lt;/ref&gt; and the EACEA (2009) study,&lt;ref&gt;Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission (2009) ''Study on the impact of ICT and new media on language learning'' [Online]: http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/studies/study_impact_ict_new_media_language_learning_en.php&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were produced for the European Commission.

A distinction needs to be made between the impact and the effectiveness of CALL. Impact may be measured quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the uptake and use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] in teaching foreign languages, issues of availability of hardware and software, budgetary considerations, Internet access, teachers’ and learners' attitudes to the use of CALL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=mahmoudi|first=elham|title=Attitude and student's performance in Computer Assisted English Language Learning (CALL) for Learning Vocabulary|journal=procedia social and behavioral science|date=June 30, 2012|volume=66|pages=489–498|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812052780|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.11.293}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes in the ways in which languages are learnt and taught, and paradigm shifts in teachers’ and learners’ roles. Effectiveness, on the other hand, usually focuses on assessing to what extent ICT is a more effective way of teaching foreign languages compared to using traditional methods – and this is more problematic as so many variables come into play. Worldwide, the picture of the impact of CALL is extremely varied. Most developed nations work comfortably with the new technologies, but developing nations are often beset with problems of costs and broadband connectivity. Evidence on the effectiveness of CALL – as with the impact of CALL – is extremely varied and many research questions still need to be addressed and answered. Hubbard (2002) presents the results of a CALL research survey that was sent to 120 CALL professionals from around the world asking them to articulate a CALL research question they would like to see answered. Some of the questions have been answered but many more remain open.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard P. (2002) ''Survey of unanswered questions in Computer Assisted Language Learning: Effectiveness issues'' [Online]: http://www.stanford.edu/~efs/callsurvey/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Leakey (2011) offers an overview of current and past research in CALL and proposes a comprehensive model for evaluating the effectiveness of CALL platforms, programs and pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Leakey J. (2011) ''Evaluating Computer Assisted Language Learning: an integrated approach to effectiveness research in CALL'', Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

A crucial issue is the extent to which the computer is perceived as taking over the teacher's role. Warschauer (1996: p.&amp;nbsp;6) perceived the computer as playing an "intelligent" role, and claimed that a computer program "should ideally be able to understand a user's spoken input and evaluate it not just for correctness but also for appropriateness. It should be able to diagnose a student's problems with pronunciation, syntax, or usage and then intelligently decide among a range of options (e.g. repeating, paraphrasing, slowing down, correcting, or directing the student to background explanations)."&lt;ref name=warschauer96/&gt; Jones C. (1986), on the other hand, rejected the idea of the computer being "some kind of inferior teacher-substitute" and proposed a methodology that focused more on what teachers could do with computer programs rather than what computer programs could do on their own: "in other words, treating the computer as they would any other classroom aid".&lt;ref name=jones86&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = C | year = 1986 | title = It's not so much the program: more what you do with it: the importance of methodology in CALL | url = | journal = System | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 171–178 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(86)90006-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warschauer's high expectations in 1996 have still not been fulfilled, and currently there is an increasing tendency for teachers to go down the route proposed by Jones, making use of a variety of new tools such as [[#Corpora and concordancers|corpora and concordancers]], interactive whiteboards&lt;ref name= schmidcutrim2009/&gt; and applications for online communication.&lt;ref name= lamyhampel/&gt;

Since the advent of the Web there has been an explosion in online learning, but to what extent it is effective is open to criticism. Felix (2003) takes a critical look at popular myths attached to online learning from three perspectives, namely administrators, teachers and students. She concludes: "That costs can be saved in this ambitious enterprise is clearly a myth, as are expectations of saving time or replacing staff with machines."&lt;ref&gt;Felix U.

As for the effectiveness of CALL in promoting the four skills, Felix (2008) claims that there is "enough data in CALL to suggest positive effects on spelling, reading and writing", but more research is needed in order to determine its effectiveness in other areas, especially speaking online. She claims that students' perceptions of CALL are positive, but she qualifies this claim by stating that the technologies need to be stable and well supported, drawing attention to concerns that technical problems may interfere with the learning process. She also points out that older students may not feel comfortable with computers and younger students may not possess the necessary metaskills for coping effectively in the challenging new environments. Training in computer literacy for both students and teachers is essential, and time constraints may pose additional problems. In order to achieve meaningful results she recommends "time-series analysis in which the same group of students is involved in experimental and control treatment for a certain amount of time and then switched – more than once if possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix | first1 = U | year = 2008 | title = The unreasonable effectiveness of CALL: what have we learned in two decades of research? | url = | journal = ReCALL | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 141–161 | doi=10.1017/s0958344008000323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of technology training in CALL for language teaching professionals certainly vary. Within second language teacher education programs, namely pre-service course work, we can find "online courses along with face-to-face courses", computer technology incorporated into a more general second language education course, "technology workshops","a series of courses offered throughout the teacher education programs, and even courses specifically designed for a CALL certificate and a CALL graduate degree"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = K.

There is a rapidly growing interest in resources about the use of technology to deliver CALL. Journals that have issues that "deal with how teacher education programs help prepare language teachers to use technology in their own classrooms" include ''Language Learning and Technology'' (2002), ''Innovations in Language Learning and Teaching'' (2009) and the TESOL international professional association's publication of technology standards for TESOL includes a chapter on preparation of teacher candidates in technology use, as well as the upgrading of teacher educators to be able to provide such instruction. Both CALICO and EUROCALL have special interest groups for teacher education in CALL.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D. E. (2013) A Case for Online English Language Teacher Education.

'''Declarative learning''' is acquiring information that one can speak about (contrast with [[motor learning]]).  The capital of a state is a declarative piece of information, while knowing how to ride a bike is not.  [[Episodic memory]] and [[semantic memory]] are a further division of declarative information.

==Overview==
There are two ways to learn a telephone number: memorize it using your declarative memory, or use it many times to create a habit. Habit learning is called [[procedural memory]]

Declarative memory uses your [[medial temporal lobe]] and enables you to recall the telephone number at will. Procedural memory activates the telephone number only when you are at the telephone, and uses your right-hemisphere's skill, [[Pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]].

Research indicates declarative and habit memory compete with each other during distraction{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.  When in doubt, the brain chooses habit memory because it is automatic.

Several researchers at the [[UCLA]] tested the hypothesis that distraction can change the way a task is learned. In their experiment, they played a series of high and low tones while asking subjects to do a simple probabilistic classification task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poldrack|first=Russell|title=Probabilistic classification task|url=http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/task/Probabilistic_classification_task|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the single task (ST) case, subjects only learned to predict the weather. In the dual task (DT) case, subjects were also asked to count the number of high pitched tones. The ability to use the learned knowledge was found to be about the same in either case. However, subjects were significantly better at identifying cue-associations (a test of declarative knowledge) when trained under ST rather than DT conditions. Furthermore, [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] showed activity in the [[hippocampus]] was associated with performance under ST, but not DT conditions, whereas activity in the [[putamen]] showed the opposite correlation. The authors concluded that while distraction may not decrease the level of learning, it can result in a reduced ability to flexibly use that knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poldrack|first=Russell A. |author2=Foerde, Karin |author3=Knowlton, Barbara J.|title=Modulation of competing memory systems by distraction|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1 August 2006|volume=103|issue=31|pages=11778–11783|doi=10.1073/pnas.0602659103|pmid=16868087|pmc=1544246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical evidence==
Declarative learning is an important skill that we use to acquire new information, such as in education. Declarative learning can be seen as what we know, for example we know that Paris is the capital of France.

===Children===

Sleep deprivation and learning have continually been linked together. The common belief is that sleep deprivation can affect children when they are learning at school or in any daily task. However, different types of learning are processed differently and have different outcomes when a child is sleep deprived. A study conducted by Csabi, Benedk, Janacesk, Katona and Nemeth&lt;ref name="Csábi"&gt;Csábi, E., Benedek, P., Janacsek, K., Katona, G., &amp; Nemeth, D. (2013). Sleep disorder in childhood impairs declarative but not nondeclarative forms of learning. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 35(7), 677-685. {{DOI|10.1080/13803395.2013.815693}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the impairment of declarative and nondeclarative learning when a child is sleep deprived. Nondeclarative learning was measured by having children perform an Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task. This task had a dog's head appear in four empty circles. Every time the dog's head appeared the child had to press the corresponding letter as quickly and correctly as possible. Declarative learning was measured by "The War of the Ghosts" test, which is a recall test where the children were told a short story consisting of thirty-six sentences and had to then recall it immediately after hearing it. The study showed that nondeclarative learning was preserved and not affected when sleep deprived children took the ASRT task. However, declarative learning greatly declined in the face of sleep-deprivation.&lt;ref name="Csábi" /&gt; Declarative Learning can be associated with tasks that require a greater amount of attention, such as learning in school. Therefore, the lack of sleep a child obtains can affect declarative learning and can affect how well a child learns during school overall.

Research focusing on children has also looked at different ways of utilizing declarative learning when it comes to memorizing tasks. Backhaus, Hoeckesfeld, Born, Hohagen, and Junghanns &lt;ref name=Backhaus&gt;Backhaus, J., Hoeckesfeld, R., Born, J., Hohagen, F., &amp; Junghanss, K. (2007, June). Immediate as well as delayed post learning sleep but not wakefulness enhances declarative memory consolidation in children. Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. Retrieved October 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study to see if sleeping after a task enhances declarative learning in children. Children between the ages of nine and twelve were given a word association task consisting of forty related word pairs. The lists of words were repeated continuously until the child participating could recall at least twenty words out of the forty given. The child was allowed to go to sleep for the night and was tested for recall right after they had woken up. The child was then asked to go about their day and was tested for recall later during the day. The study showed that declarative learning, memory and retention significantly increased only after an interval of sleep that immediately followed learning.&lt;ref name=Backhaus/&gt; This research provides evidence of sleep in the role of declarative learning, sleep consolidation, as well as stresses the importance of sleep for declarative learning during childhood.

===Adults===

Declarative learning is not solely affected by sleeping but can also be affected by levels of stress as well as hormones. In a study conducted by Espin et al.&lt;ref name=Espin&gt;Espin, L., Almela, M., Hidalgo, V., Villada, C., Salvador, A., &amp; Gomez, J. (2013, May 13). Acute pre-learning stress and declarative memory: impact of sex, cortisol response and menstrual cycle phase. Hormones and Behavior, 63(5). {{DOI| 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; stress, hormones and menstrual cycle phases in women, were tested for their effect on declarative learning in young adults. Participants were asked to participate in a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) where they were asked to give a speech to a simulated committee about why they deserved the position for their dream job. If the participant did not finish their speech in five minutes the committee would then ask standardized questions the researchers had provided. After the speech the participant was asked to complete a five-minute arithmetic task. The TSST was set up to induce stress in the participants before they proceeded to the declarative learning task. For the Declarative Learning task the participants were asked to complete a Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT), which has the participants look over a set of words and then asks them to recall as many as they can.  The study showed that if women were not exposed to the TSST task before the RAVLT there was an increase of declarative learning and recall when compared to the men. However, when the participants were exposed to the TSST task before the RAVLT then declarative learning and recall were equal for both men and women. Women during the study that were menstruating and exposed to the TSST task showed lower levels of stress than women not menstruating, they also had an increase of declarative learning and recall when compared to men and women not menstruating  
.&lt;ref name=Espin/&gt; The study not only shows that sex hormones could reduce stress in women but also that stress can have a negative effect on declarative learning.  This could affect the capability of students learning and passing their classes and also the ability to be able to complete tasks in the work place.

Sleep benefits declarative learning across a range of tasks for children and young adults, however little is known of the role that sleep plays for adults when it comes to declarative learning. A study conducted by Wilson, Baran, Schott, Ivry and Spencer &lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, J., Baran, B., Schott, E., Ivry, R., &amp; Spencer, R. (2007, June). Sleep modulates word-pair learning but not motor sequence learning in healthy older adults. Neurobiology of Aging, 33(5). {{DOI|10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2011.06.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to see if sleep plays an important role in declarative learning and motor skill learning in adults. Participants were given two tasks to assess motor skill learning and another to assess declarative learning. The participants learned a motor sequence and list of word pairs during either the morning or evening. Memory tests were given to the participants twice, at twelve and twenty-four hours after training. This gap allowed for a period of sleep, a recall test, a period of normal wake, and a recall test. The study results showed that motor skills were not dependent on sleep. However, declarative learning tasks and recall increased when the participants slept before the recall test. The study also showed that a change in sleep patterns and networks activated during sleep may contribute to age related decline in motor sequences but does not affect declarative learning.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; This study shows that even though the role of sleep may change throughout age it is still very important to declarative learning regardless of age.	

Another aspect of research is seeing the importance of declarative learning in both implicit and explicit learning tasks. In a study conducted by Matthew Kirkhart &lt;ref&gt;Kirkhart, M. W. (2001). The Nature of Declarative Knowledge and Nondeclarative Knowledge for Implicit and Explicit Learning. General Psychology, 128(4), 447-461.&lt;/ref&gt; undergraduate participants underwent implicit and explicit artificial-grammar learning tasks to see how declarative learning functioned in each. For the Implicit task participants where told that they would see a series of letter strings, a group of letters that appear in a word, and had to judge if the string were well formed or not well formed. For the Explicit task participants were told they had to reproduce letter strings according to a set of rules, which they had to determine and would be tested on later. The participants where then shown a series of letter strings and asked if they followed the rules or not. The results showed that declarative learning was not required for implicit learning but was related to the consistency in performance. It was seen, however, that declarative learning is required for explicit learning and consistency of performance. This shows that adults are using declarative learning when undergoing explicit tasks, such as memorizing formulas for statistics class. This research provides more evidence of the importance of declarative learning in education for not just children but for adults as well.

Interest in combining education with entertainment, especially in order to make learning more enjoyable, has existed for hundreds of years, with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] being movements in which this combination was presented to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Edutainment or Education: Education Possibilities of Didactic Games in Science Education|format=pdf|date=September 2007|location=Brno, Czech Republic|url=http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|access-date=12 April 2017|editor=Němec, J.|pages=55–64|conference=ICCP Brno Conference|last1=Trna|first1=Josef|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817210858/http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Amos Comenius|Komenský]] in particular is affiliated with the “school as play” concept, which proposes [[pedagogy]] with dramatic or delightful elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Poor Richard's Almanack|''Poor Richard’s Almanack'']] demonstrates early implementation of edutainment, with [[Benjamin Franklin]] combining entertaining and educational content, such as puzzles and rules of conduct, into an instructional entity for colonists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|title=Turning to Education for Fun|last=Beato|first=Greg|date=2015-03-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-12|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105130008/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|archivedate=2017-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later development of the concept of edutainment can be tied to [[Walt Disney]], with his first educational short film, [[Tommy Tucker's Tooth|''Tommy Tucker’s Tooth'']], being commissioned and shot in 1922 for the Deneer Dental Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Diane Disney (1957).

Modern forms of edutainment include television productions, film, museum exhibits, and computer software which use entertainment to attract and maintain an audience, while incorporating deliberate educational content or messages. It is also apparent that educational elements are becoming implemented into traditionally recreational realms, such as vacations and games.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Terminology ===
The term edutainment was used as early as 1954 by [[Walt Disney]] to describe the ''[[True Life Adventures]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DISNEY|first=WALT|date=1954-01-01|title=EDUCATIONAL VALUES IN FACTUAL NATURE PICTURES|jstor=42922993|journal=Educational Horizons|volume=33|issue=2|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noun]] ''edutainment'' is a [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] used by Robert Heyman in 1973 while producing documentaries for the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Marta Rey-López et al. A Model for Personalized Learning. In: Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems. Springer. Berlin. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by Dr. Chris Daniels in 1975 to encapsulate the theme of his Millennium Project. This project later became known as The Elysian World Project.&lt;ref name="elysianworld2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elysianworld.com|title=Elysian World|publisher=elysianworld.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217052758/http://elysianworld.com/|archivedate=December 17, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offshoot word "Edutainer" has been used by Craig Sim Webb since before the turn of the millennium to describe an individual who offers edutainment presentations and performances.&lt;ref name="edutainer2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutainer.ca|title=Inspirational speakers – Professional Inspirational Speaker, Performer, Songwriter &amp; Author|publisher=edutainer.ca|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027001013/http://edutainer.ca/|archivedate=October 27, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==

=== Audio and video ===
''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' are examples of shows that use [[music]] and video to teach topics like math, science, and history. Using music to aid memory dates back to the passing of ancient oral traditions, including the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Much of what edutainment can offer through audio and video especially, is accessible over the internet on platforms such as [[YouTube]], with such channels as ''[[Vsauce]]'', ''[[CGP Grey]]'', ''[[MinutePhysics]]'', ''Meet Arnold, ''[[Veritasium]]'', and ''[[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]]''.

[[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]] is a band that incorporates audio and footage from the [[British Film Institute]] into their music and performances, and this partnership helps the British Film Institute showcase its material; their album ''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|Inform—Educate—Entertain]]''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|,]] which covers topics such as the climbing of [[Mount Everest]] and [[highway safety]], demonstrates the connection between the concept of edutainment and their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|title=The Archival Delights of Public Service Broadcasting|date=2015-02-24|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422133120/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|archivedate=2017-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film and television ===
{{Main|Educational television}}

Motion pictures with educational content appeared as early as 1943, such as ''[[Private Snafu]]'', and can still be seen in films such as ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. After [[World War II]], educational entertainment shifted towards television. Television programs can be divided into three main categories: those with primarily educational intentions, those with a high degree of both education and entertainment, and entertainment shows with incidental or occasional educational value.

Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s a form of edutainment via [[telenovelas]], "soap operas for social change". The "Sabido  method" has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, "Life Lessons: How Soap Operas Can Change the World", ''The New Yorker'', June 5, 2006, pp. 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, the government in the 1970s successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning to curb the country's high birthrate.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world." ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy''. September 2007, vol. 4,, no. 3 pp. 19-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third season of the television show ''MTV Shuga'' was analyzed by researchers and then published online in 2017 in terms of its effects related to its goal of educating African youth about [[Sexual Health|sexual health]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV]], and secondarily, [[Gender based violence|gender-based violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|title=MTV Shuga Soap Opera Turns Edutainment into a Tool to Fight HIV and Gender-Based Violence|last=|first=|date=2017-02-27|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422212033/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|archive-date=2017-04-22|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]], those in the treatment group who watched the show for six months were “almost twice as likely” to get tested at HIV testing centers; mixed results were found in regards to the show’s effects on gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|title=EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF MTV SHUGA: CHANGING SOCIAL NORMS AND BEHAVIORS WITH ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit|last2=La Ferrara|first2=Eliana|date=2017|website=World Bank|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174725/http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-15|dead-url=no|access-date=|last3=Orozco|first3=Victor|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article [["Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning"]] Walt Disney believed in education through the entertainment of film and television. He is known as the master of communications who brought both entertainment and education into the world in distinctive ways. His creation of mickey mouse and his adventures taught his audience that life is not always so simple, there will be obstacles that will stand in your way. Mickey mouse's is unpolished and imperfect which make him so realistic to his audience. In many of his stories we see him battle and adventure which he overcomes teach a value in life for viewers, keep going in life. Disney achieved and educational characteristic in his work through the picture series of live animals in their natural habitat by which some film techniques added to the drama of the series. This series was one that satisfied Walt Disney the most as it obtained both the qualities of entertainment and education, which was the characteristics of this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1491447|title=Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning|first=Ralph S.|last=Izard|date=12 May 1967|publisher=|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=45|issue=1|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Educating the public about health issues is a focus for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, several initiatives have used educational entertainment principles to highlight specific conditions or wider healthcare issues. Examples include In Memory about dementia,&lt;ref name="HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY"&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY|url=https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|website=Bedrock|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022823/https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millefeuille about psoriasis&lt;ref name="Millefeuille"&gt;{{cite web|title=Millefeuille|url=http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|website=Millefeuille|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030657/http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and This is Axiom about the challenges facing the UK's National Health Service.&lt;ref name="This is Axiom"&gt;{{cite web|title=This is Axiom|url=http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|website=This is Axiom|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020639/http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
{{Main|Educational game}}

Games fulfill a number of educational purposes. Some games may be explicitly designed with education in mind, while others may have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games, including [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and video games, may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.

According to Paraskeva (2010), at least 68% of American households play video games. Many recent research articles postulate education and gaming can be joined to provide academic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paraskeva | first1 = F. | last2 = Mysirlaki | first2 = S. | last3 = Papgianni | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Multiplayer online games as educational tools: Facing new challenges in learning | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131509002413 | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 498–505 | doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Van Eck (2006), there are three reasons why games are considered learning tools: 1. Ongoing research that has included the last 20 years of educational findings have proven that digital games can be educational; 2. The new generation of today wants "multiple streams of information" (p.&amp;nbsp;1), which includes quick and frequent interaction that allows inductive reasoning; and 3. The mere popularity of games has created a billion-dollar industry. The idea of playing a game assumes the person is engaging in that activity by choice. The activity should have some value of "fun". This does not mean that the person is engaging in the activity only for leisure pursuits; it can also include the desire to learn a skill, connect with other gamers (social community), and spend time in a chosen activity. The activity needs to remain one of choice for the gamer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Eck|first=R.|year=2006|title=Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless...|publisher=Educase Review|volume=41|issue=2|pages=1–16|url=http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229182518/http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|archivedate=2016-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim (2008) supports the use of off-the-shelf games with [[Metacognition|meta-cognitive]] strategies to provide an increase in students' cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, B., Park, H., &amp; Baek, Y. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers and Education, 52, 800-810&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio and podcasts ===

[[Radio]] can serve as an effective vehicle for educational entertainment. The British radio soap opera ''[[The Archers]]'' has for decades been systematically educating its audience on agricultural matters; likewise, the [[Tanzania]]n radio soap opera ''Twende na Wakati'' ("Let's Go With the Times") was written primarily to promote [[family planning]].

Likewise, [[podcast]]s have begun to exemplify the concept of edutainment, with some radio programs also becoming available in this digital format. Not only are there are series with educational elements that are listened to recreationally, but there are also [[Uses of podcasting#Education and academia|podcasts used as an educational tool]]. Lessons based on podcasts have increased in popularity, with [[Teacherspayteachers.com|''TeachersPayTeachers'']] finding that lesson plans relating to podcasts rose in downloads by 21 percent and 650 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, which corresponded with the release of ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|title=Using 'Serial' to Get Students to Read More|last=Godsey|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209125945/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|archivedate=2017-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toys ===
{{Main|Educational toy}}

Toys are perhaps the earliest "edutainment" objects a person encounters, as many toys have also an educational aspect beside their [[aesthetic]] appeal. They can teach children literacy, numerical, conceptual or motor skills. Many toys (e.g., a miniature [[piano]]) are simply colorful, scaled-down versions of more complex objects, and thus can base children in skills and benefits associated with the latter. It is up to grown-ups to guide children to the toy's proper use in order to make the most out of it.

Toys are often employed in the context of [[mimicry]] and [[roleplay]] to partially experience personalities or situations not otherwise possible, very akin to [[simulation]] in video games. They can be used as primitive means to nurture an [[instinct]] or a [[character trait]] in children. Often, toys work simultaneously the other way, providing children with the means to ''express'' those things: a doll may be used by a girl to mimic her mother or express [[motherhood]] as much as to explore it.

Even for toys that don't possess explicit educational value, a thoughtful parent or teacher can turn a static [[figurine]], for example, into an object of interest, by pointing out its features or costumes, or referring to its history or science (e.g., a figurine of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] may be a starting point for exploring American history; a [[Santa Claus]] may be used to explore the roots of Christmas; a toy [[astronaut]] to explore science...), which can be done in conjunction with a more-explicitly "edutaining" object, such as a [[picture book]]. Most children are naturally inquisitive (possibly why they sometimes break their toys; simply to know what is inside or how it moves or what produces that sound), and caregivers should not waste this opportunity.

Even ''grown-ups'' can learn through toys about children: what are their [[Aptitude|talents]] or interests; if they are more [[extrovert]] or [[introvert]]; indeed if they dislike toys and prefer social activities or sport, and thus capitalize on the children's abilities and correct what is wrong or lacking.

Some toys are of considerable appeal and benefit to both children and adults, such as [[Lego]] or [[Rubik's Cube]], as their design and implementation can range from the simple to the sophisticated.

=== Hip hop culture ===
The term "edutainment" was first made popular amongst the hip hop community by [[KRS-One]] (a.k.a. The Teacha) thanks to his [[Boogie Down Productions]] [[Edutainment (album)|album by the same name]].

The term has since been borrowed to describe hip hop culture's innate pedagogical aesthetics. Examples of this include how Hip Hop uniquely combines both thought and action (see [[Paulo Freire]]'s use of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] in ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'') and values both Eurocentric values of rational thought and Afrocentric epistemology of kinetic, affective and emotional ways of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New York|pages=72|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is in the transmission of technical and historical knowledge, the manner in which Hip Hop practitioners learn and exchange by sharing moments of performance together through ''building'' or ''building sessions.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New-York|pages=76–77|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporations ===
The concept of educational entertainment is being used for building learning programs for organizations. High technology is used to make the programs entertaining and educational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|last=Nagy|first=Atilla|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2006|isbn=3-540-25093-X|location=|pages=79–96|chapter=The Impact of E-Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, [[PowerPoint]] presentations may become more entertaining with the addition of flashy animations or graphics. An article in a satirical newspaper, ''[[The Onion]]'', poked fun at the concept of embellishing boring presentations with attention-catching effects.&lt;ref name="Onion2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|title=Wow Factor Added To Corporate Presentation &amp;#124; The Onion – America's Finest News Source|publisher=theonion.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106232425/http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|archivedate=November 6, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional marketing executive in the article noted the previous lack of excitement in the presentation, saying "When we first finished the PowerPoint, the content was all there, but it still lacked that certain something."&lt;ref name="Onion2" /&gt;

=== Theme parks ===
{{Main|Amusement park#Educational theme parks}}
[[File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT.jpg|link=[[:File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT]].jpg|thumb|[[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]], an attraction at [[Epcot]]]]
Theme parks are a specific kind of setting in which the combination of entertaining and educational elements can be prevalent. [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]], which is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], is highly based on edutainment; the park features attractions that teach about the past, conservation, imagination, future technologies, and the world. The park's dedication plaque, written by [[Marty Sklar]] and Erwin Okun, states the following: “May [[EPCOT Center]] entertain, inform and inspire. And above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in man’s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dream It!

The offerings and promotions at [[SeaWorld]] associated with the educational topics of [[marine biology]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and animal rescue efforts are increasing at their current locations and in plans for the upcoming [[SeaWorld Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi theme park]], which is likely due to activism for animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld Shifts to Educational Entertainment, Adds Virtual-Reality Ride; Theme-park moves further away from controversial orca shows|last=Hufford|first=Austen|date=27 September 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal (Online)|access-date=|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld writes a new chapter with first killer whale-free park|last=Lindsay|first=Rowena|date=14 December 2016|work=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=|location=Boston, Mass.|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable theme parks that incorporate educational elements and topics are [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], [[Holy Land Experience]], [[Dinosaur World (theme parks)|Dinosaur World]], [[Busch Gardens]], and [[Puy du Fou]].

=== Museums and public access areas ===

Edutainment is also a growing [[paradigm]] within the [[Science museum|science center]] and [[children's museum]] community in the United States, as well as in many other locations such as the [[zoo]] or a [[botanical garden]]. Educational locations such as these are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to reach the surrounding public and get them interested in areas such as the fine arts, science, literature, and history. Additionally, [[field trip]] visits to these educational places provide participants with interactional stimulus to learn about the content offered there. Since people are used to flashy, polished entertainment venues like movie theaters and theme parks, they demand similar experiences at science centers or museums. Consequently, interactive experiences, such as games and [[mobile app]]s, are implemented in museums in order to more effectively help people learn about what they are seeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ART; TAP AND TOUR; Museums are quietly adapting to the app-happy 'selfie culture'|last=Gelt|first=Jessica|date=25 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museums are also embracing the ability to use storytelling to engage people, especially those who are young, in hopes to increase attendance; all the while, though, it is possible for the focus and purpose of museums to be diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ARENA --- The Museum of The Future --- From 3-D headsets to holograms, new technologies are revolutionizing exhibits; is it entertainment or education?|last=Gamerman|first=Ellen|date=16 October 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=|location=New York, N.Y.|edition= Eastern|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a museum or a zoo can be seen as just another business competing for entertainment dollars from the public, rather than as an institution that serves the public welfare through education or historical preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=High Tech Heretic|last=Stoll|first=Clifford|publisher=Doubleday|year=1999|isbn=0-385-48975-7|location=|pages=485–499|doi=|id=|coauthors=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects in the classroom ==
{{Main|Entertainment in education}}Much research has been done in association with edutainment and its effectiveness in its various forms. Particularly, the effects of the implementation of the concept of edutainment in the classroom setting have been studied on multiple occasions. The concept of [[flipped classroom]]s, in association with edutainment, was studied by Retta Guy and Gerald Marquis (2016), in which students were assigned [[video lesson]]s and podcasts as opposed to projects prior to class; it was found that these students outperformed those in traditional classrooms, found the actual time in class to prompt more interaction, and thought the class to be more enjoyable, although there was a noticeable period of adaption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Retta|last2=Marquis|first2=Gerald|date=2016|title=The Flipped Classroom: A Comparison of Student Performance Using Instructional Videos and Podcasts Versus the Lecture-Based Model of Instruction|url=|journal=Issues in Informing Science &amp; Information Technology|volume= 13|pages= 1–13|issn=1547-5840|doi=10.28945/3461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Ruby Lynch-Arroyo and Joyce Asing-Cashman (2016), ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', which is an example of edutainment in the form of a television show, was integrated into the education of [[Pre-service teacher education|preservice]] mathematics teachers. The subsequent results exemplified the potential for edutainment to promote [[critical thinking]], increased engagement, and [[growth mindset]]s.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Arroyo|first=Ruby|last2=Asing-Cashman|first2=Joyce|date=2016|title=Using Edutainment to Facilitate Mathematical Thinking and Learning: An Exploratory Study|url=http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematics Education|volume=9|pages= 37–52|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817203754/http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Craig D. Cox, ''et al''. (2017) conducted a study in which a mini-series that combined educational and entertaining elements was developed and presented to pharmacy [[preceptor]]s; it was effective in increasing the confidence of the participants and was an honorable mention for the [[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy]] Innovations in Teaching Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Craig D.|last2=Cheon|first2=Jongpil|last3=Crooks|first3=Steven M.|last4=Lee|first4=Jaehoon|date=2017|title=Use of Entertainment Elements in an Online Video Mini-Series to Train Pharmacy Preceptors|url=|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume= 81|issue=1|pages= 1–13|issn=0002-9459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system that incorporated the concept of edutainment through the use of games has also been studied in association with [[Disability|disabled]] students by Amal Dandashi, ''et al''. (2015), and it was found that the system had a positive impact in terms of scores, coordination, communication, and memorization skills; after replaying, higher scores were often achieved as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dandashi|first=Amal|last2=Karkar|first2=Abdel Ghani|last3=Saad|first3=Sawsan|last4=Barhoumi|first4=Zaara|last5=Al-Jaam|first5=Jihad|last6=Saddik|first6=Abdulmotaleb El|date=2015-01-01|title=Enhancing the Cognitive and Learning Skills of Children with Intellectual Disability through Physical Activity and Edutainment Games|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1155/2015/165165|journal=International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|doi=10.1155/2015/165165|page=165165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for podcasts and narration specifically, according to a study conducted by Trish L. Varao Sousa, Jonathan S. A. Carriere, and Daniel Smilek (2013) with student participants, these forms may not be particularly helpful, as their use can result in both less information actually internalized and less engagement overall when compared to other "reading encounters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varao Sousa|first=Trish L.|last2=Carriere|first2=Jonathan S.

== Criticism ==
Debate regarding the value of educational entertainment and its implementation has been had for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|title=That's Edutainment|last=Rozen|first=Joel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323160117/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|archivedate=2016-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback received by Walt Disney for his ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series represents the views of some skeptics of the concept of edutainment. For example, the use of music along with the footage of animals, such as the circumstance in which "The courtship of tarantulas was set to a tango, while the movements of two scorpions were showcased with square dance music in the background" was criticized at the time; the purpose of the music was to enhance the footage, but some people took issue with this humanization. Additionally, without approval, some of the film crew of ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'' prompted unnatural behavior in lemmings that would be filmed, which then generated a negative response.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|title=Walt and the True-Life Adventures|last=admin|date=2012-02-09|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419053222/http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|archivedate=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television show that demonstrates the concept of edutainment, has also specifically been subject to criticism. For instance, in an article published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in May 1971, [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] criticizes the promotion of "Right Answers" in the television show without actual action being taken by the children, and also argues that it is nonsensical and perplexing to have adults convey to children that everything that is to be discovered is logical and easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|title=Big Bird, Meet Dick and Jane|last=Holt|first=John|date=May 1971|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523172022/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|archive-date=2016-05-23|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that the concept of edutainment hurts the actual value of education has been prevalent as well. The book entitled ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by theorist [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates this notion, as it is claimed that areas of study have been “transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.”&lt;ref&gt;Neil., Postman, (1986-01-01). {{oclc|14271773}} ''Amusing ourselves to death : public discourse in the age of show business''.

Retrieved 2017-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Museum professionals especially have faced this dilemma, as in study conducted by Pierre Balloffet, François H. Courvoisier, and Joëlle Lagier (2014), museum professionals did not have severe negative opinions of the incorporation of educational entertainment, but individuals nevertheless had varying viewpoints on "the appropriateness or potential risks of edutainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balloffet|first=Pierre|last2=Courvoisier|first2=François H.|last3=Lagier|first3=Joelle|date=2014|title=From Museum to Amusement Park: The Opportunities and Risks of Edutainment|url=|journal=International Journal of Arts Management|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ex situ'' conservation''' literally means, "off-site [[conservation movement|conservation]]". It is the process of protecting an endangered species, variety or [[breed]], of plant or animal outside its natural habitat; for example, by removing part of the population from a threatened habitat and placing it in a new location, which may be a wild area or within the care of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2014-064.pdf|title=IUCN Species Survival Commission Guidelines on the Use of Ex situ Management for Species Conservation|date=2014|website=|publisher=IUCN|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cbd-en.pdf|title=Convention on Biological Diversity|date=1992|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which humans control or modify the natural dynamics of the managed population varies widely, and this may include alteration of living environments, reproductive patterns, access to resources, and protection from predation and mortality. ''Ex situ'' management can occur within or outside a species' natural geographic range. Individuals maintained ''ex situ'' exist outside an [[Niche (ecology)|ecological niche]]. This means that they are not under the same selection pressures as wild populations, and they may undergo [[Selective breeding|artificial selection]] if maintained ''ex situ'' for multiple generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cabi.org/bookshop/book/9780851995229|title=Managing plant genetic diversity|last=Ramanatha Rao|first=V.|last2=Brown|first2=A. H. D.|last3=Jackson|first3=M.|publisher=CABI|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crop diversity|Agricultural biodiversity]] is also conserved in ''ex situ'' collections. This is primarily in the form of [[gene bank]]s where samples are stored in order to conserve the genetic resources of major crop plants and their [[Crop wild relatives|wild relatives]].

== Facilities  ==

===Botanical gardens, zoos, and aquariums ===
[[Botanical garden]]s, and [[zoo]]s  are the most conventional methods of Ex-situ conservation. Also in ex- situ conservation, all of which house whole, protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible. These facilities provide not only housing and care for specimens of endangered species, but also have an educational value. They inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat, with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species' survival in the first place. They are the most publicly visited ex situ conservation sites, with the WZCS (World Zoo Conservation Strategy) estimating that the 1100 organized zoos in the world receive more than 600 million visitors annually. Globally there is an estimated total of 2,107 aquaria and zoos in 125 countries. Additionally many private collectors or other not-for-profit groups hold animals and they engage in conservation or reintroduction efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ex situ plant conservation: supporting species survival in the wild|last=Guerrant|first=Edward|last2=Havens|first2=Kayri|last3=Maunder|first3=Mike|publisher=Island Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly there are approximately 2,000 botanical gardens in 148 counties cultivating or storing an estimated 80,000 [[Taxon|taxa]] of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ex situ plant conservation: supporting species survival in the wild|last=Guerrant|first=Edward|last2=Havens|first2=Karyi|last3=Maunder|first3=MIke|publisher=Island Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques for plants ==

=== Cryopreservation ===
The storage of seeds, pollen, tissue, or embryos in liquid nitrogen. This method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ''ex situ'' conservation. Cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]]. Technical limitations prevent the cryopreservation of many species, but [[cryobiology]] is a field of active research, and many studies concerning plants are underway.

=== Seed banking ===
The storage of seeds in a temperature and moisture controlled environment. This technique is used for taxa with orthodox seeds that tolerate [[desiccation]]. Seed bank facilities vary from sealed boxes to climate controlled walk-in freezers or vaults. Taxa with recalcitrant seeds that do not tolerate desiccation are typically not held in seed banks for extended periods of time.

=== Tissue culture (storage and propagation) ===
Somatic tissue can be stored ''[[in vitro]]'' for short periods of time. This is done in a light and temperature controlled environment that regulates the growth of cells. As a e''x situ'' conservation technique tissue culture is primary used for clonal propagation of vegetative tissue or immature seeds. This allows for the proliferation of clonal plants from a relatively small amount of parent tissue.

=== Field gene banking ===
An extensive open-air planting used maintain [[genetic diversity]] of wild, agricultural, or forestry species. Typically species that are either difficult or impossible to conserve in seed banks are conserved in field gene banks. Field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other ''ex situ''  techniques.

=== Cultivation collections ===
Plants under [[Horticulture|horticultural]] care in a constructed landscape, typically a botanic garden or arboreta. This technique is similar to a field gene bank in that plants are maintained in the ambient environment, but the collections are typically not as genetically diverse or extensive. These collections are susceptible to hybridization, artificial selection, genetic drift, and disease transmission. Species that cannot be conserved by other ''ex situ'' techniques are often included in cultivated collections.

=== Inter situ ===
Plants are under horticulture care, but the environment is managed to near natural conditions. This occurs with either restored or semi-natural environments. This technique is primarily used for taxa that are rare or in areas where habitat has been severely degraded.

== Techniques for animals ==
[[Image:Liquid nitrogen tank.JPG|thumb|150px|A tank of [[liquid nitrogen]], used to supply a cryogenic freezer (for storing laboratory samples at a temperature of about −150 °C).]]

Endangered animal species and breeds are preserved using similar techniques.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2012. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources. FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines.] No. 12. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal species can be preserved in [[genebank]]s, which consist of [[cryogenic]] facilities used to store living [[Spermatozoon|sperm]], [[Ovum|eggs]], or [[embryo]]s. For example, the Zoological Society of San Diego has established a "[[frozen zoo]]" to store such samples using [[cryopreservation]] techniques from more than 355 species, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.

A potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is [[interspecific pregnancy]], implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species, carrying it to term.&lt;ref name=NiasariNaslaji2009&gt;{{Cite journal

== Genetic management of captive populations ==
Captive populations are subject to problems such as [[inbreeding depression]], loss of [[genetic diversity]] and adaptations to captivity.  It is important to manage captive populations in a way that minimizes these issues so that the individuals to be introduced will resemble the original founders as closely as possible, which will increase the chances of successful [[Species reintroduction|reintroductions]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild Mammals in Captivity: Principles and Techniques for Zoo Management|last=Kleiman|first=Devra|last2=Thompson|first2=Katerina|last3=Baer|first3=Charlotte|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the initial growth phase, the population size is rapidly expanded until a target population size is reached.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics|last=Frankham|first=Dick|last2=Ballou|first2=Jon|last3=Briscoe|first3=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-521-70271-3|location=United Kingdom|pages=430–471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The target population size is the number of individuals that are required to maintain appropriate levels of genetic diversity, which is generally considered to by 90% of the current genetic diversity after 100 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The number of individuals required to meet this goal varies based on potential growth rate, effective size, current genetic diversity, and generation time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the target population size is reached, the focus shifts to maintaining the population and avoiding genetic issues within the captive population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Minimizing mean kinship ===
Managing populations based on minimizing mean kinship values is often an effective way to increase genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding within captive populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Kinship is the probability that two alleles will be [[Identity by descent|identical by descent]] when one allele is taken randomly from each mating individual.  The mean kinship value is the average kinship value between a given individual and every other member of the population.  Mean kinship values can help determine which individuals should be mated.  In choosing individuals for breeding, it is important to choose individuals with the lowest mean kinship values because these individuals are least related to the rest of the population and have the least common alleles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This ensures that rarer [[allele]]s are passed on, which helps to increase genetic diversity.  It is also important to avoid mating two individuals with very different mean kinship values because such pairings propagate both the rare alleles that are present in the individual with the low mean kinship value as well as the common alleles that are present in the individual with the high mean kinship value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This genetic management technique requires that ancestry is known, so in circumstances where ancestry is unknown, it might be necessary to use molecular genetics such as [[microsatellite]] data to help resolve unknowns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Avoiding loss of genetic diversity ===
Genetic diversity is often lost within captive populations due to the [[founder effect]] and subsequent small population sizes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Minimizing the loss of genetic diversity within the captive population is an important component of ''ex situ'' conservation and is critical for successful reintroductions and the long term success of the species, since more diverse populations have higher [[Adaptation|adaptive]] potential.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The loss of genetic diversity due to the founder effect can be minimized by ensuring that the founder population is large enough and genetically representative of the wild population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This is often difficult because removing large numbers of individuals from the wild populations may further reduce the genetic diversity of a  species that is already of conservation concern.  Maximizing the captive population size and the [[effective population size]] can decrease the loss of genetic diversity by minimizing the random loss of alleles due to [[genetic drift]] .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Minimizing the number of generations in captivity is another effective method for reducing the loss of genetic diversity in captive populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Avoiding adaptations to captivity ===
[[Natural selection|Selection]] favors different traits in captive populations than it does in wild populations, so this may result in adaptations that are beneficial in captivity but are deleterious in the wild.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This reduces the success of re-introductions, so it is important to manage captive populations in order to reduce adaptations to captivity.  Adaptations to captivity can be reduced by minimizing the number of generations in captivity and by maximizing the number of migrants from wild populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Minimizing selection on captive populations by creating an environment that is similar to their natural environment is another method of reducing adaptations to captivity, but it is important to find a balance between an environment that minimizes adaptation to captivity and an environment that permits adequate reproduction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Adaptations to captivity can also be reduced by managing the captive population as a series of population fragments.  In this management strategy, the captive population is split into several sub-populations or fragments which are maintained separately.  Smaller populations have lower adaptive potentials, so the population fragments are less likely to accumulate adaptations associated with captivity.  The fragments are maintained separately until [[inbreeding]] becomes a concern.  Immigrants are then exchanged between the fragments to reduce inbreeding, and then the fragments are managed separately again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Managing genetic disorders ===
[[Genetic disorder]]s are often an issue within captive populations due to the fact that the populations are usually established from a small number of founders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In large, [[Outcrossing|outbreeding]] populations, the frequencies of most deleterious alleles are relatively low, but when a population undergoes a bottleneck during the founding of a captive population, previously rare alleles may survive and increase in number.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further inbreeding within the captive population may also increase the likelihood that deleterious alleles will be expressed due to increasing [[Zygosity|homozygosity]] within the population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The high occurrence of genetic disorders within a captive population can threaten both the survival of the captive population and its eventual reintroduction back into the wild.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laikre|first=Linda|date=1999|title=Hereditary Defects and Conservation Genetic Management of Captive Populations|url=|journal=Zoo Biology|doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2361(1999)18:2&lt;81::aid-zoo1&gt;3.0.co;2-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the genetic disorder is [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]], it may be possible to eliminate the disease completely in a single generation by avoiding breeding of the affected individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, if the genetic disorder is [[Recessive allele|recessive]], it may not be possible to completely eliminate the allele due to its presence in unaffected [[Zygosity|heterozygotes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In this case, the best option is to attempt to minimize the frequency of the allele by selectively choosing mating pairs.  In the process of eliminating genetic disorders, it is important to consider that when certain individuals are prevented from breeding, alleles and therefore genetic diversity are removed from the population; if these alleles aren't present in other individuals, they may be lost completely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Preventing certain individuals from the breeding  also reduces the effective population size, which is associated with problems such as the loss of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Showy Indian clover]], ''Trifolium amoenum'', is an example of a species that was thought to be extinct, but was rediscovered in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Connors, P. G. (1994) [http://docubase.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/pl_dochome?query_src=pl_search&amp;collection=Fremontia&amp;id=158 ''Rediscovery of showy Indian clover'']. Fremontia 22: 3–7&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a single plant at a site in western [[Sonoma County]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arcata Division, 1655 Heindon Road, Arcata, Ca.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeds were harvested and currently grown in ex situ facilities.

The [[Wollemi pine]] is another example of a plant that is being preserved via ''ex situ'' conservation, as they are being grown in nurseries to be sold to the general public.

== Drawbacks ==
''Ex situ'' conservation, while helpful in humankind's efforts to sustain and protect our environment, is rarely enough to save a species from extinction. It is to be used as a last resort, or as a supplement to [[in situ conservation]] because it cannot recreate the habitat as a whole: the entire [[genetic variation]] of a species, its [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] counterparts, or those elements which, over time, might help a species adapt to its changing surroundings. Instead, ''ex situ'' conservation removes the species from its natural ecological contexts, preserving it under semi-isolated conditions whereby natural evolution and adaptation processes are either temporarily halted or altered by introducing the specimen to an unnatural habitat. In the case of [[cryogenic]] storage methods, the preserved specimen's adaptation processes are (quite literally) frozen altogether. The downside to this is that, when re-released, the species may lack the genetic adaptations and mutations which would allow it to thrive in its ever-changing natural habitat.

Furthermore, ''ex situ'' conservation techniques are often costly, with cryogenic storage being economically infeasible in most cases since species stored in this manner cannot provide a profit but instead slowly drain the financial resources of the government or organization determined to operate them. [[Seedbank]]s are ineffective for certain plant [[genus|genera]] with recalcitrant seeds that do not remain fertile for long periods of time. Diseases and pests foreign to the species, to which the species has no natural defense, may also cripple crops of protected plants in ''ex situ'' plantations and in animals living in ''ex situ'' breeding grounds. These factors, combined with the specific environmental needs of many species, some of which are nearly impossible to recreate by man, make ''ex situ'' conservation impossible for a great number of the world's endangered flora and fauna.

'''Frederick George Bailey''' (born 1924) is a British social [[anthropologist]]. He received his Ph.D. in social anthropology from [[Manchester University]], working under [[Max Gluckman]], and is closely associated with the [[Manchester school (anthropology)|Manchester School]] of social anthropology. A prolific writer, he is probably best known for his studies of local and organizational politics. He has conducted fieldwork in Bisipāra, [[Orissa, India]], and has also written on political functions, particularly the ways that social structure arises out of and is used by the interactions of individuals.

Bailey was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1976&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was a Professor at the [[University of Sussex]]. He is [[professor emeritus]] in the department of anthropology at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">'''Geragogy''' is a theory which argues that [[Geriatrics|older adults]] are sufficiently different that they warrant a separate [[educational theory]]. The term "eldergogy" has also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeo|first=Gwen|date=1982|title='Eldergogy': A special approach to education for elders|url=|journal=Lifelong Learning: The Adult Years|issue=5(5)|pages=4-7|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have noted that "one should not expect from geragogy some comprehensive educational theory for older adult learners, but only an awareness of and sensitivity towards gerontological issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lifelong Learning in Later Life: a handbook on older adult learning|last=Findsen|first=Brian|last2=Formosa|first2=Marvin|publisher=Sense Publishers|year=2011|isbn=978-94-6091-649-6|location=Dordrecht|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Key distinctions between traditional [[pedagogy]] and geragogy include offering "opportunities for older adult learners to set the curriculum themselves and to learn through activities of personal relevance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Pat|date=2016|title=Helping older people conquer digital tablets.|url=http://gerontechnology.info/index.php/journal/article/view/gt.2016.14.2.005.00|journal=Gerontechnology|issue=14(2)|pages=78-88|doi=10.4017/gt.2016.14.2.005.00|pmid=|access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as recognition of age-related issues which may affect learning, such as reduced [[Perception|sensory perception]], limited motor capabilities and changes in cognitive processes, especially [[memory]]. 

Collaborative [[peer learning]], as employed in the [[University of the Third Age]], is a common element within geragogic settings.

*[[File:Vuxenutbildning.jpg|thumb|Older people in a peer learning setting]]Learning should aim to provide skills and resources which maintain personal independence. Useful, practical outcomes must therefore be highlighted before a course of study begins, and any assigned tasks must have meaning for older adults. Enjoyment, curiosity, seeking information and desiring communication are typical routes into learning.
* Variety in teaching methods is required, rather than reliance on lengthy verbal presentations. A flexible, interdisciplinary approach which responds to the needs of the learners present is vital.
* Tutors should strive to maintain a clear focus on the topic, limiting the number of ideas presented. Irrelevant or overly distracting concepts should be avoided. 
* In place of discipline or rote-learning, tutors should stimulate engagement with warmth, positive comments, approval and encouragement. 
* Learners may take longer to complete tasks and assignments than younger people. They may also wish to return repeatedly to a task until they feel comfortable. Examples should be reinforced regularly and often, using differing contexts in order to give as many opportunities as possible for learners to grasp a concept.
* The past experiences of learners can be useful in grounding their understanding. Tutors should seek to review specific skills which allow each learner to be creative in their own way, building on their personal life experience. It is also important to review information that may have been learned in the past (such as at school) but has not been used for some time.

'''VNU-HCM High School for the Gifted''' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: Trường Phổ thông Năng khiếu, Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh) is a specialized public high school located in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]].

Established in 1996, HSG is affiliated with [[Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City]] and is a specialized high school for highly talented students in academic subjects such as mathematics, natural sciences, literature, and foreign languages. It is considered one of the best high schools in Vietnam, and one of the three most selective specialized high schools in Ho Chi Minh City, along with [[Lê Hồng Phong High School]] and [[Trần Đại Nghĩa High School]].

The school aims to provide the best environment for academic excellence and preparation for higher education, and regularly sends students to participate in regional, national, and international academic competitions, especially in the [[International Science Olympiads]].

== History ==
The school was established in 1993 and was originally affiliated with Ho Chi Minh City University of Science as the Specialized School in Mathematics and Informatics for high school students. By 1996, the school has moved to its current main campus in [[District 5, Ho Chi Minh City|District 5]], expanded its programs of specialization, and become an independent high school that operates directly under [[Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City]] under the new name. HSG opened its second campus in [[Thủ Đức District|Thu Duc]] in 2014.

== Admissions ==

Based on performance in HSG's separate entrance examination, about 300 students are selected every year from more than 4000 applicants for each subject, who hail from not only [[Ho Chi Minh City]] but all the [[Southern Vietnam|Southern provinces]]. Specialized students receive tuition remissions, and scholarships are awarded to the top students in each class each semester.

== Academics ==
In addition to the national high school curriculum, HSG offers rigorous, specialized instruction in seven subjects: English, Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Literature. The school also admits students to non-specialized classes who seek to prepare for university entrance examinations in Groups A and D (see [[Education in Vietnam#Higher education|Higher education in Vietnam]]). Teachers at HSG are also professors from the various campuses of Vietnam National University. Classes at the school are known for their innovative critical and creative approaches, as well as for being highly challenging and often incorporating university-level materials.

HSG is best known for both its students' top performance in the [[Vietnam University Admission Rankings]], and its long-standing record in academic competitions for high school students at both national and international levels. In particular, HSG students consistently win first and second places in the National Academic Competitions,&lt;ref&gt;[[:vi:Kỳ thi chọn học sinh giỏi quốc gia lớp 12 trung học phổ thông Việt Nam]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}} the most intense competitions for high school students in Vietnam, and are regularly among those selected to represent Vietnam in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:vi:Việt Nam tại Olympic Toán học Quốc tế]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}} and the [[International Olympiad in Informatics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:vi:Việt Nam tại Olympic Tin học Quốc tế]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}

'''Humayun J. Chaudhry''' (born November 17, 1965) is an American physician and medical educator who is President and Chief Executive Officer of the [[Federation of State Medical Boards]] (FSMB) of the United States, a national non-profit organization founded in 1912 that represents the 70 state medical boards of the United States and its territories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FSMB names Dr. Chaudhry as its first DO president, CEO |author=Carolyn Schierhorn |url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=1018 |newspaper=[[The DO]] |date=September 30, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704201213/http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=1018 |archivedate=July 4, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and which co-sponsors the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] ([[USMLE]]). From 2007 to 2009, he served as Commissioner of Health Services for [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the state's most populous county outside [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the Meeting of the Suffolk County Legislature's General Meeting, held in Riverhead, New York.  March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he was listed by [[Modern Healthcare]] magazine as one of the 50 Most Influential Physician Executives and Leaders.

Chaudhry is co-author of ''Medical Licensing and Discipline in America'', published by Lexington Books in 2012, and principal author of ''Fundamentals of Clinical Medicine'', 4th edition, a textbook for medical students and physicians in training that was published by Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins in 2004. A Clinical Associate Professor of [[Internal Medicine]] at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School]] and Clinical Associate Professor of [[Preventive Medicine]] at [[Stony Brook University]] School of Medicine in New York, he is the recipient of a Laureate Award from the [[American College of Physicians]] and has been inducted into the [[American Osteopathic Association]]'s Mentor Hall of Fame.

In 2014, he was appointed Chair-Elect of the International Association of Medical Regulatory Authorities by its Members General Assembly during a biennial meeting in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FSMB CEO Dr. Humayun Chaudhry Elected Chair-Elect of International Medical Regulatory Group |url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/fsmb-ceo-dr-humayun-chaudhry-elected-chair-elect-of-international-medical-regulatory-group |date=September 17, 2014 |accessdate= November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy of "Interstate Medical License Compact" ==

On October 10, 2013, the [[Federation of State Medical Boards]] issued a press release announcing "substantial progress" in the development of an interstate medical license compact to facilitate the ability of physicians to practice medicine across state borders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsmb.org/pdf/nr_interstate_compact.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "As our health care system continues to change," said Chaudhry, "the need for increased license portability has become more pressing." The proposed compact is expected to maintain state authority and control, establish high standards for physician eligibility, and ensure a well-coordinated and fairly-applied system of oversight and discipline.

Chaudhry served as the facilitator of a meeting of representatives of state medical boards in January 2013 in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] that formally led to the proposal for an interstate compact. On March 13, Chaudhry and Lance Talmage, M.D., then Chair of the FSMB Board of Directors, received a bipartisan letter of support signed by [[U.S. Senator]] [[John Thune]] of South Dakota and seven other U.S. Senators ([[Thomas Carper]], [[Roger Wicker]], [[James Inhofe]], [[John Barrasso]], [[Mike Enzi]], [[Tim Johnson (U.S. Senator)|Tim Johnson]], and [[Lamar Alexander]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2013/3/thune-encourages-federation-of-state-medical-boards-to-develop-medical-licensure-portability-proposal Retrieved March 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; applauding "the efforts of the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) on the work you are doing in examining solutions that would allow for more efficient sharing of medical licensure information that is necessary for the advancement of telehealth technology." The letter expressed the hope that the FSMB can leverage resources "to develop a proposal that satisfies the myriad of complex issues associated with licensure portability."

In an article in the [[New York Times]] on June 30, 2014, Chaudhry said, “The proposed compact would create a new pathway to speed the licensing of doctors seeking to practice medicine in multiple states,” adding that "it would allow doctors to see more patients than ever before, if they want to.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/us/medical-boards-draft-plan-to-ease-path-to-out-of-state-and-online-treatment.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy of "Maintenance of Licensure" (MOL) ==

In 2010, the House of Delegates of the [[Federation of State Medical Boards]] approved a policy framework for "Maintenance of Licensure" (MOL) that recommends that all U.S. physicians, as a condition of licensure renewal, "should provide evidence of participation in a program of professional development and lifelong learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaudhry |first=Humayun |author2=J Rhyne |author3=F E Cain |author4=A Young |author5=M Crane |author6=F Bush |title=Maintenance of Licensure: Protecting the Public, Promoting Quality Health Care doi |journal=Journal of Medical Regulation |year=2010 |url=http://www.fsmb.org/pdf/mol-bg.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015213208/http://fsmb.org/pdf/mol-bg.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MOL framework proposes three components: reflective self-assessment, assessment of knowledge and skills, and performance in practice.

Chaudhry chairs a CEO Advisory Council that advises the FSMB's Board of Directors and works with an FSMB MOL Implementation Group, which has recommended that physicians actively engaged in the [[Maintenance of Certification]] (MOC) program of the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]], or the Osteopathic Continuous Certification (OCC) program of the [[American Osteopathic Association]], should be recognized as "substantially in compliance" with any MOL program that is adopted by a state. For those physicians not board-certified in a specialty of medicine or surgery, or for those not engaged in MOC or OCC, the program envisions states allowing multiple options by which each of the components of MOL can be achieved for licensure renewal.

On August 5, 2010, Chaudhry joined [[David Blumenthal]], M.D., President [[Barack Obama]]'s National Coordinator for Health Information Technology at the time, and [[Marilyn Tavenner]], then Principal Deputy Administrator of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., where Chaudhry noted that "[[health information technology]], generally, and [[electronic health record]]s, in particular, could be of value as doctors fulfill (their) professional obligation and demonstrate ongoing clinical competence through MOL."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chaudhry|first1=Humayun|last2=Crane|first2=Martin|last3=Bush|first3=Freda|last4=Cain |first4=Frances|title=Federation Of State Medical Boards: Maintenance of Licensure and Health IT|url=http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2010/08/05/fed-of-state-medical-boards-maintenance-of-licensure-and-health-it/|publisher=Health Affairs|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical regulation ==

State medical and osteopathic boards in the United States took 5,721 disciplinary actions against physicians in 2009, an increase of 342 actions over 2008, according to a report by the [[Federation of State Medical Boards]]. Writing in the introduction to the report, Chaudhry cautioned against using those numbers to compare or rank states. "Changes in a board's funding, staffing levels, changes in state law and many other factors," he said, "can impact the number of actions taken by a board."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Disciplinary actions against Tennessee doctors rise |author=Wortham A. |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2010/03/29/daily21.html
 |newspaper=Memphis Business Journal |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the [[New York Times]] about telemedicine and virtual medicine, Chaudhry noted that the [[Federation of State Medical Boards]]' guidelines define a patient-doctor relationship as "clearly established and begun when a physician agrees to undertake diagnosis and treatment of the patient, and the patient agrees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Should Surgeons Meet Patients Online? |author=Catherine Saint Louis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/fashion/21Skin.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stressed the importance of ensuring that patients receive the same standard of care online as in person. "It should be the same exact standard as if the patient was in your examining room," he cautioned. "You can't cut corners."

From 2009 Chaudhry has served as Secretary of the Management Committee for the International Association of Medical Regulatory Authorities. In 2010, and again in 2012 and 2014, he was elected representative of the United States to IAMRA's General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhry HJ. Charting Dynamism in Medical Education, Licensure and Regulation. ''Journal of Medical Licensure and Discipline''. 95(3):5-8. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health Commissioner ==

As Commissioner of Health Services for New York's [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] from 2007 to 2009, Chaudhry supervised 1,500 employees and oversaw an annual budget of $400 million. He created a Division of Preventive Medicine within the department through a restructuring of 72 personnel that was approved by Suffolk County Executive [[Steve Levy (politician)|Steve Levy]] and the Suffolk County Legislature and which went into effect on January 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saslow|first=Linda|title=New Group Chooses Its First Battle, Asthma|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/24healthli.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We can't make people live forever," Chaudhry said in an article in the [[New York Times]] about the new division, "but we can prevent premature deaths."

During the [[2009 flu pandemic]] due to [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1]], Chaudhry was praised for taking a cautious public health approach to the new virus, recommending closure of schools when needed and setting up e-mail alerts for Suffolk County administrators.&lt;ref&gt;Brown J. Trying to keep life normal. ''Newsday''. May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his department's public health response to the [[2009 flu pandemic]] in an Op-Ed article in [[Newsday]], Chaudhry noted the advantages of advanced technology (e.g., [[BlackBerry]], [[Twitter]]) in tracking the virus and keeping in close communication with local, state and federal health officials.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhry HJ. Flu tracking meets the "tweet." ''Newsday''. May 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Named "Long Islander of the Week" and "Dr. Stay-Well," [[Newsday]] recognized Chaudhry for "intently but calmly... (steering) the public on a better middle course between apathy and alarm."&lt;ref&gt;Long Islander of the Week. ''Newsday''. July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Suffolk County Executive [[Steve Levy (politician)|Steve Levy]] described him as someone with "an uncanny ability to take complex medical issues and explain them in layman's terms to the public," adding that Chaudhry "helped to guide the county through a number of health crises during his tenure in a masterful way."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein RJ. Suffolk health Commish Chaudhry to resign post. ''Newsday''. August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Chaudhry's tenure, Suffolk County adopted a ban on [[trans fats]], derived from partially hydrogenated oil, from its restaurants in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Another Blow Against Trans Fats in Foods |author=Stacey Stowe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/nyregion/long-island/22Rfats.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suffolk County became the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the sale of baby bottles containing the chemical [[Bisphenol A]], in a measure that Chaudhry said would be enforced with the assistance of consumer complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein RJ. Levy signs Suffolk ban on BPA baby bottles. ''Newsday''. April 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Justifying Suffolk County's actions against Bisphenol A, Chaudhry said, "There was enough evidence to warrant some type of intervention before that final study is done that shows this to be harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hand|first=Larry|title=Plastics: Danger where we least expect it|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/winter10plastics/|publisher=Harvard University School of Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; The County's lawmakers also voted to support a proposal (the first in the nation) to ban the indoor use of electronic cigarettes in public buildings, a move Chaudhry supported.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein RJ. Suffolk lawmakers vote to ban e-cigs in public spaces. ''Newsday''. August 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical educator ==

Following the completion of his medical residency training in [[Internal Medicine]], Chaudhry served from 1996 to 2001 as Director of Medical Education at [[Long Beach Medical Center]], a 202-bed community teaching hospital in Long Beach, New York. From 2001 to 2007, he served as full-time Chairman of the Department of Medicine at the College of Osteopathic Medicine of [[New York Institute of Technology]], where he also served from 2003-2005 as Assistant Dean for Pre-Clinical Education, supervising the undergraduate medical education delivered to first and second year medical students, and from 2005-2007 as the Assistant Dean for Health Policy.

Chaudhry is the principal author of the medical student textbook ''Fundamentals of Clinical Medicine'', written with co-authors from [[New York University School of Medicine]], [[Cleveland Clinic Foundation]], [[Tufts-New England Medical Center]] and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]].  The book was praised by [[Jerome P. Kassirer]], M.D., MACP, Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' from 1991–1999, who wrote in its foreword, "Every medical student should have this book." Chaudhry's book, ''Medical Licensing and Discipline in America'', co-written with David Johnson, was cited as an authority in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s 2015 decision in North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners versus [[Federal Trade Commission]] in [[Associate Justice]] [[Samuel Alito, Jr.]]'s dissenting opinion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-534_19m2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1999 to 2007, Chaudhry served in the [[United States Air Force Reserves]] as a physician and medical educator, rising to the rank of [[Major]] and serving as a [[Flight Surgeon]] on flight status with the [[732nd Airlift Squadron]] and as the Medical Operations Flight Commander for the 514th Aeromedical Staging Squadron (ASTS) of the [[514th Air Mobility Wing]], both at [[McGuire Air Force Base]], [[New Jersey]]. Chaudhry has flown on training missions on the [[C-141 Starlifter]], [[KC-10 Extender]], and the [[C-17 Globemaster III]] and is the recipient of an [[Air Force Commendation Medal]], an [[Air Force Achievement Medal]] and a Small Arms Expert [[Marksmanship Ribbon]].

From 2009 through 2012, Chaudhry delivered a lecture in the ''Foundations of Public Health'' course at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] and from 2002 through 2012 taught electrocardiography at the [[New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine]]. He served as President of the [[American College of Osteopathic Internists]] from 2008-2009 and as President of the [[Association of Osteopathic Directors and Medical Educators]] from 2007-2009. On April 11, 2013, he was awarded the title of Master of the American College of Physicians for "excellence in the practice of medicine" at a ceremony in San Francisco.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3157">'''Jail Madrassa''' is a religious [[seminary]] being used as a faith-based religious center for rehabilitation of [[drug addicts]], [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile criminals]], and religious training for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16157177&lt;/ref&gt;

This seminary came into limelight due to its brutal treatment of students for chaining, beatings, lashes, and deprival of food like in a [[torture chamber]].  Apparently, parents voluntarily paid for their children to attend 'Jail madrassa' to morphe themselves from the addiction of drugs or for the crimes, children have committed.

==Criticism==
Upon meeting the teenagers by Hasan Kazmi, a [[BBC]] [[Urdu]] service's scribe, the inmates complained that they were forced to study all hours with no adequate food nor clothing. Another boy complained, [[Taliban]] visited the seminary to get prepared for battle.

According to [[Pakistan]]'s police, they arrested the head of the seminary for subjecting students to torture and abuse under the basement of seminary. At least 18 of the teenagers aged under 20 were rescued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16157177 Torture and abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics questioned the rationale behind the arrest of inmates in religious centre which is also common in private jails run by [[Feudalism|feudal lords]] in Pakistan and drug-addict rehabilitation centres where inmates are chained to prevent them from escape.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]] [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16157177 Analysis:M Ilyas Khan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Few reports also suggest that almost 50 students under age of 18 were kept chained in the basement of seminary for sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deccan Herald]] [http://www.deccanherald.com/content/211499/over-50-chained-boys-rescued.html Over 50 'chained' boys rescued from Pak seminary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=82017&amp;Cat=4&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Rehman Malik]], Pakistan's Interiror Minister, he asked the police to investigate if the seminary had any links to the terrorist organisations like [[Tehreek-e-Taliban]] in imparting terrorist training.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deccanherald.com/content/211499/over-50-chained-boys-rescued.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CNN]] affiliate [[GEO News]], the students were beaten and shocked with electric wires. According to police, some parents enrolled the students for religious training with no knowledge of harsh treatment to their children.&lt;ref&gt;[[CNN News]] [http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/12/world/asia/pakistan-students-chained/index.html Police raid in Pakistan finds chained students at religious school]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life==
Awe, the ninth-youngest of eleven children, was born and raised in [[San Ignacio, Belize|San Ignacio]], [[Cayo District]], [[Belize]] (then [[British Honduras]]).  His childhood home was within walking distance of [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins, where, as a youth, he would amuse himself by digging up [[Maya civilization|ancient Maya]] artifacts.  Courses in [[Anthropology]] that he took while a student at [[St. John's College, Belize|St. John’s College]] in [[Belize City]] rekindled his curiosity about the human past and inspired him to pursue a career in [[archaeology]].  Due to the limited educational opportunities available to [[Belize|Belizeans]] at the time, however, he had no choice but to go abroad in order to continue his formal study of the subject.&lt;ref name="Awe2011On" /&gt;  Before leaving his Central American homeland to further his education, he held the government post of Archaeological Assistant at the Department of [[Archaeology]] (then under the Ministry of Tourism and the Environment) and served as a field assistant in excavations at the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological sites]] of [[Cerros]], [[Lamanai]] and the Sayab Mai [[Cenote]].&lt;ref name="Awe2011On" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Awe2011CV"&gt;Awe, Jaime J. (2011). Curriculum Vita. Electronic document, http://celabelize.com/cela-people, accessed October 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Awe majored in [[Anthropology]] at [[Trent University]] in [[Canada]], where he was mentored by Paul Healy and received his B.A. and M.A. in 1981 and 1985, respectively.  He began his doctoral studies at the [[University at Albany, SUNY|State University of New York at Albany]], but later transferred to the [[University of London]], where he became the first [[Belize|Belizean]] to ever receive a Ph.D. in [[Archaeology]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Awe2011On" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Awe2011CV" /&gt;  Since earning his doctorate, Awe has held faculty positions at [[Trent University]], the [[University of New Hampshire]], [[Galen University]] (in [[Belize]])&lt;ref name="Awe2011CV" /&gt; and [[Northern Arizona University]], where he is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of [[Anthropology]].&lt;ref name="NAU2015" /&gt;

== Government service ==
Awe has held the [[Belize|Belizean]] government posts of Archaeological Assistant, Chief Archaeologist and Acting Commissioner of Archaeology at the Department of [[Archaeology]], and Director of the Institute of [[Archaeology]] (formerly the Department of Archaeology, and now under the National Institute of Culture and History).&lt;ref name="Awe2011CV" /&gt;  Although he resigned the latter post in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;San Pedro Sun.

Online newspaper article, http://www.sanpedrosun.com/community-and-society/2014/07/15/doctor-jaime-awe-resigns-director-institute-archaeology/, accessed October 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; he remains Director of the Belize Valley Archaeological Reconnaissance Project (BVAR, which is under the Institute of Archaeology), a position he has held since 1988.&lt;ref name="BVAR2015" /&gt;

== Fieldwork and publications ==
BVAR includes multi-year excavations at the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site|archaeological sites]] of [[Baking Pot]], [[Cahal Pech]], [[Lower Dover]] and [[Xunantunich]].  Awe has also directed the Western Belize Regional Cave Project (WBRCP, 1997-2008), which involved excavations at [[Actun Tunichil Muknal]] (ATM) and other [[Maya civilization|Maya]] cave sites.&lt;ref name="BVAR2015" /&gt;  In addition to his work through BVAR and WBRCP, he has directed excavations at the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological sites of [[Altun Ha]], [[Caracol]], [[Lamanai]], [[Lubaantun]] and [[Nim Li Punit]].&lt;ref name="Awe2011CV" /&gt;  Awe has devoted an impressive amount of time and energy{{Peacock term|date=April 2018}} to his excavations at [[Cahal Pech]], and his writings have largely focused on the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] cities of west-central [[Belize]] during the Formative, [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]] and [[Classic Maya|Classic]] periods.  However, he has published on topics related to the [[archaeology]] of [[Belize]] in earlier and later periods as well.  In all, he has authored and co-authored over fifty academic publications,&lt;ref name="Awe2011CV" /&gt; and appeared in several televised documentaries on [[archaeology]] and the [[Maya civilization|ancient Maya]].&lt;ref name="Awe2011CV" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IMDb.

'''List of United States business school rankings''' is a tabular listing of some of the [[business school]]s and their affiliated [[university|universities]] located in the [[United States]] that are included in one or more of the rankings of full-time [[Master of Business Administration]] programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive [[list of business schools in the United States]]. These rankings are a subset of [[college and university rankings]]. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a [[university]] or [[college]] that produces students who attain [[business administration]] degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are [[accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]]. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for [[undergraduate]], [[part-time]] and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] and [[Academic administration|administrators]] in [[Higher education in the United States|American institutions of higher education]] regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges because some of the methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the [[List of colleges and universities which have signed the Presidents Letter|President's letter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationconservancy.org/presidents_letter.html|title=President's Letter|publisher=The Education Conservancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing significance==
Business school rankings are important to the various business schools because they are an important [[marketing]] tool used to recruit top students, and lure [[recruiter]]s from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school,&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj/&gt; and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/faq_meth_brief.php#one|title=Frequently Asked Questions–Rankings|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report. L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than half of recruiters said they believe the quality of MBA graduates is the same or better currently compared with past years.  Some of the most renowned schools, such as Harvard and Stanford, do not rank as highly as their stature might suggest. Recruiters complain that they often find graduates of some of the most famous institutions more arrogant and less collegial than the MBAs they meet at other schools. Recruiters also noted that "some of the large, elite schools also don't seem to enjoy as many close, personal relationships with recruiters as smaller MBA programs do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Alsop | first =Ronald| title =M.B.A. Survey: Something Old, Something New | date =September 20, 2006  | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115860376846766495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking techniques==
The rankings are based on a variety of factors such as [[standardized test]] scores of students, [[salary]] of recent graduates, survey results of graduates and/or recruiters, the specific schools that choose to participate in a market survey, the number of top companies recruiting at the school and a variety of attributes.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careerjournal.com/reports/bschool06/20060920-alsop-mblede.html|title=The Top Business Schools: Something Old, Something New|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|date=2006-09-20|work=The Wall Street Journal Online |author=Alsop, Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings vary significantly by method used to determine the success of each program. For instance, the ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[Financial Times]]'' results are based on long-term graduate career progress concerns, the ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' and ''[[Economist]]'' polls evaluate short-term experiences of the students with their program, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' consider the recent experiences of recruiters with the program, and other rankings like the [[Aspen Institute]] ''Beyond Grey Pinstripes'' measure integration of sustainability material into business programs.&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ed8a91e-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=How the rankings compare: A matter of judgment|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Bradshaw, Della and Wai Kwen Chan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117100300/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ed8a91e-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2008-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' uses a combination of the objective and subjective as well. The magazine seeks "expert opinion about program quality and statistical indicators that measure the quality of a school's faculty, research, and students." However, it ranks a broad spectrum of [[professional school]] programs such as business schools, [[law school]]s, and [[medical school]]s as well as a variety of programs specific [[academic discipline]]s such as the [[social science]]s or [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=USN&amp;WR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08method_brief.php|title=How We Do the Numbers|author=Morse, Robert J. and Samuel Flanigan|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report. L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business opinion data incorporates responses from deans, program directors, and senior faculty about the academic quality of their programs as well as the opinions of professionals who actually do the hiring of the new MBA graduates from the schools. The statistical data combines measures of the qualities of the incoming students and as well as the faculty with measures of post graduate success as related to their degrees.&lt;ref name=USN&amp;WR/&gt; There were 382 programs that responded out of 402 solicited, and the formula used a strict combination of quality assessment (40%), placement success (35%), and student selectivity (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08biz_meth_brief.php|title=Business Methodology|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report. L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' rankings, which are based on three sources of data (a student survey, a survey of corporate recruiters, and an intellectual capital rating), are published in mid-October of even numbered years.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/apr2006/bs20060420_4380.htm#MBA1|title=MBA Rankings: Updated October 2006|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.|work=BusinessWeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 student survey of 45 online questions of students' ratings of their programs was distributed to 16,595 students three weeks before graduation; there were 9,290 responses. The recruiter survey determines how many [[MBA]]s a recruiter's company hired in the previous two years and which schools it actively recruits from. 223 respondents participated out of 426 solicited. The intellectual capital is determined based on a formula incorporating [[academic publishing|academic publication]]s in journals, books written, and faculty size.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;

The ''Forbes magazine'' methodology was to calculate a five-year [[return on investment]] for 2002 graduates. ''Forbes'' surveyed 18,500 [[alumni]] of 102 MBA programs and used their pre-enrollment and post-graduate business school salary information as a basis for comparing post-MBA compensation with the cost of attending the programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/16/business-school-methodology-biz-07mba_cz_kb_0816bschoolmeth.html|title=Best Business Schools: Methodology|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=Forbes.com LLC|date=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], the [[business information]] arm of the [[Economist Group]], gathered results from two [[internet]] [[questionnaire]]s, one of business schools and one of their students and recent graduates, and used them to rate business schools located all over the world. Information provided by the schools made up 80% of the ranking, with student and alumni responses accounting for only 20%. Factors in the evaluation included faculty:student ratio, GMAT scores of incoming students, student body diversity, foreign languages offered, percentage of graduates finding jobs within three months after graduation, percentage of graduates finding jobs through the school's career service, graduates' salaries and the comparison of pre-enrollment and post-graduation salaries, and student/alumni evaluations of the program, facilities, services, and alumni network. Results were tabulated using a [[smoothing]] method incorporating the three previous years' results. The organization used strict data provision thresholds, with the result that some highly regarded schools were omitted from the list of 100 ranked schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mba.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=wmba_rank_method|title=Rankings methodology|accessdate=2007-12-19|publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Financial Times'' poll was the result of over 10,000 respondents to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates in each of the last three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent [[response rate (survey)|response rate]]. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the ''Financial Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=How to read the rankings: How the raw data are processed|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Milton, Ursula|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217140636/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2007-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey responses are audited by [[KPMG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2ea93d06-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=Auditing: Aim for accuracy|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Bradshaw, Della|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227082805/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2ea93d06-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2007-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Financial Times'' has also produced a "ranking of rankings" summarizing five of the individual rankings (''The Economist'', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', ''Wall Street Journal'', ''Forbes'', ''Financial Times''). They produce United States, and European summary rankings based on all five and a global summary ranking using the ''Wall Street Journal'', ''Economist'' and ''Financial Times''. The summary is based on underlying polls in which a school placed in the top ten using an [[average]] of the [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] placements. The summary excludes the ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' results.&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj/&gt;

The ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' includes every institution that has any [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureates]], [[Fields Medal]]s, and highly cited researchers. In addition, major universities of every country with significant amount of papers indexed by Science Citation Index-Expanded ([[Science Citation Index|SCIE]]) and Social Science Citation Index ([[Social Science Citation Index|SSCI]]) are also included. Having alumni of an institution winning [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizes in Economics]] since 1951 attributes 10% of the score. Staff of an institution winning [[Turing Award]]s in computer science since 1961 contributes 15% of the score. Highly cited researchers in economics/business category get 25% weighting. Papers indexed in SSCI in economics/business fields gets 25%. Finally, the percentage of papers published in top 20% journals of economics/business fields to that in all economics/business journals gets 25% weighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arwu.org/ARWUSubjectMethodology2010.jsp|title=Ranking methodology|accessdate=2013-03-05|publisher=[[Shanghai Jiaotong University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rankings  based on attributes other than standardized test scores, salary of graduates, and similar attributes also exist. The ''[[Beyond Grey Pinstripes]]'' ranking, compiled by the [[Aspen Institute]] and published biannually, is based entirely on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. Data for this survey is solicited from university administrators at accredited colleges, and audited by teams of Ph.D. scoring fellows. Rankings are calculated on the amount of [[sustainability]] coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|accessdate=2011-06-18|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ranking of business schools has been discussed in articles and on academic websites.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = Caution and Controversy | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] | date = 2007-06-22 | url = http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081654/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-26 | df =  }} The article contains an extensive bibliography of critical sources.&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics of ranking methodologies maintain that any published rankings should be viewed with caution for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="MRN"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong with MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |year=1993 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archivedate=April 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rankings exhibit intentional selection bias as they limit the surveyed population to a small number of MBA programs and ignore the majority of schools, many with excellent offerings.
* Ranking methods may be subject to personal biases and statistically flawed methodologies (especially methods relying on subjective interviews of hiring managers, students, and/or faculty).
* Rankings use no objective measures of program quality.
* The same list of schools appears in each ranking with some variation in ranks, so a school ranked as number 1 in one list may be number 17 in another list.
* Rankings tend to concentrate on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).
* A high rank in a national publication tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].
* Some leading business schools including Harvard, [[INSEAD]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan]] provide limited cooperation with certain ranking publications due to their perception that rankings are misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hemel | first=Daniel J | title=HBS Blocks Media Access to Students | publisher=[[The Harvard Crimson]] | date=12 April 2004 | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=358753 | accessdate=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[MBA]] programs, one study found that ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can duplicate some of the ranking order found in top 20 lists of Business Week and U.S. News &amp; World Report.&lt;ref name="MRN" /&gt;

===Historical rankings===
The historical rankings of the top MBA programs show little variation, even over a long time period. In 1977, ''MBA Magazine'' surveyed business schools deans to come up with a ranking which listed [[The Wharton School]], [[Harvard Business School]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], the [[Booth School of Business]], and the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] as their top 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rush to the M.B.A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage|work=[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]]|date=January 1979|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools plus the [[Kellogg School of Management]] have always comprised the top 5 schools in every [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Business Schools |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings |work=US News and World Report |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324142224/http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of [[Columbia Business School]], these seven schools which are most frequently listed at the top of various rankings (and are the top seven worldwide in the [[Business Insider]] ranking) have been referred to as "America's seven most powerful schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News from the schools, April 2010|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15895173|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After college Glaser worked for the Metropolitan Detroit Youth Council and as a compliance officer for the [[War Manpower Commission]].

The '''Mbankomo Centre of Excellence''' (French: ''Centre d'Excellence de Mbankomo'') is sports training facility owned by the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) in [[Mbankomo]], [[Cameroon]] which has been operational since 1998. It is situated in the middle of the equatorial forest which gives teams a secluded place for training. The centre also serves as the home venue of the [[Cameroon national football team]].

== History ==
===Development===
It was during one of Assisi's Executive Committee meets in South Africa in April 2003 that the CAF had decided to contribute more to the development of football on the continent through the construction of sports facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http:/ / www.camfoot.com/?infrastructures-la-caf-visite-son, 9337.html&lt;/ref&gt; In its first phase achievements, six regions of Africa had been identified. For the zone in Central Africa, the country of Roger Milla was chosen. The Government of the Republic of Cameroon has offered Mbankomo field, located 24&amp;nbsp;km from [[Yaoundé]]. December 20, 2006, Shorouk, an Egyptian company started work, which in principle should be received in the month of July.

=== Costs ===
6&amp;nbsp;billion CFA francs. In the opinion of [[Issa Hayatou]], the chairman of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (Caf) is approximately the amount of money already engulfed by his institution in the works construction of the "Centre of Excellence" in Cameroon. The announcement was made last Friday during a site visit by the President of CAF, who was accompanied on the occasion of its employees.
In the opinion of Issa Hayatou, the contribution of the [[International Federation of Association Football]] (Fifa) is $1.8&amp;nbsp;million (1.2 in interest-free repayable loan and $600&amp;nbsp;million in donations) . The rest of the investment capital comes from the CAF. He added that the Centre of Excellence [[Mbankomo]] could be more expensive: "If the government of [[Cameroon]] did not exempt the construction material of all customs duties."

=== Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium ===
[[File:Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts Belgique 1101.jpg|thumb|353x353px|Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The Museums’ collections trace the history of the visual arts – painting, sculpture and drawing – from the 15th to the 21st centuries. They preserve the works of the [[Flemish primitives|Flemish Primitives]], of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Jacob Jordaens|Jacques Jordaens]], [[Jacques-Louis David|Jacques Louis David]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[James Ensor]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[René Magritte]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Jan Fabre]] and many others. This jewel among Belgium's cultural institutions comprises several entities: the [[Oldmasters Museum|Musée Old Masters Museum]], the Musée Modern Museum, the [[Wiertz Museum|Musée Wiertz Museum]] and the [[Constantin Meunier|Musée Meunier Museum]], the [[Magritte Museum|Musée Magritte Museum]] and the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Musée Fin-de-Siècle Museum]].

Michel Draguet repositioned the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] nationally as well as internationally through a redeployment of the collection focused on the specificity of Belgian creation as well as on the particularity of Belgian reception of European creation.

In 2009, he created the [[Magritte Museum]] with, for the first time in Belgium, a private-public partnership (with [[Engie|GDF-Suez]]) on competencies. The selection of works exhibited in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is constantly expanding with a changing selection of external loans. With the support of Belgian and foreign museums as well as private collectors, works are being made available that have previously never been exhibited. The visitor can thus discover many treasures that are still in private possession. Since its creation, this museum, measuring 2500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has welcomed more than two million visitors and thus contributed to the economic and cultural development of the Belgian capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/ripostes/brandir-l-importance-economique-de-la-culture-pour-la-defendre-544aa05a3570fe7cfbf80d01|title=Brandir l'importance économique de la culture pour la défendre ?|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=2018-05-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magritte Museum]] has already received 8 nominations and prizes. Every year more than 300,000 visitors come here from all over the world to discover the life and the works of [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/uploads/pages/files/magritte_museum_key_figures_2009_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BRX-musée-magritte.3.JPG|alt=Magritte Museum|thumb|277x277px|Magritte Museum]]
In 2013, Michel Draguet inaugurated the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Fin-de-siècle Museum]] as first chapter of a new conception of a museum of Modern Art. Famous visual artists like [[Constantin Meunier]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Léon Spilliaert]] and [[George Minne|Georges Minne]] testify to the effervescent activity of this period, reflected also in all other creative fields: literature, opera, music, architecture, photography and poetry ([[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Émile Verhaeren|Emile Verhaeren]], [[Octave Maus]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Henry van de Velde|Henry Van de Velde]], [[Maurice Kufferath]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]] and others). [[Art Nouveau]] architecture is evoked by means of a 3D reconstruction of six buildings Art Nouveau. This was the first introduction of new technologies inside de Museum. Located at the heart of Brussels, where between 1884 and 1914 the exhibitions of ''Les XX'' and ''La Libre Esthétique'' made the city one of the artistic capitals of the late 19th century, this museum is distinguished by its multidisciplinary nature, through a partnership formed with the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Library]], the [[La Monnaie|Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], [[Cinematek]], the [[Bibliotheca Wittockiana]], the [[King Baudouin Foundation]] and the [[Brussels Capital Region]] for housing the Gillion Crowet collection, which is one of the museum's highlights.The [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum]], which was applauded internationally when it opened,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/belgique-bruxelles-s-offre-un-musee-fin-de-siecle-06-12-2013-1765553_3.php&lt;/ref&gt; welcomed 170,000 visitors during its first operating year.

Michel Draguet also initiate a highly popular yet challenging exhibition program from ancient masters to contemporary art mounting up to eight major shows per year. The quality and quantity of this program has been supported by a renewing strategy to the public in its diversity. In this way, Draguet initiate “Museum on measure”: a program dedicated to fragilized public supported by charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.article27.be/IMG/pdf/accompagner_les_publics_socialement_fragilises_au_musees_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the educational services have developed a range of new activities and the social programs have been extended. This is a result of the increase in partnerships between the public and private sectors .

Among the highlights of the programme have been large exhibitions such as “Art Nouveau Bing”, “Rubens in Brussels”, “CoBrA”, “Alechinsky”, “Leon Spilliaert” “Jordaens and Antiquity”, “The Flemish Primitives in  Brussels”, “Andres Serrano”, “Marc Chagall”, “Kandinsky and Europe”, “Symbolism in Belgium” and “Stanley Kubrick Photographer”. Michel Draguet introduced also a wide spectrum of new exhibition formats with from small “cabinet exhibitions” on such artists Pierre Lahaut, [[Jules Schmalzigaug]], [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]], and others. He placed permanent installation of contemporary artist inside the [[Oldmasters Museum|OldMasters]] department like [[David Altmejd]] or [[Jan Fabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/the-collection|title=The collection – Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|website=www.fine-arts-museum.be|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years now, the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]  has been the most popular art institution in Belgium. In 2015, the Museum had its best attended year so far with a total of 767.355 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Visitor-Figures-2015-LO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was accompanied by a significant increase in corporate funding. From 2005 until 2017, the number of visitors has doubled and the turnover tripled, thereby reducing the State contribution from 54.4% of the global budget to 32%. And this has been achieved during a period of very severe budgetary cuts: 11% in 2013 and 2014, 30% for the period 2015-2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/michel-draguet-reconduit-la-direction-des-musees-royaux-des-beaux-arts-de-belgique-132655|title=Michel Draguet reconduit à la direction des Musées royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique - 28 avril 2017 - lejournaldesarts.fr|website=Le Journal Des Arts|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online and digital outreach of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is considered as pioneer. In this perspective, Draguet initiated the ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' project which allows members of the public to delve into the works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] († Brussels, 1569). While the artist and his paintings are instantly recognizable worldwide, every composition also depicts a whole host of characters - some surprising, others familiar - and vignettes that provide the subtext of history, which are masterpieces worthy of exploration in their own right.

Drawing on a wide spectrum of virtual and on-site experiences, this unique initiative offers everyone the chance to immerse themselves in Bruegel’s works by honing in on the details of each painting and accessing expert knowledge. By delving deeper into the artist’s world, the viewer will discover the unexpected elements in Bruegel’s works which constitute the pinnacle of the Flemish master’s craft. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] launched this project jointly with the [[Google Cultural Institute]] in anticipation of the 450thanniversary of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]’s death, in 2019. The project brings together major international museums, many of which are European, around the focal figure of Bruegel the Elder. This innovative concept is the fruit of in-depth thinking on current transformations in the field of museology as it adapts to the digital era.

The ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' virtual exhibitions' can be accessed on the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]’s interactive screens, on their mobile app and on the [[Google Cultural Institute]] platform.

=== Royal Museums of Art and History ===
[[File:Park of the Cinquantenaire - Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels, 2010 (HDR 1).jpg|thumb|339x339px|Royal Museums of Art and History of Belgium]]
From 1st August 2010 till 28 February 2014, Michel Draguet was designated temporary Director-General of the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This entity includes the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Museum of Antiquities]], the Museum of Non-European Civilizations, the Museum of the Decorative Arts, the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower, [[Halle Gate]], and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]].

He was charged to manage this institution, which was then in crisis, to overhaul its accounts and structure. Under his leading, the museum put together a restructuring plan that, starting with the merging of the support staff, created enough flexibility to allow modernization of the administrative organizations of both entities – the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]] and [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]].

Michel Draguet initiated a large project of redeployment of both institutions. The home of the former would house collections of a more universalist nature, on the model of the [[Louvre]] and [[British Museum]], and that of the latter would offer a more “national” foundation that broadens to embrace a European dynamic comprising the very future of Brussels as the capital of what is today a common space. From there came the idea of redeploying the collections in accordance with two guidelines: first, to bring the federal collections together in one place; second, to develop theme-based museums that complement rather than compete with one another.

Together the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]] and [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Art and History]] welcome more than 1.1 million visitors a year: this is the equivalent of the population of Brussels. Merged, the two institutions would increase their attractiveness to the public: by reorganizing the presentation of the collections between the different institutions; by creating poles of scientific excellence based on the strong points of the collections; by creating new museum entities that offer a new dimension for marketing the city of Brussels; and by rationalizing the teams and practices employed. For the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], the entities proposed are as follows : a Museum of Non-European Civilizations, which would initially be a world museum through the eyes of Europeans, on the basis of which a new intercultural dialogue could be initiated; a Museum of Antiquities as a platform for the European identity; and a Museum of Music that will broaden the perspectives of the current [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]]. Plus a few heritage assets – the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower and [[Halle Gate]] – which contribute to the attractiveness of the city.

His plan for redeployment of both the collections and personnel that would culminate in the fusion of the two entities was discussed at the Belgian Parliament in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Without initiative from the politics and considering that his Secretary of State was not supporting the reforme led by him and by the Chairman of [[BELSPO|Belspo]] [http://plus.wikimonde.com/wiki/Philippe_Mettens Philippe Mettens], Michel Draguet decided to step down in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml|title=La Chambre des représentants de Belgique|website=www.dekamer.be|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once widespread across Europe in [[medieval university|medieval times]], they are now largely restricted to the oldest universities of Sweden and Finland, in part because of the violent conflicts between the nations in university towns in other countries. Medieval universities were large metropolitan centres with students from many different domestic and foreign regions. Students who were born within the same region usually spoke the same language, expected to be ruled by their own familiar laws, and therefore joined together to form the nations. The most similar comparison in the Anglo-world to the nation system is in [[Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom|the collegiate system of older British universities]] or [[fraternities]] at [[U.S.|American]] universities; however, both of these comparisons are imperfect. In Portugal and Brazil, there are fraternities called ''[[:pt:república estudantil|Repúblicas]]'', but this has nothing to do with the ''natio'' original concept of nations (they are created for lodgement purposes).{{clarify|date=September 2016}}

==Examples in medieval universities==

===University of Paris===
[[File:Four nations of the University of Paris.png|thumb|Map showing the territories covered by the four original nations of the [[University of Paris]] during the [[Middle Ages]].]]
In the [[University of Paris]] there were the [[French people|French]], [[Normans]], [[Picardy|Picards]], and the [[English people|English]], and later the [[Alemannia]]n nation. [[Jean Gerson]] was twice elected procurator for the French ''natio'' (i.e. the French-born students at the university) in 1383 and 1384, while studying [[theology]] at Paris. Also at Paris, Germanic speakers were grouped into a single nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmouAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22+natio+Germanorum+et+Scotorum%22&amp;lr= |title=Miscellanea Scotica: Memoirs of the ancient alliance between France and ... - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v6wQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22+natio+Germanorum+et+Scotorum%22&amp;lr= |title=Historical Tales of the Wars of Scotland, and of the Border Raids, Forays ... - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various nations in Paris often quarreled with one another; [[Jacques de Vitry]] wrote of the students:

"They affirmed that the English were drunkards and had tails; the sons of France proud, effeminate and carefully adorned like women. They said that the Germans were furious and obscene at their feasts; the Normans, vain and boastful; the Poitevins, traitors and always adventurers. The Burgundians they considered vulgar and stupid. The Bretons were reputed to be fickle and changeable, and were often reproached for the death of Arthur. The Lombards were called avaricious, vicious and cowardly; the Romans, seditious, turbulent and slanderous; the Sicilians, tyrannical and cruel; the inhabitants of Brabant, men of blood, incendiaries, brigands and ravishers; the Flemish, fickle, prodigal, gluttonous, yielding as butter, and slothful. After such insults from words they often came to blows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/source/vitry1.asp |title=Medieval Sourcebook:  Jacques de Vitry: Life of the Students at Paris |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Oxford===
The students who attended the medieval university in Oxford arranged themselves into two nations who quarrelled constantly. These two nations were called the ''australes'' and the ''boreales''. The ''australes'' originated from south of the [[River Trent]] and was the more powerful of the two nations. The Welsh were also considered part of the  ''australes'', along with scholars from the Romance lands. The ''boreales'' came mainly from the north of England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eQxAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Medieval%20oxford%20australes&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q=Medieval%20oxford%20australes&amp;f=false |title=Mobs: An Interdisciplinary Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nations at Oxford were eventually disbanded in 1274 in an effort to maintain peace in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZPx8TmNKVYC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;dq=rashdall%20universities%20oxford%20nations&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q=nation&amp;f=false |title=Rasdhall's Universities of Europe, Vol 2 |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measure was largely unsuccessful and conflicts between the nations continued. One such as on 29 April 1388 when Welsh students, who were according to the chronicler [[Henry Knighton]] ''semper inquieti'', fought with their northern counterparts. The following year the ''boreales'' ran amok in the town chanting 'war, war, war, slay, slay, slay the Welsh dogs' killing and looting as they went, before rounding up the remaining Welsh students and urinating on them as they kissed the town's gateposts 'goodbye'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themedievalstudent.wordpress.com/2012/05/06/war-war-war-slay-slay-slay-the-welsh-dogs/ |title=The medieval student |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Prague===
A similar division of students had been adopted at the [[Charles University in Prague]], where from its opening in 1347 the [[studium generale]] was divided among [[Bohemia|Bohemian]] (for local students), [[Bavaria|Bavarian]], [[Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Poland|Polish]] ''nations''. When there was not a "natio" of a student's birth territory, students were assigned to another nation.

===University of Leipzig===
When the [[University of Leipzig]] was established in 1409 by scholars from the University of Prague,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Zancke | first = Friedrich | title = Die Statutenbücher der Universität Leipzig aus den ersten 150 Jahren ihres Bestehens| url = https://archive.org/details/diestatutenbch00leip |publisher = S.

===University of Bologna===
In medieval [[Bologna]], there existed three separate universities. Two for the study of law, one for students from Italy (but not Bologna) the ''universitas citramontanorum'' and another for students from outside the peninsula the ''universitas ultramontanorum''. The final school was for the study of arts and medicine ''universitas artisarum et medicorum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=university%20of%20bologna%20ultramontane&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q=nations&amp;f=false |title=A history of the universities in Europe, Volume 1 - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ultramontane'' university was divided into fourteen different nations as early as 1265, such as the Gauls, Picards, Burgundians, Norman, Catalan, Hungarian, English, Gascon ''et al.'' whereas the ''citramontane'' university was split into three nations; the Romans, Tuscans and Lombards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4-eLaN99PEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=medieval%20universities%20nations&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20universities%20nations&amp;f=false |title=Rashdall's Universities of Europe, Volume 1 - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Universität Bologna Deutsche Nation.jpg|thumb|Students entering the ''Natio Germanica Bononiae'' (15th century)]]
The most important and powerful of the ''ultramontane'' [[University of Bologna]] was the German nation. One of its most famous members was [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] who, in 1496, enrolled into the ''Natio Germanorum'' (Natio of the Germans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEZrYxkjLkIC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22natio+germanorum%22&amp;sig=Dsr0AwrAI75N3ndXb5wHXWJaL4Q#PPA39,M1 |title=Documenta Copernicana: Urkunden, Akten und Nachrichten : Texte und Übersetzungen - Nicolaus Copernicus - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skMBAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22natio+germanorum%22&amp;dq=%22natio+germanorum%22&amp;pgis=1 |title=The Sleepwalkers - Arthur Koestler - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9r0RfQtpU6AC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=natio+copernicus&amp;sig=wZg0maLYGyn-N2P7-bO7_q6s0Jc#v=onepage&amp;q=Nationis%20Germanorum&amp;f=false |title=The Life of Copernicus (1473-1543) - Pierre Gassendi, Oliver Thill - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a privileged university organization that included German-speaking students from many regions of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote="Although great importance has frequently been ascribed to this fact, it does not by any means imply that Copernicus ever considered himself to be a German.

===University of Padua===
Students in the [[University of Padua]] were divided in 22 nations, which referred to the different territories ruled by the [[Republic of Venice]], to the biggest states of [[Italy]], and to the main states of [[Europe]]. Nations were: German (also called Alemannian), Bohemian, Hungarian, Provençal, Burgundian, Spanish, Polish, English, Scottish, Venetian, Overseas (Venetian Greek Islands), Lombard (East Lombardy and West Veneto), Trevisan (North and East Veneto), Friulian, Dalmatian, Milanese, Roman, Sicilian, Anconitan, Tuscan, Piedmontese and Genoan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unipd.it/archivio/archiviostorico/archivioantico/nationes.htm |title=Archivio antico - Archivio Generale di Ateneo - Università degli Studi di Padova |publisher=Unipd.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=November 2010}} 
{{main article|Nations in Finnish universities}}
In [[Finland]], student nations ({{lang-fi|osakunnat}}) exist at the [[University of Helsinki]] and [[Aalto University School of Science and Technology]], where they are legally sanctioned and established in the mid-1600s and 1800s, respectively. Named after regions in Finland, students had to join according to their own geographical roots before membership became voluntary in 1937. Today, students can usually choose to join any nation. Both Finnish and Swedish speaking nations exist. Organizations termed ''nations'' exist also at other universities, although they are legally considered ''associations''. In Finland, student nations co-exist with a wide range of other student organizations, such as [[Student unionism in Finland|Student Unions]].

==Scotland==
{{main article|Nations in Scottish universities}}
Nations exist in some of the [[ancient universities]] in [[Scotland]], although their significance has largely been forgotten. Nations never existed at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and were abolished at St Andrews following discussions at the Royal Commission on the Universities of Scotland, which later led to the [[Universities (Scotland) Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/medieval_university.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605183405/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/medieval_university.pdf |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/officersofmarisc00aberuoft/officersofmarisc00aberuoft_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Officers of the Marischal College and University of Aberdeen, 1593-1860" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student nations continued into modern times at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Glasgow]] for the specific purpose of electing a [[Ancient university governance in Scotland#The Rector|Rector]] of the university.

==Sweden==
{{main article|Nations in Swedish universities}}
When [[Uppsala University]] was founded in 1477, the system of 'nationes' was copied from Sorbonne in Paris where a Scandinavian nation had existed. At the Swedish universities of [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[Lund University|Lund]], a [[Nations in Swedish universities|system of student nations]] (''nationer'') remains, and until June 30, 2010 students were required to enroll in a nation. Historically, also [[Tartu University]], founded in 1632 in then [[Swedish Estonia]] had nations. It is now voluntary, but still most of the students choose to remain members. The nations are named on regional lines, where the nations in Lund take their names from provinces and areas in southern Sweden, and those in Uppsala take their names from all over Sweden, except for the [[Scanian lands]], the traditional catchment area for Lund, which was founded in 1666 to provide higher education for the youth in the newly conquered areas. (Until 2010, there was a "Skånelandens nation" in Uppsala, but it had no activity, and only existed as a [[legal fiction]] for those students who did not wish to take part in the activities of the other nations.)

Traditionally, students were required to be members of the nations whose area one came from, but with one exception ([[Södermanlands-Nerikes nation]] at Uppsala, though international students are an exception to this), this requirement is now voided. The nations are in charge of the kinds of social activities which are at other universities normally handled by the student unions, such as bars, clubs, theatre companies, orchestras, sports societies, and also some housing.

'''Noureddin Zarrinkelk''' (also spelled '''Zarrin-Kelk''', also known as '''Noori''' or '''Nouri''', born 9 April 1937 in [[Mashhad]]) is an [[Iranian animation|Iranian animator]], concept artist, editor, graphic designer, illustrator, layout artist, photographer, script writer and sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120206022016/http://www.qoqnoos.com/body/animation/zarrinkelck/RESUME.htm Director &amp; Animator: Zarrin kelk Noureddin]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied pharmacy at [[Tehran University]] and holds a PharmD. Then he studied animation film in the Belgium Royal Academy Of Fine Arts (Raoul Servais) from 1969 till 1972. 
 
Zarrinkelk founded the first school of Animation, which later merged with the prestigious faculty of fine art of [[Tehran University]]. Zarrinkelk continued being a professor of animation and graphic arts well into his retirement age.

Since 1971, Zarrinkelk has been Jury member of various international animation festivals and illustration biennials.

Zarrinkelk was elected as the president of [[ASIFA]] (Association International du Film d'Animation) by his peers in 2003.

Zarrinkelk is known as the father of animation of Iran.

==Influence==
The art of animation as practised in modern day Iran started in 1950s. [[History of Iranian animation|Iran's animation]] owes largely to Noureddin Zarrinkelk. Zarrinkelk was instrumental in founding the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults ([[IIDCYA]]) in Tehran in collaboration with the late father of Iranian graphics [[Morteza Momayez]] and other fellow artists like [[Farshid Mesghali]], [[Ali Akbar Sadeghi]] and Arapik Baghdasarian, among others.

'''Pedro Noel''' is a Brazilian journalist and graduated philosopher. According to Romanian media, he is also an Internet media activist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matzal|first=Andra|title=Guverne" de cartier și colonii ecologice. Ce avem de învățat de la mișcarea Occupy|url=http://totb.ro/%E2%80%9Dguverne%E2%80%9D-de-cartier-si-colonii-ecologice-ce-avem-de-invatat-de-la-miscarea-occupy|publisher=Think Outside The Box|accessdate=6 April 2012|location=Bucharest}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as 'one of those who made 700 thousand Spaniards take the streets' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zoltan|first=Petru|title=Omul care a scos 700.000 de spanioli în stradă: &lt;&lt;În statul român, represiunile şi supravegherea sunt mai puternice&gt;&gt;|url=http://www.jurnalul.ro/special/proteste-spania-romania-607400.htm|publisher=Jornalul|accessdate=19 March 2012|location=Bucharest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whistleblowing and investigative journalism ==

In December 2010, under the handle of 'FuturePress', Noel and Carrion started to write to the news portal WLCentral.org [http://wlcentral.org] where they exposed in different languages and using different approaches for more than one year analysis on whistleblowing material, articles and reports on human-rights violations, civic-movements and net-neutrality.

In the late 2011, Pedro Noel along with other journalists started the [[Associated Whistleblowing Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Andersen|first=Anna|title=Shine a light|url=http://grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Shine-A-Light|publisher=Reykavik Grapevine|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=Reykjavik}}&lt;/ref&gt; a media agency focused on the defense of human rights by promoting transparency, freedom of information and speech, whistleblowing and investigative journalism, conceived as a global network made up of cooperative local platforms and actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Veal|first=Lowana|title=Alternative to Wikileaks Arises in Iceland|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/09/alternative-to-wikileaks-arises-in-iceland/|publisher=IPS International Press News|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=Reykjavik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the editor of AWP, Pedro Noel took part in more than 50 revelations of wrongdoing, corruption and abuse in [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Iceland]], since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=AWP - Publications |url=https://data.awp.is|publisher=AWP|accessdate=1 Jan 2016|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Denouncing freedom of expression violations in Ecuador and Latin America ==

In a controversial session at 32nd [[Chaos Communication Congress]] in Hamburg in 2015, Noel held a talk with Canadian journalist [[Bethany Horne]] denouncing violations of free speech standards by the Ecuadorian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noel|first=Pedro|title=Ecuador: how an authoritarian government is fooling the entire world |url=https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7134-ecuador_how_an_authoritarian_government_is_fooling_the_entire_world|publisher=CCC|accessdate=28 Dec 2015|location=Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the talk, Pedro Noel released documents providing evidence that press and media coverage of critical issues were considered by Ecuadorian government as risk factors for democratic stability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noel|first=Pedro|title=Reporte de la Inteligencia Ecuatoriana (SENAIN) sobre factores de riesgo y amenazas a la estabilidad democrática |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/senain/amenazas/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=28 Dec 2015|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the local platform [[Ecuador Transparente]], operated by [[Associated Whistleblowing Press]]. The publication followed previous denounces, also performed by [[Ecuador Transparente]], of physical and on-line surveillance and spying against activists, journalists and politicians in Ecuador, performed by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=SENAIN llevó a cabo espionaje sistemático a políticos y activistas |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/senain/vigilancia/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=5 Aug 2015|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, Noel also took part in the publication of alleged proofs of illegal Internet censorship performed by Ecuadorian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=El gobierno ecuatoriano y la Asociación de Proveedores de Internet trabajan juntos para bloquear el acceso a páginas web |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/censura-movistar/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=14 Apr 2016|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Katitza|title=Leaked Documents Confirm Ecuador’s Internet Censorship Machine |url=https://www.eff.org/nl/node/91232|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)|accessdate=14 Apr 2016|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Pedro Noel also participated in the release of the [[Godwin Papers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Los papeles de Godwin |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/papeles-godwin/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=14 Nov 2016|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed on-line harassment and discredit campaigns managed by the Ecuadorian government against local journalists, media outlets and the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Filtración revela que gobierno ecuatoriano pagó campaña contra la CIDH y Fundamedios|url=http://www.fundamedios.org/alertas/filtracion-revela-que-gobierno-ecuatoriano-pago-campana-contra-la-cidh-y-fundamedios/|publisher=Fundamedios|accessdate=16 Nov 2016|location=Ecuador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social networks ==

In 2011, along with other Internet activists and researchers, Pedro Noel started&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roos|first=Jerome|title=Virality: international media coverage of The Global Square|url=http://roarmag.org/2012/02/global-square-wikileaks-media-social-network/|publisher=RoarMag.org|accessdate=19 March 2012|location=Online magazine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Redes sociais sem censura e com privacidade|url=http://www.fne.org.br/fne/index.php/fne/jornal/edicao_121_junho_2012/redes_sociais_sem_censura_e_com_privacidade|publisher=Jornal do Engenheiro|accessdate=1 June 2012|location=Brasilia, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project TheGlobalSquare in partnership with [[Delft University of Technology|TU Delft]] and its project [[Tribler]]. The social network is focused on attack and censorship resilient P2P information broadcasting and social systems.

== Spanish Indignados ==

Along with Santiago Carrion, Noel founded the news portal EuropeanRevolution.net [http://europeanrevolution.net], a portal conceived as an informative platform for activists, having as  first goal to translate into English what was happening with the 15 May movement and in the squares occupations around Europe in order to expand its impact worldwide.

This led Noel to collaborate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hérard|first=Pascal|title=Les indignés européens marchent sur Paris|url=http://www.tv5.org/cms/chaine-francophone/info/Les-dossiers-de-la-redaction/Mouvement-des-indignes-2011/p-17709-Les-indignes-europeens-marchent-sur-Paris.htm|publisher=TV5 Monde|accessdate=15 September 2011|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; with TakeTheSquare.net [http://TakeTheSquare.net] 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moreira|first=Ana Beatriz|title=

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noel|first=Pedro|title=WL Central: An endorsed WikiLeaks resource|url=http://wlcentral.org/users/futurepress|publisher=wlcentral.org|accessdate=19 March 2014|location=Online magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; project, originally formed as an extension of the International Committee of the camp that started in Puerta del Sol, Madrid, Spain. The project was aimed to create a task-force seeking structured change of the worldwide political reality- designed to bring the May 15th ideals to a global context.

Noel and other were the responsible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zoltan|first=Petru|title=Omul care a scos 700.000 de spanioli în stradă: &lt;&lt;În statul român, represiunile şi supravegherea sunt mai puternice&gt;&gt;|url=http://www.jurnalul.ro/special/proteste-spania-romania-607400.htm|publisher=Jornalul|accessdate=19 March 2012|location=Bucharest}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the worldwide online campaign which culminated in the global day of action on [[15 October 2011 global protests|October 15th 2011]] in more than 950 cities in 82 countries and its main website 15October.net [https://web.archive.org/web/20110923151059/http://15october.net/].

Pol-Int is headed by Dagmara Jajeśniak-Quast and based at the Center for Interdisciplinary Polish Studies (ZIP) at the [[Viadrina European University|European University Viadrina]] in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] and at the Collegium Polonicum in [[Słubice]]. The platform is co-financed by the [http://fwpn.org.pl/en/ Foundation for Polish-German Cooperation], the [http://www.pnfn.pl/pl/ Polish-German Foundation for Science], the [[Viadrina European University|European University Viadrina]] and the [[European Regional Development Fund]].

== Profile ==
Pol-Int offers up-to-date information on Polish studies worldwide: publications, journals and articles, [[review]]s, job offers (including scholarships and grants), events, conference reports, and calls for papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pancerz|first=Patrycja|date=|title=Projekt bardzo patriotyczny, czyli wszystko o Polsce|url=|journal=Studens scribit|language=Polish|volume=1 |issue=17 |year=2017|pages=29–31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone interested in the field of Polish studies can register, set up an individual profile, as well as publish and obtain information, share and promote their own [[Research|research projects]], and find project partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moz.de/artikel-ansicht/dg/0/1/1444078/|title=Der etwas andere Hörsaal|last=Adesiyan|first=Frauke|date=2015-12-15|work=Märkische Oderzeitung|access-date=2018-02-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Pol-Int serves as a networking tool for scholars dealing with [[Poland]] past and present, its culture, society, economy, and so forth.

All posts on the platform are further disseminated through a customizable [[newsletter]]. The platform is based on and prospers from the commitment and active participation of its academic community.

In 2016, Pol-Int launched the academic blog “Salon” – a separate space within the platform to discuss current pressing issues in [[Poland]], to debate them at expert meetings, such as panel discussions, and to later publish the results in [[Article (publishing)|articles]], [[review]]s and [[interview]]s online. The “Salon” is meant to bridge the gap between the traditional analogue and the digital sphere of contemporary [[research]], in order to promote exchange between both realms.

== Editorial board ==
The editorial board is based in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. Thanks to an expanding cooperation with more than 100 voluntary specialist [[Editing|editors]] from over 25 [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] who [[Scholarly peer review|peer-review]] texts before publication, Pol-Int publishes reviews in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. The [[editorial board]] reviews more than 150 recently published monographs or anthologies and academic articles per year and coordinates the workflow with the specialist editors and reviewers. All publications on Pol-Int are required and certified to maintain the level of renowned [[academic journal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jez|first=Katarzyna|date=June 2015|title=Innovative Online Platform for Polish Studies|url=http://aseees.org/sites/default/files/downloads/2015June_1.pdf|journal=NewsNet|volume=55/3, p. 5.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Right To Play''' is a global organization that attempts to teach children in need with educational games. It was founded in 2000 by Olympic gold medalist Johann Olav Koss, Right To Play's programs are facilitated by more than 14,900 local volunteer coaches and more than 620 international staff.

Working in both the humanitarian and development context, Right To Play builds local capacity by training community leaders as coaches to deliver its programs in 18 countries affected by war, poverty, and disease in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and North America. Right To Play is headquartered in Toronto, Canada and has national offices in Canada, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The national offices raise funds, build awareness for Right To Play programs and advocate for play based learning.

==The Fundraising Years – Supporting International Humanitarian Partners==

Between 1994 and 2000, Right to Play, formerly Olympic Aid, continued to raise funds for children in disadvantaged situations, building on the momentum of subsequent Olympic Games. In 1996, Olympic Aid formed a partnership with UNICEF and raised $13 million USD prior to and during the Games in Atlanta. The funds assisted UNICEF in vaccinating approximately 12.2 million children and more than 800,000 women.

This vaccination effort was extraordinary as it resulted in temporary Olympic Truces in Afghanistan and the Kurdish region in northern Iraq. All fighting stopped in the regions so the UNICEF staff could safely immunize the children and women of these areas.

==Transition to Direct Implementation – Working With International Partners==
With its incorporation in late 2000, Olympic Aid (which became Right To Play) made the transition from “fundraising vehicle” to implementing Non-Governmental Organization (NGO).  In March 2001, the first sport and play programs began in refugee communities in Angola and Côte d'Ivoire.

During the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Olympic Aid hosted a Roundtable Forum entitled “Healthier, Safer, Stronger: Using Sport for Development to build a brighter future for children worldwide”. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan gave the keynote address while global leaders in health, sport and development participated in a moderated discussion of the role of sport in relation to four development issues: vaccination, tobacco-free sport, HIV and AIDS prevention and the rehabilitation of refugees. With participants including Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Dr. Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee, the Olympic Aid Roundtable placed Sport for Development firmly on the UN agenda.

==Controversy==
===Ban from 2010 Winter Olympics===
In October 2008, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]] (VANOC) announced that Right To Play would be banned from an official role at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref name="2010ban-CBC"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[The Canadian Press]]|title=Charity booted from 2010 Olympic village over sponsorship conflicts|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/charity-booted-from-2010-olympic-village-over-sponsorship-conflicts-1.725855|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=October 3, 2008|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two committees cited sponsorship conflicts as the reason behind the ban, identifying Right To Play sponsors such as [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Scotiabank]], and [[Mitsubishi]] as competitors to Olympic sponsors [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]], [[Royal Bank of Canada]], and [[General Motors]].&lt;ref name="2010ban-CBC"/&gt; Right To Play had been present in an official role at every Summer and Winter Olympics since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], and since [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] as Olympic Aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The Canadian Press|title=IOC says Right to Play not welcomed at Olympics|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/ioc-says-right-to-play-not-welcomed-at-olympics-1.362871|publisher=[[CTV News]]|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rijnlands Lyceum Foundation''' is an educational organisation in the Netherlands encompassing seven different schools offering both primary and [[secondary education]]. The foundation is based in [[Wassenaar]]. The executive director of the organisation is Dr. Maarten Knoester (since 2008), the chairman of the supervisory board is [[Frans Weisglas]] (since 2010), former chairman of the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament. As chairman of the supervisory board Mr Weisglas succeeded [[Hans Dijkstal]], former vice-prime minister of the Netherlands.

==Schools in the organisation==
The organisation comnprises eight schools:
*Het Rijnlands Lyceum Oegstgeest
*Het Rijnlands Lyceum Sassenheim
*Het Rijnlands Lyceum Wassenaar

*[[International School of The Hague]] (primary)
*European School The Hague - ''Rijnlands Lyceum'' (primary)
*European School The Hague - ''Rijnlands Lyceum'' (secondary) 
* Eerste Nederlandse Montessori School (primary)

The first three schools have three levels of secondary education: [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|MAVO]], [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]], and [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]]. They also offer bilingual education, in English and Dutch. In addition Rijnlands Lyceum Oegstgeest has an international department offering the MYP and IB DP. The International School of The Hague is an international primary school and an international secondary school, offering the IPC, the MYP and the IB DP programmes. The European School The Hague opened in 2012 for primary education and 2014 for secondary education, and serves the children of people working in The Hague at, for example, agencies of the European Union. The Eerste Nederlandse Montessori School is a regular Dutch primary school based in The Hague.

The most important aspects of '''science and technology in Argentina''' are concerned with medicine, nuclear physics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, space and rocket technology and several fields related to the country's main economic activities. According to the [[World Bank]], Argentine exports in high-technology are products with high R&amp;D intensity, such as in aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and electrical machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Data |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TX.VAL.TECH.CD |title=High-technology exports (current US$) &amp;#124; Data &amp;#124; Table |website=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benefiting from [[Latin America]]'s highest literacy rates since shortly after [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] made primary education universally available in the 1860s and 1870s, Argentine researchers and professionals at home and abroad continue to enjoy a high standing in their fields. Argentine [[Bernardo Houssay]] was the first Latin American awarded with a [[Nobel Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Probably for that, the Argentine education is referred as the ''Latin American docta''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Eminences in their fields==
[[File:Agote 1a transfusión.jpg|thumb|Dr. [[Luis Agote]] (''second from right'') overseeing the first safe and effective blood transfusion (1914)]]
Despite its modest budget and numerous setbacks, academics and the sciences in Argentina have enjoyed an international respect since the turn of the 1900s, when Dr. [[Luis Agote]] devised the first safe and effective means of [[blood transfusion]] as well as [[René Favaloro]], who was a pioneer in the improvement of the [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]] . Argentina is the Latin American country with the most [[List of Nobel laureates by country|Nobel Prize laureates]]; and has three Nobel Prize winners in the sciences: [[Bernardo Houssay]] in Physiology or Medicine in 1947, [[Luis Federico Leloir]] in Chemistry in 1970, and [[César Milstein]] in Physiology or Medicine in 1984. Dr. [[Domingo Liotta]] created the first artificial heart in 1969, revolutionizing the heart transplant field.

They have also contributed to [[Biology|bioscience]] in efforts like the [[Human Genome Project]], where Argentine scientists have successfully mapped the [[genome]] of a living being, a world first.&lt;ref name="science"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.ar/sw_section.php?id=361 |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111140430/http://www.argentina.ar/sw_section.php?id=361 |archivedate=November 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina has its own satellite programme, nuclear power station designs (4th generation) and public nuclear energy company [[INVAP]], which provides several countries with nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.ar/sw_seccion.php?id=124&amp;idioma_sel=en |accessdate=June 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617145706/http://www.argentina.ar/sw_seccion.php?id=124&amp;idioma_sel=en |archivedate=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aquarius SAC-D satellite.png|left|upright|thumb|SAC-D satellite]]

Other projects are focusing on IS, nanotechnology, biotechnology, helicopters, farming machinery and military defensive systems. Established in 1991, the [[CONAE]] has since launched 8 indigenous built satellites successfully, AMSAT, MuSat, SAC-B, SAC-A, SAC-C, SAC-D/Aquarius, ARSAT I and ARSAT-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conae.gov.ar/index.php/espanol/registro-de-satelites|title=Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales - REGISTRO DE SATELITES|first=Super|last=User|date=|website=www.conae.gov.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conae.gov.ar/eng/satelites/satelites.html |accessdate=June 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204030327/http://www.conae.gov.ar/eng/satelites/satelites.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, secured an agreement with the [[European Space Agency]] on for the installation of a 35-m diameter antenna and other mission support facilities at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]]. The facility will contribute to numerous ESA space probes, as well as CONAE's own, domestic research projects. Chosen from 20 potential sites and one of only three such ESA installations in the world, the new antenna will create a triangulation which will allow the ESA to ensure mission coverage around the clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buenosairesherald.com/BreakingNews/View/4670 |title=Interplanetary support station to be installed in Argentina |website=BuenosAiresHerald.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social sciences]] have a particularly strong tradition in Argentina. Home to 122 [[think tanks]] specializing in [[public policy]] and [[economics]] issues, Argentina ranks fifth in the number of these institutions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/01/25/sociedad/s-01846328.htm |title=Argentina, quinto país en el mundo en centros de estudio |website=Clarin.com |date=2009-01-25 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Dr. [[Sandra Díaz (scientist)|Sandra Díaz]], researcher from the [[Instituto Multidisciplinario de Biologia Vegetal]] (IMBIV - [[NU of C]]), was elected as a foreign associate member to the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.) in recognition of her outstanding work on climate change, being the first Hispanic woman to achieve this honor. Moreover, Dr. Diaz won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 as a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.argentina.ar/_en/science-and-education/C1914-a-argentina-in-the-science-academy.php |accessdate=May 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531161144/http://www.en.argentina.ar/_en/science-and-education/C1914-a-argentina-in-the-science-academy.php |archivedate=May 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leloir festejando.jpg|thumb|Dr. [[Luis Federico Leloir]] (''left'') and his staff toast his 1970 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.]]

Currently there are further outstanding Argentine researchers in the mentioned institution as Alberto Carlos Frasch ([[NU of SAM]]), Armando Parodi ([[NU of SAM]] - [[Leloir Institute]]), and Francisco de la Cruz ([[Balseiro Institute]] - [[NU of Cu]]).

Among the public institutions devoted to research and development in Argentina are:
*[[CITEDEF]]: [[Ministry of Defense (Argentina)|Defense]] Scientific and Technical Research Institute
*[[National Atomic Energy Commission|CNEA]]: National [[Nuclear power|Atomic Energy]] Commission
*[[Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales|CONAE]]: National [[space program|Space Activities]] Commission
*[[CONICET]]: the National Research Council
*[[Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria|INTA]]: National Agricultural Technology Institute
*[[Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial|INTI]]: National Industrial Technology Institute
*[[INVAP]]: Argentine high-technology research &amp; development company

==A well-educated work force==
[[Image:World literacy map UNHD 2007 2008.png|thumb|350px|Literacy Level]]
Four out of five Argentine adults have completed grade school, over a third have completed their secondary education and one in nine Argentine adults have college degrees. Likewise, Argentina has the highest rate of university students in Latin America, besides having more within the southern hemisphere with professors and institutions awarded prestigious prizes and fellowships from philanthropic institutions like the John S.

The "'''Subversive Proposal'''" was an Internet posting by [[Stevan Harnad]] on June 27 1994&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.ca/group/bit.listserv.vpiej-l/browse_thread/thread/682843612b4ff4d/62b3bd13407dc1d8?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22We+have+heard+many+predictions+about+the+demise+of+paper+publishing%22 Subversive Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/groups?q=harnad+%22subversive+proposal%22&amp;start=0&amp;scoring=d&amp;hl=en&amp;filter=0 Discussion Archive of Subversive Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; (presented at the 1994 Network Services Conference in London &lt;ref&gt;[http://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=serialst;8e89574c.9409 1994 Network Services Conference, London]&lt;/ref&gt;) calling on all authors of "esoteric" research writings to archive their articles for free for everyone online (in [[anonymous FTP]] archives or websites). It initiated a series of online exchanges, many of which were collected and published as a book in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Shumelda Okerson]] &amp; [[James J. O'Donnell]] (Eds.)

American Scientist Open Access Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; until the founding of the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] which first coined the term "Open Access"). The Subversive Proposal also led to the development of the [[GNU]] [[EPrints]] software used for creating [[Open Archives Initiative|OAI]]-compliant [[open access]] [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]].

The proposal was updated gradually across the years, as summarized in the American Scientist Open Access Forum on its 10th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserver.sigmaxi.org/sc/wa.exe?A2=ind04&amp;L=american-scientist-open-access-forum&amp;D=1&amp;O=D&amp;F=l&amp;S=&amp;P=58204 "June 27, 2004: The 1994 'Subversive Proposal' at 10"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swami Kuvalayananda''' (30 August 1883 – 18 April 1966) was a researcher and educator who is primarily known for his pioneering research into the scientific foundations of yoga. He started scientific research on yoga in 1920, and published the first scientific journal specifically devoted to studying yoga, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120620192320/http://kdham.com/newsbooks/publications/yoga-mimamsa/ Yoga Mimamsa], in 1924. Most of his research took place at the [[Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center]] which he also founded in 1924. His influence on modern yoga has been "profound" &lt;ref name="Alter2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph S. Alter|title=Yoga in Modern India: The Body between Science and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6anlz6i71oC&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=24 August 2012|date=30 August 2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-11874-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Swami Kuvalayananda was born Jagannatha Ganesa Gune in a traditional Karhade Brahmin family in the village Dhaboi in [[Gujarat]] state, [[India]].. Kuvalayananda’s father, Sri Ganesa Gune, was a teacher and his mother, Srimati Saraswati, a housewife. The family was not rich and had to depend for some time on public and private charity. Being from a poor family, Kuvalayananda had to struggle hard for his education. Nevertheless, at his [[matriculation]] in 1903, he was awarded  the [[Jagannath Shankarsheth]] Sanskrit Scholarship to study at [[Baroda College]] where he graduated in 1910.

During his student days, he was influenced by political leaders like [[Sri Aurobindo]], who was working as a young lecturer at the university, and [[Lokmanya Tilak]]'s  [[Indian Home Rule Movement]]. His national idealism and patriotic fervor prompted him to devote his life to the service of humanity. During this time, he took up a vow of lifelong [[celibacy]].

Coming into contact with the Indian masses, many of whom were illiterate and superstitious, he realized the value of education, and this influenced him to help organize the [[Khandesh]] Education Society at [[Amalner]], where ultimately he became the Principal of the National College, in 1916. The National College was closed down by the British Government in 1920 due to the spirit of [[Indian nationalism]] prevalent at the institution. From 1916 to 1923, he taught Indian culture studies to high school and college students.

== Yoga Education ==
Kuvalayananda's first [[guru]] was Rajaratna Manikrao, a professor at the  Jummadada Vyayamshala in [[Baroda]]. From 1907 to 1910, Manikrao trained Kuvalayananda in the Indian System of  [[Physical Education]] which Kuvalayananda advocated throughout his life. As early as the 1930s, Kuvalayananda trained large groups of yoga teachers as a way to spread physical education in India &lt;ref&gt;Alter 2004, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, he met the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[yogin]], Paramahamsa [[Madhavdasji]], who had settled at Malsar, near [[Baroda]], on the banks of the [[Narmada]] river. The insight into [[Yogic]] discipline, under the guidance of [[Madhavdasji]], greatly influenced Kuvalayananda's career. 
[[File:Paramahamsa Madhavdasji.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Paramahamsa Madhavdasji]]

Though Kuvalayananda was spiritually inclined and idealistic, he was, at the same time, a strict [[rationalist]]. So, he sought scientific explanations for the various [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] effects of Yoga he experienced. In 1920-21, he investigated the effects of some of the Yogic practices on the human body with the help of some of his students in a laboratory at [[Baroda]] Hospital. His subjective experience, coupled with the results of these scientific experiments, convinced him that the ancient system of Yoga, if understood through the modern scientific [[experimental system]], could help society. The idea of discovering the scientific basis behind these yogic processes became his life's work.

== Yoga Mimamsa ==

In 1924, Kuvalayananda founded the [[Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center]] in Lonavla in order to provide a laboratory for his scientific study of Yoga. At the same time, he also started the first scientific journal devoted to scientific investigation into yoga, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120620192320/http://kdham.com/newsbooks/publications/yoga-mimamsa/ Yoga Mimamsa].

The [[Sanskrit]] word [[mimamsa]] means "investigation."   [https://web.archive.org/web/20120620192320/http://kdham.com/newsbooks/publications/yoga-mimamsa/ Yoga Mimamsa], has been published quarterly every year since its founding and was scheduled to be indexed by [[EBSCO]] in 2012.

In Yoga Mimamsa, Swami Kuvalayananda and others published the first scientific experiments on yogic techniques, such as the effect of [[asana]], [[shatkarma]], [[Bandha (Yoga)|bandhas]], and [[pranayama]] on humans.&lt;ref&gt;Alter 2004, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

These experiments impressed some Western researchers who came to the [[Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center]] to learn more. Dr. Josephine Rathbone, a professor of health and physical education, visited from [[Columbia University]] in 1937 to 1938. K.T. Behanan, a doctoral candidate from [[Yale University]], wrote his dissertation on yoga after visiting in the late 1931, and staying for a year. In 1957, the physicians Wenger, from the [[University of California]], and Bagchi, from the [[University of Michigan]], spent a month and a half working there.&lt;ref&gt;Alter 2004, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Research and collaboration continues to this day.

==Later Years==

Besides his yoga research, Swami Kuvalayananda was a tireless promotor of his causes, and he spent much of his later years opening up new branches of [[Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center|Kaivalyadhama]] and enhancing the main [[Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center|Kaivalyadhama]] campus in [[Lonavla]].

In 1932, he opened the Mumbai branch of Kaivalyadhama at [[Santacruz, Mumbai|Santacruz]]. It was relocated to [[Marine Drive, Mumbai|Marine Drive]] ([[Chowpatty]]) in 1936, and named the Ishvardas Chunnilal Yogic Health Center. Its mandate is the prevention and cure of various diseases  through Yoga. In this same period, at Kanakesvara near [[Alibaug]], a Kaivalyadhama Spiritual Center in [[Colaba]]  was opened.

In 1943, he opened another branch of Kaivalyadhama in [[Rajkot]], [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], with spiritual practices as its main focus.

In 1944 at [[Lonavla]], the Kaivalyadhama Shriman Madhava Yoga Mandir Samiti was founded to pursue scientific and  literary research in Yoga

The Gordhandas Seksaria College of Yoga and Cultural Synthesis was established in 1951  at Lonavla  to prepare young people spiritually and intellectually for selfless service to  humanity.

In 1961, he opened the Srimati Amolak Devi Tirathram Gupta Yogic Hospital for the treatment of chronic functional disorders with the help of Yogic techniques.

Some of his pupils, like [[Padma Shri]] awardee, [[S. P. Nimbalkar]], have become known yoga teachers in their own rights.&lt;ref name="In Conversation With Dr. Nimbalkar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lokvani.com/lokvani/article.php?article_id=2261 | title=In Conversation With Dr. Nimbalkar | publisher=Lokvani | date=25 January 2005 | accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UnCollege''' is a social movement that aims to change the notion that going to college is the only path to success.&lt;ref name="uncollege"&gt;UnCollege. Retrieved from http://www.uncollege.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoHE"&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/disgruntled-college-student-starts-uncollege-to-challenge-system/29631 The Chronicle of Higher Education] ''Disgruntled College Student Starts ‘UnCollege’ to Challenge System'' By Jeff Young, February 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/06/03/stephens.college/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 College is a waste of time] By Dale Stephens, Special to CNN June 3, 2011 "a social movement empowering individuals to take their education beyond the classroom"&lt;/ref&gt; UnCollege was founded by Dale J. Stephens in 2011.&lt;ref name="Huffpost"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/10/uncollege-homeschooling-f_n_821343.html UnCollege: Home-Schooling For College Students] ''Huffington Post'', 02/10/11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thedartmouth"&gt;[http://thedartmouth.com/2011/02/28/news/uncollege Students develop new UnCollege curriculum] ''The Dartmouth'' Monday, February 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Stephens is a self-described "elementary school dropout", as he was   [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] with emphasis on real-world experience for the majority of his childhood.&lt;ref name="businessinsider"&gt;Gobry, Pascal-Emmanuel (2011-06-14). [http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-06-14/tech/30039115_1_higher-education-uncollege-talents Peter Thiel Is Giving This Man $100,000 To Disrupt College]. ''[[Business Insider]]'', 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly attended [[Hendrix College]]. While there, Stephens had a night-long discussion with a friend regarding the disconnect between the theoretical subject matter taught in college and its [[reality|real world]] applications.&lt;ref name=businessinsider /&gt; This discussion would become the basis for UnCollege, which Stephens founded in 2010.&lt;ref name=businessinsider /&gt;

In 2010, Stephens also applied for the [[Thiel Fellowship]], a program founded by [[Peter Thiel]] which grants fellows US$100,000 to forgo college for two years and focus on their passions.&lt;ref name="inc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Markowitz, Eric|title=Meet the College Dropouts|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/201109/peter-thiel-college-dropouts.html|publisher=Inc.|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gee|first=Robyn|title=Creator Of UnCollege Gets 100K From Thiel Foundation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/youth-radio-youth-media-international/creator-of-uncollege-gets_b_871214.html?ref=tw|publisher=Huffington Post|date=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnstephens&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephens, Dale|title=College is a waste of time|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/06/03/stephens.college/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=Dale|title=Thiel Fellow Dale Stephens Drops Out (Of College), Moves In (To Silicon Valley), And Starts Up (Talent-Scouting RadMatter)|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1767368/peter-thiel-fellows-dale-stephens|publisher=Fast Company|date=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his initial proposal was rejected, Stephens was encouraged to reapply in pursuit of his work as an educational futurist through UnCollege.

==Description==
UnCollege provides resources for students that wish to define their own educational paths, whether in or outside of traditional higher education models.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|title=How Students Can Take Charge of Their Education|url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/how-students-can-take-charge-of-their-education/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is inspired by Stephens' background in [[unschooling]] and his frustrations with the college experience.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He states that his goal with UnCollege is not to take down universities, but to encourage more people to consider the opportunity cost of attending college.&lt;ref name=cnn1&gt;{{cite web|title=College is a waste of time|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/06/03/stephens.college/index.html?hpt=o...%20May%202012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students develop new UnCollege curriculum |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2011/02/28/news/uncollege |publisher=The Darthmouth |accessdate=2012-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412015909/http://thedartmouth.com/2011/02/28/news/uncollege |archivedate=April 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UnCollege features resources, forums, and workshops designed to help students, both in and out of college, gain useful skills.&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web|title=UnCollege|url=http://www.uncollege.org/|accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also hosts the UnCollege Manifesto, a 25-page document written by Stephens that covers subjects like "The value (or lack thereof) of a college degree" and "Twelve steps to self-directed learning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncollege.org/manifesto The UnCollege Manifesto]. ''UnCollege''.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the site matches students with mentors, and encourages students to collaborate and learn outside of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ‘UnCollege’: are walled campuses obsolete?|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/business-brains/the-8216uncollege-are-walled-campuses-obsolete/14638|publisher=Smart Planet|date=May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613172055/http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/business-brains/the-8216uncollege-are-walled-campuses-obsolete/14638|archivedate=2012-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond The Hill : Getting Schooled: UnCollege attracts students with higher education alternative|url=http://dailyorange.com/2011/02/beyond-the-hill-getting-schooled-uncollege-attracts-students-with-higher-education-alternative/|publisher=Daily Orange|accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The UnCollege movement is founded on these principles:&lt;ref name="uncollege" /&gt;

* Many people pay too much for university and learn too little.
* You can get an amazing education anywhere—but you’ll have to stop writing papers and start doing things.
* You need an excellent education to survive in a world where 50% of the population is under 30.
* Subjects taught in traditional universities are often contrived, theoretical, and irrelevant, promoting conformity and regurgitation rather than innovation and learning.
* You don’t have to decide what to do with your life at age 18.
* You can contribute to society without a university degree.
* You cannot rely on university to give you a complete and relevant education when professors are often more interested in researching than teaching.
* If you want to gain the skills requisite for success, you must hack your education.&lt;ref name="Uncollege About"&gt;UnCollege About. Retrieved from http://uncollege.org/about.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UnCollege movement believes that college, while not itself adverse, needs significant changes because:&lt;ref name="uncollege" /&gt;

* Tuition is rising at twice the rate of inflation.
* Students are not learning.
* Students are incurring high levels of debt to finance their educations.

==Reception==
Through his work with UnCollege, Stephens was named as one of Splashlife's 30 Under 30: Social Media Titans.&lt;ref name=spl&gt;{{cite web|title=30 under 30: Social Media Titans|url=http://www.splashlife.com/article/30-under-30-social-media-titans?page=8|publisher=Splashlife|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; UnCollege has been profiled in world publications like [[CNN]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Asia Times]]'', [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', [[Mashable]], [[NPR]], [[CBS]], ''[[Inc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23887">The '''United States of America Mathematical Olympiad''' ('''USAMO''') is a highly selective [[high school]] [[mathematics]] [[competition]] held annually in the [[United States]]. Since its debut in 1972, it has served as the final round of the [[American Mathematics Competitions|AMC]] series of contests. The United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO) was introduced in 2010 to recognize top scorers based on their AMC10-based index. Qualifying for the USAMO is considered one of the most prestigious awards for high school students in the United States. Top scorers on the USAMO are invited to the [[Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program]] to represent the United States at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].

== Eligibility ==
In order to be eligible to take the USAMO, a participant must be either a [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen]] or a [[Permanent residence (United States)|legal resident of the United States]] or [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="eligibilityUSAMO"&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.unl.edu/amc/e-exams/e8-usamo/usamo.shtml | title=United States of America Mathematical Olympiad - USAMO | publisher=The Mathematical Association of America | accessdate=2006-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only U.S. residents and citizens may join the American [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] team. In addition, all participants, regardless of geographic location, must meet qualification indices determined by previous rounds of the [[American Mathematics Competitions|AMC]] contests. Entry to the USAMO is by invitation only.

== History ==
The USAMO was created in 1972 at the initiative of Nura D. Turner and [[Samuel L. Greitzer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Why Can't We Have a USA Mathematical Olympiad? |first=Nura D. |last=Turner |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=78 |issue=2 |date=February 1971 |pages=192–195 |doi=10.2307/2317636 |jstor=2317636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greitzer |first=S. |title=The First U.S.A. Mathematical Olympiad |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=80 |issue=3|pages=276–281 |date=March 1973 |doi=10.2307/2318449 |jstor=2318449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obituary: Samuel L Greitzer (1905–1988) |url=http://www.amt.edu.au/obitgreitzer.html |first1=G. |last1=Berzsenyi |first2=W. |last2=Mientka |journal=Mathematics Competitions |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=29 |year=1988 |access-date=2014-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204082356/http://www.amt.edu.au/obitgreitzer.html |archive-date=2014-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as the next round to the [[AHSME]] until 1982. In 1983, the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]] was introduced as a bridge between the AHSME and USAMO. In 2010, the USAMO split into the USAMO and USAJMO.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Mathematics Competitions#History]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical participant selection process ==

The USAMO (and the USAJMO since 2010) is restricted to approximately 500 (250 prior to 2006) participants combined each year. To keep this quota constant, the AMC Committee uses a selection process, which has seen a number of revisions in the exam's history.

=== Present ===
AMC 12 based indices are determined by taking AMC 12 Score + 10*(AIME Score). 
AMC 10 based indices are determined by taking AMC 10 Score + 10*(AIME Score). 
Cutoffs, based on AMC 12 indices, are determined so that approximately 260-270 students qualify for the USAMO.
Cutoffs, based on AMC 10 indices, are determined so that approximately 230-240 students qualify for the USAJMO.
If a student took the AMC 10 and 12 (i.e. AMC 10A and 12B or AMC 12A and 10B) and qualified for both the USAMO and USAJMO, the student must take the USAMO.

=== 2011 ===

Since 2011, the goal has been to select approximately 500 students total for the two Olympiads where 270 students qualify for the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) and 230 students qualify for the 2011 USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO). Selection for the USAMO and USAJMO are made according to the following rules:

1. U.S. citizens and students residing in the United States and Canada (with qualifying scores) are eligible to take the USAMO and USAJMO.

2. Selection to the USAMO will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as AMC 12 Score + 10 * AIME Score. Selection to the USAJMO will be based on the USAJMO index which is defined as AMC 10 Score + 10 * AIME Score.

3. Only AMC 12 A or AMC 12 B takers who are U.S. citizens and students residing in the United States and Canada will be eligible for the USAMO.

4. Only AMC 10 A or AMC 10 B takers who are U.S. citizens and students residing in the United States and Canada will be eligible for the USAJMO. This automatically limits Junior Math Olympiad participation to 10th graders and below. Students who take ONLY the AMC 10 test, whether AMC 10 A or AMC 10 B or both, will NOT be eligible for the USAMO regardless of their score on the AMC 10 or the AIME.

5. The approximately 260-270 individual students with the top AMC 12 based USAMO indices will be invited to take the USAMO. These indices will be selected from the pool of AMC 12 takers with an AIME score.

6. The approximately 230-240 individual students with the top AMC 10 based USAMO indices will be invited to take the USAJMO. These indices will be selected from the pool of AMC 10 takers with an AIME score after removing students who also took an AMC 12 test and qualified for the USAMO in rule 5. This means young students MUST take the USAMO if they qualify through an AMC 12 index.

7. We will select the student with the numerically largest index, whether AMC 10 based USAJMO index or AMC 12 based USAMO index, from each US state not already represented in either the USAMO or the USAJMO. The student will be invited to the USAMO if the numerically highest index in the state is AMC 12 based, and invited to the USAJMO if the index is AMC 10 based.

=== 2010 ===
Starting in 2010, the USA Mathematical Olympiad is split into two parts.  The USA Mathematical Olympiad will be administered to approximately 270 students, mostly selected from top ranking AMC12 participants.  The AMC10 only participants will take part in USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathlinks.ro/viewtopic.php?t=279691&amp;search_id=1663915827]&lt;/ref&gt;

1.Selection to the USAMO and JMO will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as
AMC score + 10 * AIME score.

2.Only AMC 12A or AMC 12B takers are eligible for the USAMO (with the slight exception mentioned in item 5 below).

3.Only AMC 10A and AMC 10B takers are eligible for the JMO.  (This automatically limits Junior Math Olympiad participation to 10th graders and below.)

4.Approximately the top 260 AMC12 based USAMO indices will be invited to the USAMO.

5.In order to find unrecognized young talent, AMC 10 takers who score 11 or more on the AIME will be invited to the USAMO. (In 2008 and 2009 this was 5 or 6 students).

6.Select the top index from any state not already represented in the USAMO.

7.Approximately the top 220-230 students with AMC10 based USAMO indices and not already selected to the USAMO via an AMC12 based index will be invited to the JMO.

''Source: [http://www.unl.edu/amc/e-exams/e0-usajmo/usajmo.shtml]''

=== 2008 ===
Selection for the USAMO will be made according to the following rules:

1. The goal is to select about 500 of the top scorers from this
year's AIME and AMC 12A, AMC 12B, AMC 10A and AMC
10B contests to participate in the USAMO.

2. Selection will be based on the USAMO index which is defined
as 10 times the student’s AIME score plus the student’s score
on the AMC 12 or the AMC 10.

3. The first selection will be the approximately 330 highest
USAMO indices of students taking the AMC 12A or AMC
12B contest.

4. The lowest AIME score among those 330 first selected will
determine a floor value. The second selection of approximately
160 USAMO participants will be among students in
the 10th grade and below who received an AIME score at
least as high as the floor value. If there are more than 160
young students with a score above the floor value, then approximately
160 students will be selected from this group by
using the USAMO index.

5 The student with the highest USAMO index from each state,
territory, or U.S. possession not already represented in the
selection of the first and second groups will be invited to
take the USAMO.

6. To adjust for variations in contest difficulty, the number of
students selected from A &amp; B contests will be proportional
to the number of students who took the A &amp; B Contests.

7. In advising young students (in grade 10 or below) who desire
to be selected for the USAMO whether to take the AMC 12
contest or the AMC 10 contest, please be aware of the following
facts:

a. In 2007, among 506 students invited to take the USAMO,
229 were in 10th grade and below. Those students had
scored 6 or greater on the AIME.

b. Among those 229 students, 87 had their AIME qualifying
high score based on the AMC 12 and 142 had their AIME
qualifying high score based on the AMC 10.

c. In 2007, among 8,312 students who took the AIME, 2,696
were in grades 10 and below. Of those, 998 qualified
for the AIME from the AMC 12 and 1,698 qualified from
the AMC 10.

=== 2006-2007 ===

Beginning in 2006, the USAMO was expanded to include approximately 500 students (around 430 were actually invited, read [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad#Recent qualification indices|below]]) due to a proposal and sponsorship from the Art of Problem Solving website:
# The goal is to select about 500 of the top scorers from this year's AIME and AMC 12A, AMC 12B, AMC 10A and AMC 10B contests to participate in the USAMO.
# Selection will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as 10 times the student’s AIME score plus the student’s score on the AMC 12 or the AMC 10.
# The first selection will be the approximately 240 highest USAMO indices of students taking the AMC 12A or AMC 12B contest.
# The lowest AIME score among those 240 first selected will determine a floor value. The second selection of approximately 120 USAMO participants will be among students in the 10th grade and below who received an AIME score at least as high as the floor value. If there are more than 120 young students with a score above the floor value, then approximately 120 students will be selected from this group by using the USAMO index.
# The student with the highest USAMO index from each state, territory, or U.S. possession not already represented in the selection of the first and second groups will be invited to take the USAMO.
# To adjust for variations in contest difficulty, the number of students selected from A &amp; B contests will be proportional to the number of students who took the A &amp; B Contests.
# The selection process is designed to favor students who take the more mathematically comprehensive AMC 12A and AMC 12B contests.*

*Statement 7 above (quoted from the AMC website) has recently come under controversy. During the selection for the 2006 USAMO, students who qualified by the floor value (in grades seven through ten) were qualified based on AMC scores as well (see * below) as their AIME scores, yet no distinction was made between the AMC 12 contest and the generally easier AMC 10 contest, giving those who took the AMC 10 an advantage over those who took the AMC 12. Students in grades seven through ten who were in the first selection of qualifiers (see 3. above) would still have qualified even if they had taken the AMC 10, except in the rare case that they set the floor themselves, making the AMC 12 still non-advantageous.

=== 2002-2005 ===

Since 2002, the following set of guidelines have been adopted for use in determining each year's USAMO participants:

# The goal is to select about 250 of the top scorers from the prior AIME and AMC 12A, AMC 12B, AMC 10A and AMC 10B contests to participate in the USAMO.
# Selection will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as 10 times the student’s AIME score plus the student’s score on the AMC 12 or the AMC 10.
# The first selection (consisting of participants from all grade levels) will be the approximately 160 highest USAMO indices of students taking the AMC 12A or AMC 12B contest.
# The lowest AIME score among those 160 first selected will determine a floor value. The second selection of USAMO participants will be from the highest USAMO indices among students in grades seven through ten who got an AIME score at least as high as the floor value. To note, during 2002-2005 period, this included all students in grades seven through ten.
# The student with the highest USAMO index from each state, territory, or U.S. possession not already represented in the selection of the first and second groups will be invited to take the USAMO.
# To adjust for variations in contest difficulty, the number of students selected from A &amp; B contests will be proportional to the number of students who took the (A &amp; B) Contests.
# The selection process is designed to favor students who take the more mathematically comprehensive AMC 12A and AMC 12B contests.

=== 2001 and earlier ===

Prior to 2001, the following guidelines were used:

* First Group: The top 120 students.
* Second Group: The next 20 students in grades 11 and below.
* Third Group: The next 20 students in grades 10 or below.
* Fourth Group: The next 20 students in grades 9 or below.
* Fifth Group: One student from each state, one student from the combined U.S.A. Territories, and one student from the APO/FPO schools- if not represented in the first four groups.

== Test format and scoring ==

=== Post-2002 ===

Since 2002, the USAMO has been a six-question, nine-hour [[mathematical proof]] examination spread out over two days. (The [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] uses the same format.) On each day, four and a half hours are given for three questions.

Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 7, with a score of 7 representing a proof that is mathematically sound. Thus, a perfect score is 42 points. The number of perfect papers each year has varied depending on test difficulty. Regardless, the top 12 scorers are all named contest winners.

The scale of 0 to 7 goes as follows:
*0 - No work, or completely trivial work
*1-2 - Progress on the problem, but not completely solved
*3-4 - All steps are present, but may lack clarity. (These scores are very rare.)
*5-6 - Complete solution with minor errors
*7 - Perfect solution

=== 1996 to 2001 ===

The test consisted of two three-problem sets. Three hours were given for each set; one set was given in the morning (9:00-12:00), and the other in the afternoon (1:00-4:00).

=== 1995 and earlier ===

The test consisted of five problems to be solved in three and a half hours (earlier, three hours). Each problem was worth 20 points, for a perfect score of 100.

== Test procedures ==

In most years, students have taken the USAMO at their respective high schools. Prior to 2002, the problems were mailed to the schools in sealed envelopes, not to be opened before the appointed time on the test day. Since 2002, test problems have been posted on the AMC website (see [[#External links|links]] below) fifteen minutes prior to the official start of the test. Student responses are then faxed back to the AMC office at the end of the testing period.

In 2002, the [[Akamai Foundation]], as a major sponsor of the American Mathematics Competitions, invited all USAMO participants to take the test at a central event at [[MIT]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], all expenses paid. In addition, Akamai invited all 2002 USAMO participants who were not high school seniors (approximately 160 students) to take part in an enlarged [[Mathematical Olympiad Program]] (also known as "MOP") program. Since holding this central event every year would be prohibitively expensive, it has been discontinued.  In 2004 and 2005, however, funding was found to send 30 rising freshmen to MOP as well, in a program popularly called "Red MOP."

Each year, the top 12 scorers on the USAMO are considered for selection to the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] team for the United States. The students are trained at the MOP in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], and then six are selected to the team. The next approximately 18 high scorers, usually excluding high school seniors, are also invited to MOP.

== Awards ==

The Top 12 on the USAMO and USAJMO are named Winners and automatically qualify for [[Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program]] (MOP) (except for seniors, who only qualify for the MOP if they were in the Team Selection Test group from the previous year). The remaining spots at MOP are filled via the MOP selection process.

[[File:Teliris VL Modular.JPG|thumb|A [[telepresence]] system in 2007]]
'''Videotelephony''' comprises the technologies for the reception and transmission of [[audio signal|audio]]-[[video]] signals by users at different locations, for communication between people in real-time.&lt;ref name=McGrawHill&gt;McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Engineering. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Videotelephony Videotelephony], McGraw-Hill, 2002. Retrieved from the FreeDictionary.com website, January 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''videophone''' is a [[telephone]] with a [[Display device|video display]], capable of simultaneous video and audio for communication between people in [[near real-time|real-time]]. '''Videoconferencing''' implies the use of this technology for a group or organizational meeting rather than for individuals, in a '''videoconference'''.&lt;ref name="Mulbach-1995c"&gt;Mulbach et al, 1995. pg. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Telepresence]] may refer either to a high-quality videotelephony system (where the goal is to create the illusion that remote participants are in the same room) or to meetup technology, which goes beyond video into robotics (such as moving around the room or physically manipulating objects). Videoconferencing has also been called "visual collaboration" and is a type of [[groupware]].

At the dawn of its commercial deployment from the 1950s through the 1990s, videotelephony also included "image phones" which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]-type telephone lines, essentially the same as [[Slow-scan television|slow scan TV]] systems. The development of advanced [[codec|video codecs]], more powerful [[CPU]]s, and high-bandwidth [[internet Protocol|Internet telecommunication services]] in the late 1990s allowed videophones to provide high quality low-cost colour service between users almost anyplace in the world that the Internet is available.

Although not as widely used in everyday communications as audio-only and text communication, useful applications include [[sign language]] transmission for [[deaf]] and [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired]] people, [[distance education]], [[telemedicine]], and overcoming [[disability|mobility issues]]. It is also used in commercial and corporate settings to facilitate meetings and conferences, typically between parties that already have established relationships. [[News media]] organizations have begun to use desktop technologies like [[Skype]] to provide higher-quality audio than the phone network, and video links at much lower cost than sending professional equipment or using a professional studio. More popular videotelephony technologies use the Internet rather than the traditional landline phone network, even accounting for modern digital packetized phone network protocols, and even though videotelephony software commonly runs on [[smartphones]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of videotelephony}}
[[File:France in XXI Century. Correspondance cinema.jpg|thumb|Video telephony predicted to be in use by the year 2000, as envisioned in 1910. (artist's conception)]]
[[Image:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14756466975).jpg|thumb|Video telephone booth, 1930]]
The concept of videotelephony was first conceived in the late 1870s in both the United States and Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the video telephone, or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably [[electrical telegraphy]], [[telephony]], [[radio]], and [[television]].

Simple analog videophone communication could be established as early as the invention of the [[television]]. Such an antecedent usually consisted of two [[closed-circuit television]] systems connected via [[Coaxial cable|coax cable]] or [[radio]]. An example of that was the German Reich Postzentralamt (post office) video telephone network serving Berlin and several German cities via coaxial cables between 1936 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;"German Postoffice To Use Television-Telephone For Its Communication System", (Associated Press) The Evening Independent, St. Petersburg, Fl, September 1, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, C. Brooks, "Talks On 'See-Phone': Television Applied to German Telephones Enables Speakers to See Each Other...", The New York Times, September 18, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of video technology started in the latter half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably by [[John Logie Baird]] and [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T's Bell Labs]]. This occurred in part, at least with AT&amp;T, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications. However video technology was to be deployed in [[Analog television|analog]] [[television broadcasting]] long before it could become practical—or popular—for videophones.
[[File:On Line System Videoconferencing FJCC 1968.jpg|thumb|Multiple user videoconferencing first being demonstrated with [[Stanford Research Institute]]'s [[NLS (computer system)|NLS computer technology]] (1968).]]

During the first manned [[space flight]]s, [[NASA]] used two radio-frequency ([[UHF]] or [[VHF]]) video links, one in each direction. TV channels routinely use this type of videotelephony when reporting from distant locations. The news media were to become regular users of mobile links to [[satellite]]s using specially equipped trucks, and much later via special satellite videophones in a briefcase.

This technique was very expensive, though, and could not be used for applications such as [[telemedicine]], [[distance education]], and business meetings. Attempts at using normal [[telephony]] networks to transmit slow-scan video, such as the first systems developed by [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], first researched in the 1950s, failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video [[Video compression|compression]] techniques. The greater 1&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and 6 Mbit/s [[bit rate]] of the AT&amp;T Picturephone in the 1970s also did not achieve commercial success, mostly due to its high cost, but also due to a lack of [[network effect]]—with only a few hundred Picturephones in the world, users had extremely few contacts they could actually call to, and [[interoperability]] with other videophone systems would not exist for decades.

Videotelephony developed in parallel with conventional [[public switched telephone network|voice telephone systems]] from the mid-to-late 20th century. Very expensive [[videoconferencing]] systems rapidly evolved throughout the 1980s and 1990s from proprietary equipment, software, and network requirements to standards-based technologies that were available for anyone to purchase at a reasonable cost.

Only in the late 20th century with the advent of powerful [[video codec]]s combined with high-speed [[Internet access|Internet broadband]] and [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] service did videotelephony become a practical technology for regular use.

In the 1980s, [[digital telephony]] transmission networks became possible, such as with [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] networks, assuring a minimum [[bit rate]] (usually 128 kilobits/s) for compressed video and audio transmission. During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication. Many of these technologies, such as the [[Media space]], are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stults, Media Space, Xerox PARC, Palo Alto, CA, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Steve. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xIujg_rkEX8C Media Space: 20+ Years of Mediated Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505084733/https://books.google.com/books?id=xIujg_rkEX8C |date=2016-05-05 }}, Springer, 2009, {{ISBN|1-84882-482-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84882-482-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dedicated systems started to appear as ISDN networks were expanding throughout the world. One of the first commercial videoconferencing systems sold to companies came from [[PictureTel Corp.]], which had an [[Initial public offering|Initial Public Offering]] in November, 1984.

In 1984, Concept Communication in the United States replaced the then-100 pound, US$100,000 computers necessary for teleconferencing, with a $12,000 [[circuit board]] that doubled the video [[frame rate]] from 15 up to 30 frames per second, and which reduced the equipment to the size of a circuit board fitting into standard [[personal computer]]s.&lt;ref name="williamjtobin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.williamjtobin.com/inventions--patents.html|title=Mr. Tobin has been awarded 15 patents in the past 40 years|last=|first=|date=|publisher=WilliamJTobin.com|accessdate=2011-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530033905/http://www.williamjtobin.com/inventions--patents.html|archivedate=2011-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also secured a patent for a [[codec]] for full-motion videoconferencing, first demonstrated at [[AT&amp;T Bell Labs]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="williamjtobin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rtir"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:CUcollaboration.gif|thumb|right|Global Schoolhouse students communicating via [[CU-SeeMe]], with a video framerate between 3–9 frames per second (1993).]]

Videoconferencing systems throughout the 1990s rapidly evolved from very expensive proprietary equipment, software, and network requirements to a standards-based technology readily available to the general public at a reasonable cost.

Finally, in the 1990s, [[Internet Protocol]]-based videoconferencing became possible, and more efficient video compression technologies were developed, permitting desktop, or personal computer (PC)-based videoconferencing. In 1992 [[CU-SeeMe]] was developed at Cornell by Tim Dorcey et al. In 1995 the [[South African Communication Landmarks#Telecommunication landmarks|first public videoconference between North America and Africa]] took place, linking a technofair in [[San Francisco]] with a techno-rave and cyberdeli in [[Cape Town]]. At the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] opening ceremony in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], Japan, [[Seiji Ozawa]] conducted the [[Ode to Joy]] from [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] simultaneously across five continents in near-real time.

While videoconferencing technology was initially used primarily within internal corporate communication networks, one of the first community service usages of the technology started in 1992 through a unique partnership with PictureTel and IBM Corporations which at the time were promoting a jointly developed desktop based videoconferencing product known as the PCS/1. Over the next 15 years, [[Project DIANE]] (Diversified Information and Assistance Network) grew to utilize a variety of videoconferencing platforms to create a multi-state cooperative public service and distance education network consisting of several hundred schools, libraries, science museums, zoos and parks, and many other community oriented organizations.

In the 2000s, videotelephony was popularized via free Internet services such as [[Skype]] and [[iChat]], web plugins and on-line telecommunication programs that promoted low cost, albeit lower-quality, videoconferencing to virtually every location with an Internet connection.

With the rapid improvements and popularity of the Internet, videotelephony has become widespread through the deployment of video-enabled [[mobile phone]]s, plus videoconferencing and [[webcam|computer webcam]]s which utilize [[Voice over IP|Internet telephony]]. In the upper echelons of government, business, and commerce, [[telepresence|telepresence technology]], an advanced form of videoconferencing, has helped reduce the need to travel.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In May 2005, the first [[high-definition video|high definition]] video conferencing systems, produced by [[Lifesize communications|LifeSize Communications]], were displayed at the [[Interop]] trade show in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], able to provide video at 30 frames per second with a 1280 by 720 [[display resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/high-definition-video-conferencing-is-here/59|title=High definition video conferencing is here|author=George Ou|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513014916/http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/high-definition-video-conferencing-is-here/59|archivedate=2010-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jkcit.co.uk/news/20060522.htm Polycom High-Definition (HD) Video Conferencing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416002711/http://www.jkcit.co.uk/news/20060522.htm |date=2016-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polycom]] introduced its first high definition video conferencing system to the market in 2006. As of the 2010s, high definition resolution for videoconferencing became a popular feature, with most major suppliers in the videoconferencing market offering it.

Technological developments by videoconferencing developers in the 2010s have extended the capabilities of video conferencing systems beyond the boardroom for use with [[Mobile device|hand-held mobile devices]] that combine the use of video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities broadcasting in real-time over secure networks, independent of location. [[Mobile collaboration]] systems now allow people in previously unreachable locations, such as workers on an off-shore oil rig, the ability to view and discuss issues with colleagues thousands of miles away. Traditional videoconferencing system manufacturers have begun providing mobile applications as well, such as those that allow for live and still image streaming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communication.aver.com/model/VCLink VCLink for Mobile Devices – AVer Video Conferencing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313105857/http://communication.aver.com/model/VCLink |date=2017-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major categories ==

[[File:Webcam grayscale.jpg|thumb|A typical low-cost webcam for use with personal computers (2006)]]

Videotelephony can be categorized by its functionality, that is to its intended purpose, and also by its method of transmissions.

'''Videophones''' were the earliest form of videotelephony, dating back to initial tests in 1927 by AT&amp;T.  During the late 1930s the post offices of several European governments established public videophone services for person-to-person communications utilizing dual cable circuit telephone transmission technology. In the present day standalone videophones and [[UMTS]] video-enabled [[mobile phone]]s are usually used on a person-to-person basis.

'''Videoconferencing''' saw its earliest use with AT&amp;T's Picturephone service in the early 1970s. Transmissions were analog over short distances, but converted to digital forms for longer calls, again using telephone transmission technology. Popular corporate video-conferencing systems in the present day have migrated almost exclusively to digital [[ISDN]] and [[Internet Protocol|IP]] transmission modes due to the need to convey the very large amounts of data generated by their cameras and microphones. These systems are often intended for use in conference mode, that is by many people in several different locations, all of whom can be viewed by every participant at each location.

[[Telepresence]] systems are a newer, more advanced subset of videoconferencing systems, meant to allow higher degrees of video and audio fidelity. Such high-end systems are typically deployed in corporate settings.

[[Mobile collaboration]] systems are another recent development, combining the use of video, audio, and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation [[Mobile device|hand-held electronic devices]] broadcasting over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real-time, independent of location.

A more recent technology encompassing these functions is TV cams. TV cams enable people to make video “phone” calls using [http://technovally.com/five-top-popular-apps-video-calling/ video calling] services, like Skype on their TV, without using a PC connection. TV cams are specially designed video cameras that feed images in real time to another TV camera or other compatible computing devices like smartphones, tablets and computers.

''[[Webcam]]s'' are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via [[personal computer]]s, and can be used with many [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software Client brands|software clients]] for both video calls and videoconferencing.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman. Editors: Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman, Amy B. Woszczynski, Ken Hoganson, Herbert Mattord. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4aIXq5z8YC Handbook of Distance Learning for Real-Time and Asynchronous Information Technology Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508053249/https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4aIXq5z8YC |date=2016-05-08 }}, Idea Group Inc (IGI), 2008, p. 17, {{ISBN|1-59904-964-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59904-964-9}}. Note costing: "....students had the option to install a webcam on their end (a basic webcam costs about $40.00) to view the class in session."&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the systems has its own advantages and disadvantages, including [[video|video quality]], [[capital cost]], degrees of sophistication, [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] capacity requirements, and [[Indirect costs|cost of use]].

=== Categories by cost and quality of service ===
[[File:Videoconferencing via Skype across the Internet between Interview Coach Mark Efinger and a woman being coached.png|thumb|right|Web cameras in laptop computers can allow two people to have a "face-to-face" conversation despite being separated by a vast distance. In this example, a coach helps a student prepare for a [[college interview]].]]
From the least to the most expensive systems:
* [[Webcam|Web camera]] videophone and videoconferencing systems, either stand-alone or built-in, that serve as complements to personal computers, connected to other participants by [[computer network|computer]] and [[VoIP]] networks&amp;nbsp;– lowest direct cost assuming the users already possess computers at their respective locations. Quality of service can range from low to very high, including [[High-definition video|high definition]] video available on the latest model webcams. A related and similar device is a TV camera which is usually small, sits on top of a TV, and can connect to it via its [[HDMI]] port, similar to how a webcam attaches to a computer via a USB port.
* [[Videophone]]s&amp;nbsp;– low to midrange cost. The earliest standalone models operated over either plain [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephone lines on the [[PSTN]] telephone networks or more expensive [[ISDN]] lines, while newer models have largely migrated to [[Internet protocol]] line service for higher image resolutions and sound quality. Quality of service for standalone videophones can vary from low to high;
* [[Videoconferencing|Videoconferencing systems]]&amp;nbsp;– midrange cost, usually utilizing [[multipoint control unit]]s or other bridging services to allow multiple parties on a videoconference calls. Quality of service can vary from moderate to high.
* [[Telepresence|Telepresence systems]]&amp;nbsp;– highest capabilities and highest cost. Full ''high-end'' systems can involve specially built teleconference rooms to allow expansive views with very high levels of audio and video fidelity, to permit an 'immersive' videoconference. When the proper type and capacity transmission lines are provided between facilities, the quality of service reaches state-of-the-art levels.

== Security concerns ==

[[Computer security]] experts have shown that poorly configured or inadequately supervised videoconferencing system can permit an easy "virtual" entry by [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hackers]] and criminals into company premises and corporate boardrooms, via their own videoconferencing systems.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes-2012.01.22"&gt;Perlroth, Nicole. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/technology/flaws-in-videoconferencing-systems-put-boardrooms-at-risk.html Cameras May Open Up the Board Room to Hackers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827142248/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/technology/flaws-in-videoconferencing-systems-put-boardrooms-at-risk.html |date=2017-08-27 }}, [[The New York Times|''The New York Times'' online]], January 22, 2012. A version of this article appeared in print on January 23, 2012, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: "Conferences Via the Net Called Risky".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption ==

For over a century, [[futurist]]s have envisioned a future where telephone conversations will take place as actual face-to-face encounters with video as well as audio. Sometimes it is simply not possible or practical to have face-to-face meetings with two or more people. Sometimes a telephone conversation or conference call is adequate. Other times, [[e-mail]] exchanges are adequate. However, videoconferencing adds another possible alternative, and can be considered when:
* A live conversation is needed
* Non-verbal (visual) information is an important component of the conversation
* The parties of the conversation can't physically come to the same location
* The expense or time of travel is a consideration

Some observers argue that three outstanding issues have prevented videoconferencing from becoming a widely adopted form of communication, despite the ubiquity of videoconferencing-capable systems.&lt;ref name="VanMeggelen"&gt;Van Meggelen, Jim. [http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6889 The Problem With Video Conferencing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104215914/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6889 |date=January 4, 2006 }}, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Eye contact:''' [[Eye contact]] plays a large role in conversational [[turn-taking]], perceived attention and intent, and other aspects of group communication.&lt;ref&gt;Vertegaal, "Explaining Effects of Eye Gaze on Mediated Group Conversations: Amount or Synchronization?" ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional telephone conversations give no eye contact cues, many videoconferencing systems are arguably worse in that they provide an incorrect impression that the remote interlocutor is avoiding eye contact. Some telepresence systems have cameras located in the screens that reduce the amount of [[parallax]] observed by the users. This issue is also being addressed through research that generates a synthetic image with eye contact using stereo reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Computer vision approaches to achieving eye contact appeared in the 1990s, such as [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=260136&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=72199399&amp;CFTOKEN=47661501 Teleconferencing Eye Contact Using a Virtual Camera], ACM CHI 1993. More recently gaze correction systems using only a single camera have been shown, such as. Microsoft's [http://research.microsoft.com/barc/mediapresence/GazeMaster.aspx GazeMaster] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622134028/http://research.microsoft.com/barc/mediapresence/GazeMaster.aspx |date=June 22, 2006 }} system.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[Telcordia Technologies]], formerly Bell Communications Research, owns a patent for eye-to-eye videoconferencing using rear projection screens with the video camera behind it, evolved from a 1960s U.S. military system that provided videoconferencing services between the [[White House]] and various other government and military facilities. This technique eliminates the need for special cameras or image processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=GqkaAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage Google Patent]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Appearance consciousness:''' A second psychological problem with videoconferencing is being on camera, with the video stream possibly even being recorded. The burden of presenting an acceptable on-screen appearance is not present in audio-only communication. Early studies by Alphonse Chapanis found that the addition of video actually impaired communication, possibly because of the consciousness of being on camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Studies in interactive communication II: The effects of four communication modes on the linguistic performance of teams during cooperative problem solving| last1=Chapanis| first1=A| last2=Ochsman| first2=R| last3=Parrish| first3=R| journal=Human Factors| year=1977| volume=19| pages=101–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Signal latency''': The information transport of digital signals in many steps need time. In a telecommunicated conversation, an increased [[latency (engineering)|latency]] (time lag) larger than about 150–300 ms becomes noticeable and is soon observed as unnatural and distracting. Therefore, next to a stable large bandwidth, a small [[Internet Control Message Protocol|total round-trip time]] is another major technical requirement for the communication channel for interactive videoconferencing.&lt;ref name="Percy"&gt;Percy, Alan. [http://www.telephonyworld.com/training/brooktrout/iptel_latency_wp.html ''Understanding Latency''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514133416/http://www.telephonyworld.com/training/brooktrout/iptel_latency_wp.html |date=2013-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bandwidth and quality of service''': In some countries it is difficult or expensive to get a high quality connection that is fast enough for good-quality video conferencing. Technologies such as [[ADSL]] have limited upload speeds and cannot upload and download simultaneously at full speed. As Internet speeds increase higher quality and high definition video conferencing will become more readily available.
* '''Complexity of systems''': Most users are not technical and want a simple interface. In hardware systems, an unplugged cord or a dead battery in a remote control is seen as failure, contributing to a perceived unreliability. Successful systems are backed by support teams who can pro-actively support and provide fast assistance when required.
* '''Perceived lack of interoperability''': not all systems can readily interconnect, for example ISDN and IP systems require a gateway. Popular software solutions cannot easily connect to hardware systems. Some systems use different standards, features, and qualities which can require additional configuration when connecting to dissimilar systems. Free software systems circumvent this limitation by making it relatively easy for a single user to communicate over multiple incompatible platforms.
* '''Expense of commercial systems''': well-designed [[telepresence]] systems require specially designed rooms which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fit out their rooms with codecs, integration equipment (such as [[Multipoint Control Unit]]s), high fidelity sound systems, and furniture. Monthly charges may also be required for bridging services and high capacity broadband service.

These are some of the reasons many systems are often used for internal corporate use only, as they are less likely to result in lost sales. One alternative to companies lacking dedicated facilities is the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Public videoconferencing facilities|rental of videoconferencing-equipped meeting rooms]] in cities around the world. Clients can book rooms and turn up for the meeting, with all technical aspects being prearranged and support being readily available if needed. The issue of eye-contact may be solved with advancing technology, including smartphones which have the screen and camera in essentially the same place. The ubiquity of [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, and computers with built-in audio and webcams in developed countries obviates the need to buy expensive hardware.

== Technology ==

{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}

===Components and types===
[[File:Polycom VSX 7000 with 2 video conferencing screens.JPG|thumb|'''Dual display''': An older [[Polycom VSX 7000]] system and camera used for videoconferencing, with two displays for simultaneous broadcast from separate locations (2008).]]
[[File:Room220.jpg|thumb|Various components and the camera of a [[Lifesize communications|LifeSize Communications]] Room 220 high definition multipoint system (2010).]]
[[File:GoogleHangoutsMeeting.jpg|thumb|A video conference meeting facilitated by [[Google Hangouts]].]]

The core technology used in a videotelephony system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time. The hardware or [[software]] that performs compression is called a [[codec]] (coder/decoder). Compression rates of up to 1:500 can be achieved. The resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labeled [[Packet (information technology)|packets]], which are then transmitted through a [[digital network]] of some kind (usually [[ISDN]] or [[Internet Protocol|IP]]).

The other components required for a videoconferencing system include:
* '''Video input''': ([[Pan–tilt–zoom camera|PTZ]] / [[360-degree video|360°]] / [[Fisheye lens|Fisheye]]) [[video camera]], or [[webcam]]
* '''Video output''': [[Computer display|computer monitor]], [[television]], or [[Video projector|projector]]
* '''Audio input''': [[microphone]]s, CD/DVD player, cassette player, or any other source of PreAmp audio outlet.
* '''Audio output''': usually [[loudspeaker]]s associated with the display device or telephone
* '''Data transfer''': analog or digital telephone network, [[Local area network|LAN]], or [[Internet]]
* '''Computer''': a data processing unit that ties together the other components, does the compressing and decompressing, and initiates and maintains the data linkage via the network.

There are basically two kinds of videoconferencing and videophone systems:

# '''Dedicated systems''' have all required components packaged into a single piece of equipment, usually a console with a high quality [[remote control]]led video camera. These cameras can be controlled at a distance to pan left and right, tilt up and down, and zoom. They became known as PTZ cameras. The console contains all electrical interfaces, the control computer, and the software or hardware-based codec. Omnidirectional microphones are connected to the console, as well as a TV monitor with loudspeakers and/or a [[video projector]]. There are several types of dedicated videoconferencing devices:
## Large group videoconferencing are built-in, large, expensive devices used for large rooms such as conference rooms and auditoriums.
## Small group videoconferencing are either non-portable or portable, smaller, less expensive devices used for small meeting rooms.
## Individual videoconferencing are usually portable devices, meant for single users, and have fixed cameras, microphones, and loudspeakers integrated into the console.
# '''Desktop systems''' are add-ons (hardware boards or software codec) to normal PCs and laptops, transforming them into videoconferencing devices. A range of different cameras and microphones can be used with the codec, which contains the necessary codec and transmission interfaces. Most of the desktops systems work with the [[H.323]] standard.
# '''WebRTC Platforms''' are video conferencing solutions that are not resident by using a software application but is available through the standard web browser. Solutions such as Adobe Connect and Cisco WebEX can be accessed by going to a URL sent by the meeting organizer and various degrees of security can be attached to the virtual "room". Often the user will be required to download a piece of software, called an "Add In" to enable the browser to access the local camera, microphone and establish a connection to the meeting. WebRTC technology doesn't require any software or Add On installation, instead a WebRTC compliant internet browser itself acts as a client to facilitate 1-to-1 and 1-to-many videoconferencing calls. Several enhanced flavours of WebRTC technology are being provided by Third Party vendors.

=== Videoconferencing modes ===

Videoconferencing systems use two methods to determine which video feed or feeds to display.

''Continuous Presence'' simply displays all participants at the same time,&lt;ref name="V&amp;VCF" /&gt; usually with the exception that the viewer either does not see their own feed, or sees their own feed in miniature.

''Voice-Activated Switch'' selectively chooses a feed to display at each endpoint, with the goal of showing the person who is currently speaking. This is done by choosing the feed (other than the viewer) which has the loudest audio input (perhaps with some filtering to avoid switching for very short-lived volume spikes).  Often if no remote parties are currently speaking, the feed with the last speaker remains on the screen.

=== Echo cancellation ===

[[echo cancellation|Acoustic echo cancellation]] (AEC) is a processing [[algorithm]] that uses the knowledge of audio output to monitor audio input and filter from it noises that echo back after some time delay. If unattended, these echoes can be re-amplified several times, leading to problems including:
* The remote party hearing their own voice coming back at them (usually significantly delayed)
# Strong [[reverberation]], which makes the voice channel useless
# Howling created by feedback

Echo cancellation is a processor-intensive task that usually works over a narrow range of sound delays.

=== Bandwidth requirements ===
[[File:Bildtelefon T-View 100.JPG|thumb|left|'''[[Deutsche Telekom]] T-View 100''' [[ISDN]] type videophone meant for home offices and small businesses with a lens cover which can be rotated upward to assure privacy when needed (2007).]]
{{See also|Broadband Internet access}}

Videophones have historically employed a variety of transmission and reception bandwidths, which can be understood as data transmission speeds. The lower the transmission/reception bandwidth, the lower the data transfer rate, resulting in a progressively limited and poorer image quality. Data transfer rates and live video image quality are related, but are also subject to other factors such as [[Video compression|data compression techniques]]. Some early videophones employed very low data transmission rates with a resulting poor video quality.

''Broadband bandwidth'' is often called "''high-speed''", because it usually has a high rate of data transmission. In general, any connection of 256 kbit/s (0.256 Mbit/s) or greater is more concisely considered broadband Internet. The [[International Telecommunication Union]] Standardization Sector ([[ITU-T]]) recommendation I.113 has defined broadband as a transmission capacity at 1.5 to 2 Mbit/s. The [[Federal Communications Commission|United States Federal Communications Commission]] definition of broadband is 25 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/f-c-c-sharply-increases-definition-of-broadband/?_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906004513/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/f-c-c-sharply-increases-definition-of-broadband/?_r=0 |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, adequate video for some purposes becomes possible at data rates lower than the ITU-T broadband definition, with rates of 768 kbit/s and 384 kbit/s used for some video conferencing applications, and rates as low as 100 kbit per second used for videophones using [[H.264|H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] compression protocols. The newer [[MPEG-4]] [[video compression|video]] and [[Audio data compression|audio compression]] format can deliver high-quality video at 2 Mbit/s, which is at the low end of [[cable modem]] and [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] broadband performance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Standards ===

[[File:TANDBERG E20.jpg|thumb|The [[Tandberg E20]] is an example of a [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]]-only device. Such devices need to route calls through a Video Communication Server to be able to reach [[H.323]] systems, a process known as "interworking" (2009).]]

The [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) has three umbrellas of standards for videoconferencing:
* ITU [[H.320]] is known as the standard for [[public switched telephone network]]s (PSTN) or videoconferencing over integrated services digital networks. While still prevalent in Europe, [[ISDN]] was never widely adopted in the United States and Canada.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}}
* ITU [[H.264]] [[Scalable Video Coding]] (SVC) is a compression standard that enables videoconferencing systems to achieve highly error resilient [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) video transmissions over the public Internet without quality-of-service enhanced lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vidyo.com/comparison_video.html SVC vs. H.264/AVC Error Resilience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810075550/http://www.vidyo.com/comparison_video.html |date=August 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard has enabled wide scale deployment of high definition desktop videoconferencing and made possible new architectures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vidyo.com/whitepaper_info.html SVC White Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104232909/http://www.vidyo.com/whitepaper_info.html |date=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduces latency between the transmitting sources and receivers, resulting in more fluid communication without pauses. In addition, an attractive factor for IP videoconferencing is that it is easier to set up for use along with [[web conferencing]] and [[data collaboration]]. These combined technologies enable users to have a richer [[multimedia]] environment for live meetings, collaboration and presentations.
* ITU [[ITU-T V-Series Recommendations|V.80]]: videoconferencing is generally compatibilized with [[H.324]] standard point-to-point videotelephony over regular [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) phone lines.

The [[Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]] (UCIF), a non-profit alliance between communications vendors, launched in May 2010. The organization's vision is to maximize the interoperability of UC based on existing standards. Founding members of UCIF include [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Microsoft]], [[Polycom]], [[Logitech]]/[[LifeSize|LifeSize Communications]], and [[Juniper Networks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/brettjo/archive/2010/05/19/unified-communications-interoperability-forum-ucif.aspx Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcworld.com/article/196640/collaboration_vendors_join_for_interoperability.html Collaboration Vendors Join for Interoperability]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Call setup ===

Videoconferencing in the late 20th century was limited to the [[H.323]] protocol (notably Cisco's [[Skinny Client Control Protocol|SCCP]] implementation was an exception), but newer videophones often use [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]], which is often easier to set up in home networking environments.&lt;ref&gt;

RFC 4168, ''The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)'', IETF, The Internet Society (2005)

&lt;/ref&gt; It is a text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) and the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  H.323 is still used, but more commonly for business videoconferencing, while SIP is more commonly used in personal consumer videophones.  A number of call-setup methods based on [[instant messaging]] protocols such as [[Skype]] also now provide video.

Another protocol used by videophones is [[H.324]], which mixes call setup and video compression.  Videophones that work on regular phone lines typically use H.324, but the bandwidth is limited by the modem to around 33 kbit/s, limiting the video quality and frame rate.  A slightly modified version of H.324 called [[3G-324M]] defined by [[3GPP]] is also used by some cellphones that allow video calls, typically for use only in [[UMTS]] networks.&lt;ref name="IMTC"&gt;

January 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also [[H.320]] standard, which specified technical requirements for narrow-band visual telephone systems and terminal equipment, typically for videoconferencing and videophone services. It applied mostly to dedicated circuit-based switched network (point-to-point) connections of moderate or high bandwidth, such as through the medium-bandwidth [[ISDN]] digital phone protocol or a fractionated high bandwidth T1 lines. Modern products based on H.320 standard usually support also H.323 standard.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[IAX2]] protocol also supports videophone calls natively, using the protocol's own capabilities to transport alternate media streams. A few hobbyists obtained the Nortel 1535 Color SIP Videophone cheaply in 2010 as surplus after [[Nortel]]'s bankruptcy and deployed the sets on the [[Asterisk (PBX)]] platform. While additional software is required to patch together multiple video feeds for conference calls or convert between dissimilar video standards, SIP calls between two identical handsets within the same PBX were relatively straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nerdvittles.com/?p=703 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608160915/http://nerdvittles.com/?p=703 |archivedate=2017-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferencing layers ===

The components within a videoconferencing system can be divided up into several different layers: User Interface, Conference Control, Control or Signaling Plane, and Media Plane.

Videoconferencing User Interfaces (VUI) can be either graphical or voice responsive. Many in the industry have encountered both types of interfaces, and normally graphical interfaces are encountered on a computer. User interfaces for conferencing have a number of different uses; they can be used for scheduling, setup, and making a videocall. Through the user interface the administrator is able to control the other three layers of the system.

Conference Control performs resource allocation, management, and routing. This layer along with the User Interface creates meetings (scheduled or unscheduled) or adds and removes participants from a conference.

Control (Signaling) Plane contains the stacks that signal different endpoints to create a call and/or a conference. Signals can be, but aren’t limited to, [[H.323]] and [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) Protocols. These signals control incoming and outgoing connections as well as session parameters.

The Media Plane controls the audio and video mixing and streaming. This layer manages Real-Time Transport Protocols, User Datagram Packets (UDP) and [[RTP Control Protocol|Real-Time Transport Control Protocol]] (RTCP). The RTP and UDP normally carry information such the payload type which is the type of codec, frame rate, video size, and many others. RTCP on the other hand acts as a quality control Protocol for detecting errors during streaming.&lt;ref name="V&amp;VCF" /&gt;

=== Multipoint videoconferencing ===

{{Main|Multipoint Control Unit}}

Simultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible in a hardware-based system by means of a [[Multipoint Control Unit]] (MCU). This is a bridge that interconnects calls from several sources (in a similar way to the audio conference call). All parties call the MCU, or the MCU can also call the parties which are going to participate, in sequence. There are MCU bridges for IP and ISDN-based videoconferencing. There are MCUs which are pure software, and others which are a combination of hardware and software. An MCU is characterised according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle, its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols, and features such as Continuous Presence, in which multiple parties can be seen on-screen at once. MCUs can be stand-alone hardware devices, or they can be embedded into dedicated videoconferencing units.

The MCU consists of two logical components:
# A single multipoint controller (MC), and
# Multipoint Processors (MP), sometimes referred to as the mixer.

The MC controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane, which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation, endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls. This component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources.
While the MC controls resources and signaling negotiations, the MP operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint. The MP generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference.

Some systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no MCU, stand-alone, embedded or otherwise. These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as "decentralized multipoint", where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central "manager" or other bottleneck. The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they don't have to be relayed through a central point. Also, users can make ad-hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU. This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth, because every station must transmit to every other station directly.&lt;ref name="V&amp;VCF" /&gt;

=== Cloud-based video conferencing ===
Cloud-based video conferencing can be used without the hardware generally required by other video conferencing systems, and can be designed for use by [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-276065692.html |title=PDS and Vidtel Enable Affordable, Cloud-Based, Interoperable Video Conferencing for Southeast Michigan Businesses |publisher=''Information Technology Newsweekly'' |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |date=December 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611071132/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-276065692.html |archivedate=June 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or larger international or multinational corporations like [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=Stair&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iT4WAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=cloud-based+video+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cAEFU_D2Je_wyAHsuIC4Aw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cloud-based%20video%20conferencing&amp;f=false |page=288 |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |title=Principles of Information Systems |author=Ralph Stair and George Reynolds |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511201829/https://books.google.com/books?id=iT4WAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=cloud-based+video+conferencing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cAEFU_D2Je_wyAHsuIC4Aw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cloud-based%20video%20conferencing&amp;f=false |archivedate=May 11, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/746946/Facebook_CIO_Supports_Video_Calls_to_Preserve_Employee_Culture#undefined |date=January 30, 2014 |title=Facebook CIO Supports Video Calls to Preserve Employee Culture |author=Stacy Collett |publisher=''[[CIO Magazine]]'' |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213025348/http://www.cio.com/article/746946/Facebook_CIO_Supports_Video_Calls_to_Preserve_Employee_Culture#undefined |archivedate=February 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud-based systems can handle either 2D or 3D video broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-330937061.html |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |title="Cloud-Based Interoperability Platform for Video Conferencing" in Patent Application Approval Process |publisher=''Politics &amp; Government Week'' |date=May 23, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611070857/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-330937061.html |archivedate=June 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud-based systems can also implement mobile calls, VOIP, and other forms of video calling.

{{Update|date=February 2015}}
[[File:Video Call.jpg|thumb|right|A '''mobile video''' call between [[Sweden]] and [[Singapore]] made on a [[Sony-Ericsson|Sony Ericsson]] [[K800]] (2007)]]

High speed Internet connectivity has become more widely available at a reasonable cost and the cost of video capture and display technology has decreased. Consequently, personal videoconferencing systems based on a webcam, personal computer system, software compression, and broadband Internet connectivity have become progressively more affordable to the general public. Also, the hardware used for this technology has continued to improve in quality, and prices have dropped dramatically. The availability of freeware (often as part of [[chat program]]s) has made software based videoconferencing accessible to many.

The widest deployment of video telephony now occurs in [[mobile phone]]s.  Nearly all mobile phones supporting [[UMTS]] networks can work as videophones using their internal cameras, and are able to make video calls wirelessly to other UMTS users in the same country or internationally.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As of the second quarter of 2007, there are over 131 million UMTS users (and hence potential videophone users), on 134 networks in 59 countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Mobile phones can also use broadband wireless Internet, whether through the cell phone network or over a local [[wifi]] connection, along with software-based videophone apps to make calls to any video-capable Internet user, whether mobile or fixed.

[[Hearing impairment|Deaf, hard-of-hearing]], and [[mutism|mute]] individuals have a particular role in the development of affordable high-quality videotelephony as a means of communicating with each other in [[sign language]]. Unlike [[Video Relay Service]], which is intended to support communication between a caller using sign language and another party using spoken language, videoconferencing can be used directly between two deaf signers.

Videophones are increasingly used in the provision of [[telemedicine]] to the elderly,  disabled, and to those in remote locations, where the ease and convenience of quickly obtaining diagnostic and consultative medical services are readily apparent.&lt;ref name="Aberdeen"&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25712429_ITM Videophone Scheme Could Provide 'Virtual Care' for Elderly Residents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511170001/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25712429_ITM |date=2013-05-11 }}, Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal (UK), published in Europe Intelligence Wire, 13 November 2006, retrieved 2009-04-14;&lt;/ref&gt; In one single instance quoted in 2006: "A nurse-led clinic at Letham has received positive feedback on a trial of a video-link which allowed 60 [[pensioner]]s to be assessed by medics without travelling to a doctor's office or medical clinic."&lt;ref name="Aberdeen" /&gt; A further improvement in telemedical services has been the development of new technology incorporated into special videophones to permit remote diagnostic services, such as [[blood sugar]] level, [[blood pressure]], and [[vital signs]] monitoring. Such units are capable of relaying both regular audiovideo plus medical data over either standard ([[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]) telephone or newer [[broadband]] lines.&lt;ref name="BusinessWire-2004.05.03"&gt;"Motion Media Unveils Two New Healthcare Videophones – CareStation 156s and CareStation 126s", Business Wire, May 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tandberg Image Gallery - telepresence-t3-side-view-hires.jpg|thumb|A Tandberg T3 '''high resolution telepresence''' room in use (2008).]]
Videotelephony has also been deployed in corporate [[teleconferencing]], also available through the use of public access videoconferencing rooms. A higher level of videoconferencing that employs advanced telecommunication technologies and high-resolution displays is called ''[[telepresence]]''.

Today the principles, if not the precise mechanisms, of a videophone are employed by many users worldwide in the form of [[webcam]] videocalls using personal computers, with inexpensive webcams, microphones, and free videocalling [[Web client]] programs. Thus an activity that was disappointing as a separate service has found a niche as a minor feature in software products intended for other purposes.

According to Juniper Research, smartphone videophone users will reach 29 million by 2015 globally.&lt;ref name="JuniperResearch"&gt;[http://juniperresearch.com/viewpressrelease.php?pr=209 Smartphone Video Call Users to reach 29 million by 2015 Globally, finds Juniper Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626004835/http://www.juniperresearch.com/viewpressrelease.php?pr=209 |date=2014-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Pew Research in 2010, revealed that 7% of Americans have made a mobile video call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = 7% Of All Americans Have Made A Mobile Video Call| url = http://theappwhisperer.com/2010/10/14/7-of-all-americans-have-made-a-mobile-video-call/| newspaper = theappwhisperer.com| date = 14 October 2010| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131225100910/http://theappwhisperer.com/2010/10/14/7-of-all-americans-have-made-a-mobile-video-call/| archivedate = 25 December 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on government and law ===

In the United States, videoconferencing has allowed testimony to be used for an individual who is unable or prefers not to attend the physical legal settings, or would be subjected to severe psychological stress in doing so, however there is a controversy on the use of testimony by foreign or unavailable witnesses via video transmission, regarding the violation of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment]] of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Tokson, Matthew J. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1249646 Virtual Confrontation: Is Videoconference Testimony by an Unavailable Witness Constitutional?], [[University of Chicago Law Review]], 2007, Vol. 74, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a military investigation in [[North Carolina]], [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] witnesses have testified via videoconferencing.

In [[Hall County, Georgia]], videoconferencing systems are used for initial court appearances. The systems link jails with court rooms, reducing the expenses and security risks of transporting prisoners to the courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesize.com/Industry_Solutions/Case_Studies/Case-Study_Hall-County.aspx Case Study: Hall County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722232009/http://www.lifesize.com/Industry_Solutions/Case_Studies/Case-Study_Hall-County.aspx |date=2012-07-22 }}, Lifesize.com website.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on education ===
[[File:American, Indonesian Students Link Hands Via Distance Learning.jpg|thumb|Indonesian and U.S. students participating in an educational videoconference (2010)]]
{{See also|Distance education}}

Videoconferencing provides students with the opportunity to learn by participating in two-way communication forums. Furthermore, teachers and lecturers worldwide can be brought to remote or otherwise isolated educational facilities. Students from diverse communities and backgrounds can come together to learn about one another through practices known as [[telecollaboration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Technology and Second Language Teaching and Learning|last=Dooly|first=Melinda|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=169–183|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118914069.ch12|chapter = Telecollaboration|year = 2017|isbn = 9781118914069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Telecollaboration 2.0|last=Guth|first=Sarah|last2=Helm|first2=Francesca|language=en|doi=10.3726/978-3-0351-0013-6|year = 2010|isbn = 9783035100136}}&lt;/ref&gt;(in foreign language education) and [[virtual exchange]], although [[language barrier]]s will continue to be present. Such students are able to explore, communicate, analyze, and share information and ideas with one another. Through videoconferencing, students can visit other parts of the world to speak with their peers, as well as visit museums and other cultural and educational facilities. Such [[history of virtual learning environments|virtual field trips]] can provide enriched learning opportunities to students, especially those in geographically isolated locations, and to the economically disadvantaged. Small schools can use these technologies to pool resources and provide courses, such as in foreign languages, which could not otherwise be offered.

A few examples of benefits that videoconferencing can provide in campus environments include:

=== Impact on medicine and health ===
{{main|Telemedicine}}

Videoconferencing is a highly useful technology for real-time [[telemedicine]] and [[telenursing]] applications, such as [[remote diagnostics|diagnosis]], consulting, transmission of [[medical imaging|medical images]], etc. With videoconferencing, patients may contact [[nurse]]s and [[physician]]s in [[medical emergency|emergency]] or routine situations; physicians and other [[paramedical]] professionals can discuss cases across large distances. Rural areas can use this technology for diagnostic purposes, thus saving lives and making more efficient use of health care money. For example, a rural medical center in [[Ohio]] used videoconferencing to successfully cut the number of transfers of sick infants to a [[hospital]] {{convert|70|mi|km}} away. This had previously cost nearly $10,000 per transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesize.com/en/company/news/press-releases/2008/adena-health-system Adena Health System Uses LifeSize High Definition Video to Bring Remote Specialists to Infant Patients] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707212532/https://www.lifesize.com/en/company/news/press-releases/2008/adena-health-system |date=2017-07-07 }} (media release), LifeSize.com website, December 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on business ===

Videoconferencing can enable individuals in distant locations to participate in meetings on short notice, with time and money savings. Technology such as [[VoIP]] can be used in conjunction with desktop videoconferencing to enable low-cost face-to-face business meetings without leaving the desk, especially for businesses with widespread offices. The technology is also used for [[telecommuting]], in which employees work from home. One research report based on a sampling of 1,800 corporate employees showed that, as of June 2010, 54% of the respondents with access to video conferencing used it "all of the time" or "frequently".&lt;ref name=InformationWeek-2010.09.30&gt;By Alison Diane, InformationWeek.

Videoconferencing is also currently being introduced on online networking websites, in order to help businesses form profitable relationships quickly and efficiently without leaving their place of work. This has been leveraged by banks to connect busy banking professionals with customers in various locations using [[video banking]] technology.

Videoconferencing on hand-held mobile devices ([[mobile collaboration]] technology) is being used in industries such as manufacturing, energy, healthcare, insurance, government, and public safety. Live, visual interaction removes traditional restrictions of distance and time, often in locations previously unreachable, such as a manufacturing plant floor thousands of miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m.controleng.com/index.php?id%3D2819%26tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D11999%26cHash%3D0387e9884a |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820094831/http://m.controleng.com/index.php?id=2819&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=11999&amp;cHash=0387e9884a |archivedate=August 20, 2011 }}, Mobile video system visually connects global plant floor engineers, Control Engineering, May 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the increasingly [[Globalization|globalized]] [[film industry]], videoconferencing has become useful as a method by which creative talent in many different locations can collaborate closely on the complex details of film production. For example, for the 2013 award-winning animated film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', [[Burbank, California|Burbank]]-based [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] hired the [[New York City]]-based husband-and-wife songwriting team of [[Robert Lopez]] and [[Kristen Anderson-Lopez]] to write the songs, which required two-hour-long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months.&lt;ref name="Hogg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogg|first=Trevor|title=Snowed Under: Chris Buck talks about Frozen|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/03/snowed-under-chris-buck-talks-about.html|work=Flickering Myth|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=26 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326133247/http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/03/snowed-under-chris-buck-talks-about.html|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Truax"&gt;{{cite news|last=Truax|first=Jackson|title=Frozen composers Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez|url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/frozen-composers-robert-lopez-and-kristen-anderson-lopez|accessdate=January 4, 2014|newspaper=Awards Daily|date=November 27, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104213934/http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/frozen-composers-robert-lopez-and-kristen-anderson-lopez|archivedate=January 4, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziemba|first=Christine|title=Disney's Frozen Wins Academy Award for Animated Feature|url=http://blog.calarts.edu/2014/03/03/disneys-frozen-wins-academy-award-for-animated-feature/|work=24700: News from California Institute of the Arts|publisher=California Institute of the Arts|accessdate=March 23, 2014|date=March 3, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311225326/http://blog.calarts.edu/2014/03/03/disneys-frozen-wins-academy-award-for-animated-feature/|archivedate=March 11, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|title=Awards Spotlight: 'Frozen' Director Chris Buck on Crafting Well-Rounded Female Characters|url=http://www.studiosystemnews.com/spotlight-frozen-director-chris-buck-on-crafting-well-rounded-female-characters/|newspaper=Studio System News|accessdate=March 23, 2014|date=November 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324001614/http://www.studiosystemnews.com/spotlight-frozen-director-chris-buck-on-crafting-well-rounded-female-characters/|archivedate=March 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of lower cost endpoints, cloud based infrastructure and technology trends such as WebRTC, Video Conferencing is moving from just a business-to-business offering, to a business-to-business and business-to-consumer offering.

Although videoconferencing has frequently proven its value, research has shown that some non-managerial employees prefer not to use it due to several factors, including anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Mark. "Broadband videoconferencing as knowledge management tool," Journal of Knowledge Management 11, no. 2 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Some such anxieties can be avoided if managers use the technology as part of the normal course of business. Remote workers can also adopt certain behaviors and best practices to stay connected with their co-workers and company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20150309152853/https://blog.highfive.com/how-to-stay-connected-while-working-remotely] Freeman, Michael, "How to stay connected while working remotely"&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also find that attendees of business and medical videoconferences must work harder to interpret information delivered during a conference than they would if they attended face-to-face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informs.org/article.php?id=1511&amp;p=1 ]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Ferran, Carlos and Watts, Stephanie.

=== Impact on media relations ===
{{main|Press videoconferencing}}

The concept of [[press videoconferencing]] was developed in October 2007 by the PanAfrican Press Association (APPA), a Paris France-based [[non-governmental organization]], to allow African journalists to participate in international [[press conferences]] on developmental and [[good governance]] issues.

Press videoconferencing permits international press conferences via videoconferencing over the Internet. Journalists can participate on an international press conference from any location, without leaving their offices or countries. They need only be seated by a computer connected to the Internet in order to ask their questions to the speaker.

In 2004, the [[International Monetary Fund]] introduced the Online Media Briefing Center, a password-protected site available only to professional journalists. The site enables the IMF to present press briefings globally and facilitates direct questions to briefers from the press. The site has been copied by other international organizations since its inception. More than 4,000 journalists worldwide are currently registered with the IMF.

=== Use in sign language communications ===
[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|160px|left|Video Interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]
{{Main|Video Relay Service|Video Remote Interpreting}}

One of the first demonstrations of the ability for [[telecommunication]]s to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[videophone]] (trademarked as the "Picturephone") was introduced to the public at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&amp;nbsp;–two deaf users were able to communicate freely with each other between the fair and another city.&lt;ref name="BellLabs" /&gt; Various universities and other organizations, including [[BT Research#History|British Telecom's Martlesham]] facility, have also conducted extensive research on [[sign language|signing]] via videotelephony.&lt;ref name="NS-1989.08.19"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow [[Plain old telephone service|analogue copper phone lines]],&lt;ref name="Sperling" /&gt; coupled with the high cost of better quality [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN (data) phone lines]].&lt;ref name="NS-1989.08.19" /&gt; Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient and powerful [[video codec]]s and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and [[Internet Protocol|IP (Internet)]] services in the 1990s.

==== 21st century improvements ====

Significant improvements in video call quality of service for the deaf occurred in the United States in 2003 when [[Sorenson Media Inc.]] (formerly Sorenson Vision Inc.), a video compression software coding company, developed its VP-100 model stand-alone [[videophone]] specifically for the deaf community.  It was designed to output its video to the user's television in order to lower the cost of acquisition, and to offer remote control and a powerful [[Sorenson codec|video compression codec]] for unequaled video quality and ease of use with video relay services. Favourable reviews quickly led to its popular usage at educational facilities for the deaf, and from there to the greater deaf community.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;

Fitzgerald, Thomas J. [http://tech2.nytimes.com/mem/technology/techreview.html?_r=2&amp;res=9906E1DC163FF93BA25751C1A9659C8B63 For the Deaf, Communication Without the Wait]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[The New York Times]], December 18, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupled with similar high-quality videophones introduced by other electronics manufacturers, the [[Broadband Internet access|availability of high speed Internet]], and [[Video Relay Service#U.S. VRS regulation|sponsored video relay services]] authorized by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 2002, VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;

==== Present day usage ====

[[Image:Deaf or HoH person at his workplace using a Video Relay Service to communicate with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter and sign language SVCC 2007 Brigitte SLI + Mark.jpg|thumb|right|A '''deaf or hard-of-hearing person using a Video Relay Service''' at his workplace to communicate with a hearing person in London (2007).]]

Using such video equipment in the present day, the deaf, hard-of-hearing, and speech-impaired can communicate between themselves and with hearing individuals using [[sign language]]. The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide "Video Relay Services" (VRS). Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter, who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person's party. Video equipment is also used to do on-site sign language translation via [[Video Remote Interpreting]] (VRI).  The relative low cost and widespread availability of [[3G]] [[mobile phone]] technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech-impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others. Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways.

Sign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present day where one of the parties is [[deaf]], [[hard-of-hearing]], or [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired (mute)]]. In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) to spoken French, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) to spoken English, and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other), [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) to spoken German, and so on.

[[Multilingual]] [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|sign language interpreter]]s, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as a multilingual interpreter interpreting a call from a deaf person using ASL to reserve a hotel room at a hotel in the [[Dominican Republic]] whose staff speaks Spanish only, therefore the interpreter has to utilize ASL, spoken Spanish, and spoken English to facilitate the call for the deaf person), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable mental processing efforts on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[Linguistics|construction]], [[semantics]] and [[syntax]], different from the aural version of the same principal language.

With video interpreting, [[sign language]] interpreters work remotely with live [[video]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like [[telephone interpreting]], video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|interpreters]] are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|necessary equipment]]. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely, in order to [[Zoom lens|zoom]] in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing.

The name "videophone" never became as standardized as its earlier counterpart "telephone", resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country.  Videophones are also known as "video phones", "videotelephones" (or "video telephones") and often by an early trademarked name ''Picturephone'', which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume.

A ''[[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Video conferencing systems meant for multiple participants|videoconference system]]'' is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A ''videoconference'' (also known as a ''videoteleconference'') allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a [[multipoint control unit]] (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[science fiction]] literature, names commonly associated with videophones include "telephonoscope", "telephote", ''viewphone'', ''vidphone'', ''vidfone'', and ''visiphone''. The first example was probably the cartoon [https://www.histv.net/george-dumaurier-1877 "Edison's Telephonoscope" by George du Maurier in ''Punch'' 1878] . In many [[science fiction]] [[movies]] and TV programs that are set in the future, videophones were used as a primary method of communication. One of the first movies where a videophone was used was [[Fritz Lang|Fritz Lang's]] ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;French, Lawrence. [http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/fritz-langs-metropolis-the-best-film-of-this-or-any-other-year/ Director Fritz Lang on the Making of Metropolis], May 15, 2010, retrieved from CinemaFantastique website, April 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable examples of videophones in popular culture include an iconic scene from the 1968 film [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] set on [[List of spacecraft from the Space Odyssey series#Space Station V|Space Station V]]. The movie was released shortly before AT&amp;T began its efforts to commercialize its Picturephone Mod II service in several cities and depicts a videocall to Earth using an advanced AT&amp;T videophone—which it predicts will cost $1.70 for a two-minute call in 2001 (a fraction of the company's real rates on Earth in 1968). Film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] strove for scientific accuracy, relying on interviews with scientists and engineers at [[Bell Labs]] in the United States. Dr. [[Lawrence Rabiner|Larry Rabiner]] of Bell Labs, discussing videophone research in the documentary ''2001: The Making of a Myth'', stated that in the mid-to-late-1960s videophones "...captured the imagination of the public and...  of Mr. Kubrick and the people who reported to him".  In one ''2001'' movie scene a central character, Dr. Heywood Floyd, calls home to contact his family, a social feature noted in the ''Making of a Myth''.

A portable videophone is also featured prominently in the 2009 science fiction movie ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'', where the story's protagonist, Sam Bell, also calls home as well to communicate with loved ones. Bell, the lone occupant of a mining station on the far side of the Earth's moon, finally succeeds in making his videocall after an extended work period, but becomes traumatized when viewing his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;

Other popular science fiction stories with videophones include ''[[Space: 1999]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'', and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''. The videophone was a staple, everyday technology in the futuristic 1960s [[Hanna Barbera]] cartoon ''[[The Jetsons]]''.

Other earlier examples of videophones in popular culture included a videophone that was featured in the [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon, ''[[Plane Daffy]]'', in which the female spy [[Hatta Mari]] used a videophone to communicate with [[Adolf Hitler]] (1944), as well as a device with the same functionality has been used by the [[Dick Tracy#Evolution of the strip|comic strip character ''Dick Tracy'']]. Called the '2-Way Wrist TV', the fictional detective often used the phone to communicate with police headquarters&lt;ref&gt;

By the early 2010s videotelephony and videophones had become commonplace and unremarkable in various forms of media, in part due to their real and ubiquitous presence in common electronic devices and laptop computers. Additionally, TV programming increasingly utilized videophones to interview subjects of interest and to present live coverage by news correspondents, via the Internet or by satellite links. In the mass market media, the popular U.S. [[TV talk show]] hostess [[Oprah Winfrey]] incorporated videotelephony into her TV program on a regular basis from May 21, 2009, with an initial episode called ''Where the Skype Are You?'', as part of a marketing agreement with the Internet telecommunication company [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;
