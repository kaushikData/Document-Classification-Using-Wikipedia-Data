'''Jan van Kessel''' or '''the other Jan van Kessel''' (c. 1620, [[Antwerp]] &amp;ndash; in or after 1661, Amsterdam (?)) was a Flemish painter of still lifes of fruits, hunting pieces and flowers.  After training in Antwerp he moved to the Dutch Republic where he is recorded as operating a studio in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/237496 Jan van Kessel (ca. 1620-in of na 1661)] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Very little information is available about the life of Jan van Kessel.  He was born in Antwerp some time between 1615 and 1625.  He trained with the history painter [[Simon de Vos]].  He was admitted as a master in the Antwerp [[Guild of St Luke]] in the Guild year 1644-1645, the same year as [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]] with whom he is often confused.

He is recorded in 1649 in Amsterdam, where he received in September 1649 two assistants: Jan Baptist Walvis and Gerrit Cornelisz.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

His last recorded work dates from 1661 and he is believed to have died in or after 1661.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

==Work==
[[File:'the other' Jan van Kessel - A still life of a swan and other birds, with rabbits, fruit and vegetables and a landscape beyond.jpg|thumb|288px|''A still life of a swan and other birds, with rabbits, fruit and vegetables and a landscape beyond'']]
'the other' Jan van Kessel was a still life specialist who painted still lifes of fruits, hunting pieces and flowers.  About 30 works have been attributed to Jan van Kessel.&lt;ref name=bon&gt;[https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22647/lot/173 'the other' Jan van Kessel, ''Game and fruit still life with poultry and hounds.png''] at Bonhams&lt;/ref&gt;  Attribution of work to 'the other' Jan van Kessel has been difficult due to confusion with other artists with a similar name all active around the same time.  In addition to the still life painter Jan van Kessel the Elder, there was another Antwerp painter referred to as [[Jan van Kessel the Younger]] (the son of Jan van Kessel the Elder) who is believed to have painted still lifes, while in Amsterdam there was a [[Jan van Kessel (Amsterdam)|Jan van Kessel]] known as a landscape painter.&lt;ref name=ni&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/44094 Jan van Kessel the Younger] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.rkd.nl/explore/artists/44092 Jan van Kessel (of Amsterdam)] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work has often been confused with that of his better known namesake and contemporary, Jan van Kessel the Elder as well as that of [[Jan van Kessel the Younger]].&lt;ref name=bon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/45238 Jan van Kessel (ca. 1620-in of na 1661), ''Stilleven van jachtbuit en vruchten in een landschap''] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History&lt;/ref&gt;  'the other' Jan van Kessel and Jan van Kessel the Elder have a distinctive manner of signing.

There are clear stylistic differences between the work of 'the other' Jan van Kessel and Jan van Kessel the Elder. Art historian K. Ertz considers 'the other' Jan van Kessel as not inferior to Jan van Kessel the Elder, and even believes him to eclipse his more famous namesake in his masterpiece [[:File:'the other' Jan van Kessel - Swags of fruit and flowers surrounding a cartouche with a sulphur-crested cockatoo.jpg|''Swags of fruit and flowers surrounding a cartouche with a sulphur-crested cockatoo'']].  This work is in the collection of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] where it is still attributed to Jan van Kessel the Elder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/jan-van-kessel-antwerp-c1620-1661-5813672-details.aspx Jan van Kessel (Antwerp c.1620-?1661 ?), ''Grapes, peaches, hazelnuts, quinces, redcurrants and other fruit, with a brimstone butterfly, a bumblebee and other insects on a stone capital''] at Christie's&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/45261 Fred G. Meyer] attributes the work ''Grapes, peaches, hazelnuts, quinces, redcurrants and other fruit, with a brimstone butterfly, a bumblebee and other insects on a stone capital'' to 'the other' Jan van Kessel but the work is attributed to Jan van Kessel (I) at the Fitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

{{2008 Summer Paralympics}}
During the '''Parade of Nations''' at the [[2008 Summer Paralympics#Opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2008 Summer Paralympic Games]], athletes from each participating country paraded in the stadium, preceded by their flag. The flag was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the [[National Paralympic Committee]] or by the athletes themselves to represent their country. It is considered a great honour to bear the country's flag in the Parade of Nations.

==Parade order==
Per tradition, the host country, in this case the [[People's Republic of China]], marched last however contrary to tradition in the [[Olympic Games]] the national team of [[Greece]] did not enter first. All other nations marched in name order in the language of the host nation, which in this case is the [[Chinese language]]. As Chinese is written in characters and not letters, the order of the teams' entry was determined by the number of strokes in the first character of their respective countries' [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]] names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/ceremonies/n214508163.shtml |title=Opening Ceremony plan released - The Official Website of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games |accessdate=6 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906055923/http://en.beijing2008.cn/ceremonies/n214508163.shtml |archivedate=6 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Countries with the same number of strokes in the first character are sorted by those of the next character. This made [[Guinea]] (几内亚) the first country to enter, as it takes two strokes to write the first character in the country's name (几), and [[Zambia]] (赞比亚) last-but-one, ahead of China.

==List==
The following is a list of each country's flag bearer. The list is sorted in Latin alphabetical order.

It is not known at present who carried Guinea's flag.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==	 
McCarrick was born on [[Long Island|Long Island, New York]] and she lived there until her move to [[Ireland]] in January 1987.&lt;ref name="CharleyProject"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://presspack.rte.ie/2006/07/04/cracking-crime-12/|title=CRACKING CRIME {{!}} RTÉ Presspack|website=presspack.rte.ie|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarrick disappeared on March 26, 1993.&lt;ref name="TheJournal.ie"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/annie-mccarrick-missing-dublin-2695550-Apr2016/|title=Mother of American student missing from Dublin for 23 years says she just wants a grave|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=TheJournal.ie|access-date=2016-12-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had left her apartment in [[Dublin]], Ireland so that she could go to the [[Wicklow Mountains]] for the day. She had asked a friend to accompany her but her friend declined. [[CCTV]] captured images of McCarrick in the [[Allied Irish Bank]] location in Sandymount, where she was seen withdrawing money from her bank account. She did some shopping at Quinnsworth supermarket before returning to her apartment at 3:00pm. She was seen on a bus at about 3:40pm in [[Ranelagh]].&lt;ref name="CIM"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During nighttime between the time of 9:00 and 11:00pm, someone had claimed to have seen her at a pub called Johnnie Fox's in [[Glencullen]] talking to a young man who was wearing a wax jacket. The woman who was sighted by someone at the pub was believed to be McCarrick. McCarrick had gone to see an Irish music and dancing show that was a traditional event called the Hooley Show, but McCarrick did not realise there was a cover charge. McCarrick's male friend then paid for her, and continued to keep paying for her during her entire time there. Nobody saw either McCarrick or her male friend leave the pub, and the man's identity was never discovered. Since it was dark and wet outside, people question if she would have walked all the way to Enniskerry, which was 6km away.&lt;ref name="TheJournal.ie"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and aftermath==
Numerous searches by authorities in Ireland have turned up nothing in McCarrick's disappearance. The authorities focused their search on the Wicklow Mountains and wider [[Leinster]] area as many women have gone missing there since 1990.&lt;ref name="CIM"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] believe that McCarrick was murdered by the same serial killer involved in the other disappearances.&lt;ref name="CharleyProject"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, in a new book called ''Missing, Presumed'' by a detective named Sergeant Alan Bailey, it was revealed that an IRA killer and child abuser was established as a "credible suspect" in the disappearance of McCarrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/missing-annie-mccarricks-mother-astonished-to-learn-of-ira-suspect-in-students-disappearance-30903767.html|title=Missing Annie McCarrick's mother 'astonished' to learn of IRA suspect in student's disappearance - Independent.ie|newspaper=Independent.ie|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/ira-member-may-have-killed-annie-mccarrick-former-garda-claims-1.2038826|title=IRA member may have killed Annie McCarrick, former garda claims|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the case was reopened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcoldcaseinvestigations.com/showthread.php?5670-Case-Reopened-Annie-McCarrick|title=Case Reopened:  Annie McCarrick|website=www.officialcoldcaseinvestigations.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony John "A.J." Soprano Jr.''' (born July 15, 1986), played by [[Robert Iler]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/cast-and-crew/anthony-soprano-jr&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] [[television|TV]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]''. He is the son of [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] and [[Tony Soprano]].

==Biography==
{{plot|Character|date=September 2015}}
{{Overly detailed|date=September 2015}}
Anthony is the troubled younger brother of Tony and Carmela's more accomplished daughter, [[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]]. A chronic [[underachiever]] with self-esteem issues, A.J. is diagnosed as borderline [[Attention Deficit Disorder|ADD]]. Additionally, he crashes his mother's car, smokes [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] at his own [[confirmation]], gets drunk on stolen [[Eucharist|communion]] wine, [[vandalism|vandalizes]] his school swimming pool, and is finally expelled after cheating on a test. As a result, his parents arrange to send him to [[military school]], until they discover that he suffers from the same anxiety and [[panic attack]]s that plagued his father and grandfather. Instead, he remains in public school.  His birthday is July 15.

In the episode "[[Two Tonys]]," it is revealed that Tony had bought A.J. an elaborate $5,000 drum set, and in the episode "[[All Happy Families...]]," despite discovering that A.J. is not doing well in school and does not have an optimistic future as far as college is concerned, Tony gets him an almost new [[Nissan Xterra]], though Tony claims it is a "motivational tool."  A.J. is excited about the SUV, though he comments about the environmental impact of SUV's and claims he may encounter social pressure from school friends to drive a different vehicle. During the fifth season he also shows an increasing amount of disrespect to his mother, presumably due to the separation. He tends to relate to his father and ends up moving in with him during the separation; however, in the episode "[[Sentimental Education (The Sopranos episode)|Sentimental Education]]," when A.J. and Tony get into a scuffle over A.J.'s disrespect, as his father has him pinned against the wall, A.J. says, "One of these days, you wait...I'm going to kick your fucking ass."  Immediately afterwards, A.J. decides he wants to move back in with his mother, threatening to call social services due to the ongoing "violence against children" present in his father's home. Carmela takes the opportunity to demand certain things from A.J. in return for allowing him to move back in, like showing respect to his mother by not swearing at her and attending to schoolwork.

Frequently throughout the series, Tony and Carmela express concern about A.J.'s future. Tony has no desire to groom his son into a position within his organization. In the fifth season of the show, A.J. displays an unexpected interest in pursuing a career in [[event planning]], but later derides his parents' mentions of it (e.g., in "[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Sacrimoni Request...]]").

In all seasons, A.J. is portrayed as a fan of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], via [[product placement]]s (shirts, coats, posters and stickers) of bands like [[Pantera]], [[Nevermore]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Coal Chamber]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], and [[Limp Bizkit]] though as early as season 1 a poster of an [[Ulver]] [[black metal]] album can be spotted in his room. By the end of the series, having grown more worldly and introspective, he discovers and begins analyzing the early work of [[Bob Dylan]]. Through various plot points and pieces of clothing, A.J. is identified as a fan of the [[New York Giants]], [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[New York Red Bulls|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]].
 
In "[[Full Leather Jacket (The Sopranos episode)|Full Leather Jacket]]", A.J. says that he wants to go to [[Harvard University]] or [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] for college.  Tony dismisses the idea as unrealistic given A.J.'s poor academic performance. During Season 3, when Tony asks him about it at a family dinner, A.J. claims that he never said that, as he knows his grades wouldn't be good enough.  Throughout Season 5, references are made to the unlikelihood of A.J.'s being admitted to a four-year university.

In Season 6, A.J. admits to his parents that he has flunked out of the community college he was attending, a worrying parallel to Tony's own youth. A.J. acquires a large knife and goes to the institution where [[Junior Soprano|Uncle Junior]] is being held, in a futile effort to exact revenge for his father. He is arrested but later released without charge thanks to his father's political connections. At this time, he has been seen delving into the [[New York City]] club scene and experimenting with [[cocaine]].

After several days of Anthony's claiming to be searching for jobs on the [[Internet]] with no result, Tony intervenes and arranges a construction job for his son. A.J. first claims he cannot do it because he will be trying again for community college, but Tony says that is not a problem as many of the men who work in construction are high school and college students. A.J. is reluctant to accept the job because of the early hours and outdoor work, which makes Tony angry. Tony grabs a [[football helmet]] and smashes the windshield of A.J.'s [[Nissan Xterra]], and warns A.J. not to test him. A.J. reluctantly works at the construction site where he meets [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Blanca Selgado|Blanca Selgado]], whom he begins dating. Blanca, who is Dominican, 10 years A.J.'s senior, and has a three-year-old son named Hector, meets with Carmela's disapproval. Tony however is more approving of the relationship, commenting that Blanca was [[Catholic]] like the Sopranos, at least.

In 2007, A.J. proposes to Blanca at a fancy restaurant dinner by telling her that he will own a couple of restaurants in a couple of years. However, Blanca soon gives the ring back and breaks up with him, leaving A.J. severely depressed. His father tries to cheer him up, telling him there are many reasons he will meet other women and be successful in future relationships, including that he is smart, hard-working and white, "a huge plus nowadays."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=The Sopranos 6x17 - Tony Soprano tries to cheer up A.J.|date=2012-10-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vfRSO6psrA|accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He quits his job and mopes about until his father forces him to attend a fraternity party with the college-age relatives of his fellow mafiosi. A.J. grudgingly attends, but soon starts to enjoy himself. Several of the boys run a [[sports betting]] operation at the college and after a night of drinking, they beat and torture a college student who neglected to pay them by pouring acid on his foot.  A.J. joins in to help forget his relationship problems. Later, he joins his new friends again when one of them carelessly opens the door of his car, hitting a passerby on a bicycle. They make racial slurs towards the man, blame the accident on him, and attack the man. A.J. stands by, neither helping his friends, nor aiding the victim. Following that, A.J. is seen telling his psychiatrist that he is once again depressed about the world due to that incident.

This depression would lead to a botched suicide attempt, wherein A.J. ties a cinder block to his leg with a too-long length of rope and attempts to drown himself in the pool at the Soprano home. His father hears his cries for help and dives into the pool and rescues him. He is then placed in a facility to get psychiatric care, where he meets Rhiannon, an ex-girlfriend of his former friend [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Hernan O.27Brien|Hernan]]. After Tony tells him that his uncle [[Bobby Baccalieri|Bobby]] has been shot dead, A.J. begins to cry and complain about how Bobby's death negatively affects him. Tony loses patience with him, violently drags him out of his bed, slaps him around, and tells him to pack as the family leaves home quickly to elude a possible attack by [[Phil Leotardo]]'s gang.

In the final episode, A.J. is in his Nissan Xterra with Rhiannon, his new girlfriend, and starts making out with her, but they both rush out of the vehicle when it catches fire due to A.J.'s parking it over a pile of leaves. He later decides he wants to join the Army, but is talked out of it by his parents and girlfriend. Instead, Tony gets him a new [[BMW M3]] and a job working for [[Little Carmine]]'s film production company. The job, with the possibility of A.J. opening up his own nightclub, which Tony proposes to his son if he does well with the job, seems to alleviate A.J.'s depression, and he is last seen having dinner with his family.

[[File:North carolina algonkin-kleidung08.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Watercolor painting by Governor [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] c.1585 of an [[Algonquian peoples|Algonkin]] Indian Chief in what is today [[North Carolina]].]] 
The '''Aquascogoc''' is the name given to a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe of [[Secotan]] people and also the name of a village encountered by the [[England|English]] during their late 16th century attempts to settle and establish permanent colonies in what is now [[North Carolina]], known at the time as [[Virginia]]. Together with the rest of Secotan people they formed a part of the Native American group known as the [[Carolina Algonquian]] Indians, and spoke the now extinct [[Carolina Algonquian language]]. In 1585 the village of Aquascogoc was burned by Sir Richard Grenville, in retaliation for the alleged theft of a silver drinking vessel.

==Roanoke colony==
Sir [[Richard Grenville]] was the leader of the 1585 expedition which first attempted to land English settlers on [[Roanoke Island|Roanoke]] island. Guided by Chief [[Manteo (Croatan)|Manteo]], Grenville arrived at the village but the inhabitants showed little inclination to meet with him, and the Englishmen soon returned to their boats.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; However, a silver drinking cup was found to be missing, and was believed to have been stolen by the Aquascogoc, leading to a furious reaction from Grenville.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A_T0GyxK9DYC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Aquascogoc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uBtwzwd-6e&amp;sig=wRq_5yPfwXUI9UOJV5BxHl9mS7U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cD-kTanmAZCZhQfF_fzOCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aquascogoc&amp;f=false Miller, Lee, ''Roanoke: Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony''] Retrieved April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the angry exchanges which followed, the village of Aquascogoc was torched by the English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=14277 Aquascogoc at www.h-net.org] Retrieved April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aquascogoc would however have their revenge. Grenville left Roanoke, leaving behind fifteen men, battle-hardened soldiers. When Governor [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] returned in 1587 he searched for the fifteen, but found only bones.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; White quickly made contact with friendly natives led by Chief [[Manteo (Croatan)|Manteo]], who explained to him that the lost fifteen had been killed by hostile [[Secotan]], Aquascogoc and [[Dasamongueponke]] warriors,&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; choosing a time and place of attack "of great advantage to the savages".&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Much of what is known about the lives of the Aquascogoc and other [[Algonquian people|Algonquian tribes]] in 16th-century [[North Carolina]] survives because of the [[watercolor painting]]s and the journal kept by Governor [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]]. who was commissioned in 1585 to "draw to life" the inhabitants of the New World and their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Brave-New-World.htmlin Article in Smithsonian Magazine by Abigal Tucker, December 2008] Retrieved March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During White's time at Roanoke Island, he completed numerous watercolor drawings of the surrounding landscape and native peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] society of the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]], and predate the first body of "discovery voyage art" created in the late 18th century by the artists who sailed with Captain [[James Cook]].  They represent the sole surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of America, encountered by England's first settlers.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;

White's enthusiasm for watercolor paint was unusual; most contemporary painters preferred to use [[Oil painting|oil-based paints]].&lt;ref name="Milton, p199"&gt;Milton, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; White's watercolors would soon become a sensation in Europe, and it was not long before the paintings were [[engraving|engraved]] by the Flemish master engraver [[Theodore de Bry]].&lt;ref name="Milton, p200"&gt;Milton, p.200&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the medium of print, the illustrations became widely known and distributed; they were published in 1590 under the title "America".&lt;ref name="Milton, p200"/&gt;

'''Carl Weeks''' (1876–1962)  was an American businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist best known for founding pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies including Weeks &amp; Leo Co., Inc. Carl and his wife Edith built [[Salisbury House (Des Moines, Iowa)|Salisbury House]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines, IA]].

==Early life==
Carl Weeks was born to Charles Weeks and Laura (Chamberlain) Weeks on December 2, 1876 in [[Linn County, Iowa|Linn County, IA]].&lt;ref name="StoryOfIowa"&gt;Peterson, William John (1952). The Story of Iowa: The Progress of an American State, Volume 3, New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Co., Inc. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, the family including 2 year old Carl relocated to [[Kansas]]. Charles and Laura built and managed the Sod Hotel, an elegant hotel made of prairie [[Sod house|sod]] in [[Plainville, Kansas|Plainville, KS]].&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Harriet. "History of Plainville City and Township", Plainville Times, September 21, 1961, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888 when Carl was age 11, the Weeks family moved back to Iowa settling in Des Moines. Carl finished high school at age 16, then attended Highland Park College of Pharmacy in Des Moines earning a degree of Graduate in Pharmacy.&lt;ref name="StoryOfIowa" /&gt;

==Business==
After completing school, Carl moved to  [[Oskaloosa, Iowa|Oskaloosa, IA]] working for Green &amp; Bentley Drug Company. Carl then purchased a drug store in [[Centerville, Iowa|Centerville, IA]]. Carl sold the drug store and returned to Des Moines to work at the D. Weeks Company.&lt;ref name="StoryOfIowa" /&gt;

===D. Weeks Company===
D. Weeks Company was owned by Carl's brothers, Deyet and Leo Weeks. The company manufactured [[patent medicine]]s from formulas that Carl provided. Carl eventually served as President of the company.&lt;ref name="UofIowa"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Biographical Dictionary of Iowa | publisher = The University of Iowa | url = http://uipress.lib.uiowa.edu/bdi/DetailsPage.aspx?id=401 | accessdate = November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StoryOfIowa" /&gt;

===D. C. Leo Company===
Carl and Leo Weeks formed D. C. Leo Company after their brother, Deyet Weeks, died.&lt;ref name="WL"&gt;{{cite web | title = Weeks &amp; Leo - History | publisher = Weeks &amp; Leo | url = http://www.weeksandleo.com/pages.php?pageid=2 | accessdate = November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; D. C. Leo Company offered [[private label]] medicines and cosmetics to individual dealers.&lt;ref name="StoryOfIowa" /&gt;

===The Armand Company===
In 1907, Carl formed The Florian Company to manufacture [[cosmetics]]. The Florian Company, based in Des Moines, was renamed The Armand Company in 1915.

The product was marketed as “ARMAND’S COMPLEXION POWDER IN THE LITTLE PINK &amp; WHITE HAT BOX” and “ARMAND COLD CREAM POWDER In The LITTLE PINK &amp; WHITE HAT BOXES”.&lt;ref name="Armand"&gt;{{cite web | title = Armand | publisher = cosmetics and skin | url = http://cosmeticsandskin.com/companies/armand.php | accessdate = December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1927, The Armand Company was number one in the United States in face powder sales. The company had also expanded into numerous international markets.&lt;ref name="Armand" /&gt;

Carl merged Armand Company into Weeks &amp; Leo Co., Inc. when he retired in 1950.&lt;ref name="WL" /&gt;

'''Daisy May Bates''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0050b.htm Australian Women Biographical entry]&lt;/ref&gt; (born '''Margaret Dwyer'''; 16 October 1859 – 18 April 1951) was an [[Irish-Australian]] journalist, welfare worker and lifelong student of [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] culture and society. She was known among the native people as "Kabbarli" (i.e. /kaparli/, a kin term found in a number of [[Australian languages]] which means "grandmother" or "granddaughter"&lt;ref&gt;Glass, A. and D. Hackett, (2003) ''Ngaanyatjarra and Ngaatjatjarra to English Dictionary'' Alice Springs, IAD Press. {{ISBN|1-86465-053-2}}, p39&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Early life==
Daisy Bates was born Margaret Dwyer in [[County Tipperary]], Ireland in 1859. &lt;!-- no Republic of Ireland in 1859 --&gt; Her mother, Bridget (née Hunt), died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1862.  Her father, James Edward O'Dwyer, married Mary Dillon in 1864 and died en route to the United States, so she was raised in [[Roscrea]] by relatives, and educated at the National School in that town.

==Emigration and life in Australia==
In November 1882, Dwyer—who by then had changed her first name to Daisy May—emigrated to Australia aboard the {{RMS|Almora}} as part of a Queensland government assisted immigration scheme. Some accounts (based on Dwyer's own claims) say that she left Ireland for "health reasons", but biographer [[Julia Blackburn]] discovered that after getting her first job as a [[governess]] in Dublin at age 18, there was a scandal, presumably sexual in nature, which resulted in the young man of the house taking his own life.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} This story has never been verified, but if true, could have spurred Dwyer to leave Ireland and reinvent her history, setting a pattern for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reece |first1=Bob |title=The Irishness of Daisy Bates |url=http://www.irishheritage.net/durack2009.pdf |publisher=Australian-Irish Heritage Association |accessdate=19 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=18 October 2009 |quote="Was her departure hastened by a young man of good family committing suicide on her account? We shall never know."}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until long after her death that the truth about her early life emerged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Vries |first1=Susanna |title=Desert Queen: the Many Lives and Loves of Daisy Bates |url=http://www.susannadevries.com/desert_queen.html |website=Susanna de Vries |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even her recent biographers have produced differing accounts of her life and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Philip |title=Native entitlement |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/native-entitlement/news-story/6f970d6d73786a2161310bfefe7055e5?sv=cb8aff12e99922cb3a5b180ca2b5e05a |accessdate=19 June 2018 |date=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwyer settled first at [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Queensland allegedly staying first at the home of the Bishop of North Queensland and later with family friends who had migrated earlier. Dwyer had travelled with Ernest C. Baglehole and James C. Hann, amongst others, on the later stage of her journey.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Both Baglehole and Hann had boarded at Batavia for the journey to Australia. Hann's family, through William Hann's donation of £1000, had been very generous to the construction of St James Church of England some few years before Bishop Stanton had arrived at Townsville.  She subsequently found employment as a governess on Fanning Downs [[Station (Australian agriculture)|Station]].

Records show that she married poet and horseman [[Breaker Morant]] (Harry Morant aka Edwin Murrant) on 13 March 1884 in [[Charters Towers]]; the union lasted only a short time and Dwyer reputedly threw Morant out because he failed to pay for the wedding and stole some livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maloney |first1=Shane |title=Daisy Bates &amp; Harry ‘Breaker’ Morant |journal=The Monthly |date=June 2007 |url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2007/june/1290560118/shane-maloney/daisy-bates-harry-breaker-morant |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, they were never divorced. Morant biographer Nick Bleszynski suggests that Dwyer played a more important role in Morant's life than has been previously thought, and that it was she who convinced him to change his name from Edwin Murrant to Harry Harbord Morant.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

After parting ways with Morant, Dwyer moved to [[New South Wales]]. She said that she became engaged to Philip Gipps but he died before they could marry, though no records support this.  She then met John (Jack) Bates—like Morant, a bushman and [[Drover (Australian)|drover]]—and they married on 17 February 1885.  Their only child, Arnold Hamilton Bates, was born in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], New South Wales on 26 August 1886. The marriage was not a happy one, probably because Jack's work kept him away from home for long periods.

She also found time to marry Baglehole, her emigration voyage shipmate,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} in 1885 at St Stephen's Anglican Church, Newtown, Sydney. Although he is shown as being a seaman, he was the son of a wealthy London family and had become a ship's officer after completing an apprenticeship and this might have been an attraction for Daisy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The polygamous nature of these marriages was kept secret during Bates's lifetime.

In February 1894, Bates returned to England, leaving Arnold in a Catholic boarding school and telling Jack that she would only return when he had a home established for her. She arrived in England penniless, but eventually found a job working for journalist and social campaigner [[W.T Stead|WT Stead]]. Despite her skeptical views she worked as an assistant editor on the psychic quarterly ''Borderlands'', and enjoyed an active intellectual life among London's well-connected and bohemian literary and political milieu. However, after she left Stead's employment in 1896, it is unclear how she supported herself until 1899, when she embarked for Western Australia after Jack wrote to say that he was looking for a property there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reece |first1=Bob |title='You would have loved her for her lore': the letters of Daisy Bates |journal=Australian Aboriginal Studies |date=22 March 2007 |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27You+would+have+loved+her+for+her+lore%27%3A+the+letters+of+Daisy+Bates.-a0169134504 |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement with Australian Aboriginal people==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Bates's involvement with the Aboriginal Australians was not as a missionary, doctor or teacher. The [[foreword]] of her book written by [[Alan Moorehead]] said, " As far as I can make out she never tried to teach the Australians Aborigines anything or convert them to any faith. She preferred them to stay as they were and live out the last of their days in peace." Alan Moorehead also said, "She was not an anthropologist but she knew them better than anyone else who ever lived; and she made them interesting not only to herself but to us as well."

At about 1899 a letter was published in ''[[The Times]]'' about the cruelty of West Australian settlers to [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. As Bates was preparing to return to Australia, she wrote to ''The Times'' offering to make full investigations and report the results to them. Her offer was accepted and she sailed back to Australia in August 1899. In all, Bates devoted 40 years of her life to studying Aboriginal life, history, culture, rites, beliefs and customs. She researched and wrote on the subject while living in a tent in small settlements from Western Australia to the edges of the [[Nullarbor Plain]], including at [[Ooldea, South Australia|Ooldea]] in South Australia. She was also famed for her strict lifelong adherence to [[Edwardian]] fashion, including boots, gloves and a veil.

Bates set up camps to feed, clothe and nurse the transient population, drawing on her own income to meet the needs of the aged. She was said to have worn [[pistols]] even in her old age and to have been quite prepared to use them to threaten police when she caught them mistreating "her" Aborigines.

Bates was convinced that the Australian Aborigines were a dying race and that her mission was to record as much as she could about them before they disappeared.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In a 1921 article in the Perth ''Sunday Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bates |first=Daisy |title=New Aboriginal Reserve |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57973115 |work=Sunday Times |publisher=via National Library of Australia |date=12 June 1921 |location=(Perth, WA : 1902 - 1954) |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates advocated a "woman patrol" to prevent the movement of Aborigines from the [[Central Australian Reserve]] into settled areas, and later responded to criticism by the Aboriginal civil-rights leader [[William Harris (Australian)|William Harris]], who maintained that part-Aboriginal people could be of value to Australian society, by writing that "As to the half-castes, however early they may be taken and trained, with very few exceptions, the only good half-caste is a dead one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reece |first=Bob |title=Daisy Bates: Grand Dame of the Desert |date=2007 |publisher=National Library of Australia |location=Canberra |isbn=978-0-64-227654-4 |pages=89–90 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Daisy_Bates.html?id=P_8KgFI92e4C&amp;q=%22as+to+the+half+castes%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Australia===
On her return voyage she met Father Dean Martelli, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest who had worked with Aborigines and who gave her an insight into the conditions they faced. She found a school and home for her son in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], invested some of her money in property as a security for her old age, bought note books and supplies and left for the state's remote north-west to gather information on Aborigines and the effects of white settlement.

She wrote articles about conditions around [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] and other areas for geographical society journals, local newspapers and ''The Times''. This experience kindled her lifelong interest in the lives and welfare of Aboriginal people in Western and South Australia.

Based at the [[Beagle Bay Mission]] near [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], Bates, now thirty-six, began her life's work. Her accounts, among the first attempts at a serious study of Aboriginal culture, were published in the Journal of Agriculture and later by [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[geography|geographical]] societies in Australia and overseas.

While at the mission she also compiled a local dictionary of several [[dialects]], comprising some two thousand words and sentences, as well as notes on legends and myths. In April 1902 Bates, accompanied by her son and her husband, set out on a droving trip from Broome to Perth. It provided good material for her articles but after spending six months in the saddle and travelling four thousand kilometres, Bates knew that her marriage was over.

Following her final separation from Bates in 1902, she spent most of the rest of her life in outback Western and South Australia, studying and working for the remote Aboriginal tribes, who were being decimated by the incursions of European settlement and the introduction of modern technology, western culture and exotic diseases.

In 1904, the Registrar General of Western Australia, Malcolm Fraser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lomas|first1=Brian D.|title=Queen of Deception|date=2015|publisher=Amazon|isbn=978-0-646-94238-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 30, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; appointed her to research Aboriginal customs, languages and dialects, a task which took nearly seven years to compile and arrange the data. Many of her papers were read at Geographical and [[Royal Society]] meetings.

[[Image:Daisy may bates.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bates and a group of Aboriginal women, circa 1911]]
In 1910–11 she accompanied anthropologist A. R. Brown (later Professor [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]]) and writer and biologist [[E. L. Grant Watson]] on a [[Cambridge]] ethnological expedition to inquire into Western Australian marriage customs. She was appointed a "[[Protector of Aborigines|Travelling Protector]]" with a special commission to conduct inquiries into all native conditions and problems, such as employment on stations, guardianship and the morality of native and half-caste women in towns and mining camps.

Legend has it that Bates later came into conflict with Radcliffe-Brown because she sent him her manuscript report of the expedition. Much to Bates's chagrin, it was not returned for many years and when it came back it was heavily annotated with Radcliffe-Brown's critical remarks. The conflict culminated in a famous incident at a symposium, where Bates accused Radcliffe-Brown of plagiarism—Bates was scheduled to speak after Radcliffe-Brown had presented his paper, but when she rose it was only to compliment him sarcastically on his presentation of her work, after which she resumed her seat.

===A "Protector of Aborigines"===
After 1912, despite having earlier been appointed as Travelling Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia, her application to become the Northern Territory's Protector of Aborigines was rejected on basis of her [[gender]], Bates continued her work on her own, financing it by selling her cattle station.

The same year she became the first woman ever to be appointed Honorary Protector of Aborigines at [[Eucla, Western Australia|Eucla]]. During the sixteen months she spent there, Bates changed from a semi-professional scientist and ethnologist to a staunch friend and protector of the Aborigines, deciding to live among them and look after them, and to observe and record their lives and lifestyle.

Bates stayed at Eucla until 1914, when she travelled to [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]] and Sydney to attend the Science Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Science. Before returning to the desert, she gave lectures in Adelaide which aroused the interests of several women's organisations.

During her years at Ooldea she financed the supplies she bought for the Aborigines from the sale of her property. To maintain her income she wrote numerous articles and papers for newspapers, magazines and learned societies. Through journalist and author [[Ernestine Hill]], Bates's work was introduced to the general public, although much of the publicity tended to focus on her sensational stories of cannibalism.

In August 1933 the Commonwealth Government invited Bates to [[Canberra]] to advise on Aboriginal affairs. The next year she was created a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. More important to Bates was the opportunity to put her work in print.

===South Australia===
She left Ooldea and went to [[Adelaide]] where, with the help of [[Ernestine Hill]], she produced a series of articles for leading Australian newspapers, titled ''[[My Natives and I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article213918855 |title=MY NATIVES AND I. |newspaper=[[The Nowra Leader]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 August 1937 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged seventy-one, she still walked every day to her office at ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'' building. Later the Commonwealth Government paid her a stipend of $4 a week to assist her in putting all her papers and notes in order and prepare her manuscript. But with no other income it was impossible for her to remain in Adelaide so she moved to the village settlement of [[Pyap]] on the [[Murray River]] where she pitched her tent and set up her typewriter.

In 1938, she published ''[[The Passing of the Aborigines]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bates, Daisy | title=The passing of the Aborigines : a lifetime spent among the natives of Australia | publication-date=1938 | publisher=Murray | edition= 1st | isbn=978-0-7195-0071-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserted practices of [[cannibalism]] and [[infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article225571211 |title=LATEST in the BOOK SHOPS |newspaper=[[Weekly Times]] |issue=3720 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=14 January 1939 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |page=34 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--   amongst clans such as the [[Nyool-Nyool]], [[Bibbulmun]], [[Baduwonga]], [[Kaalurwonga]] and [[Baadu]]  -- citing who? --&gt;

==Final years==
In 1941 she went back to her tent life at Wynbring Siding, east of Ooldea, and she remained there on and off until her health forced her back to Adelaide in 1945.

In 1948 she tried, through the [[Australian Army]], to contact her son Arnold, who by then was serving in France. Later, in 1949, she contacted the Army again, through the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]], in an effort to communicate with him. Arnold was living in [[New Zealand]] but refused to have anything to do with his mother.

Daisy Bates died on 18 April 1951, aged 91. She is buried at Adelaide's [[North Road Cemetery]].

'''Dmytro Bulatov''' ({{lang-uk|Дмитро Сергійович Булатов}}; August 13, 1978 in Kiev) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] civic activist who was [[Ministry of Youth and Sports (Ukraine)|Minister of Youth and Sports]] in the 2014 [[Second Yatsenyuk Government|Yatsenyuk Government]].

Bulatov was an activist and leader of the [[AutoMaidan]], which was the mobile car-based arm of the anti-government [[Euromaidan]] movement. He is also in charge of the "Socially responsible society" [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]. Due to his activism, he was kidnapped and tortured outside the villas of Ukrainian government and business figures.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/dmytro-bulatov-believes-pro-russia-group-behind-kidnapping-article-1.1615982|title=Dmytro Bulatov believes pro-Russia group was behind kidnapping and torture - NY Daily News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Dmytro Bulatov is a graduate of the [[Kyiv Polytechnic Institute|National Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Polytechnic Institute"]]. In 2001, he graduated from the Electronics Department with a degree in Engineering of Microelectronics and Semiconductor Devices.

Between 1998 and 2014, Dmytro Bulatov had his own business and held key positions in state and private companies. He worked as the Director of the Tsentr-K Private Enterprise (1998-2003, hotel industry), as the Chief of Q-Service Group of Companies (2003-2007, marketing, advertisement and design), as the Deputy Director of ITERA Group of Companies (2007-2008, building activity), the Director of “Promlohistyka” LLC (2008-2009, metallurgy), and as the Director of “Torhovo-Promyslovyi Holding” LLC (2009-2010, oil and gas trade). In conjunction with this, he held consulting activities in the areas of marketing, advertisement and sales. Between 2010 and 2013, he was the owner of Stolnik Autocenter, but after certain events, the business vector was changed and Bulatov began to work mainly in consulting.

Between May and October 2010, he worked as the Director of the “Ukrrybproekt” Designing Institute for Fisheries and Fishery Industry and in the State Committee of Fishing of Ukraine under the Ministry of Agrarian Policy of Ukraine. During this half of the year, he turned the institute from a losing organisation to a profitable one.

Dmytro Bulatov was also active in [[wakeboarding]] and took part in All-Ukrainian competitions.

At the beginning of 2013, he created the “Socially Responsible Society” NGO. Together with the Ukrainian Philanthropists Forum, this organisation began the National Philanthropists Top List. In April 2013, Bulatov was one of the action organizers of alcohol sales point dismantling in Druzhby Narodiv Park in Kyiv. In September 2013, he agitated for the prohibition of alcohol festivals held at playgrounds.

After Dmytro Bulatov’s son of 12 years old had gotten stuck in an open drain at the crossing of Zdolbunovska Street and Hryhorenka Street (Kyiv, Pozniaky Microdistrict) while riding a bicycle and had told about it to his father, Dmytro Bulatov, together with other activists, also came to grips with the problem of open drain covers. In autumn 2013, his organisation, at its own expense, covered dangerous open drain covers with grates and fibreglass lids that were made by Bulatov and his automobile repair shop. Such fibreglass lids were cheaper and could not be sent for scrap. Dmytro Bulatov continually appeared before mass media with an appeal to fix such lids.

Dmytro Bulatov is married and has three children.

===AutoMaidan===

On November 30, 2014, Dmytro Bulatov found out about the forceful dispersal of Euromaidan and, together with his friend Oleksii Hrytsenko, decided to organise a car run across Kyiv in order to involve people in the protest. On the first day, about 300 drivers partook in the action. On the morning of December 1, Bulatov gathered with other participants (most notably Vasyl Futin, Tetiana Chornovol, Andrii Dzidzia, Volodymyr Kadura, and others) to delegate responsibility. This was the beginning of AutoMaidan.

Bulatov was the organizer and took part in most of AutoMaidan’s actions, particularly in a drive to Mezhyhiria, in visits to other high-ranking person and troop leader of “Berkut”, and also in blocking of “Berkut” in Sviatoshynskyi District, Kyiv.

===Kidnapping===
On January 22, 2014, during Eurorevolution in Ukraine, the activists of&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; [[AutoMaidan]] announced that Bulatov went missing. The last time Bulatov got in touch was the evening of January 22. On January 23, at approximate four o'clock in the morning, “Berkut” arrested a minimum of 15 activists of AutoMaidan who patrolled Hospital No. 17 in Kyiv and piled up nine cars.
AutoMaidan announced a reward of ten thousand US dollars for information to help find Dmytro Bulatov and save his life. Subsequently, this amount was increased up to twenty-five thousand US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ua/video/video-novini/za-dostovirni-vidomosti-pro-dmitra-bulatova-obicyayut-25-tisyach-dolariv.html?type=2|title=Дружина Булатова заявила про зникнення чоловіка / ТСН, 27 січня 2014|language=uk|publisher=|access-date=2014-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128225732/http://tsn.ua/video/video-novini/za-dostovirni-vidomosti-pro-dmitra-bulatova-obicyayut-25-tisyach-dolariv.html?type=2|archive-date=2014-01-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, Bulatov got in touch with friends and claimed he had been kidnapped, and terribly tortured by captors who spoke with Russian accents. After these terrible tortures, he was brought outside the city and thrown out of a car.

Bulatov managed to get to the Village of Vyshenky, [[Boryspil Raion|Boryspil district]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvi.ua/new/2014/01/30/bulatov_rozpoviv_scho_yoho_rozpynaly_a_takozh_vidrizaly_vukho Булатов розповів, що його розпинали і відрізали вухо{{ref-uk}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203185537/http://tvi.ua/new/2014/01/30/bulatov_rozpoviv_scho_yoho_rozpynaly_a_takozh_vidrizaly_vukho |date=February 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and asked for help. The same day, Bulatov was admitted to the Boris Clinic, where he received first medical care.
According to Petro Poroshenko, Dmytro Bulatov, Oleksandr Danyliuk, and Oleksii Hrytsenko (participant of AutoMaidan) were entered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine into the foreign travel ban list. This list was observed by the frontier guards. On February 2, Shevchenko District Court in the City of Kyiv rejected to uphold a motion of investigation to arrest Dmytro Bulatov. That same day, Bulatov went to Lithuania to be treated there in transit through Riga.

On 6 February 2014, while undergoing treatment in [[Lithuania]], Bulatov stated at a [[press conference]] in [[Vilnius]]  that he was tortured to admit that his organisation was funded and aided by Americans and the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, especially, and that he was hired to organise the Automaidan and the riots against the [[current government]].&lt;ref name=kidnap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/189103.html|title=Bulatov says he was tortured to admit US involvement in riots in Ukraine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the press conference, Bulatov repeatedly stressed that he believed he was abducted by the [[Russian special forces]] and that the leader of [[Ukrainian Choice]], oligarch [[Viktor Medvedchuk]], might have been involved in his abduction. After one session of torture, "they made me say into a camera that I was a spy for the United States, that I was a spy for the CIA, that Americans were giving me money, that Automaidan was funded by Americans, and that I was specifically hired to organize the Automaidan and the riots against the current government." Bulatov also said: "After this torture, I said to the camera everything they asked me to say, and they recorded it all on video. I said that the U.S. ambassador gave me $50,000, which I used to buy gasoline for the Automaidan, to repair cars for the Automaidan activists, for whom I had bought several video cameras to film trips. That is, I lied only to get them to torture me less."&lt;ref name=kidnap/&gt;

The kidnapping of Bulatov was widely condemned, including by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton.[[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], [[Catherine Ashton]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26009866 |title=BBC News - Beaten protest leader Dmytro Bulatov leaves Ukraine |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-02 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh from medical care in [[Lithuania]], Bulatov went to Germany to visit his relatives. On 15 February 2014, he held a press conference at [[Checkpoint Charlie Museum]] in Berlin where he again accused Medvedchuk of his kidnapping, but said: “That’s only a suspicion.” He confirmed that he would re-join protests in Ukraine and would not seek [[Right of asylum|asylum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/bulatov-visits-berlin-vows-more-protest-in-ukraine/a-17435580|title=Bulatov visits Berlin, vows more protest in Ukraine - DW - 15.02.2014|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, Dmytro Bulatov returned to Ukraine.

Now, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine is carrying out an investigation into the kidnapping of Dmytro Bulatov.  Operational-Investigations Group is investigating five cases, including intimidation in relation to social and political activity.

===Politics===
On February 2014 Dmytro Bulatov was appointed [[Ministry of Youth and Sports (Ukraine)|Minister for Youth and Sports]] in the [[first Yatsenyuk Government]].&lt;ref name=IU26214GNU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/193035.html|title=Maidan nominates Yatseniuk for prime minister|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/193222.html|title=Ukrainian parliament endorses new cabinet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began reforms in the areas of sports and physical culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5659">[[Image:Domingo Cullen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Domingo Cullen, as depicted by J. Zorrila de San Martín]]'''Domingo Cullen''' (1791 – 21 June 1839) was the governor of [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]] during 1838.

Cullen was born in [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]], but moved to Argentina in the 1820s after establishing commercial activities (linked with fluvial trade) in the area. He met Santa Fe's ''[[caudillo]]'' [[Estanislao López]] when serving as a deputy of the Cabildo of [[Montevideo]]. After being involved in activism related to the independence of [[Uruguay]] and the resistance against [[Brazil]] (see [[Cisplatine War]]), he returned to Santa Fe, settled in a [[ranch]], and married Joaquina Rodríguez del Fresno, the young widow of Pedro Aldao and sister-in-law of López. In 1828 he became a counselor of López, and his Minister of Government in 1833.

At the time of López's death on 15 June 1838, Cullen was in [[Buenos Aires]] as representative of Santa Fe, trying to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing [[French blockade of Buenos Aires|French blockade of the port]] (caused by a law of 1821 that obligated resident foreign citizens of the province of Buenos Aires to serve in [[conscription]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cema.edu.ar/ceieg/arg-rree/4/4-015.htm Historia General de las Relaciones Exteriores de la República Argentina]. Cap. 20: Los bloqueos francés y anglofrancés.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cullen argued that the blockade was the result of a provincial law and therefore the other provinces were not bound to help Buenos Aires. [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], the powerful governor of Buenos Aires, contended that this violated the [[Federal Pact]].

When Cullen returned to Santa Fe, he became governor, but his election was not acknowledged by Rosas and by [[Pascual Echagüe]], governor of the neighbouring [[Entre Ríos Province]]. Without López's support, he faced opposition from his personal enemies in the province and from those loyals to Rosas. In the end, all provinces including Santa Fe ended up supporting Buenos Aires against the French, and Cullen was forced to resign and go to [[exile]].

Accused of conspiring with the Unitarians (enemies of Rosas) and the French, he sought asylum in [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]], but he was betrayed by his host and delivered to Rosas's men, to be tried in Buenos Aires. However, right after crossing the [[Arroyo del Medio]] and entering the territory of Buenos Aires Province, his captors announced they had orders to kill him. Cullen was assisted by a priest in [[San Nicolás de los Arroyos]] and wrote a letter to his wife; he was then killed by a firing squad, on 21 June 1839. He was buried in the spot.

In 1840 the army of General [[Juan Lavalle]] passed by the place on its way to Santa Fe, and Cullen's body was exhumed at the request of Pedro Rodríguez del Fresno, an officer of Lavalle's and Cullen's brother-in-law. He was taken to the Convent of Saint Dominic in Santa Fe, where they remain today, next to the bodies of his son Patricio and several other important leaders.

==Descent==
Cullen's family was of [[Irish people|Irish]] origin, descended from Thomas Cullen Maher, who emigrated from [[Kilkenny]] to the [[Canary Islands]] in 1793. Domingo Cullen (full name: Domingo Alejandro Lorenzo Cullen y Ferraz), born in [[Tenerife]], was Cullen Maher's third grandson, the son of Guillermo Felipe Cullen and Ángela Isidra Ferraz de la Guardia.

Cullen emigrated to the [[Río de la Plata]] region, first settling in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], in 1811, and moving then to Santa Fe in 1823. This Argentine branch of the family has given Santa Fe many influential characters in the field of politics.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishgenealogy.com.ar/genealogia/C/Cullen/domingo.htm Domingo Cullen] at IrishGenealogy.com.ar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cullen had seven children. [[José María Cullen]], his firstborn, and [[Patricio Cullen]], his second son, both served as governors of Santa Fe ([[Tomás Cullen]], his last son, was also ad interim governor). His third child, Joaquina, was the wife of [[Nicasio Oroño]], governor and political chief of [[Rosario]], and the fourth, Josefa, was married to Juan María Gutiérrez Granados, member of the Constitutional Assembly that crafted the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]].

'''Ebenezer Crafts''' (1740 – 1810) was one of the founders of [[Craftsbury, Vermont]], and [[Leicester Academy]].
[[File:Craftsbury Public Library 02.jpg|thumb|''Mrs. Ebenezer Crafts (1741-1812) and her daughters Matilda (1771-1848) and Augusta (1772-1861)'', 1781, by Winthrop Chandler]]
Crafts was born in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]], and studied theology, graduating from Yale College in 1759.&lt;ref name=Crafts&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA132&amp;id=M3XCFlk3sVMC The History of the Crafts Family] by William Francis Crafts, on [[google books]]&lt;/ref&gt; He married Mehitable Chandler, sister of the painter [[Winthrop Chandler]], on 9 December 1762.  Mehitable was from the town next to Pomfret, [[Woodstock, Connecticut]], where the couple settled in 1768.&lt;ref name=Crafts/&gt;  Crafts later purchased a farm in the neighboring town of [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]], where he built the large ''Publick House'' in the center of the village. The couple kept a tavern there for many years and they acquired a large estate.&lt;ref name=Crafts/&gt; After the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]], he raised a company of cavalry in the adjoining towns of Sturbridge, Charlton, Dudley, and Oxford, and was commissioned its captain. He was ordered to join the army with it at Cambridge, and remained in the service until the [[evacuation of Boston]] by the British troops, when he returned to Sturbridge.&lt;ref name=Crafts/&gt; In 1785 a regiment of cavalry was ordered to be raised in [[Worcester County, Massachusetts]]. Of this regiment he was commissioned its first colonel, an office which he held until his resignation in 1791.&lt;ref name=Crafts/&gt; During the outbreak known as "[[Shays' Rebellion]]," in western Massachusetts, he rendered prompt and efficient service in its suppression, under Gen. [[Benjamin Lincoln]], in the winter of 1786-1787.&lt;ref name=Crafts/&gt;

Col. Crafts conceived the idea of founding an academy in Sturbridge, but the opportunity to secure the mansion of Aaron Lopez, in the neighboring town of [[Leicester, Massachusetts]], induced him to modify his plans. The mansion was a very suitable building, and the estate was purchased at auction for £515. A large oil portrait of Col. Crafts hangs upon the walls of [[Leicester Academy]].&lt;ref name=Crafts/&gt; He was aided largely in this enterprise by Col. Jacob Davis, and the first student on 17 June 1784 was his son [[Samuel C. Crafts]].&lt;ref name=Crafts/&gt;

Falling on hard times, in 1788 Crafts was forced to move and settled in 1791 in a town near [[Cabot, Vermont]]. It was later named after him. Crafts lived the rest of his life in [[Craftsbury, Vermont]],  He died and was buried there in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81761523 Ebenezer Crafts] at Find a Grave&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15856">'''Education for librarianship''' in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] generally consists of a [[master's degree]] program in [[library science]]. In [[Germany]], the first step for an academic librarian is a [[Ph.D.]] in a subject field, followed by additional training in librarianship. There are also [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[Associate degree|associate]], and certificate programs in library science, which provide formal training of paraprofessional library workers, [[library technician]]s, and clerks—as well as preparation for [[Graduate school|graduate study]] in library science.

==Historical development==
Until the 19th century, the librarian in charge of an academic collection was normally a scholar, often a university professor with a special interest in the library.  There were no training programs, and the new librarian was expected to follow the practices of other similar libraries. (Popular libraries in the modern sense had not yet developed.) In the 19th century, although some librarians followed this older pattern, others prepared as apprentices under the direction of established librarians.

==Library school==
A library school is an institution of [[Higher education|higher learning]] specializing in the professional training of [[librarian]]s. The first library school in the United States was established by [[Melvil Dewey]] (the originator of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey decimal system]]) in 1887 at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Carl Milton. 1961.

Many others were founded during [[World War II]]. The [[University of Chicago Graduate Library School]] became the first library school to confer a master's degree in [[library science]], which is now the standard professional degree, and later became the first to give a doctoral degree in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74029187|title=Libraries and librarianship : sixty years of challenge and change, 1945-2005|last=Sylvan)|first=Bobinski, George S. (George|date=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=|isbn=9780810858992|location=Lanham, Md.|pages=124|oclc=74029187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent American library schools are located at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Most library schools in North America offer graduate programs only. Accreditation of these programs is granted by the [[American Library Association]]. The bachelor's degree in Library Science (or Library Economy as it was called in early days) was, for the most part, phased out several decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;White, Carl Milton. 1976. A historical introduction to library education: problems and progress to 1951. Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Librarians in North America typically earn a master's degree, typically the Master of Library Science (MLS) or the [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (MLIS). This degree allows one to work as a practicing librarian in public libraries, academic libraries, school library media centers, and special libraries, while many individuals with the MLS credential work with major library vendors. The degree is also applicable to related sectors such as publishing.

Master of Library Science programs are typically structured to offer a combination of required and elective courses in [[library science]] and [[information science]]. The required courses focus on core library skills such as [[cataloging]], reference, [[collection development]] as well as related areas such as the philosophy underlying the profession, [[information technology]] and [[management]].  Elective courses may include [[information management]], [[children's literature]], [[genealogy]] and [[archives]] as well as specialized courses related to different types of libraries.

In recent decades, many schools offering librarianship education have changed their names to reflect the shift from print media to electronic media, and to information contained outside of traditional libraries. Some call themselves schools of library and information science (abbreviated to "SLIS", hence the term "SLISters" for their students), while others [[List of Information Schools|may have dropped the word "library" altogether]]. This trend began as early as the 1960s with the recognition that information and access to it was shifting to electronic resources with the development of telecommunications and computer networks and away from the traditional definition of librarianship.  This shift led a number of library schools to change or broaden their mission to be more inclusive of information sciences across many disciplines including library sciences, archives, computer sciences and more, and led to the development by a number of schools of an ''iSchool'' organization, &lt;ref&gt;Olson, G., &amp; Grudin, J. (2009, March 1). The information school phenomenon. ''Interactions: New Visions of Human-Computer Interaction'', 15-19.&lt;/ref&gt; to advance the field of information as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://ischools.org/|website=iSchools|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree programs==
The normal preparation for a faculty member in a department of library science (or other name) is a Ph.D. in [[Library science]] or [[Information science]]. In some fields of librarianship, a Ph.D. in another related subject, such as archival studies, is the equivalent, and some faculty have doctorates in various subject fields, as well as an MLS (or similar) degree.

===United States and Canada===
In the United States and Canada, a professional librarian normally has a one or two-year [[master's degree]] in [[library and information science]], [[library science]] or [[information science]] with abbreviations such as MLS, MSLS, MIS, MS-LIS, MISt, MI, MLIS, or MILS. Many professional librarians have degrees obtained from programs [[accredited by the American Library Association]] (ALA) and can have specializations within fields such as [[archive]]s, [[records management]], [[information architecture]], information policy, knowledge management, public librarianship, medical librarianship, law librarianship, special librarianship, academic librarianship, or school (K-12) librarianship. School librarians often are required to have a [[teaching credential]] and school librarian license in addition to a library science degree. Master's degree programs for school library media specialist initial preparation are also accredited by the [[National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education]] (NCATE), which ALA recognizes. Many, if not most, academic librarians also have a second, subject-based master's degree.

The early history of education for librarians in the U.S. has been explored by Churchwell.&lt;ref&gt;Churchwell, Charles D. 1975. ''The shaping of American library education''. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of Chicago studies in library science assessed the state of education for librarians in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Berelson, Bernard. 1949. Education for librarianship; papers presented at the Library Conference, University of Chicago, August 16–21, 1948. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pivotal role of the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral degree]] at the [[University of Chicago Graduate Library School]] from 1921-1951 has been analyzed by John Richardson in his study, ''The Spirit of Inquiry''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, John V. 1982. ''The spirit of inquiry: the Graduate Library School at Chicago, 1921-51.'' Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Many faculty members at the [[University of Chicago, Graduate Library School]] (1928-1979) were at the forefront of the field's development in the twentieth century: [[Lester Asheim]], [[Lee Pierce Butler]], [[Leon Carnovsky]], [[Herman H. Fussler]], [[Frances E. Henne]], [[Carleton B. Joeckel]], [[Jesse Shera]], [[Peggy Sullivan]], [[Douglas Waples]], [[Louis Round Wilson]], Howard Winger, and Robert Wadsworth. ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'' was first published by the Graduate Library School in 1931.

At the turn of the millennium (1999–2000), problems related to the graduate education of professional librarians pervaded professional and academic discourse.  These were initially identified by the Council of the American Library Association as the growing elimination of the word "library" from the names of schools, the seeming lack of attention to core competencies (cataloguing was often mentioned), and the national shortage of professionals to work with particular groups (specifically young people in public libraries and disadvantaged populations), and in particular environments (such as schools). The [http://www.ala.org/ala/educationcareers/education/1stcongressonpro/1stcongresssteeringcommittees.cfm Final Report of the Steering Committee on the Congress for Professional Education] provides an analysis of these issues. The Coalition on Reinventing Information Science, Technology, and Literary Education supported by the Kellogg Foundation provided additional analysis of future educational needs and direction.&lt;ref&gt;Drabenstott, K. M., et al., The Kellogg CRISTAL-ED Project: creating a model program to support libraries in the digital age {Coalition on Reinventing Information Science, Technology, and Literary Education}. In: ''Advances in librarianship'', v20. Academic Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Bernie Sloan compiled an extensive 2004 bibliography on changes in LIS education.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Bernie. 2004. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070221200900/http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~b-sloan/edbib.html Changes in LIS Education.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguished service to education for librarianship in the U.S. and Canada is recognized by the annual [[Beta Phi Mu Award]] sponsored by the International Honorary Society, [[Beta Phi Mu]].&lt;ref&gt;George S. Bobinski (2007) ''Libraries and Librarianship: Sixty Years of Chaallenge and Change, 1945-2005'', pp. 129-146.  Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt; The first award was made in 1954 to [[Rudolph Hjalmar Gjelsness]] Dean of the University of Michigan's Library Science Department from 1940 to 1964.

The primary association for faculty teaching in library and information science programs is the [[Association for Library and Information Science Education]].

In [[academic regalia in the United States]], the color for library science is [[lemon (color)|lemon]].

===Europe===
In the UK, a librarian can have a three- or four-year [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Library and information science|library and information studies]] or [[information science]]; separate [[master's degree]]s in librarianship, archive management, and records management are also available. In the [[United Kingdom]], these degrees are accredited by the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] and the [http://www.archives.org.uk/ Society of Archivists].

In [[Germany]], the first step for an academic librarian is a [[Ph.D.]] in a subject field, followed by additional training in librarianship.

In [[Denmark]] the first step to become a librarian is a 3-year long [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Library and Information Science]] (B.Sc.) at [[The Royal School of Library and Information Science]]. The students then have the choice between taking a half-year-long education for [[librarianship]] called Librarian D.B or take a 2-year [[master's degree]] called [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (M.L.I.Sc.). All the already mentioned courses takes place in [[Danish language|Danish]] but The Royal School of Library and Information Science also offers an English-speaking 2-year master's degree called [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (M.L.I.Sc.). Students who complete the bachelor's degree, the librarianship or one of the master's degrees offered get work as librarians, information employees or organization staff. The students can also obtain a [[Ph.D.]] in Library and Information Science at The Royal School of Library and Information Science (first awarded at The Royal School of Library and Information Science in 2004). The students can also obtain a [[doctorate]] in Library and Information Science at The Royal School of Library and Information Science (first awarded at The Royal School of Library and Information Science in 2006).

===Philippines===
In 1914, the [[University of the Philippines]] offered the first courses in Library education in the country. The University would later establish the first separate library school in the country in 1961; the [[UP School of Library and Information Studies|Institute of Library Science]], a former department of the now defunct College of Liberal Arts. Librarians usually have a four-year [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Library and information science|library and information studies]], or a [[master's degree]] in LIS or one with a concentration in Library Science. It is also not uncommon for librarians to possess a degree in Education, with a specialization or major in Library Science. With passage of the Republic Act No. 6966 (Repealed in 2003 with the passing of R.A. 9246 or "The Philippine Librarianship Act of 2003") in 1990, graduates of library and information science are required to take the licensure examinations for librarians in order to practice librarianship in the Philippines or countries which have reciprocity as regards the practice of the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/ra_no9246.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415074535/http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/ra_no9246.htm |date=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, [[Victoria University of Wellington]] is the only university providing postgraduate education in librarianship.  Qualifications include Master of Information Studies (course based) and Master of Arts (thesis based) as well as postgraduate diploma and certificate in librarianship.  [[Open Polytechnic]] provides undergraduate librarianship education.

'''Fransaskois''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃.sas.kwa|pron}}) are [[francophone]]s or [[French Canadians]] living in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie]] province of [[Saskatchewan]]. The term '''Franco-Saskatchewanian''' may also be used on occasion, although in practice it is rare due to its length and unwieldiness.

==Population==
French speakers represent about six per cent of the population of Saskatchewan, and like the province itself natural increase and net emigration nearly balance one another out. Fransaskois and Fransaskoises are chiefly found in large cities such as [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatoon]], [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] and [[Moose Jaw]]. However, they form a plurality or majority in small towns like [[Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan|Gravelbourg]], [[Albertville, Saskatchewan|Albertville]], [[Duck Lake, Saskatchewan|Duck Lake]], [[Ponteix, Saskatchewan|Ponteix]], [[Zenon Park, Saskatchewan|Zenon Park]] and [[Bellegarde, Saskatchewan|Bellegarde]].

As with other French Canadian minority groups in Canada outside of Quebec, not all Fransaskois are French speakers; due to the pressures toward [[Language shift|assimilation]] that the community faces as a small minority group in a predominantly English-speaking province, a considerable number of people who are ethnically [[French people|French]] (Fransaskois) are in fact bilingual, primarily or exclusively [[English language|anglophone]].

==History==
In 1752 Louis de La Corne was appointed commandant ''poste de l’Ouest''.&lt;ref name=DCB&gt;{{cite DCB |first=C. J. |last=Russ |title=La Corne, Louis de, Chevalier de La Corne |volume=3 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/la_corne_louis_de_3E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He embarked on an expedition along the northern coast of Lake Superior, through Fort Paskoya (Le Pas, Manitoba) and into what is today the province of Saskatchewan establishing Fort Saint-Louis, or what became known as Fort-à-la-Corne, near the forks of the Saskatchewan River.&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; It is there that the first attempts at wheat cultivation in the west took place.&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; La Corne left in order to return to New France; the lands he left behind were the furthest western laying lands in the French Empire.

French ''[[coureurs de bois]]'' utilized the territory for over a century in their pursuit of furs to trade with the Hudson's Bay Company and the North-West Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lapointe |first1=Richard |first2=Lucille |last2=Tessier |translator-first=Lucille |translator-last=Tessier |title=The Francophones of Saskatchewan: A History |location=Regina |publisher=Campion College, University of Regina |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-9692-6582-5 |p=3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These French fur traders often had local First Nations women as their companions.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=3}}  While the majority of these couples were not formally married, the offspring that they produced often carried the French names of their fathers. Names like Dumont, Cardinal, Breland and Vandal are often associated with the French Métis.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=3}}  After the union of the two trading companies in 1821,{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=3}} the French Métis settled along the Red River in Manitoba where they lived peacefully until Rupert’s Land, which had been property of the Hudson’s Bay Company, was sold to the Dominion of Canada in 1870.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=3}} Events moved quickly as Canada hastily attempted to transfer power to their new western lands. After 1870 many Métis left the Red River to seek out new territories where they might return to their former ways of life. The vast majority landed on the banks of the Saskatchewan River in the area of Batoche and Duck Lake{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=5}} where armed resistance led to the Métis defeat at the battle of Batoche in 1885 when Riel surrendered to General Middleton’s soldiers.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=5}}

However, in 1892, the [[Northwest Territories]] (which at the time covered the [[Canadian Prairies]] west of [[Southern Manitoba]]) abolished French as an official language. In 1984, its status as an official languages was restored in the Canadian territories, but not in the prairie provinces.

At the end of the nineteenth century the Roman Catholic Church aided the government in bringing new groups of immigrants to the prairies.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=76}} The resulting immigration saw many arrive from Quebec who began establishing towns, schools, churches and businesses. The Canadian government worked to encourage French immigrants from France and Belgium, achieving some success in 1912 and 1913 as some 3000 French arrived in Canada in those two years.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=72}} At the turn of the century the French-speaking settlers represented about 2.9% of the population.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=101}} Five years after the foundation of the province of Saskatchewan in 1905 the French-speaking population represented 5.2%.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=101}} The population grew from 2600 to 25000 in the first ten years of the twentieth century and they would double their population during next two decades.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=101}}

The French Canadians arriving in Saskatchewan were mostly farmers interested in developing the agricultural landscape of the province.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=127}} Others worked full-time to ensure the survival of the Catholic Church and the French language in the province. The first bishops of the west were French Canadians who believed that the survival of the Church was dependent on the survival of the mother tongue.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=190}} In February 1912, 450 members of the Francophone community of Saskatchewan met at Duck Lake to form a provincial organization called ''La Sociéte du Parler Français de la Saskatchewan''.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=190}} Invited delegates included Bishop Mathieu of Regina, Bishop Charlebois of Keewatin and the Attorney General Alphonse Turgeon.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986}} Later that year the society would go on to form the ''Association Franco-Canadienne de la Saskatchewan''.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=190}} It was renamed again in 1913, the name ''Association Catholique Franco-Canadienne'' (ACFC) was chosen to represent the cultural and religious interests the group represents. The name changed again in 1962 when the word Catholique was changed in favour of the word Culturelle. Finally in 1998 the name was changed to the Association Communautaire Fransaskois.&lt;ref&gt;http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/association_culturelle_franco-canadienne.html&lt;/ref&gt; The associations function is to unite Francophones of the province in order to promote their ideas and protecting their rights.  The success of the ACF can be attributed to many strong leaders such as Raymond Denis, Dr. Laurent Roy, Order of Canada recipient Irene Chabot, Roland Pinsonneault, Dumont Lepage and Albert Dube.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fransaskois.sk.ca/content/acf/gsDisplayGeneral/index/menu_id/1,&lt;/ref&gt; The ACF is still functioning today and celebrations for their one-hundredth anniversary are planned throughout 2012. 2012 has been proclaimed the Year of the Fransaskois Community in Saskatchewan by Minister Donna Harpauer in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the ACF.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fransaskois.sk.ca/content/acf/gsDisplayGeneral/index/menu_id/1&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to a French education was not easily won in Saskatchewan. In 1916 several provincial organizations like the [[Saskatchewan Grain Growers]], the Saskatchewan School Trustees’ Association, the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities resolved to forbid the use of foreign languages in Saskatchewan's schools.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=201}} Premier William Martin drafted an amendment to Section 177 of the School Act which limited French instruction to one hour a day.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986}} In response to the loss of the right to teach French in a public school in 1918 Franco-Catholic school trustees formed the ''Association des commissaries d’écoles franco-canadiens (ACEFC)''.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=200}} In Gravelbourg, Monsignor Mathieu O.M.I Regina opened the College Mathieu, a private institution offering a classical education opened its doors in 1918 {{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=254}} For over 75 years the College Mathieu was the only option for a French education in Saskatchewan. The school was renowned for their competitive sports teams and their dynamic arts programs.

Two French newspapers emerged in Saskatchewan, ''La Liberté'' and ''Le Patriote de l’Ouest'' and two radio stations CFRG in Gravelbourg and CFNS in Saskatoon each began in 1951 and 1952 respectively.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=280}} Today, the two papers have been combined into a single publication entitled ''L’Eau Vive''.{{sfnp|Lapointe|Tessier|1986|p=273}} Radio-Canada has taken a leading role in broadcasting French radio and television across the province; both mediums feature some provincially produced content.

In 1982, Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights guaranteed minority education rights.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cefsk.ca/EN/EN_History/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323221439/http://www.cefsk.ca/EN/EN_History/index.html |archivedate=23 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Supreme Court decision (Mahe decision) in 1990 recognized the Fransaskois’ right to control their children’s education.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt;  The province of Saskatchewan adopted bill 39 (Multicultural Act) in 1993, and the following year in the town of Gravelbourg, the first French council gained control of their school for the first time in nearly eighty years. The ‘Conseil scolaire fransaskois de la Vielle’ was the first of eight such school councils to gain such control in the province.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; The other communities were Prince Albert, the Battlefords, Vonda, Bellevue, Bellegarde, Regina and Saskatoon, while French schools also appeared in Moose Jaw, Ponteix and Zenon Park in the next two years.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; All the councils were consolidated into the Division scolaire fransaskois no. 310 in 1999 after an amendment to the Education Act of 1995.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; Today, the French-language school board is called the Conseil des écoles fransaskoises. Operated out of offices in Saskatoon, it consists of 13 schools with 1300 students as of September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;CEF Rapport Annuel 2010-2011, http://www.cefsk.ca/fichiers/documents/contenu/RA-2010-2011-web.pdf,pg.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights==
The courts recently recognized French-language educational rights straight through to the end of high school. Though there were few all-French schools in 1969, a number of schools were given permission to teach in French. In 1995, the legal battles ended with Saskatchewan's Francophones winning the right to manage their own schools. The Conseil des écoles fransaskoises operates 15 schools and offers full range of educational services in French. In 1918, in the southern Saskatchewan town of Gravelbourg, Monseigneur O. E. Mathieu founded a private-Catholic school named Collège Mathieu. Girls were admitted to the Collège in 1970. It remained in operation as Western Canada's only private French language high school until spring 2003. As a result of the declining population of students, the high school joined the Conseil des écoles fransaskoises and is now known as L'école Sécondaire Collège Mathieu. The original Collège Mathieu now offers technical training and postsecondary and adult education courses across the province.

==Culture==
Despite their numbers, Fransaskois celebrate their vibrant culture regularly. Folk arts, visual arts, fine arts and performance arts all feature prominently in their festivals.

The most famous Fransaskoise, [[Jeanne Sauvé]], born in [[Vonda, Saskatchewan|Vonda]], served as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Members of Parliament|MP]], [[Cabinet minister]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and ultimately [[Governor General of Canada]]. In the arts, notable Fransaskois include [[Folk music | trad and roots]] band La Raquette à Claquettes and children's entertainer [[Carmen Campagne]] (from the  town of [[Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan | Willow Bunch]]). New upcoming artists such as Alexis Normand, Véronique Poulin and Shawn Jobin are becoming{{when?|date=June 2018}} staples on the Fransaskois music scene, joining more established artists such as Annette Campagne, Chritianne Blondeau and Michel Lalonde.

A French-language professional theatre company, La Troupe du Jour, founded in 1987, operates from a base in  Saskatoon.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://latroupedujour.fransaskois.net |title=La Troupe du Jour |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 
|website=fransaskois.net |publisher= Le Portail fransaskois |access-date= 28 September 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sports, the most notable Fransaskois is [[Colorado Avalanche]] forward [[Blake Comeau]] of [[Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan |Meadow Lake]]. Comeau was a member of the [[2004 Memorial Cup]] champion [[Kelowna Rockets]] and of two gold-medal-winning World Junior Hockey championship teams.

==Media==
The Fransaskois community is served primarily by the radio and television services of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Radio-Canada]]. [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]]'s [[CBKFT-DT]] and [[Première Chaîne]]'s [[CBKF-FM]] are based in Regina and have rebroadcasters throughout the province, while Regina and Saskatoon receive [[Espace musique]] service from rebroadcasters of [[CKSB-FM]] in [[Winnipeg]].

Two [[community radio]] stations, [[CFNS (AM)|CFNS]] in Saskatoon and [[CFRG (AM)|CFRG]] in Gravelbourg, previously operated as locally-owned affiliates of Radio-Canada's radio network. Both were directly acquired by the network in 1973, becoming rebroadcasters of CBKF. In 2003, a new community station, [[CFRG-FM]], was launched in Gravelbourg by a new community group which has no ownership affiliation with the original CFRG.

'''Fritz Buntrock''' (8 March 1909 in [[Osnabrück]] – 24 January 1948 in [[Kraków]])  was a German [[War crime|war criminal]], member of ''[[SS-Unterscharfuehrer]]'' (the SS equivalent to a corporal) serving at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] during [[the Holocaust in occupied Poland]]. He was prosecuted at the first [[Auschwitz trial]].&lt;ref name =de.wikiref&gt;Miroslav Kárný: Das Theresienstädter Familienlager (Bllb) in Birkenau (September 1943–Juli 1944), in: Hefte von Auschwitz 20 (1997), S. 154.

'''Gerhardus Christian''' "'''Gerrie'''" '''Coetzee''' (born 8 April 1955) is a South African former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1974 to 1986, and in 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Dreyer2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreyer|first=Nadine|title=A century of Sundays: 100 years of breaking news in the Sunday times, 1906-2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rFGX4z8-S8C&amp;pg=PA314|accessdate=26 March 2012|year=2006|publisher=Zebra|isbn=9781770071063|pages=314–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first boxer from the African continent ever to fight for, and win, a world [[heavyweight]] championship, having held the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] title from 1983 to 1984. One of Coetzee's nicknames, "The Bionic Hand", came about because of persistent troubles with his right hand, which required the insertion of several corrective items during three surgeries. His [[Afrikaans]] nickname was "''Seer Handjies''", or "Little Sore Hands", named so by fellow South African boxing great [[Kallie Knoetze]]. Coetzee fought the likes of [[Iran Barkley]], [[Greg Page (boxer)|Greg Page]], [[Pinklon Thomas]], [[Frank Bruno]], [[Leon Spinks]], [[Mike Weaver (boxer)|Mike Weaver]], and [[Michael Dokes]].

==Professional career==
===Rise to championship contention===
Coetzee started boxing professionally on the night of 14 September 1974, when he beat 19 fight veteran and fellow South African [[Christian Roos]] by a decision in four. He followed that win with 21 consecutive wins to reach a record of 22-0 before fighting for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight title for the first time. Among those wins was one over Roos in a rematch, which Coetzee won by a [[knockout]] in three rounds; wins over former world title challengers [[Ron Stander]], [[Randy Stephens]] and [[Pierre Fourie]]; a South African Heavyweight championship victory against amateur rival [[Kallie Knoetze]] (unanimous decision in 10) as well as a first-round knockout of former world heavyweight champion [[Leon Spinks]]. With exception of the Spinks bout, held at [[Monte Carlo]], the rest of Coetzee's fights during his early run were held in his native South Africa.

Spinks attacked Coetzee and pressured him, throwing punches from many angles and trying to steam-roll the South African. Coetzee composed himself and a short right hand delivered to Spinks' temple knocked down the former world champion. Coetzee proceeded to drop Spinks two more times to record a [[technical knockout]]. The win enhanced Coetzee's reputation as a real title threat in the post-Ali landscape of the heavyweight division.

===First world title attempt===
Coetzee faced [[John Tate (boxer)|John Tate]] for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight title that had been left vacant by [[Muhammad Ali]]. Coetzee became the first African-born heavyweight ever to challenge for a world title. Coetzee fought a tentative bout and, after holding his own early, faded from the midpoint of the bout onward. Tate won a decision over 15 rounds. Coetzee would reveal later in his career that in his early fighting years, he struggled with self-confidence, particularly in measuring up to American fighters.

The first major boxing event in South Africa to change the face of sports in apartheid South Africa was the fight between Bob Foster and Pierre Fourie on 1 December 1973. This laid firm foundations for racially mixed boxing in front of racially mixed audiences.  Mixed bouts between South Africans were legalised in 1977, but the last vestiges of the colour bar disappeared only two years later when the system of white, black and supreme titles was abolished.

The first multiracial SA title fights were held at the Rand Stadium in Johannesburg on 27 November 1976 when Gerrie Coetzee and Elijah 'Tap Tap' Makhatini became undisputed champions.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Jackson - http://www.supersport.com/boxing/blogs/ron-jackson/The_origins_of_boxing_in_SA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second world title attempt===
Tate lasted only a short time as WBA world titlist, as he was KOd in spectacular last-second fashion by [[Mike Weaver (boxer)|Mike Weaver]] in his first title defense.  In the meantime, Coetzee had maintained his status as a highly rated contender with a win over [[Mike Koraniki]] in the first round to keep his title hopes alive. Weaver traveled to South Africa in 1980 to defend his title against Coetzee, fighting in front of a very large crowd. Coetzee dominated the early portions, and had Weaver hurt several times. In the 8th, Weaver was in trouble but Coetzee could not capitalize.

With the opportunity to finish Weaver gone, Coetzee seemed to wilt. Weaver was beginning to time Coetzee's punches for counters. By round 12 the fight was close to even, with the South African's lead having evaporated. Weaver had survived Coetzee's onslaught and the tide had turned. Coetzee's stamina failed him and he had begun to throw fewer punches after round 9. Coetzee was now leaning and mauling more and was getting hit more often coming in with his unprotected head held high. Weaver was accelerating and was getting the better of exchanges as the bout wore on.  Coetzee was knocked down for the first time in his career and out by a big counter punch in the 13th round.

===Road to a third title bout===
Less than 5 months after the loss against Weaver, Coetzee returned to the ring and beat fringe contender [[George Chaplin (boxer)|George Chaplin]] before facing [[Renaldo Snipes]]. Coetzee dropped Snipes early and seemed to dominate the action. However, the fight was scored by rounds and not on points, meaning a round won widely with knockdowns was no more valued than a round lost narrowly, and he lost a ten-round decision that was deemed one of the worst of the decade.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Coetzee had gone 5-1 in the 6 fights since the Weaver bout. Among the wins was one over former title challenger [[Scott Le Doux]] heading into a bout with the up-and-coming future WBC champion [[Pinklon Thomas]]. Again, Coetzee held the edge in the first half of the bout but Thomas rallied to hold Coetzee to a draw.  Following his loss to Snipes and draw with Thomas, Coetzee was not considered a strong title contender.

===WBA heavyweight champion===
{{Main article|Gerrie Coetzee vs. Michael Dokes}}
Coetzee received his third world title try against WBA champion [[Michael Dokes]]. By now known as someone who could not win "The Big One", Coetzee's predicted fate in this bout was to show-case the [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]]-promoted Dokes' abilities and status as a rising star.

The fight took place on 23 September 1983 at the Richfield Coliseum in [[Richfield, Ohio]].  Coetzee dominated Dokes after a few rounds of even fighting. The South African led with aggression but also used counter punching as well. Coetzee's poise was apparent, and he boxed more deftly than usual employing more left hooks while still eschewing much in the way of defense, sponging anything Dokes could land and scoring a knockdown.  Coetzee knocked out Dokes in the tenth round to become South Africa's first world Heavyweight title holder. He also became the first Caucasian world heavyweight champion in 23 years. The fight was KO Magazine's "Upset of The Year" for 1983.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

It turned out that the punch that knocked out Dokes hurt Coetzee even more: his right hand was broken and required surgery five days after the fight, in [[New York City]].

===Failed unification and defeat===
There was much talk about a unification bout with the recognized best fighter in the division and now International Boxing Federation Champion, Holmes, in 1984, and a contract for a lucrative bout was signed. Holmes possessed only one of the 3 title belts but was recognized by most as the real, bona fide, champion.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Financial problems arose when the backer of the bout, JPD Sports out of Dallas, Texas, could not raise the original purse necessary. Caesar's Palace spoke of saving the promotion, but it fell through. Don King's involvement as Coetzee's promoter, as well as Larry Holmes' split with King previously also contributed to the bout not being made. Holmes wanted to save the bout which would have earned both him and Coetzee a significant sum of money. Coetzee was personally willing and eager for the bout. He even indicated he was willing to go through with the bout though he would likely enter the ring without the WBA title. The WBA had stated that for the bout to take place with its blessing, it required Holmes to fight as a contender for Coetzee's belt. Or, the WBA would require Coetzee to drop his belt to qualify as a challenger for Holmes'.

Holmes saw no reason for the WBA to preside over a bout between the two men. The WBA insisted Coetzee could not face Holmes, despite the fact Holmes had been recognized as the best heavyweight in the world since 1978. In any event, Coetzee re-injured his hand during training camp, requiring further surgery, and the fight was cancelled.

On his return to the ring, after an extended absence, Coetzee was paired with [[Greg Page (boxer)|Greg Page]] (the real #1 contender [[David Bey]], refused to go to South Africa as described in "Only in America: The Life and Crimes of Don King" by Jack Newfield, Bey became the #1 by outpointing Greg Page over 12 rounds). Page was even more stigmatized by failing to win big fights than was Coetzee. He was seen as supremely talented and like many fighters in the immediate post-Ali era, his size, speed and coordination supposedly portended great expectations of achievement. While Page could look extremely impressive, as against James Tillis for example, he also was seen as lazy and unmotivated.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In this bout Page did less posing than normal, and did more fighting putting on an energetic performance.  Coetzee seemed overconfident, and can be seen delivering a lot of the trash-talking and doing less punching and trying more verbal intimidation such as he used in bouts against Tate and Weaver. But Page was on much better form than when he had lost to Bey. Coetzee for his part was dangerous and while sloppy, was getting his own shots home. The challenger's strong chin nullified Coetzee's power to some extent. The two exchanged momentum. Coetzee's lack of defense was more evident than usual, and he was a sitting duck for Page's counter-punching and his once dependable chin seemed to fail him, being stung and hurt often. His right was not effective, but he was scoring with his left hand. He was dropped after the bell of the 6th round in a foul; and in the 7th legitimately. Page was taking advantage of Coetzee's recklessness. In exchange after exchange as the bout wore on, it was Coetzee, the "puncher", losing the skirmishes and being hurt. He was knocked out in Round 8. But, there was controversy.

Coetzee's camp protested that not only had the 8th round run too long, but also that while Coetzee was on the canvas the bell had sounded and the referee's count should have been waved off. Generally, this would have allowed Coetzee to continue for at least one more round. The 8th, the round in question actually did run for almost a minute too long.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Despite this, the WBA recognized the result as it happened, and affirmed Page as the winner by a knockout in eight. Coetzee and his camp demanded an immediate rematch. Instead, Page went on to face [[Tony Tubbs]] whom he had beaten several times in the amateurs.

===Post-championship career===
After losing his title, Coetzee made token attempts at a comeback. He beat the former title challenger and at that time mid-level foe [[James "Quick" Tillis]] by a decision in ten. Next was a journey to England to fight the big-punching contender [[Frank Bruno]]. In the offing would be a shot at the WBA title, since dropped by Page. Coetzee was knocked out in round one. After that fight, he announced his retirement, but came back twice during the 1990s, winning by knockout in three against both [[Dave Fiddler]] and [[Wes Turner]] in 1993, and then winning against [[Dan Komiscki]] in three. Coetzee lost to former world Middleweight and Light Heavyweight champion [[Iran Barkley]] by a knockout in ten, after dropping him in round two, for the WBB Superheavyweight belt.

'''Glen De Boeck''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɣlɛn də ˈbuk}}; born 22 August 1971 in [[Boom, Antwerp|Boom]]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] former [[soccer|football]] player and manager, who is currently unemployed after last managing [[K.V. Kortrijk|Kortrijk]] in the [[Belgian First Division A]]. During his career he played as [[Defender (association football)#Centre back|central defender]], mostly on the books of [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].

==Career==
In the summer of 1995, De Boeck was transferred from [[Y.R. K.V. Mechelen|KV Mechelen]] to [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]]. In the late 1990s, he was criticized by pundits, who claimed he was not good enough for Anderlecht. He eventually increased his technical performances to become one of the best defenders in [[Belgian First Division A|The Jupiler Pro League]] in the early 2000s.

In February 2005, De Boeck decided to end his career due to a heavy [[knee]] injury. He made a successful move to coaching to finally become Managing Director of Herculean, the corporate wellbeing company.

==Coaching career==
He was directly snapped up by his last club to become an assistant manager, together with [[Daniel Renders]].

On 23 April 2007, it was revealed that De Boeck would become manager of first division side [[Cercle Brugge]] at the end of [[Jupiler League 2006-07|the 2006-07 season]]. He succeeded [[Harm Van Veldhoven]], who had already chosen to leave for [[Germinal Beerschot]]. On 1 February 2008, the board of directors at Cercle declared De Boeck had signed a new contract until 2011, as he also became the football section's technical director, being made responsible for the further development of the football team. In March 2009, De Boeck denied [[K.R.C. Genk]] in signing him as their new coach. Instead he choose to stay with his current club [[Cercle Brugge]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/voetbal-binnenland/glen-de-boeck-ik-zie-me-nog-vijf-jaar-bij-cercle-brugge.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He left Cercle in June 2010 and was named the manager of Germinal Beerschot who were looking for a successor to Jos Daerden who left to become an assistant coach at Dutch club Twente.

On 30 November 2010, after continuous bad results and disagreements on the management board, he was fired as coach from Germinal Beerschot.

At the start of the season 2011–2012 De Boeck was appointed as the new manager of [[VVV-Venlo]], but halfway through the season on 6 December 2011, following a 7-0 defeat to [[Heracles Almelo]], he resigned as manager of VVV-Venlo. In November 2012 he signed for [[Waasland-Beveren]], but was released one year later.

In January 2015 he started a new challenge in the business world as Managing Director for [http://www.Herculean.coop Herculean], the corporate wellbeing company.

==International==
De Boeck made his international debut with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] on 6 October 1993, against [[Gabon national football team|Gabon]] (a friendly), going on to represent his country at two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], with three appearances combined.

[[File:Henry-Leslie.jpg|thumb|right|Leslie in later years]]
'''Henry David Leslie''' (18 June 1822 – 5 February 1896) was an English composer and conductor.  Leslie was a leader in supporting amateur choral musicians in Britain, founding prize-winning amateur choral societies.  He was also a supporter of musical higher education, helping to found national music schools.

==Biography==
Leslie was born in London.  His parents were John Leslie, a tailor and enthusiastic amateur [[viola]] player, and Mary Taylor Leslie.  He had eight brothers and sisters.  He attended the Palace School in [[Enfield Town|Enfield]] and worked with his father.  As a teenager, he studied the cello with [[Charles Lucas (musician)|Charles Lucas]] and later played that instrument in concerts at the [[Sacred Harmonic Society]] for several years.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Holmstrom, John, rev. Anne Pimlott Baker.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37667 "Leslie, Henry David (1822–1896)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 5 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Leslie began to compose music, and in 1840 he published his ''Te Deum and Jubilate in D''.  He became honorary secretary of the newly founded Amateur Musical Society in 1847.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. Henry Leslie", ''[[The Times]]'', 7 February 1896, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His symphony in F was performed in 1848 by the Amateur Musical Society under [[Michael Balfe]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 March 1848, p. 5, col B&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, at the Norwich music festival of 1849, his much-admired anthem "Let God Arise" was premiered.  He conducted the Amateur Musical Society from 1853 until it dissolved in 1861.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Leslie's dramatic overture, ''The Templar'' (1852), was followed by and his well-regarded [[oratorio]]s ''Immanuel'' (1854) and ''Judith'' (1858), and some chamber music.  In 1855, he founded a madrigal society which grew to 200 voices and became known as Henry Leslie's Choir.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1896/02/07/104110548.pdf "Death of Henry David Leslie",] ''The New York Times'', 7 February 1896&lt;/ref&gt; He was its conductor until 1880.  The choir introduced many important choral works to English audiences, including [[J. S. Bach]]'s 18-part motets.  According to ''[[The Times]]'', this choir "held the palm among London societies for finished singing of unaccompanied music, both ancient and modern".&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

In 1857, Leslie married Mary Betsy, one of his pupils, the daughter of physician William Henry Perry.  The couple moved to Mary's family home, now known as Bryn Tanat Hall, at [[Llansanffraid-ym-Mechain|Llansanffraid]], near [[Oswestry]] on the Welsh border.  They produced four sons and one daughter.  Their son William became a master of the Musicians' Company, and [[Charles Leslie (cricketer)|Charles]] became a cricketer for Middlesex and England.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Leslie's [[operetta]] ''Romance, or, Bold Dick Turpin'', first performed in 1857, was presented at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1860.  After this, he wrote the cantatas ''Holyrood'' (1860) and ''Daughter of the Isles'' (1861) and a [[Psalm 100|Jubilate]] in B (1864).  In 1865, he wrote a romantic opera ''Ida, or, The Guardian Storks''.  He also conducted the amateur Herefordshire Philharmonic Society from 1863.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He published over a hundred part songs for the choir.  Some of these became very popular, including the trio "O memory", "The Pilgrims", and "[[Annabel Lee|Annabelle Lee]]" set to a poem by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  His output also included a quantity of chamber and piano music.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He also edited collections of part songs, including ''Cassell's Choral Music'', in 1867.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Later years===
In 1864, Leslie established a National College of Music, in Piccadilly, and acted as its principal.  Its professors included [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[Julius Benedict]], and other prominent musicians, but the college survived only two years.  In 1874, he became conductor of the newly formed Guild of Amateur Musicians.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; In 1878, Leslie and others made another attempt to form a national music school, which was successful and became the predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]].

Leslie and Sullivan organised the British musical presentations at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.  There Henry Leslie's Choir won the first prize at the international choral competition.  In 1880, after a royal command performance at [[Windsor Castle]], he dissolved the choir.  Later, however, it was re-formed under [[Alberto Randegger]], with Leslie as president, and he resumed conducting it from 1885 to 1887.  [[Charles Santley]] and other well-known soloists performed with the choir.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Leslie's only major composition later in life was his second symphony, ''Chivalry'', which premiered in 1881 at [[The Crystal Palace]].  After he retired, he founded the [[Oswestry]] School of Music and its Festival of Village Choirs.  At the end of his life, Leslie was ill for several years.

He died in 1896 in [[Baschurch]], Shropshire, and was buried in the churchyard at [[Llanyblodwel]].

He is known under the pseudonym Engel, such writing of the nickname has an origin from the name of a song of the German rock-group [[Rammstein]].

== Early years ==
Artimovich was born in Kalinigrad Oblast, the USSR. At the age of 6 months he moved with his parents to [[Leningrad Oblast]], where he lived until the ending of high school. His first experiences in programming were connected to the [[BASIC|Basic]] language on the [[ZX Spectrum]] computer.

== Saint-Petersburg State University ==
In 1999, Artimovich entered the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint-Petersburg State University]] at the faculty of Applied Mathematics, and moved to live to [[Saint-Petersburg]]. In 2004, he finished studying, having defended the thesis and having gained the diploma as "Mathematician".

== Sun Microsystems ==
From 2004, he worked in the Saint-Petersburg branch of [[Sun Microsystems]], in the development of the C compiler which belonged to a set of development tools of the software named [[Sun Studio]]. Artimovich's duties consisted in porting the compiler of language C on the amd64 platform and realizing of functionality of the compiler specific to the operating system Linux. In 2008, Artimovich left Sun Microsystems.

Artimovich, in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="Kramer"/&gt; told that after leaving Sun Microsystems he was engaged in research in the field of [[information security]] and [[computer virus]]es, and also the development of his own [[antivirus]] software for Windows operating systems.

== Cyberattack on Aeroflot ==

In summer of 2010, a [[cyberattack]] similar to a "[[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|distributed denial of service]]" was carried out on the electronic ticket payment system of [[Aeroflot]] airline. The attack was so strong that the equipment of the backbone provider of the Internet serving payment system couldn't cope with it, and Aeroflot suspended the online sale of tickets for a week.

In autumn of 2010, specialists from the anti-virus company [[ESET]] conducted research to determine the source of the attack and drew the conclusion that the attack was made with use of the botnet Festi. This cyberattack drew the close attention of Russian intelligence services, and the conclusion was drawn that the founder and the owner of Festi was Artimovich. This was confirmed by American journalist and blogger [[Brian Krebs]], who specializes on information security, in an article titled "Who Is the ‘Festi’ Botmaster?",&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt; as well as American journalist Andrew Kramer of The New York Times in the article titled "Online Attack Leads to Peek Into Spam Den"&lt;ref name="Kramer"/&gt; and also by the report by ESET antivirus company at the conference "AVAR 2012" in Hangzhou, China, dedicated to Anti-virus Technologies and [[Corporate Security]].&lt;ref name="Matrosov2"/&gt;

'''Jaap Goudsmit''' (born 22 July 1951 in [[Amsterdam]]) is [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[scientist]], known for his research in the field of [[AIDS]] and influenza. Recently he shifted his research interest to neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's Disease. He is also a prolific writer of non-fiction books: Viral Sex, the Nature of AIDS (1997); Viral Fitness, the Next SARS and West Nile in the Making (2004); Serendipity Manual (2012); The Vaccine Bug, a personal history of the World of Immunity (2013); Immorbidity Alphabet, Spelling-out a life free of dis-ease (2015); The Time of your Life, Staying healthy to the End (2016) and The Art of Facing Mortality, a scientist's view (2016).

Jaap Goudsmit was among the first in 1986 who discovered that the amount of HIV in blood predicted the progression to clinically manifest AIDS and he discovered in 2008 the achillesheel of the influenza virus that opened the way towards a universal influenza vaccine. In 2013 Goudsmit coined the concept "Immorbidity" for a human life course immune to age-related diseases that prematurely end life, accepting that even with a minimum of disease human life ends. In 2000 the science-fiction writer Wil McCarthy introduced the term " immorbidity " in his book " The Collapsium" as the concept to eradicate all terminal illness during time transport over lightyears making the transported people virtually immortal.

In 1978 Jaap Goudsmit received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree with [[Latin honors|honor]] at the Faculty of Medicine of the [[University of Amsterdam]]. He was awarded a Fogarty fellowship, and joined the research on [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] with Nobel Prize winner [[Daniel Carleton Gajdusek]]. He received his PhD  from the University of Amsterdam in 1982. He received a Fogarty Visiting Scientist Award to do [[postdoctoral research]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. In 1983 Jaap Goudsmit became board certified in the Netherlands as a Medical Microbiologist. From 1989 -2001 he was professor in [[virology]] at the University of Amsterdam. One Science paper published in 1990 with Jaap Goudsmit as senior author created a controversy in the Netherlands and concerned a study of blocking of HIV replication by antisense DNA. Despite the fact that Jaap Goudsmit had to retract this paper, he was chosen by his peers in a 1993 Science article as one of the best European AIDS scientists and is still one of the most productive and most cited virologist worldwide.

Jaap Goudsmit was appointed professor of virology in 1989 at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, a position he held till 2001. He has been head of the Department of Human Retrovirology at the [[Academic Medical Center]] (AMC) of the University of Amsterdam from 1996 to 2002 and chairman of the AMC Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and the AMC Institute for Science Education. From 1984 -2001 he was one of the principal researcher of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS among homosexual men and HIV drug users.
From 2001-2016 Jaap Goudsmit was professor of vaccinology and immunoprophylaxis in the department of Internal Medicine at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam and in 2016 he became professor of Pathogenesis and natural history of Neurodegenerative diseases in the Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Academic Medical Center. In 2016 Jaap Goudsmit was appointed professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health.

He chaired the Scientific Advisory Committee of the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] (IAVI) and has been a member of its board. He was project leader and (co)chair of Eurovacc Foundation. In 2002 Jaap Goudsmit joined [[Crucell]], a  biotechnology company in [[Leiden]], as Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President of Vaccine Research and Development. From 2004 -2011 he was Chief Scientific Officer of Crucell and member of the Management Board. When Crucell was acquired by Johnson and Johnson Jaap Goudsmit became head of the Crucell Vaccine Institute from 2011-2015, an institute focusing on influenza research. In 2015 he became global head of the Janssen Prevention Center, that focuses on the prevention of non-communicable diseases with a special emphasis on prognostic markers for age-related diseases. In 2017 Jaap Goudsmit retired from Johnson &amp; Johnson and returned to academia to study Alzheimer's Disease and Ageing. 

Goudsmit is a very productive researcher and author or co-author of more than 550 scientific publications of which nine appeared in Science and six in Nature. According to the [[Institute for Scientific Information]], he entered the list of most-cited scientists in 2001. In 2016 Jaap Goudsmit received a honorary degree from the Vrije University and the Vrije University Medical Center for his lifetime achievements in science both in academia and the biofarmaceutical Industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">'''Karl Roche''' (1862&amp;ndash;1931) was a German [[syndicalist]] and [[left communist]] trade unionist. Roche joined the [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] (FVdG) around 1900 as a seaman. He became a prominent member of the organization. 

In 1913, [[Carl Windhoff]], [[Fritz Kater]], and he were the FVdG delegates at the [[First International Syndicalist Congress]] in London. In 1919, he wrote the FVdG's first post-World War I platform ''Was wollen die Syndikalisten? Programm, Ziele und Wege der "Freien Vereinigung deutscher Gewerkschaften"'' (''What do the Syndicalists want? Program, Goals, and Means of the "Free Association of German Trade Unions"''). The program summarized the FVdG's theory: a reaffirmation of the importance of strikes as a vehicle for emancipation and a rejection of the centralized mainstream labor unions. Roche was also a resolute proponent of collaboration with [[left communist]]s. 

In late 1918, [[Rudolf Rocker]] returned to Germany, in March 1919 he joined the FVdG and started gaining influence. An avowed [[communist anarchist]] and follower of [[Kropotkin]], Rocker rejected such close collaboration with Marxists. His growing influence led Roche to leave the [[Free Workers' Union of Germany]], as the FVdG was now known, in 1920 and join the [[General Workers' Union of Germany]] (AAUD). He became the leader of the AAUD in [[Hamburg]]. In the mid-1920s he left the AAUD for the [[Federation of Communist Anarchists of Germany]] and then re-joined the FAUD.

Kennedy is one of Africa’s best- known community organizers and social entrepreneurs. Among SHOFCO's accomplishments are setting up and running a free school for girls in the slum, making clean water and medical care accessible and helping dozens of individuals start small businesses. 

== Early life ==
Kennedy, was born in an African village, and lived there until it was struck by famine when he was just  two years old. Desperate for a better life, his mother moved the family to the city. But, given the lack of jobs and housing in Nairobi, they ended up in the slum.  When Kennedy Odede was a kid, he foraged for food, lived on the streets of Kibera, and taught himself to read with old newspapers. He lived in the Kibera Slum for twenty- three years and experienced the devastating realities of life in extreme poverty first hand. The oldest of eight children, Kennedy became a street-child at the age of ten. Influenced by the non violence principles of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/01/15/509678827/how-martin-luther-king-jr-changed-the-life-of-a-street-kid-in-kenya|title=How Martin Luther King Jr. Changed The Life Of A Street Kid In Kenya|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; he imagined how he could change his community. In 2004 he had a job in a factory earning $1 for ten hours of work. He saved 20 cents and used this to buy a soccer ball and start (SHOFCO). Although he was entirely informally educated, Kennedy received a full scholarship to Wesleyan University, becoming one of Kibera’s first to receive an education from an American liberal arts institution.

== Career ==
Driven by the innovation and entrepreneurial spirits of the people of Kibera, SHOFCO became the largest grassroots organization in the Kibera. Kennedy was awarded the 2010 Echoing Green Fellowship, which is given to the world’s best emerging social entrepreneurs. He was named to FORBES "30 under 30 list" for top Social Entrepreneurs &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/emeg45hfhj/kennedy-odede-29/#47d655d444e6|title=Kennedy Odede, 29 - pg.22|last=Carlyle|first=Erin|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in  He won the 2010 Dell Social Innovation Competition, and is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.

'''Khalid Mohammad bin Muslim Al-Arawi Al-Juhani''' ({{lang-ar|وقع خالد بن محمد مسلم الجهني}}, also known as '''Mu'awiyah al-Madani''') was a Saudi member of [[al-Qaeda]]. He appeared, cradling a rifle, in a 2002 videotape in which he promised a "martyrdom" attack.&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews20020120/&gt; In 2003, the Saudi government identified al-Juhani as one of twelve dead perpetrators of the [[Riyadh compound bombings]] based on [[DNA]] found at the scene.&lt;ref name=riyadh12&gt;[http://saudinf.com/main/y5802.htm Saudi statement identifies al-Juhani as killed in Riyadh]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Al-Juhani was once a bodyguard for [[Osama Bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rulit.net/books/the-black-banners-read-249656-92.html&lt;/ref&gt; He fled Afghanistan, along with [[Saleh al-Oufi]], in late 2001 following the American invasion.&lt;ref name="conf"&gt;Stevens, Robert. [[Associated Press]], "Confusion reigns in the Kingdom", July 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2002, a series of five video cassettes were recovered from the rubble of the destroyed home of [[Mohammad Atef]] outside of [[Kabul, Afghanistan]]. The tapes showed [[Abderraouf Jdey]], [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], [[Muhammad Sa'id Ali Hasan]], [[Abdul Rahim Jenko|Abd Al-Rahim]], and al-Juhani vowing to die as martyrs.  It was the first time authorities had reason to suspect him of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[[CBC News|CBC]], [http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2002/01/25/terror_cda020125.html Two Canadians among fugitive al-Qaeda members], January 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC News]] said the videos had been recorded after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

After the tape was discovered, and the Saudi newspaper [[Al Watan (Saudi Arabia)|Al-Watan]] contacted
his family members, they said he spent three years fighting in Afghanistan from the time he was 18 years old, and another three years fighting in [[Chechnya]]. They believed he had been left mentally ill "as a result of pressure he faced during the [Afghan] war".&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews20020120&gt;

"Global Jihadism", p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; In Saudi Arabia, [[Karim el-Mejjati]] agreed to allow al-Juhani to live with his family.

[[File:FBI Juhani.jpg|thumb|left|A [[composite image]] created by the FBI to show how Juhani may try to disguise himself.]]
On March 23, 2003, el-Mejjati's wife and 10-year-old son, Ilyass, left the city to try to reach an [[ophthalmologist]]. They had been originally intended to travel with  al-Juhani, which caught the attention of the [[Mabahith]] secret police. However, al-Juhani argued he wasn't feeling well and asked a brother and his wife to instead accompany el-Mejjati and her son. The group was nonetheless arrested by authorities who hoped that al-Juhani was present.&lt;ref name="gaz"&gt;[[La Gazette du Maroc]], [http://www.lagazettedumaroc.com/articles.php?r=2&amp;sr=964&amp;n=422&amp;id_artl=6625 Mon mari n'etait pau un terroriste, mais un Moujahid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713181428/http://www.lagazettedumaroc.com/articles.php?r=2&amp;sr=964&amp;n=422&amp;id_artl=6625 |date=2011-07-13 }}, May 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Juhani was identified as one of the twelve suicide bombers in the May 2003 suicide bombing attacks in Riyadh.

'''Landscape managers''' are professionally trained and qualified experts in landscaping management for [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and [[recreation]] [[stewardship]] of designed and [[natural landscape]]s.

==Scope of work==
Landscape managers work with designed landscapes, such as [[urban park|public park]]s, private [[garden]]s and public [[botanic garden]]s, and [[golf course]]s and sports centers. They also work with [[natural landscape]]s, such as [[nature reserve]]s, [[Open space reserve|natural open space parks]], and [[national parks]].

==Education==
The [[United Kingdom]] [[Landscape Institute]] has a landscape management division whose members describe themselves as [[landscape architect]]s. There are undergraduate degree programs leading to qualifications in landscape management and membership of professional institutes.

In the [[United States]] 4-year [[undergraduate degree]]s are offered for dual majors of [[Construction]] [[management]] and Ornamental [[horticulture]] or [[Landscape architecture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1694">'''Leszek of Dobrzyń''' (pl: ''Leszek dobrzyński''; bef. 1302 - bef. 10 July 1316), was a Polish prince member of the [[House of Piast]] and Duke of [[Dobrzyń nad Wisłą|Dobrzyń]] during 1312-1316 with his brothers.

He was the eldest son of [[Siemowit of Dobrzyń]] and Anastasia, daughter of [[Leo I of Galicia|Leo I of Halych-Peremyshl]]. 

==Life==

The only known fact about him was his mention in the testimony of Jan of Kisielew during the Polish-Teutonic trial in Warsaw in 1339; because this is the only contemporary source who named him, his existence is a matter of dispute between historians. If he was a real person, certainly died young, in or before 1316,&lt;ref&gt;K. Jasiński: ''Rodowód Piastów małopolskich i kujawskich'', Poznań – Wrocław 2001, p. 173, believed that most likely Leszek died ca. 1314; however, this fact is not substantiated.&lt;/ref&gt; still under the regency of his mother and uncle Władysław I.

'''Levi Keith Johnston''' (born May 3, 1990) is an American model and actor, best known as the twice-former [[Engagement|fiancé]] of [[Bristol Palin]] and father of their son [[Bristol Palin#Relationships and children|Tripp]]. He first received media attention in August 2008 when U.S. [[vice president]]ial candidate [[Sarah Palin]] announced that her daughter Bristol was five months pregnant with Johnston's baby and that the two were engaged. Ultimately, the couple ended their relationship, and Johnston and the Palin family engaged in several public feuds.

After working in the Alaskan [[oil field]]s, Johnston began pursuing a career in the entertainment industry, aspiring to be a [[Model (person)|model]] and an actor.  He has written a book based on his experiences with the Palins, titled ''Deer in the Headlights''.

==Personal life==
Johnston was born in Wasilla, Alaska, the first born child of Sherry (née Sampson) and Keith Johnston. Levi has one sibling, Mercede "Sadie" Johnston.&lt;ref name="Holland2009"/&gt; Levi attended [[Wasilla High School]], where he played on the hockey team, but did not graduate.&lt;ref name="Ref_c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_d"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_e"/&gt; He worked full-time on the [[Alaska North Slope]] [[oil field]]s as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] [[electrician]],&lt;ref name="Goldman2008"/&gt; quitting in January 2009.&lt;ref name="Ref_f"/&gt;

According to Johnston, he and Bristol Palin began dating during their freshman year of [[high school]].&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; After losing a [[pre-engagement ring|promise ring]] on a [[caribou]] hunt, Johnston had Bristol's name [[tattoo]]ed on his finger.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP08"/&gt;

Following the announcement that she would be Senator [[John McCain]]'s running mate in the November, 2008 U.S. presidential election, Sarah Palin announced that her daughter Bristol was pregnant by Johnston, and that the two would be married.&lt;ref name="Ref_g"/&gt; Johnston denied claims that he was being pressured into a [[shotgun wedding]], stating, "We were planning on getting married a long time ago with or without the kid. That was the plan from the start."&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt; The couple's son, Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston, was born in December 2008,&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; but the two broke off their [[engagement]] in March 2009.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; In May 2009, Johnston said that their relationship was improving and that they were determined to jointly raise Tripp.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt; Later, Bristol began a child custody case against Johnston, seeking sole custody and child support.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009"/&gt;

In July 2010, Bristol Palin and Johnston announced that they had reunited and were engaged for the second time;&lt;ref name="Ref_h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="show"/&gt; less than three weeks later, they ended their second engagement.&lt;ref name="Ref_i"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_j"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_k"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_l"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_m"/&gt;

Johnston married Sunny Oglesby (born 1992) on October 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/bristol-palin-smitten-joey-junker-levi-johnston-marries-sunny-oglesby_n_2059607.html "Bristol Palin, Joey Junker: Reality Star 'Smitten' With Snowmobiler"]. ''The Huffington Post''. November 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A month prior to the wedding, the couple's first daughter, Breeze Beretta Johnston, was born. Their second daughter, Indy Rae Johnston, was born in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/09/levi-johnston-and-girlfriend-sunny-oglesby-welcome-daughter-breeze-beretta/ "Levi Johnston and Girlfriend Sunny Oglesby Welcome Daughter Breeze Beretta"]. ABC News. September 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/levi-johnston-girlfriend-sunny-oglesby-daughter-breeze-barette-johnston-article-1.1157883 "Levi Johnston, girlfriend Sunny Oglesby welcome daughter Breeze Beretta Johnston"]. ''Daily News'' (New York). September 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media attention==

===During the 2008 U.S. presidential election===
Johnston attended the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] with the Palin family.&lt;ref name="teen dad"/&gt; While Sarah Palin was delivering her prime-time nomination acceptance speech, the cameras frequently cut away to Johnston and Bristol.&lt;ref name="teen dad"/&gt; Johnston shook hands onstage with Sarah Palin's running mate, Republican presidential candidate, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]],&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; and was treated as a member of Palin's family.&lt;ref name="Baxter2008"/&gt; [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] commentator [[Dick Morris]] remarked that McCain's decision to welcome Johnston to the stage was a good move because it would help McCain show "a nonjudgmental", tolerant attitude, while still sending the message that unwed teens who become pregnant should marry.&lt;ref name="Staff2008"/&gt;

===2009 interviews===
After his 2009 breakup with Bristol, Johnston gave a series of nationally televised interviews.&lt;ref name="People1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="People2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="People3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; He appeared on ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]'' with his mother and sister, saying he wanted to dispel rumors.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; Remarking on Bristol's public appearances to [[Abstinence-only sex education|promote sexual abstinence]],&lt;ref name="AP09"/&gt; Johnston told ''[[The Early Show]]'' that "abstinence is a great idea" but said it was unrealistic to think it is going to work for teens.&lt;ref name="CBS News"/&gt; In another interview he said that he was "pretty sure" Sarah Palin had known that he and Bristol were having sex in the family's house.&lt;ref name="People1"/&gt;

The Palin family denounced Johnston's statements as lies, with one public statement reading, "We're disappointed that Levi and his family, in a quest for fame, attention, and fortune, are engaging in flat-out lies, gross exaggeration, and even distortion of their relationship."&lt;ref name="Fleeman2009"/&gt;

In August 2009, Johnston speculated that [[Resignation of Sarah Palin|Sarah Palin's early resignation from office]] was due to long-standing marital difficulties, the pressures of the job, and lucrative book and other media offers.&lt;ref name="Ref_n"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_o"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_p"/&gt; In a September 2009 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' interview, Johnston alleged that Sarah Palin initially wanted the couple to keep Bristol's pregnancy a secret and offered to adopt the baby and raise him as her own,&lt;ref name="vanityfair" /&gt; but that he and Bristol rejected the plan.&lt;ref name="vanityfair"/&gt; In response, Sarah told the media Johnston's statements were "untrue, malicious, and appalling", emphasizing that she highly appreciated her children and commenting that Johnston's photoshoots were "attention-seeking and desperate".&lt;ref name="Ref_q"/&gt;

===2010 apology and subsequent retraction===
In July 2010, a week prior to the announcement that he and Bristol were engaged a second time, Johnston issued a statement saying "I publicly said things about the Palins that were not completely true. I have already privately apologized to [[Todd Palin|Todd]] and Sarah. Since my statements were public, I owe it to the Palins to publicly apologize."&lt;ref name="Eunice2010"/&gt; After the brief second engagement ended, Johnston said that he regretted issuing the apology, saying, "it kind of makes me sound like a liar. I've never lied about anything."&lt;ref name="Ref_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_r"/&gt;

==2011 Wasilla mayoral election==
In August 2010, Johnston announced that he would be running in the October 2011 election for mayor of [[Wasilla, Alaska]],&lt;ref name="US mag 10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ET"/&gt; saying he wanted his son, Tripp, to be proud of him.&lt;ref name="et2"/&gt; The then-current mayor, [[Verne E. Rupright]], responded that Johnston's announcement was a little early, and advised him to get a high school diploma, and keep his clothes on, a reference to Johnston's modeling career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-08-11/gossip/27072349_1_bristol-palin-levi-johnston-sarah-palin|work=Nydailynews.com|date=2010-08-11|title=Alaska mayor responds to Levi Johnston's bid: Get a high school diploma and keep your clothes on|author=Cristina Everett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost/&gt; Bristol Palin responded that she "never knew he had political aspirations. I'm glad that Levi has not given up on completing his education and is looking for steady employment."&lt;ref name="us mag"/&gt; Johnston's manager stated he hoped to copy the rise of Sarah Palin from mayor of Wasilla to governor of Alaska, "creating a rural, Alaskan version of the [[Bush family|Bush political dynasty]]."&lt;ref name="the Australian"/&gt;  It was reported that Johnston's bid for mayor would tie into his proposed reality television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/levi-johnston-to-run-for-mayor-of-wasilla-201098|work=US Magazine|title=Levi Johnston to Run for Mayor of Wasilla|date=2010-08-09|author=UsWeekly Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2010, [[Public Policy Polling]] reported that Johnston had become the most unpopular person polled in his home state, with a six percent approval and 72 percent disapproval rating, replacing former [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential candidate and senator [[John Edwards]].&lt;ref name="the Atlantic Wire"/&gt;

On August 23, 2011, six weeks before the October 4 election, Johnston announced through his attorney that he would not be running, citing his busy schedule promoting his new book.&lt;ref name="too busy"/&gt; His manager stated that "Levi doesn't want the office of the Mayor to be a joke", adding that "there are a lot of issues that he would need to study up on and he thinks that this isn't the right time for him to be Mayor."&lt;ref name="not running"/&gt;

==Other activities==
Johnston hired [[Anchorage, Alaska]], attorney Rex Butler (who was previously best known for representing criminal defendants and handling civil litigation)&lt;ref name="Ref_s"/&gt; to represent him in his pursuit of a career in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref name="Ref_t"/&gt; The ''[[Associated Press]]'' reported in July 2009 that Johnston was also pursuing a movie deal.&lt;ref name="News2009"/&gt;

Johnston and [[comedian]] [[Kathy Griffin]] attended the 2009 [[Teen Choice Award]]s together. She later stated that he was "surprisingly sweet and courteous" to her.&lt;ref name="FXKG"/&gt; Johnston and Griffin's acquaintance is documented in the sixth season of Griffin's [[reality television]] series, ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]''. Additionally, as a gag in her stand-up comedy routine, Griffin often referred to the acquaintance as a relationship, and Johnston as her boyfriend.

In October 2009, Johnston appeared in a television commercial for [[Lynda Resnick|Roll International]], makers of Wonderful Pistachios, as part of their "Get Crackin" advertising campaign.&lt;ref name=pistachio/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The commercial features Johnston, with a [[bodyguard]], opening a [[pistachio]] as a [[voice-over]] states, "Now Levi Johnston does it with protection."&lt;ref name=playgirl/&gt;

It was reported that Johnston would pose fully nude for ''[[Playgirl]]'' magazine;&lt;ref name="Ref_u"/&gt; however, following a statement by Sarah Palin that referred to Johnston's "aspiring [[pornography|porn]] career",&lt;ref name="Barr2009"/&gt; it was announced that Johnston's [[photo shoot]] would not include [[full frontal nudity]].&lt;ref name="Ref_v"/&gt;

Politico reported in April 2010 that Johnston was writing on a memoir "that would air the true story of the Palin household."&lt;ref name="Allen2010"/&gt; Johnston's book, ''Deer in the Headlights: My Life in Sarah Palin's Crosshairs'', was published in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;''Deer in the Headlights: My Life in Sarah Palin's Crosshairs'', September 20, 2011, Touchstone, ({{ISBN|978-1-4516-5165-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston appeared as a celebrity coach to Logan Cummins in the pilot of a reality television show titled "Mansformation" released in May 2013.&lt;ref name="Mansformation"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbY38mw2lAA&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
On September 28, 2010, [[Ben Folds]] and [[Nick Hornby]] released an album called ''[[Lonely Avenue (album)|Lonely Avenue]]'', which featured a track entitled "Levi Johnston's Blues". The song provides an account of Johnston's story,&lt;ref name="Ref_z"/&gt; based on actual posts Johnston had uploaded to his own [[MySpace]] webpage.

Alaska singer-songwriter [[Marian Call]] has said that "The Avocado Song" was inspired by Levi Johnston.

In the [[HBO]] film ''[[Game Change (film)|Game Change]]'' (2012), Johnston is portrayed by actor [[Justin Gaston]].

At the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) she was coached by [[Terry Gathercole]].

In 1996, Frame retired from swimming after developing [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sacfs.asn.au/news/2012/05/05_03_champion_swimmer_fights_for_understanding.htm|title=Champion swimmer fights for understanding of 'the most misunderstood' disease|publisher=ME/CFS Australia (Victoria)|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linley Frame: Olympian and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome sufferer|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2012/05/04/3495770.htm|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marie Rose Ferron''' (24 May 1902 &amp;ndash; 11 May 1936), often called the '''Little Rose''', was a [[Canadian-American]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mysticism|mystic]] and [[Stigmata|stigmatist]].{{sfn|Freze, p.125}}&lt;ref&gt;''A Stigmatist: Marie-Rose Ferron'' by Jeanne S. Bonin 1988 {{ISBN|2-89039-161-2}} page 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ferron was born in [[Saint-Germain-de-Grantham, Quebec]], as the tenth child of a large devoutly Catholic family which moved to [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] in 1906. It is said that she was six years old when she had her first vision of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], as a child, carrying a cross. "He was looking at me with sadness in His eyes," she once said.&lt;ref name=anchor&gt;[http://issuu.com/the_anchor/docs/05.13.11 Souza, Kenneth A. "Seventy-five Years, Later Little Roses Devotees Still Pray For Sainthood Cause", ''The Anchor'', Fall River Diocese, May 13, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 13, Ferron was stricken with a mysterious [[paralysis]] and painful contraction of the muscles, forcing her to walk with crutches for several years until her twisted and clubbed feet confined her to a bed for the rest of her life. Because her muscles would sometimes painfully contract, making it very difficult to straighten once again, a flat board was placed on her narrow bed to which she was rigidly strapped. She also suffered an intestinal problem that made it difficult to digest solid food and contracted [[tetanus]] and [[pyorrhea]].&lt;ref name=anchor/&gt;

The family relocated to [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]] in 1925, where, the following year, her [[stigmata]] first appeared. By [[Lent]] 1927 the wounds began to appear regularly every Friday.&lt;ref name=anchor/&gt; Ferron lived in constant pain until her death in 1936 at the age of 33. The number of mourners attending her funeral attest to her popularity in the Franco-American community.&lt;ref name=kaell&gt;[http://umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Historical%20Studies%20vol%2073%20Final%20(2).pdf Kaell, Hillary. "“Marie-Rose, Stigmatisée de Woonsocket”:The Construction of a Franco-American Saint Cult, 1930-1955", ''Historical Studies'', Vol.73, The Canadian Catholic Historical Association, (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her stigmata (including a [[crown of thorns]]) were repeatedly photographed. There are those that have considered her the first American stigmatist.{{sfn|Freze, pp. 251-252}}&lt;ref&gt;''Religion and American cultures: an encyclopedia of traditions, Volume 1'' by Gary Laderman, Luís D. León 2003 {{ISBN|1-57607-238-X}} page 336&lt;/ref&gt; An inquiry into the cause of Ferron's canonization was conducted by Bishop Russell McVinney of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence|Providence, Rhode Island]] and ended in 1964 with the bishop deciding against further proceedings.&lt;ref name=kaell/&gt;

'''Martin T. Schechter''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of British Columbia|OBC]]}} (born December 16, 1951) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Epidemiology|
epidemiologist]] recognized for contributions to [[HIV]] research, prevention and treatments and to [[addiction]] research. He is a professor and founding director of the School of Population and Public Health in the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC). Schechter received his [[Order of British Columbia]] in 1994 alongside BC's first [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Michael Smith (chemist)|Michael Smith]]. He now serves as Chief Scientific Officer of the [[Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research]].

==Education==
Schechter completed his BA in Mathematics at [[York University]] (1973), his MA in Mathematics at [[University of British Columbia|UBC]] (1975), his PhD in Mathematics at the [[New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering|Polytechnic Institute of New York]] (1977), his MD in Medicine at [[McMaster University]] (1981) and his MSc in Epidemiology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1983).&lt;ref name=cash&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin T. Schechter|url=http://www.cahs-acss.ca/martin-t-schechter/|publisher=Canadian Academy Health Sciences|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to health research==
Schechter combines interests in clinical epidemiology and health services research with [[HIV/AIDS]] and urban health research including [[opioid addiction]] research. He is the author of more than 350 peer-reviewed publications and 530 abstracts and scholarly presentations.&lt;ref name= cash /&gt;

When Schechter first began his work on AIDS research in 1983, there were no reported cases yet in [[British Columbia]] and embracing the necessity of an appropriate and humane response to HIV infection was not a popular activity at that time.&lt;ref name=OBC&gt;{{cite web|title=1994 Recipient: Martin Schechter|url=http://www.orderofbc.gov.bc.ca/members/obc-1994/1994-martin-schechter/|work=Order of British Columbia|publisher=Government of British Columbia|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airing public service announcements about condoms in movie theatres caused a public and private debate between Schechter and then-[[Premier of British Columbia]] [[Bill Vander Zalm]].&lt;ref name=ubyssey&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Garricia|title=Research Supplement: The researchers behind the labcoat|url=http://ubyssey.ca/features/research-supplement-researchers485/|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=The Ubyssey|date=18 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had HIV not been such an emerging health crisis, Schechter likely would have continued in the field of [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name= ubyssey /&gt;

In 1989, he helped organize the [[International AIDS Society#Conferences|Fifth International Conference on AIDS]] in [[Montreal]] as a member of its steering committee. In 1990, he was invited by the [[World Health Organization]] to participate on its 10-member Steering Committee on Epidemiology, Forecasting and Surveillance&lt;ref name = OBC /&gt; that was monitoring the scale of the AIDS epidemic and advising on prevention programs in the early period of the epidemic.

Schechter co-founded the [[Canadian HIV Trials Network]] in 1990 with John Ruedy and [[Julio Montaner]].  Under Schechter's leadership as National Director from 1992-2014, the Network grew to become a nationwide collaboration of researchers, people living with [[HIV/AIDS]] and facilities to investigate treatments, preventions and vaccines for [[HIV/AIDS]].

In 1992, he co-founded and was a director of the [[British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS]]. He was also founding President of the [[Canadian Association for HIV Research]] in 1991.

In 1996, Schechter co-chaired the [[XI International AIDS Conference, 1996|XI International AIDS Conference]] in [[Vancouver]] which attracted 15,000 delegates from around the world. It was at this global conference that the benefits of triple-therapy [[HAART]] were first fully revealed.

In 2004, he co-founded the [[Canadian Academy of Health Sciences]], serving as its first President-Elect from 2004-2007 and second President from 2007-2009.

==Heroin trials==
Schechter was the principal investigator and co-authored a study published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine ]] about the controversial [[North American Opiate Medication Initiative]] (NAOMI). The 2005-2008 study compared the use of diacetylmorphine ([[heroin]]) and [[methadone]] in street addicts. In the NAOMI study, researchers selected 250 subjects in Vancouver and Montreal with at least five years of heroin addiction and who had twice previously not benefited from addiction treatment including methadone maintenance. Providing injections of medically prescribed heroin in a clinic setting was projected to save about $40,000 per person in lifetime societal costs compared to methadone.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|last=Ubelacker|first=Sheryl|title=Medically prescribed heroin more cost-effective than methadone, study suggests|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/03/12/medically_prescribed_heroin_more_costeffective_than_methadone_study_suggests.html|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found those receiving the effective element of heroin were 62 per cent more likely to remain in addiction treatment and 40 per cent less likely to take street drugs and commit crimes to support their habit than those given methadone.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite news|last=Paperny|first=Anna Mehler|title=Quebec's landmark heroin study in jeopardy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebecs-landmark-heroin-study-in-jeopardy/article4283353/|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=23 Aug 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Masculinity''' (also called '''manhood''' or '''manliness''') is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men.

==Overview==
Masculine qualities and roles are considered typical of, appropriate for, and expected of boys and men. The concept of masculinity varies historically and culturally; although the [[dandy]] was seen as a 19th-century ideal of masculinity, he is considered [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] by modern standards.&lt;ref name = "Reeser"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reeser | first = Todd W. | title = Masculinities in theory: an introduction | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4051-6859-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YMnn8Zf0heoC | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}} Masculine norms, as described in [[Ronald F. Levant]]'s ''Masculinity Reconstructed'', are "avoidance of [[femininity]]; restricted emotions; sex disconnected from intimacy; pursuit of achievement and status; self-reliance; [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[aggression]], and [[homophobia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levant |first1=Ronald F. |last2=Kopecky |first2=Gini |title=Masculinity reconstructed: changing the rules of manhood—at work, in relationships, and in family life | publisher = Dutton |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0452275416}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=February 2018}}{{Where|date=February 2018}} These norms reinforce [[gender role]]s by associating attributes and characteristics with one gender.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal | last = Dornan | first = Jennifer | title = Blood from the moon: gender ideology and the rise of ancient Maya social complexity | journal = [[Gender &amp; History]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 459&amp;ndash;475 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.0953-5233.2004.00348.x | date = August 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0953-5233.2004.00348.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic study of masculinity received increased attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the number of courses on the subject in the United States rising from 30 to over 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |last=Bradley |first=Rolla M. |date=2008|title=Masculinity and self perception of men identified as informal leaders |publisher= [[University of the Incarnate Word]] | url = https://athenaeum.uiw.edu/uiw_etds/190/|oclc=1004500685}} [https://search.proquest.com/openview/bb91cf3b301335a7d97da0d80aed98a6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y View online preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sparked investigation of the intersection of  masculinity with other axes of social discrimination and concepts from other fields, such as the [[social construction of gender difference]]&lt;ref name="Flood 2007 Viii"&gt;{{cite book | last = Flood | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Flood | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities |page=viii | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC | isbn = 9780415333436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (prevalent in a number of [[philosophical]] and [[sociological]] theories).

Both males and females can exhibit masculine traits and behavior. Those exhibiting both masculine and [[feminine]] characteristics are considered [[androgynous]], and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = [[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York London | year = 2006 | origyear = 1990 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Laurie | first = Timothy | title = The ethics of nobody I know: gender and the politics of description | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–78 | publisher = [[Emerald Group Publishing|Emerald]] | doi = 10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | date = 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/6262250/The_Ethics_of_Nobody_I_Know_Gender_and_the_Politics_of_Description Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since what constitutes masculinity has varied by time and place, according to [[Raewyn Connell]], it is more appropriate to discuss "masculinities" than a single overarching concept.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|185}} Study of the history of masculinity emerged during the 1980s, aided by the fields of women's and (later) gender history. Before women's history was examined, there was a "strict gendering of the public/private divide"; regarding masculinity, this meant little study of how men related to the household, domesticity and family life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tosh, John (1999), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Br8JCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Introduction: masculinity and domesticity]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Tosh | editor-first = John | title = A man's place: masculinity and the middle-class home in Victorian England |page=2 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780300077797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although women's historical role was negated, despite the writing of history by (and primarily about) men, a significant portion of the male experience was missing. This void was questioned during the late 1970s, when women's history began to analyze gender and women to deepen the female experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davis | first = Natalie Z. | title = "Women's history" in transition: the European case | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 83–103 | publisher = Feminist Studies, Inc. | doi = 10.2307/3177729 | jstor = 3177729  | date = Spring–Summer 1976 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/3177729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Scott's seminal article, calling for gender studies as an analytical concept to explore society, power and discourse, laid the foundation for this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Scott | first = Joan W. | title = Gender: a useful category of historical analysis | journal = [[The American Historical Review]] | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1075 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | jstor = 1864376 | date = December 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott, gender should be used in two ways: productive and produced. Productive gender examined its role in creating power relationships, and produced gender explored the use and change of gender throughout history. This has influenced the field of masculinity, as seen in Pierre Bourdieu's definition of masculinity: produced by society and culture, and reproduced in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bourdieu | first = Pierre | title = Masculine domination | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780745622651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A flurry of work in women's history led to a call for study of the male role (initially influenced by psychoanalysis) in society and emotional and interpersonal life. Connell wrote that these initial works were marked by a "high level of generality" in "broad surveys of cultural norms". The scholarship was aware of contemporary societal changes aiming to understand and evolve (or liberate) the male role in response to feminism.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|28}}John Tosh calls for a return to this aim for the history of masculinity to be useful, academically and in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Steedman, Carolyn (1992), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EzD4fdELEioC&amp;pg=PA614 Culture, cultural studies and the historians]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Grossberg | editor-first1 = Lawrence | editor-last2 = Nelson | editor-first2 = Cary | editor-last3 = Treichler | editor-first3 = Paula | title = Cultural studies | page = 617 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 9780415903455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Ancient}}Antiquity===
[[File:Odysseus sehnt sich nach Ithaka (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of Odysseus leaning on a ship|[[Odysseus]], hero of the ''Odyssey'']]
Ancient literature dates back to about 3000 BC, with explicit expectations for men in the form of laws and implied masculine ideals in myths of gods and heroes. In the [[Hebrew Bible]] of 1000 BC, King David of Israel told his son, "I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Bible Gateway passage: 1 Kings 2:2 - King James Version |url= https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+2:2&amp;version=KJV | website = biblegateway.com |publisher=Bible Gateway |access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after David's death. Throughout history, men have met exacting cultural standards. Kate Cooper wrote about ancient concepts of femininity, "Wherever a woman is mentioned a man's character is being judged – and along with it what he stands for."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Kate (1996), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19 Private lives, public meanings]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Cooper | editor-first = Kate | title = The virgin and the bride: idealized womanhood in late antiquity | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 | page = 19 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 9780674939509 | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' (about 1750 BC):
*Rule 3: "If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death."
*Rule 128: "If a man takes a woman to wife, but has no intercourse with her, this woman is no wife to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hammurabi | author-link = Hammurabi | others = L.W.

Scholars cite [[integrity]] and [[social equality|equality]] as masculine values in male-male relationships&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bassi | first = Karen | title = Acting like men: gender, drama, and nostalgia in Ancient Greece | journal = [[Classical Philology (journal)|Classical Philology]] | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–92 | publisher = [[Chicago University Press|Chicago Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/449528 | date = January 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/449528 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virility in male-female relationships. Legends of ancient heroes include the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The stories demonstrate qualities in the hero which inspire [[respect]], such as wisdom and courage: knowing things other men do not know and taking risks other men would not dare.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Medieval and Victorian eras ===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Beowulf, holding a sword, blocks a dragon's fire with his shield.|Beowulf fighting the dragon]]

[[Jeffrey Richards]] describes a European "medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richards | first = Jeffrey | title = From Christianity to Paganism: The New Middle Ages and the Values of 'Medieval' Masculinity | journal = Cultural Values | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–234 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14797589909367162 | date = 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14797589909367162 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courage, respect for women of all classes and generosity characterize the portrayal of men in literary history. The [[Anglo-Saxon]]s [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and [[Beowulf]] are examples of medieval masculine ideals. According to David Rosen, the traditional view of scholars (such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]) that ''Beowulf'' is a tale of medieval [[heroism]] overlooks the similarities between Beowulf and the monster Grendel. The masculinity exemplified by Beowulf "cut[s] men off from women, other men, passion and the household".&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, David (1993), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC&amp;pg=PA11 The armor of the man-monster in Beowulf]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Rosen | editor-first = David | title = The changing fictions of masculinity | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana | page = 11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC | isbn = 9780252063091 | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Victorian era, [[Victorian masculinity|masculinity]] underwent a transformation from traditional heroism. Scottish philosopher [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in 1831: "The old ideal of Manhood has grown obsolete, and the new is still invisible to us, and we grope after it in darkness, one clutching this phantom, another that; [[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Werterism]], [[Byron]]ism, even [[Beau Brummell|Brummelism]], each has its day".&lt;ref&gt;Adams, James Eli (1995), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f7gwHwyxZJ4C&amp;pg=PA1 Introduction]", in {{cite book |editor-last=Adams |editor-first=James Eli | title = Dandies and desert saints: styles of Victorian masculinity |page=1 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, New York | isbn = 9780801482083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boxing was professionalized in America and Europe in the 19th century, and emphasized the physical and confrontational aspects of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher David Thrasher, ''Fight Sports and American Masculinity: Salvation in Violence from 1607 to the Present'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Bare-knuckle fighting without gloves represented "the manly art" in 19th century America.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott J. Gorn, ''The Manly Art: Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in America'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Modern times}} Twentieth century to present ===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a traditional family consisted of the father as  [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]] and the mother as [[homemaker]]. Despite women's increasing participation in the paid labor force and contributions to family income, men's identities remained centered on their working lives and specifically their economic contributions. Central to adult men's identities is the provider role, as masculinity is often measured by the size of one's paycheck/economic contribution to the family.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, R. 1974. Measuring masculinity by the size of a paycheck. In: J. Pleck &amp; J. Sawyer (Eds.) ''Men and masculinity'' (pp. 96 – 100). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinity is also secured by denying any semblance of softness, emotion, femininity, or any characteristic associated with women and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C. J. (2012). ''Dude, you're a fag : masculinity and sexuality in high school.'' Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overwhelmingly, the construction of masculinity most valued in the latter part of the twentieth century to today is one that is independent, sexually assertive, and athletic, among other normative markers of manhood.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kaufman, ed. 1987.

There is some evidence of masculinities undergoing shifts in the contemporary social landscape. Characteristic of present-day masculinity is men's willingness to counter stereotypes. Regardless of age or nationality, men more frequently rank good health, a harmonious family life and a good relationship with their spouse or partner as important to their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=26 August 2008 |title=Research and insights from Indiana University |url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/tips/page/normal/8690.html |location= |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |access-date=13 March 2017}}

In many cultures, displaying characteristics not typical of one's gender may be a social problem. In [[sociology]], this labeling is known as [[gender role|gender assumptions]] and is part of [[socialization]] to meet the [[mores]] of a society. Non-standard behavior may be considered indicative of [[homosexuality]], despite the fact that gender expression, [[gender identity]] and [[sexual orientation]] are widely accepted as distinct concepts.&lt;ref name=nacua&gt;{{cite web  |title=Gender identity and expression issues at colleges and universities| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140323020027/http://www.nacua.org/nacuanet/visual/nacuanotessample.html | archive-date = 23 March 2014 |url= http://www.nacua.org/nacuanet/visual/nacuanotessample.html |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2007 |work=[[National Association of College and University Attorneys]] NACUAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=February 2018}}{{Where|date=February 2018}} When sexuality is defined in terms of object choice (as in early [[sexology]] studies), male homosexuality is interpreted as [[effeminacy]].&lt;ref name=chrysler&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | author-link = Associated Press | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081211035529/http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp | archive-date = 11 December 2008 |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp |title=Chrysler TV ad criticized for using gay stereotypes |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | publisher = Here Press |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social disapproval of excessive masculinity may be expressed as "machismo"&lt;ref name = "Britannica"/&gt; or by [[neologism]]s such as "[[testosterone poisoning]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Alda | first = Alan | author-link =Alan Alda | title = What every woman should know about men | url = http://asylumnation.com/asylum/_r/showthread/threadid_15480/index.html | work = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]] | location = New York | date = October 1975 | access-date = 6 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance of socialization and genetics in the development of masculinity is debated. Although [[social conditioning]] is believed to play a role, [[psychologist]]s and [[psychoanalysts]] such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] believed that aspects of "feminine" and "masculine" identity are [[subconscious]]ly present in all human males.{{efn|See [[innate bisexuality]] and [[anima and animus]] for more information.}}

The historical development of gender roles is addressed by [[behavioural genetics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human ecology]], [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. All human cultures seem to encourage gender roles in literature, costume and song; examples may include the epics of [[Homer]], the [[Hengist and Horsa]] tales and the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] commentaries of [[Confucius]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} More specialized treatments of masculinity may be found in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the [[Bushido|bushidō]] of ''[[Hagakure]]''.

===Nature versus nurture===
{{main|Nature versus nurture}}

The sources of [[gender identity]] are debated. Some believe that masculinity is linked to the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with [[human penis|male genitalia]].&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Proponents of this view argue that women can become men [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormonally]] and [[Sex reassignment surgery|physically]],&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} and many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Sara | title = Third wave feminist linguistics and the analysis of sexism | journal = Discourse Analysis Online | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | publisher = [[Sheffield Hallam University]] | date = 2003 | url = http://extra.shu.ac.uk/daol/articles/closed/2003/001/mills2003001-paper.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the nurture side of the debate, it is argued that masculinity does not have a single source. Although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form of masculinity, it does not create it.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|17–21}} Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

In contrast to earlier perspectives of the nature versus nurture debate, contemporary social scientists suggest masculinity to stem from both nature ''and'' nurture, as both biological predispositions and social factors intersect to give rise to masculine gender identities.&lt;ref name="footnote.co"&gt;''Fausto-Sterling, Anne. 2014. "Where Does Gender Come From?" Footnote.'' http://footnote.co/where-does-gender-come-from/&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars suggest that innate differences between the sexes are compounded and/or exaggerated by the influences of social factors.&lt;ref name="footnote.co"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, Amy S. 2012.

Ed. by H. Crowley and S. Himmelweit. Polity/Open University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social construction of masculinity===
Social scientists conceptualize masculinity (and femininity) as a performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Butler|Butler, Judith]] (2006) [1990]. ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]]''. New York London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinities"&gt;[[Raewyn Connell|Connell, R.W.]] (2005). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC ''Masculinities''] (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Candace, and Don H. Zimmerman. 1987. “Doing Gender.” ''Gender &amp; Society'' 1:125–151&lt;/ref&gt; Gender performances may not necessarily be intentional and people may not even be aware of the extent to which they are performing gender, as one outcome of lifelong gender socialization is the feeling that one's gender is "natural" or biologically-ordained.

The social construction of gender also conceptualizes gender as a continuum. Theorists suggest one is not simply masculine or feminine, but instead may display components of both masculinity and femininity to different degrees and in particular contexts.

Masculine performance varies over the life course, but also from one context to another. For instance, the sports world may elicit more traditionally normative masculinities in participants than would other settings.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A. 1992. ''Power at Play: Sports and the Problem of Masculinity''. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Men who exhibit a tough and aggressive masculinity on the sports field may display a softer masculinity in familial contexts. Masculinities vary by social class as well. Studies suggest working class constructions of masculinity to be more normative than are those from middle class men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Edward W. 2008. “Rednecks,” “Rutters,” and `Rithmetic: Social Class, Masculinity, and Schooling in a Rural Context." ''Gender &amp; Society'' 22 (6): 728-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Karin A. 1996. ''Puberty, Sexuality, and the Self: Boys and Girls at Adolescence''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; As these contexts and comparisons illustrate, theorists suggest a multiplicity of masculinities, not simply one single construction of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Masculinities"/&gt;

==Hegemonic masculinity==
{{Main|Hegemonic masculinity}}
[[Image:USMC-10881.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Two men wrestling in a gymnasium, watched by a group of uninformed soldiers|Contests of physical skill and strength appear in some form in many cultures. Here, two [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] compete in a wrestling match.]]
Traditional avenues for men to gain honor were providing for their families and exercising leadership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last= George | first = Annie | title = Reinventing honorable masculinity: discourses from a working-class Indian community | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 35&amp;ndash;52 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X04270379 |date= July 2006 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X04270379 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raewyn Connell]] has labeled traditional male roles and privileges [[hegemonic masculinity]], encouraged in men and discouraged in women: "Hegemonic masculinity can be defined as the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of [[patriarchy]], which guarantees the dominant position of men and the subordination of women".&lt;ref name="Connell_2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | date = 2005 | edition = 2nd | location = Cambridge | publisher = Polity  | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Connell (1987) placed emphasis on heterosexuality and its influence on the construction of gender. From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).&lt;ref&gt;Kostas, M.

==Precarious manhood==
Researchers have argued that the "precariousness" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82–86 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721411402669 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Precarious" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved. In many cultures, boys endure painful initiation rituals to become men. Manhood may also be lost, as when a man is derided for not "being a man". Researchers have found that men respond to threats to their manhood by engaging in stereotypically-masculine behaviors and beliefs, such as supporting hierarchy, espousing homophobic beliefs, supporting aggression and choosing physical tasks over intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vandello | first1 = Joseph A. | last2 = Bosson | first2 = Jennifer K. | last3 = Cohen | first3 = Dov | last4 = Burnaford | first4 = Rochelle M. | last5 = Weaver | first5 = Jonathan R. | title = Precarious manhood | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 1325–1339 | publisher = [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0012453 | date = December 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0012453 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Winegard and Geary wrote that the precariousness of manhood involves social status (prestige or dominance), and manhood may be more (or less) precarious due to the avenues men have for achieving status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Winegard | first1 = Bo M. | last2 = Winegard | first2 = Ben | last3 =  Geary | first3 = David C. | title = Eastwood’s brawn and Einstein’s brain: an evolutionary account of dominance, prestige, and precarious manhood | journal = [[Review of General Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–48 | publisher = [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0036594 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0036594 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who identify with creative pursuits, such as poetry or painting, may not experience manhood as precarious but may respond to threats to their intelligence or creativity. However, men who identify with traditionally-masculine pursuits (such as football or the military) may see masculinity as precarious. According to Winegard, Winegard, and Geary, this is functional; poetry and painting do not require traditionally-masculine traits, and attacks on those traits should not induce anxiety. {{Dubious|date=August 2015}} Football and the military require traditionally-masculine traits, such as pain tolerance, endurance, muscularity and courage, and attacks on those traits induce anxiety and may trigger retaliatory impulses and behavior. This suggests that nature-versus-nurture debates about masculinity may be simplistic. Although men evolved to pursue prestige and dominance (status), how they pursue status depends on their talents, traits and available possibilities. In modern societies, more avenues to status may exist than in traditional societies and this may mitigate the precariousness of manhood (or of traditional manhood); however, it will probably not mitigate the intensity of male-male competition.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Women who participate in sports, especially male-dominated sports, are sometimes derided as being masculine. Even though most sports emphasize stereotypically masculine qualities, such as strength, competition, and aggression, women who participate in sports are still expected to conform to strictly feminine gender norms. This is known as the "female/athlete paradox". Although traditional gender norms are gradually changing, female athletes, especially those that participate in male-dominated sports such as boxing, weight lifting, American football, ice hockey, and motor sports, are still often viewed as deviating from the boundaries of femininity and may suffer repercussions such as discrimination or mistreatment from administrators, harassment by fans, and decreased media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paloian|first1=Andrea|title=The Female/Athlete Paradox: Managing Traditional Views of Masculinity and Femininity|url=https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2012/fall/female|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence points to the negative impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5&amp;nbsp;million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from [[heart disease]]. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from [[cardiovascular disease]] than women, and are more likely to be diagnosed with a [[terminal illness]] because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Galdas | first1 = Paul M. | last2 = Cheater | first2 = Francine M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Paul | title = Men and health help-seeking behaviour: Literature review | journal = [[Journal of Advanced Nursing]] | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 616–623 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | pmid = 15737222 | date = March 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercials often focus on situations in which a man overcomes an obstacle in a group, working or playing hard (construction or farm workers or [[cowboy]]s). Those involving play have central themes of mastery (of nature or each other), risk and adventure: fishing, camping, playing sports or socializing in [[bar (establishment)|bars]]. There is usually an element of danger and a focus on movement and speed (watching fast cars or driving fast). The bar is a setting for the measurement of masculinity in skills such as [[billiards]], strength, and drinking ability.&lt;ref name="Strate et al 1992" /&gt; Men engage in positive health practices, such as reducing fat intake and alcohol, to conform to masculine ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Genevieve Creighton &amp; John L Oliffe (2010) Theorising masculinities and men’s health: A brief history with a view to practice, Health Sociology Review, 19:4, 413, DOI: 10.5172/hesr.2010.19.4.409&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}

==Effeminacy==
{{see also|Effeminacy#Gay men}}
Gay men are considered by some to "deviate from the masculine norm" and are [[benevolent prejudice|benevolently stereotyped]] as "gentle and refined", even by other gay men. According to gay human-rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to the well-intentioned claim that gays are "just the same" as straights, there is a difference. What is more, the distinctive style of gay masculinity is of great social benefit. Wouldn't life be dull without the flair and imagination of [[queer]] fashion designers and interior decorators? How could the NHS cope with no gay nurses, or the education system with no gay teachers? Society should thank its lucky stars that not all men turn out straight, macho and insensitive. The different hetero and homo modes of maleness are not, of course, biologically fixed.&lt;ref name=Tatchell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tatchell|first1=Peter| author-link =Peter Tatchell|title=What straight men could learn from gay men - a queer kind of masculinity?|work=The Scavenger|url=http://www.thescavenger.net/glbtiq-sp-1239/glbtiq/170-what-straight-men-can-learn-from-gay-men-6789.html|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psychologist Joseph Pleck argues that a hierarchy of masculinity exists largely as a [[dichotomy]] of homosexual and heterosexual males: "Our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are "real men" and have power, and males who are not".&lt;ref name=nomas.org&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleck|first=Joseph|title=Understanding patriarchy and men's power|url=http://nomas.org/understanding-patriarchy-and-mens-power/ | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) |accessdate=11 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Kimmel]] adds that the [[Trope (literature)|trope]] "You're so gay" indicates a lack of masculinity, rather than homosexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Kimmel | first1 = Michael S. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Summer | author-link1 = Michael Kimmel | title = Mars and Venus, Or, Planet Earth?: Women and Men in a New Millenium [sic] | publisher = Kansas State University | format = DVD | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57227710 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pleck, to avoid male oppression of women, themselves and other men, [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures, institutions and discourse must be eliminated from Western society.

In the documentary ''The Butch Factor'', gay men (one of them [[transgender]]) were asked about their views of masculinity. Masculine traits were generally seen as an advantage in and out of the [[closeted|closet]], allowing "butch" gay men to conceal their [[sexual orientation]] longer while engaged in masculine activities such as sports. [[Effeminacy]] is inaccurately&lt;ref name=nacua/&gt; associated with [[homosexuality]],&lt;ref name=chrysler/&gt; and some gay men doubted their sexual orientation; they did not see themselves as effeminate, and felt little connection to [[LGBT culture|gay culture]].&lt;ref name=ifbutscoconuts&gt;{{cite web|author1=ifsbutscoconuts|title=The butch factor: masculinity from a gay male perspective (blog)|url=http://ifsbutscoconuts.kinja.com/the-butch-factor-masculinity-from-a-gay-male-perspect-1549893361 | date = 23 March 2014|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some effeminate gay men in ''The Butch Factor'' felt uncomfortable about their femininity (despite being comfortable with their sexuality),&lt;ref name="Feminine Gay Man Strength"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Curry|first1=Tyler|title=The strength in being a feminine gay man |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tyler-curry/the-strength-in-being-a-feminine-gay-man_b_3896302.html| work = [[The Huffington Post]]|date = 1 October 2013|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and feminine gay men may be derided by stereotypically-masculine gays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Darianna |title=Why do masculine gay guys look down on feminine guys? |url=http://www.queerty.com/why-do-masculine-gay-guys-look-down-on-feminine-guys-20140707 |work=Queerty |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;br&gt;See also: {{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Darianna |title=An open letter to gay guys who look down on 'Fem Guys' |url=https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/open-letter-gay-guys-fem-guys-jvinc/ |work=The Good Men Project |date=9 July 2014 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminine-looking men tended to [[Coming out|come out]] earlier after being labeled gay by their peers. More likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives,&lt;ref name=ifbutscoconuts/&gt; they are taunted by derogatory words (such as "[[sissy]]") implying feminine qualities. Effeminate, "[[camp (style)|campy]]" gay men sometimes use what John R. Ballew called "camp humor", such as referring to one another by [[she|female pronouns]] (according to Ballew, "a funny way of defusing hate directed toward us [gay men]"); however, such humor "can cause us [gay men] to become confused in relation to how we feel about being men".&lt;ref name="Gay men and masculinity"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Ballew | first = John R. |title=Gay men and masculinity (blog) |url=http://bodymindsoul.org/articles/gay-sexuality/gay-men-and-masculinity/ | website = bodymindsoul.org | publisher = John R.

A study by the Center for Theoretical Study at [[Charles University in Prague]] and the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] found significant differences in shape among the faces of heterosexual and gay men, with gay men having more "stereotypically masculine" features ("undermin[ing] stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Saul |first = Heather | title = Gay and straight men may have different facial shapes, new study suggests | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/gay-and-straight-men-may-have-different-facial-shapes-new-study-suggests-8928519.html |accessdate=6 March 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=8 November 2013|quote=Their results found that homosexual men were rated as more stereotypically 'masculine' than heterosexual men, which they said undermined stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave]] [[pro-feminism]] paid greater attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and [[hegemonic masculinity]]. This shift led to increased cooperation between the [[Men's liberation movement|men's liberation]] and [[gay liberation]] movements developing, in part, because masculinity was understood as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and in response to the universalization of "men" in previous men's movements. Men's-rights activists worked to stop second-wave feminists from influencing the gay-rights movement, promoting [[hypermasculinity]] as inherent to gay sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jeffreys | first = Sheila | author-link = Sheila Jeffreys | title = Unpacking queer politics: a lesbian feminist perspective | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780745628387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Two concerns over the study of the history of masculinity are that it would stabilize the historical process (rather than change it) and that a cultural overemphasis on the approach to masculinity lacks the reality of actual experience. According to John Tosh, masculinity has become a conceptual framework used by historians to enhance their cultural explorations instead of a specialty in its own right.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tosh, John (2011), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0E5ARiVe9YUC&amp;pg=PA17 The history of masculinity: an outdated concept?]", in {{cite book |editor-last1= Arnold |editor-first1= John H. |editor-last2= Brady |editor-first2= Sean | title = What is masculinity?: historical dynamics from antiquity to the contemporary world | pages = 17&amp;ndash;34 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781137305602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This draws attention from reality to representation and meaning, not only in the realm of masculinity; culture was becoming "the bottom line, the real historical reality".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tosh critiques Martin Francis' work of in this light because popular culture, rather than the experience of family life, is the basis for Francis' argument.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Francis | first = Martin | title = A flight from commitment? Domesticity, adventure and the masculine imaginary in Britain after the Second World War | journal = [[Gender &amp; History]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–185 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | date = April 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis uses contemporary literature and film to demonstrate that masculinity was restless, shying away from domesticity and commitment, during the late 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Francis wrote that this flight from commitment was "most likely to take place at the level of fantasy (individual and collective)". In focusing on culture, it is difficult to gauge the degree to which films such as ''[[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|Scott of the Antarctic]]'' represented the era’s masculine fantasies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Michael Roper’s call to focus on the subjectivity of masculinity addresses this cultural bias, because broad understanding is set aside for an examination "of what the relationship of the codes of masculinity is to actual men, to existential matters, to persons and to their psychic make-up" (Tosh's human experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Roper|first = Michael | title = Slipping out of view: subjectivity and emotion in gender history | journal = [[History Workshop Journal]] | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–72 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | date = March 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tosh, the culture of masculinity has outlived its usefulness because it cannot fulfill the initial aim of this history (to discover how manhood was conditioned and experienced) and he urged "questions of behaviour and agency".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His work on Victorian masculinity uses individual experience in letters and sketches to illustrate broader cultural and social customs, such as birthing or Christmas traditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Stefan Dudink believes that the methodological approach (trying to categorize masculinity as a phenomenon) undermined its [[Historiography|historiographic]] development.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink |first = Stefan | title = The trouble with men: Problems in the history of 'masculinity' | journal = [[European Journal of Cultural Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–431 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/136754949800100307 | date = September 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/136754949800100307 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abigail Solomou-Godeau’s work on post-revolutionary French art addresses a strong, constant patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Solomon-Godeau | first = Abigail | title = Male trouble: a crisis in representation | publisher = Thames and Hudson | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780500280379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tosh’s overall assessment is that a shift is needed in conceptualizing the topic&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; back to the history of masculinity as a speciality aiming to reach a broader audience, rather than as an analytical tool of cultural and social history. The importance he places on public history hearkens back to the initial aims of gender history, which sought to use history to enlighten and change the present. Tosh appeals to historians to live up to the "social expectation" of their work,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which would also require a greater focus on subjectivity and masculinity. This view is contrary to Dudink’s; the latter called for an "outflanking movement" towards the history of masculinity, in response to the errors he perceived in the study.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This would do the opposite of what Tosh called for, deconstructing masculinity by not placing it at the center of historical exploration and using discourse and culture as indirect avenues towards a more-representational approach. In a study of the [[Low Countries]], Dudink proposes moving beyond the history of masculinity by embedding analysis into the exploration of nation and nationalism (making masculinity a lens through which to view conflict and nation-building).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink|first = Stefan | title = Multipurpose masculinities: gender and power in low countries histories of masculinity | journal = [[BMGN: Low Countries Historical Review]] | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–18 | publisher = Royal Netherlands Historical Society | doi = 10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | date = March 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Francis' work on domesticity through a cultural lens moves beyond the history of masculinity because "men constantly travelled back and forward across the frontier of domesticity, if only in the realm of the imagination"; normative codes of behavior do not fully encompass the male experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Media images of boys and young men may lead to the persistence of harmful concepts of masculinity. According to men's-rights activists, the media does not address men's-rights issues and men are often portrayed negatively in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Farrell | first1 = Warren | last2 = Sterba | first2 = James P. | author-link1 = Warren Farrell | title = Does feminism discriminate against men? | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195312829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jackson called hegemonic masculinity "economically exploitative" and "socially oppressive": "The form of oppression varies from patriarchal controls over women's bodies and reproductive rights, through ideologies of domesticity, femininity and compulsory heterosexuality, to social definitions of the value of work, the nature of skill and the differential remuneration of 'productive' and 'reproductive' labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Jackson | first = Peter | title = The cultural politics of masculinity: towards a social geography | journal = [[Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–213 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.2307/622614 | jstor = 622614 | date = April 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/622614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological research===
According to a paper submitted by Tracy Tylka to the [[American Psychological Association]], "Instead of seeing a decrease in [[objectification]] of women in society, there has just been an increase in the objectification of both sexes. And you can see that in the media today." Men and women restrict food intake in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively-thin body; in extreme cases, this leads to [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grabmeier | first = Jeff | title = Pressure to be more muscular may lead men to unhealthy behaviors | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080618040952/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/maleobj.htm | archive-date = 18 June 2008 | url = http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/maleobj.htm | publisher = [[Ohio State University]] | date = 10 August 2006 | access-date = 29 July 2008 }}

In 1987 Eisler and Skidmore studied masculinity, creating the idea of "masculine stress" and finding three elements of masculinity which often result in emotional stress:
* The emphasis on prevailing in situations requiring body and fitness
* Being perceived as emotional
* The need for adequacy in sexual matters and financial status

Because of social norms and pressures associated with masculinity, men with spinal-cord injuries must adapt their self-identity to the losses associated with such injuries; this may "lead to feelings of decreased physical and sexual prowess with lowered self-esteem and a loss of male identity. Feelings of guilt and overall loss of control are also experienced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hutchinson | first1 = Susan L. | last2 = Kleiber | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Heroic masculinity following spinal cord injury: Implications for therapeutic recreation practice and research | journal = Therapeutic Recreation Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | publisher = Sagamore Journals | date = January 2000 | url = http://js.sagamorepub.com/trj/article/view/1110 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising.

In their book ''Raising Cain: Protecting The Emotional Life of Boys'', [[Dan Kindlon]] and Michael Thompson wrote that although all boys are born loving and empathic, exposure to gender socialization (the tough male ideal and [[hypermasculinity]]) limits their ability to function as emotionally-healthy adults. According to Kindlon and Thompson, boys lack the ability to understand and express emotions productively because of the stress imposed by masculine gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kindlon | first1 = Dan | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Michael | contribution = The road not taken: turning boys away from their inner life | editor-last1 = Kindlon | editor-first1 = Dan | editor-last2 = Thompson | editor-first2 = Michael | title = Raising Cain: protecting the emotional life of boys | pages = 1–20 | publisher = Ballantine Books | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780345434852 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Notion of "masculinity in crisis"}}"Masculinity in crisis"===
A theory of "masculinity in crisis" has emerged;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horrocks|first=Rooger|title=Masculinities in Crisis: Myths, Fantasies, and Realities|year=1994|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=0333593227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k24dAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Marked Men: White Masculinity in Crisis |last= Robinson |first= Sally |authorlink= |year= 2000 |publisher= [[Columbia University Press]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-231-50036-4 |page= 5 |pages= |accessdate= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian archeologist Peter McAllister said, "I have a strong feeling that masculinity is in crisis. Men are really searching for a role in modern society; the things we used to do aren't in much demand anymore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers| first = Thomas| title = The dramatic decline of the modern man|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/11/14/manthropology_interview/singleton/|newspaper = [[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date = November 14, 2010|accessdate = June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others see the changing labor market as a source of stress. [[Deindustrialization]] and the replacement of [[Smokestack industry|smokestack industries]] by technology have allowed more women to enter the labor force, reducing its emphasis on physical strength.&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002"&gt;{{citation | last = Beynon| first = John | contribution = Masculinities and the notion of 'crisis' | editor-last = Beynon| editor-first = John | title = Masculinities and culture | pages = 75–97 | publisher = Open University Press | location = Philadelphia| year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-335-19988-4 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86–89}}

The crisis has also been attributed to the questioning of male dominance and rights granted to men solely on the basis of sex following the [[feminist movement]].&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt;{{rp|83–86}} British sociologist John MacInnes wrote that "masculinity has always been in one crisis or another", suggesting that the crises arise from the "fundamental incompatibility between the core principle of modernity that all human beings are essentially equal (regardless of their sex) and the core tenet of patriarchy that men are naturally superior to women and thus destined to rule over them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacInnes | first = John | authorlink = | title = The end of masculinity: the confusion of sexual genesis and sexual difference in modern society | year = 1998 | publisher = Open University Press | location = Philadelphia | page = 11 | isbn = 978-0-335-19659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Beynon, masculinity and men are often conflated and it is unclear whether masculinity, men or both are in crisis.  He writes that the "crisis" is not a recent phenomenon, illustrating several periods of masculine crisis throughout history (some predating the women's movement and [[post-industrial society]]), suggesting that due to masculinity's fluid nature "crisis is constitutive of masculinity itself".&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt; Film scholar [[Leon Hunt]] also writes: "Whenever masculinity's 'crisis' actually started, it certainly seems to have been in place by the 1970s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Leon | year = 1998 | title = British low culture: from safari suits to sexploitation | publisher = Routledge | location = London, New York | page = 73 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3dvtQEetWrsC&amp;pg=PA73 | isbn = 978-0-415-15182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asian cultures===
{{main|Herbivore men}}
In 2008, the word "herbivore men" became popular in Japan and was reported worldwide. Herbivore men refers to young Japanese men who naturally detach themselves from masculinity. [[Masahiro Morioka]] characterizes them as men 1) having gentle nature, 2) not bound by manliness, 3) not aggressive when it comes to romance, 4) viewing women as equals, and 5) hating emotional pain. Herbivore men are severely criticized by men who love masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Morioka | first = Masahiro | title = A phenomenological study of "Herbivore Men" | journal = The Review of Life Studies | volume = 4 | pages = 1–20 | date = September 2013 | url = http://www.lifestudies.org/press/review.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.lifestudies.org/press/rls0401.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Martin completed a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in 1956 at [[Arizona State University]]. He was awarded an MA in philosophy at the [[University of Arizona]] in 1958 and in 1962 he was awarded a PhD in philosophy from [[Harvard University]]. He was appointed Assistant Professor at [[University of Colorado]] in 1962 and in 1965 he moved to [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name="cfinews"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/michael_l._martin_philosopher_and_author_19322015/|title=Center for Inquiry News: Michael L.

He is the author or editor of a number of books, including ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (1989), ''The Case Against Christianity'' (1991), ''Atheism, Morality, and Meaning'' (2002), ''The Impossibility of God'' (2003), ''The Improbability of God'' (2006), and ''The Cambridge Companion to Atheism'' (2006). He sat on the editorial board of the philosophy journal, ''[[Philo (journal)|Philo]]'' and wrote many reviews and articles for journals and magazines including ''Free Inquiry''.&lt;ref name="cfinews" /&gt;

==Atheism==
In his ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'', Martin cites a general absence of an atheistic response to contemporary work in philosophy of religion, and accepts the responsibility of a rigorous defense of non belief as his "cross to bear:"

&lt;blockquote&gt;The aim of this book is not to make atheism a popular belief or even to overcome its invisibility.  My object is not utopian.  It is merely to provide good reasons for being an atheist. … My object is to show that atheism is a rational position and that belief in God is not.  I am quite aware that atheistic beliefs are not always based on reason.  My claim is that they should be.&lt;ref&gt;''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Martin used the concepts of [[negative and positive atheism]] as proposed by [[Antony Flew]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The presumption of atheism and other philosophical essays on God, freedom, and immortality|last=Flew|first=Anthony|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|year=1976|isbn=978-0064921190|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the terms weak or soft atheism (negative) and strong or hard atheism (positive).

Martin was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Paul Rhodes; Boyd, Gregory A. (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. Baker Academic. p. 166. {{ISBN|978-0801031144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates ==
Martin took part in a number of written and internet debates with Christian philosophers.
* In 1991 Martin and Keith Parsons (founder of Georgia Skeptics and teacher of philosophy at Berry College (Rome, Georgia)) provided atheistic critiques to Douglas Jones' propositions on The Futility of Non Christian Thought in  a written debate, ''Is Non-Christian Thought Justifiable?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/apologetics/index.html?mainframe=/apologetics/jones_martin.html|title=Reformed Apologetics|website=www.reformed.org|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/webfiles/antithesis/index.html|title=Antithesis at Reformed.org|website=www.reformed.org|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in ''Antithesis'' magazine.

'''Monica Kristina Ingeborg Törnell''', (born June 3, 1954 in [[:sv:Trönö|Trönö]], [[Hälsingland]], [[Gävleborg County]], [[Sweden]]) is a Swedish [[Singing|singer]] and [[songwriter]]. After being discovered by [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]] 1971, she was a prominent singer in several genres, mainly [[Folk music|folk]] and [[rock music]], for over two decades. Together with [[Lasse Holm]], she represented Sweden in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986]] in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]]. She is the mother of [[:sv:Tobias Törnell|Tobias]] (born in 1973) and Mattias Törnell (born in 1980).

== Biography ==

=== Childhood ===
Monica Törnell lived her first years in Trönö (in the [[:sv:Norrala|Norrala]] municipality), but she later moved with her family to [[Söderhamn]].&lt;ref name="ka"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sjölander|first=Ann-Christin|year=1986|title=Monica Törnell en fri själ i nöjesvärlden: 'Ta mig så'n jag är'|periodical=[[:sv:Kommunalarbetaren|Kommunalarbetaren]]|issue=25|pages=24–25|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this city, she started to visit Folkets Park, where she heard artists such as [[Lill-Babs]], [[Jerry Williams (singer)|Jerry Williams]], and many others.&lt;ref name="s&amp;s"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Larsson|first=Tomas|year=1986|title=Monica Törnell: Sångerskan som väljer sina egna vägar|periodical=[[:sv:Scen &amp; Salong|Scen &amp; Salong]]|issue=4/5|pages=20–21|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early in her life, Törnell had her public debut before audience of 700 people at the 1962 [[Ericsson]] [[Christmas]] party in Söderhamn, where her father Jöns Törnell was an employee.&lt;ref name="skd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jag bär på en hemlig dröm - att få filma och skriva|last=Svensson|first=Håkan|date=1987-01-08|work=[[:sv:Skånska Dagbladet|Skånska Dagbladet]]|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
followed by a series of performances in public parks at home.&lt;ref name="ritz"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Månson|first=Per|year=1984|title=Jag är som jag är|periodical=[[:sv:Musikmagasinet Ritz|Musikmagasinet Ritz]]|issue=7|pages =67–68|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She was  also good at drawing, and in 1965, she became one of five first-prize winners in the drawing competition "Ung Fantasi" (Young Fantasy), in which 1500 schoolchildren took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mårtensgård|first=Lasse|author-link=:sv:Lasse Mårtensgård|pages=42|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In her early teens she played [[fiddle]] and sang both solo and in [[choir]]. In the late 1960s she was in the singing groups ''He, She and You'' and ''TJI''. These groups consisted only of guitars and bass and sang mostly [[American folk music]].&lt;ref name="ritz" /&gt; On 20 February 1971, she won a vocalist contest in society [[Ljusne]], [[Söderhamn Municipality]], where she sang the song ''[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monicatornell.se/Summertime_16.html|title=Monica - Summertime|last=Törnell|first=Monica|work=Monica Törnell|language=Swedish|accessdate=2008-07-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery ===
In 1971, Törnell sang at the opening of the local restaurant in Söderhamn that her father then opened along with a friend. At the same time, [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]] was across the street, which led to him discovering Törnell,&lt;ref name="skd" /&gt; although she was already relatively well known in the area.&lt;ref name="ritz" /&gt; After meeting Vreeswijk, she quit as a photography student, which she had been for seven months after [[primary school]].&lt;ref name="ka" /&gt; During the latter part of 1971 and beginning of 1972 she made a major tour in both [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lahger|first=Håkan|author2=Micke Berg|year=1977|title=Monica Törnell: Jag har jobbat som fan och fått kämpa ensam...|journal=Musikens makt|issue=11/12|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
together with Vreeswijk. Other musicians on the tour were [[Björn J:son Lindh]], [[Palle Danielsson]], [[:sv:Kenny Håkansson|Kenny Håkansson]], [[:sv:Björn Ståbi|Björn Ståbi]] and [[:sv:Pers Hans Olsson|Pers Hans Olsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennyhakansson.se/kebne/kebnekajse.htm |title=Kebnekajse 2002 |last=Håkansson |first=Kenny |work=Kenny Håkansson |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010033727/http://www.kennyhakansson.se/kebne/kebnekajse.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cornelis arranged a demo, which he presented to [[:sv:Göte Wilhelmson|Göte Wilhelmson]] for his new record company [[Phonogram Records]]. She was offered a recording contract for a single, but turned it down because she wanted to do an [[LP album]],&lt;ref name="ritz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mm"/&gt; which she did later in 1972. At the beginning of Törnell's time in the chaotic world of entertainment, Cornelis and his former wife Bim Warne gave her significant guidance.&lt;ref name="s&amp;s"/&gt; She also appeared on the television programmes ''[[:sv:Halvsju|Halvsju]]'' and ''Strapetz'', and thus reached a wider audience.

Her real breakthrough came on 10 July 1972 at [[:sv:Visfestivalen i Västervik|Visfestivalen]] in [[Västervik]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:På ruinens brant|På ruinens brant]] p.18&lt;/ref&gt;
The same year she made her record debut with a [[folk music]] inspired LP, [[:sv:Ingica|Ingica]], which was issued by Phonogram with the label of [[Philips Records]]. Other musicians on the disk were Björn J:son Lindh, [[Janne Schaffer]], and Vreeswijk himself. She also sang a duet with Cornelis in the song ''Jenny Jansson'' on his 1972 album ''Visor, svarta och röda'', and a duet with [[:sv:Ola Magnell|Ola Magnell]] in the song, ''Man ska vara två'' from his first LP, ''Påtalåtar'' (published in 1974). She continued in the same style in their second LP, [[:sv:Alrik (musikalbum)|Alrik]] (1973), which was also a success. Both of her first albums were produced by Lill-Babs's brother [[:sv:Lasse Svensson|Lasse Svensson]], a former drummer in the bands [[Tages (band)|Tages]] and [[:sv:Blond (musikgrupp I)|Blond]]. That same year, she made a number of appearances with [[Tomas Ledin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomasledin.com/arforar.php?decade=1970&amp;id=14 |title=Tomas Ledin |last=Ledin |first=Tomas |work=Tomas Ledin |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207215910/http://tomasledin.com/arforar.php?decade=1970&amp;id=14 |archivedate=February 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also sang the [[leitmotif]] to [[Per Oscarsson]]'s controversial film [[Ebon Lundin]] (1973) along with [[:sv:Arne Olsson (musiker)|Arne Olsson]]'s [[big band]] ''Vieux Carré''.

=== 1975–79 ===
In the mid-1970s, Törnell oriented herself against rock, and toured for some time with her own band consisting of Henrik "Hempo" Hildén (from the [[jazz fusion]] group [[:sv:Splash (musikgrupp)|Splash]]) on [[drum]]s, Per Sydén on [[bass guitar]], and her brother, Bobo Törnell on [[guitar]]. In 1975 came the English-language album ''[[:sv:Don't Give a Damn|Don't Give a Damn]]'', which was produced by Björn J:son Lindh. Several members of Splash were involved with the album. Bobo was involved with some of Monica's later albums, both as a guitarist and songwriter. The album was a kind of revolt against the image of her as folksinger. During the [[Progg]] movement, it was controversial for a Swedish artist to sing in English. She is often associated with this movement, but rarely sung in a progressive context, since she belonged to a commercial record company. However, she was critical of the movement, and said in 1977 that she hoped that Progg was the beginning of moving forward, instead of being simplistic, and music would be more open.&lt;ref name="mm" /&gt; The media compared her voice to that of [[Melanie Safka]] and [[Janis Joplin]], but she said that the French [[Chanson]] had been her inspiration. In 1977, Törnell released another English-language album, [[Bush Lady]], recorded in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and produced by the American [[jazz]] [[trumpet]]er Stephen Franckevich; however, this album was no more successful.

In October 1977, she participated in the [[feminism|feminist]] [[:sv:Kvinnokulturfestivalen|Kvinnokulturfestivalen]] at the [[Riksdag building]] in [[Stockholm]], arranged by, among others, [[:sv:Suzanne Osten|Suzanne Osten]]. She had more successes in 1978 when she returned to the Swedish language and, together with the group ''New Band'' (with several members of the band [[:sv:Östan Sol, Västan Måne|Östan Sol, Västan Måne]]) published the LPs [[:sv:Jag är som jag är...|Jag är som jag är...]] (I am who I am...), produced by Björn J: son Lindh. This album included the song ''En kungens man'', written by [[Björn Afzelius]] in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjornafzelius.com/tekster/en_kungens_man.htm |title=En kungens man |last=Afzelius |first=Björn |work=Björn Afzelius |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621080400/http://www.bjornafzelius.com/tekster/en_kungens_man.htm |archivedate=June 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the song ''Kavaljersvisa från Värmland'', which became a huge success. The newspaper [[Dagens Nyheter]] awarded her with the ''Kasper Prize'' for this album, and in July of the same year she sang again at Visfestivalen in Västervik. Like a number of other artists, she supported option 3 of the [[:sv:Folkomröstningen om kärnkraften]] (Referendum on nuclear power) and participated in a 1979 compilation titled ''[[:sv:Nej till kärnkraft!]]'' (''No to nuclear power!'') with the song ''[[We Will All Go Together When We Go]]'' by [[Tom Lehrer]]. The same year, she also produced her own album, ''[[:sv:Ingica Mångrind|Ingica Mångrind]]'', together with the New Band and mainly in English.

=== 1980s ===
In the early 1980s, Törnell returned to rock music and began to increasingly write her own songs. With the album ''Ängel'' (1982) began a long collaboration with the producer Ulf Wahlberg, who also played keyboard in the band [[Secret Service (band)|Secret Service]]. The same year she also participated in a couple of songs on the album ''Z'' with, among others, Mats Zetterberg, known from the bands [[Fiendens musik]] and Bluesblocket from [[Lund]] in southern Sweden. In addition to the rock music she showed on a 1983 album with trumpeter Weine Renliden that she also has great potential as jazz vocalist.
 
In 1984 came Törnell LP ''Mica'', which in addition to the hit song ''[[Vintersaga]]'' by Ted Ström, also included her own songs ''Heden'' and ''Känslan i maj'', which was very successful (the latter came in 1989 also in the instrumental version of [[Putte Wickman]] and Ivan Renliden). She had then changed to the record company Air Music, led by Sture Borgedahl, and was in the mid-1980s along with [[Adolphson-Falk]] one of that company's most important artists. [12] She also participated in a couple of songs on Ströms own albums in the middle of the 1980s. In 1984 came a new album, ''Fri'', including for example the title track ''Fri'', written by Monica herself, and ''Nio liv''. In 1985 she also sang the song ''Hav utan hamn'' of Lasse Wellander's album ''Full hand'' and a duet with [[Per Gessle]] in the song ''Rickie Lee'' on his solo album ''Scener''. She also participated in the [[African National Congress|ANC]] Gala at [[Scandinavium]] in [[Gothenburg]] at the end of November the same year. [13]
 
In 1986 she made along with [[Lasse Holm]] song ''[[E' de' det här du kallar kärlek?]]'' (written by Holm), which became the winner of the Swedish [[Melodifestivalen]] and came in fifth place in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. To participate in this competition was not entirely uncontroversial, in view of her previous connection to the [[progg]] movement. She had, moreover, 1977 described Melodifestivalen as "this damned pop competition." [7] Holm had get into touch with Törnell when he 1985 was one of the producers of the album by Lasse Wellander as Törnell then participated in [2].
 
The same year also came album ''Big Mama'', in which even [[Steve Marriott]] (from [[The Small Faces]] and [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]) participated as guest artist. This album was produced by mainly [[Janne Schaffer]] and Törnell herself. She became involved in this time of Kjell Alinge's radio show Eldorado, with songs that ''I can see you'' by [[Don Henley]] and [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] with Swedish text by Peter R. Ericson (1987). The following year she sang three songs on a tribute album to [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]], ''Den flygande holländaren'', including her interpretation of Vreeswijk's song ''Ågren''. She released two further own albums in the 1980s, now back with Ulf Wahlberg as producer, ''Månfred'' (1988), including the successful song ''Vind skall komma'', and ''Vive la Mystique'' (1989). During the latter part of the 1980s, she made four appearances on Visfestivalen in Västervik, 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989. From the mid-1980s, however, she had begun to have health problems, which later came to influence her career negative [14].

=== In recent years ===
During the 1990s, became her state of health as well as her recordings and scene performances significantly fewer. From that time, she has mainly been active as a visual artist and has exhibited oil paintings, including in Söderhamn and [[Sundsvall]]. In 1992, however, she released a CD with songs by Lennart Hellsing. These were set to music by Klas Widén and [[Georg Riedel (Swedish jazz musician)|Georg Riedel]]. The same year she also participated in an album with the band Twang from [[Gävle]]. She also made new appearances on Visfestivalen in Västervik 1991 and 1994. In 1997, she worked as an actor in the role of the woman weaver in Hans Klinga's stage-setting of [[Astrid Lindgren]]'s ''[[Mio, My Son]]'' at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in Stockholm. [15] The following year she appeared in the television programme ''Livslust'' and told me about his illness and the diagnosis established only after ten years, [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]. [14] In October 1999 she sang again for the audience at a charity gala in Gävle Concert Hall. [16] The same year she also participated with the song ''Pilträd gråt för mig'' (Willow, Weep for Me, [[Ann Ronell]]-Fjellström / Bourne) on a tribute album to the then recently deceased guitarist Jan-Eric "Fjellis" Fjellström.

In 2001 she sang at the Cornelis Day on Mosebacke Etablissement in Stockholm along with jazz musician Thomas Jutterström from Söderhamn. [17] In 2004, she participated along with the British rock band [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] on the compilation album ''Rendezvous'' with ''I'm So Happy'', a previously unreleased song that she herself wrote in the early 1980s. She has in recent years also made a number of appearances, including during the Söderhamn Days, along with the cover band Rocktools from Söderhamn. In January 2005 she sang at a charity gala for the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which was held in Gävle Concert Hall. [18] The same year she sang duet with Thorsten Flinck in the song ''Här och nu'' (by Björn Afzelius) on the album ''Vildvuxna rosor''. In 2007 she sang the song ''When I Paint My Masterpiece'' on the compilation album ''Whatever Colors You Have in Your Mind'', a tribute to [[Bob Dylan]]. She has also (along with Björn Ståbi, Freddie Wadling, Karin Wistrand and others) participated in the music project Mother, which is led by the former [[punk rock]] musician Per Forsgren from Gävle and has resulted in the album ''LP'' (2008). Continuing health problems have, however, have so far been an obstacle for a comeback on a larger scale. [19]

'''Nicholas Victor Leslie Henson''' (born 12 May 1945) is an English actor who has portrayed many roles since 1963. He joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1977.

'''Nour El-Khoury''' (June 7, 1960 – 1998) was a [[Maronite]] Christian [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] woman. During the [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanese war in the 1980s]], wounds appeared on the back of Nour’s hands and pieces of incense started to come out, accompanied by oil exuding, apparitions and messages from The Holy.

Her sociopolitical phenomenon got local and international media coverage, among which the local Maronite Christian media.

Six years after her death, on December 16, 2004, the smell of incense came out from her dress that was worn by her niece for a dress-up party, this was also covered by the Lebanese Christian Media.

}}
American commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] regularly expresses his points of view on a wide variety of political, social, and moral issues. He has personally labeled his [[political philosophy]] ''[[traditional conservatism|traditionalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2465303&amp;page=1 '' Bill O'Reilly Calls Himself T-Warrior]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]],'' since its inception on the [[Fox News Channel]] in 1996, has been the primary outlet of his opinions.  O'Reilly started his own radio program, ''[[The Radio Factor]]'', a few years later.  He has also written several non-fiction books detailing some of his beliefs. O'Reilly generally leans to the right on most issues,{{citation needed|reason=questionable statement with no valid supporting reference|date=July 2015}} most notably the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush]] administration's [[War on Terror]], but breaks from the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority on such issues as the [[global warming controversy]], [[gun control]], [[gay marriage]] and the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]].

== Political views ==

=== Political affiliation ===
On ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and on his former talk-radio program, Bill O'Reilly has focused on news and commentary related to politics and culture.&lt;ref name="sandiego"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20040210-0550-campaign-bush-oreilly.html|title=Conservative U.S. anchor now skeptical about Bush|accessdate=April 4, 2009 |date=February 10, 2004|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly has long said that he does not identify with any political ideology, writing in his book ''The O'Reilly Factor'' that the reader "might be wondering if whether I'm [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], or exactly what.... See, I don't want to fit any of those labels, because I believe that the truth doesn't have labels. When I see corruption, I try to expose it. When I see exploitation, I try to fight it. That's my political position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=Bill|title=The O'Reilly Factor: The Good, the Bad, and the Completely Ridiculous in American Life|accessdate=2000-09-12|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780767905299&amp;view=excerpt|date=2002-03-12|publisher=Broadway Books|isbn=0-7679-0529-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 2000, the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' in New York reported, however, that he had been registered with the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the state of New York since 1994. When questioned about this, he said that he was not aware of it and says he registered as an independent after the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Ingrassia| first =Michele| title =He's Living the Life of O'Reilly|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]| date=December 6, 2000|url =http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/12/06/2000-12-06_he_s_living_the_life_of_o_re.html| accessdate=April 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a broadcast of ''The Radio Factor'', O'Reilly said that there was no option to register as an independent voter; however, there was in fact a box marked "I do not wish to enroll in party."&lt;ref&gt;''The Radio Factor'', September 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being registered as an Independent, many view him as a conservative figure.&lt;ref name="sandiego"/&gt;  A Pew Research February 2009 poll found that 66% of his television viewers identify themselves as conservative, 24% moderate, and 3% liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1102/limbaugh-audience-conservative-men|title=Limbaugh Holds onto his Niche – Conservative Men|date=February 3, 2009|accessdate=April 4, 2009 |publisher=Pew Research Center| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327215304/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1102/limbaugh-audience-conservative-men| archivedate= March 27, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 2008 poll by [[Zogby International]] found that O'Reilly was the second most trusted news personality after Rush Limbaugh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imao.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/media_project_poll_info.pdf|title=Zogby Poll Finds the Internet Today's Most Trusted News Source|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=October 1, 2010|publisher=The IFC Media Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2003 interview with [[Terry Gross]] on [[National Public Radio]], O'Reilly said:
{{quote|I'm not a political guy in the sense that I embrace an ideology. To this day I'm an independent thinker, an independent voter, I'm a registered independent... there are certain fundamental things that this country was founded upon that I respect and don't want changed. That separates me from the secularists who want a complete overhaul of how the country is run.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1459090|title=Bill O'Reilly|last=Gross|first=Terry|date=October 8, 2003|work=Fresh Air from WHYY (npr)|accessdate=April 9, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303230016/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1459090| archivedate= March 3, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Domestic politics ===

O'Reilly has opined on many domestic issues. O'Reilly said the [[Bill Clinton]] [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] stemming from the [[Lewinsky scandal]] was "not about sex. This is about honesty and cruelty. For Mr. Clinton, it was about undermining the justice system." In the same article he writes that [[Gary Condit]], a moderate [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Congress|congressman]] from [[California]] who had an extramarital affair with [[Chandra Levy]] prior to her disappearance and death, should be held to the same standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,29294,00.html | title=talking Points: Condit Should Resign | work=Fox News | first=Bill | last=O'Reilly | date=2001-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Newsmax]] publication, O'Reilly has repeatedly claimed that Clinton had the [[Internal Revenue Service]] audit him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/4/22/200136.shtml "IRS Official to Judicial Watch: Clinton Enemies Were Audited"], Carl Limbacher, ''NewsMax.com'', April 23, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly says that he was audited three times since his program debuted in 1996.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

O'Reilly has been critical of former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]], calling her "perhaps the worst attorney general in history", and that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] became a "disorganized mess" during her tenure. He later praised former Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] for going after the [[Arthur Andersen]] accounting firm, as well as [[Enron]], [[WorldCom]], [[Sam Waksal]] of [[Imclone]] and [[Martha Stewart]].&lt;ref name="FOX_1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,113782,00.html|publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill|title=Right Man for the Job? | date=2004-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, O'Reilly had criticized Democratic Senator [[Hillary Clinton]], stating that she would run for [[United States presidential election, 2008|president]] in 2008. In an interview with [[Jay Leno]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', he said, "I just feel that Hillary is a [[Socialism|socialist]], and I'm paying enough tax. Hillary wants to take my money [and] your money... and give it to strangers. There's something about that that offends me." He said that she had voted for every single spending bill that year. In the same interview, he accused her of running as a political [[carpetbagger]], and said that she intends to abolish the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in favor of the [[Direct election|popular vote]], claiming that it would be done only to give her an advantage in the presidential race.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Tonight Show]]'', May 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

After criticizing the overturn of [[Snyder v. Phelps]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]], O'Reilly offered on March 30, 2010 to help Snyder pay the {{USD|16,510}} in court costs while he prepared an appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/2010/03/29/1844265/marines-dad-ordered-to-pay-protesters.html Marine's dad ordered to pay protesters' court fees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403010856/http://www.kansascity.com/2010/03/29/1844265/marines-dad-ordered-to-pay-protesters.html |date=April 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MCT"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/04/marine_scotus_040510w/|title=Snyder-Phelps fight has many twists, turns|last=Lamothe|first=Dan|date=April 6, 2010|publisher=[[Marine Corps Times]]|accessdate=6 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324031812/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/04/marine_scotus_040510w|archivedate=24 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2004 presidential election====
During the lead up to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], O'Reilly said that the Democratic Party has been taken over by the "far-[[political left|left]]" in a conversation with former Democratic Congressman [[Brad Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billoreilly.com/show?JSESSIONID=B48mn9DkkwFSIq1rZ0SEaXZ0Fso2ue02JonZthH0qEyGFzb14rcu!1153361422&amp;action=viewTVShow&amp;showID=44|title= Redefining the Democratic Party|publisher=billoreilly.com|accessdate=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly following the election, O'Reilly ridiculed a message in which Democratic challenger [[John Kerry]] thanked his supporters for their support as well as opposing "the attacks from big news organizations such as Fox, Sinclair Broadcasting, and conservative talk radio."&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News: [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0411/S00237.htm A Message from John Kerry - 19 November 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly shot back, calling Kerry a "sissy" six times.&lt;ref&gt;''The Radio Factor'', November 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry himself stated publicly in a 2006 interview that he always felt he'd have a "fair shot" at conveying his views on ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and regrets not doing an interview prior to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,201705,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Exclusive! Sen. John Kerry Enters the 'No Spin Zone' | date=2006-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although O'Reilly has never officially endorsed any candidate, he did advise his audience not to support Democratic [[South Dakota]] senator [[Tom Daschle]] in his Senate re-election bid on his radio program, saying that, "[W]ith all due respect to the senator, we don't have any respect for him at all. And we hope he loses in South Dakota. And I -- really, I stay out of all these races, but you guys listening in South Dakota, vote for the other guy."&lt;ref&gt;''The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly'', July 21, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Daschle would lose the 2004 Senate election in South Dakota to [[John Thune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#41 |title=Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 2, 2004 |publisher=clerk.house.gov |date= |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008 presidential election====
In the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primary]], O'Reilly urged his viewers not to vote for a candidate, this time [[John Edwards]], and called Edwards a "phony" regarding his public statements on poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,276378,00.html|publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill|title=John Edwards and Rosie O'Donnell| date=May 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Reilly has, on many occasions, admitted to "having no respect for him", and called him "arrogant" for keeping his campaign staffer [[Amanda Marcotte]] on after making remarks O'Reilly called offensive to Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,251906,00.html|publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill|title=John Edwards and His Anti-Christian Employees| date=February 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly has also criticized Republicans. When speaking to [[Ed Schulz]] in 2007, O'Reilly said that then-presidential candidate [[Rudy Giuliani]] had "terrible character judgement" with [[Bernard Kerik]] and felt that "disqualified him from being president."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323305,00.html|publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill|title=Ed Schultz on Talk Radio's Handling of Presidential Candidates| date=January 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Culture War" and domestic politics====

O'Reilly has taken to using the abbreviation "S-P", for "[[Secularism|Secular]] [[Progressivism|Progressive]]", as a shorthand way of referring to a political category of people who want "drastic change" in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} O'Reilly classifies the group as "far left", and almost always refers to the group in a negative manner. However, he says that he is not equating the negative qualities he sees in "SPs" with a "liberal" political ideology, saying the SP camp is far more "[[libertine]]" with social values:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Liberal thought, however, can be a good thing. Progressive programs to help the poor, fight injustice and give working people a fair shake are all positive. But libertine actions damage a just society because actions have consequences. Kids who drink and take drugs are likely to hurt themselves and others. But obviously, the SPs do not make judgments like that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,336334,00.html | title = What Will Happen if Far-Left Secular Progressives Achieve Power in America? | date= March 10, 2008 | publisher = Fox News Channel | author = Bill O'Reilly }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''Culture Warrior'', O'Reilly called President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] examples of liberals who were also traditionalists, also citing current US Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] of [[Connecticut]] and [[Evan Bayh]] of Indiana as liberal/Democratic "traditionalists".{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

O'Reilly has supported stricter [[border control]]s, including placement of the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] troops on the [[US-Mexican border]] and has criticized President [[George W. Bush]] for not allocating enough resources to make border security effective. He also criticized [[Ronald Reagan]]'s act of [[amnesty]], claiming that it made the [[illegal immigration]] problem worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/oreilly052206.asp | title=Guarding the border|author=Bill O'Reilly|publisher=''Jewish World Review''|date=2005-06-22|accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly makes a distinction between criminal illegal immigrants and non-criminals by saying that criminal illegal immigrants should be deported immediately. O'Reilly criticizes the lack of cooperation between local [[sanctuary cities]] and the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293375,00.html| title=Geraldo Rivera on Criminal Alien Charged With Murder in Newark |author=Bill O'Reilly|publisher=Fox News|date=2007-08-15|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Iraq War====
O'Reilly initially supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Speaking on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on March 18, 2003, O'Reilly promised that "If the Americans go in and overthrow [[Saddam Hussein]] and it's clean [of weapons of mass destruction]...I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again."&lt;ref&gt;''Good Morning America'', ABC.  March 18, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, O'Reilly responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: "My analysis was wrong and I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm not pleased about it at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/160422_oreilly13.html "Bill O'Reilly admits he was wrong about Iraq"], ''[[Associated Press]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to never again trusting the current U.S. government, he said, "I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at that time."{{fact|date=April 2017}}

O'Reilly has questioned the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]] in hindsight, in particular the performance of Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. However, he maintains that the United States "did a good thing by trying to liberate a country". {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} O'Reilly says the war effort should continue as long as progress is being made. He has also said that some [[anti-war]] activists are actively rooting for the United States to lose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Barry McCaffrey|General McCaffrey]] says strong progress is being made. He believes the [[Sunni]]s have turned against [[Al Qaeda]] and that the [[Nouri al-Maliki|Maliki]] government is neutralizing the [[Shiite|Shi'ia]] death squads.

Again, I don't know. With all America has sacrificed in Iraq, though, it seems reasonable to let the end game play out. If things are getting better, don't derail the train.

But the anti-war crew is now fully invested in defeat. So the struggle at home is becoming even more vicious. Iraq is a shooting war. America's a political war. Both are driven by hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,272079,00.html|title=The Truth About Iraq|date=2006-05-14|accessdate=2007-06-27|publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Reilly called the Iraqi people a "[[prehistory|prehistoric]] group", citing a poll showing that only two percent of them viewed the U.S. Forces as liberators and 55 percent preferred that they leave. "We cannot intervene in the [[Muslim]] world ever again", he said. "What we can do is bomb the living daylights out of them (...) no more ground troops, no more [[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]], ain't going to work."&lt;ref&gt;''The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly'', June 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[White House Press Secretary]] (and former [[Fox News]] colleague) [[Tony Snow]], O'Reilly said that the United States cannot win given the circumstances of Iraqis not supporting the effort:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You can't win. No one could. No nation could unless the Iraqi people turn on all the terrorists. And they're not. They're not, Tony.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
O'Reilly went on to say that the country was corrupt and compared the situation to the American support of [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's like South Vietnam. It's the same thing. There were a lot of South Vietnamese helping us. A lot fought and died on our side but there wasn't enough of them to prevent the [[communist]]s which were more united.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,289245,00.html|title=Iraq's Future|date=2007-07-12|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Reilly would go on to praise General [[David Petraeus]] for reducing American casualties and advancing American objectives with the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|2007 troop surge]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cost has been great. We all know that. In suffering and cash. And the Iraqi government is still a mess. But General Petraeus, backed by a brave and professional U.S. military, has restored much order, largely defeated the Iraqi Al Qaeda thugs, and at least given the good people of that country a chance to prosper. General David Petraeus is "The Factor" person of the year by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,317268,00.html|title='The Factor's' Person of the Year|date=2007-12-18|accessdate=2007-12-24|publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During [[The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium|''The Rumble'' with Jon Stewart]], O'Reilly admitted that "We should not have gone to Iraq. Afghanistan we had to."&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/07/14275237-bill-oreilly-vs-jon-stewart-10-best-moments-from-online-rumble?lite&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Terrorism ====
O'Reilly has endorsed an aggressive [[War on Terror]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215164,00.html|title=A Deal on Tough Interrogation...|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|author=Bill O'Reilly|date=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports [[coercion|coercive]] measures to extract information from detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], which he visited on two occasions. He has said that, in comparison to procedures used under the regimes of [[dictator]]s such as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Pol Pot]], the U.S.'s tactics are not [[torture]] and are beneficial even when involving physical techniques,&lt;ref name="geneva_convention"&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel, June 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "Torture is taking my fingers off, disfiguring me, taking my eye out — not keeping me in a cold room and uncomfortable with blaring rock music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,213629,00.html|title=Does The U.S. Support Torturing Terror Suspects?|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|author=Bill O'Reilly|date=September 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly cites [[waterboarding]] as a successful coercive measure that should not be classified as torture, citing that [[Abu Zubaydah]] and [[Khaled Sheikh Mohammed]] have both given up valuable information after being subjected to the technique:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my opinion, it is immoral to allow terrorists to kill people when you can stop them. If you capture someone who knows the inner workings of a terror outfit, you make life very uncomfortable for that person within boundaries set by Congress.

But let's stop the nonsense here. America's not a bad country because it [[waterboarding|waterboarded]] Zubaydah. The Bush administration has done its job. We haven't been attacked since [[9/11]].

The [[media bias|liberal press]], politicians, the [[ACLU]] can't stop any wrongdoing. They're all lost in a fog of misguided indignation, crazy with hatred for Bush, but we the people must take a stand here. This isn't a game. This is life and death. And if you don't believe it, I know scores of people right here in New York City that will tell you about their dead loved ones.

Waterboarding should be a last resort, but it must be an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,316544,00.html|title=Would You Waterboard Someone to Save American Lives?|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|author=Bill O'Reilly|date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He has also said that detainees should be judged under [[military tribunal]]s, but not protected under the [[Geneva Convention]] because the convention requires combatants to wear a uniform.&lt;ref name="geneva_convention" /&gt;

He has been critical of politicians such as Democratic [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] and private citizens such as financier [[George Soros]] for wanting to try terror suspects in civilian courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,216557,00.html|title=The Terror War Meets the Culture War|date=2006-09-29|accessdate=2007-06-27 | work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly has said that both political parties in the United States are "playing games" with regards to the war on terrorism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...both the [[political right|right]] and the left are playing games to some extent. Certainly, Al Qaeda remains dangerous, but the only way to hit them is to invade [[Pakistan]]. Do the Democrats want to do that?

On the other hand, it would be a tragedy if after all the blood and treasure Americans have sacrificed, Al Qaeda has not been badly damaged.

America should be united in fighting these savages, but we're not. Ideology has poisoned a reasoned, disciplined approach to defeating the [[jihadists]]. America's great strength, diversity of thought, can also be a weakness. And Al Qaeda knows it.

The old saying goes, "United we stand, divided we fall." Well, we're divided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,289746,00.html|title=Al Qaeda and the 2008 Presidential Race|date=2007-07-18|accessdate=2007-08-08 | work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===George Soros===
O'Reilly has accused billionaire businessman, investor and political activist [[George Soros]] of trying to influence the [[2008 United States Presidential Election|2008 election]] by donating to causes and organizations that O'Reilly calls the "radical left", such as [[moveon.org]], which regularly criticizes conservative politicians. O'Reilly said of Soros "If [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] didn't invent [[Dr. Evil]], some would give Soros that moniker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,270631,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=Far Left Influence: 'Hurricane Soros' Is Getting Stronger|date=May 8, 2007|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly also accused [[Media Matters for America]] of receiving funds from Soros;&lt;ref&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel, April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; although Media Matters denies having any funding directly or indirectly from Soros,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/research/2007/04/24/oreilly-purported-to-chart-an-intricate-web-lea/138687 Media Matters - O'Reilly purported to chart an intricate web leading to "vile propaganda outfit" Media Matters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; he and the group's founder, [[David Brock]], have raised money together to fund political advertisements challenging [[John McCain]] in the 2008 election for what [[politico.com]] called "attack ads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = David Brock, Dems plan $40M hit on McCain

Most Americans have no idea who Soros or Brock are. They will only know what they see on TV, smear stuff against McCain. And the pipeline extends directly to [[NBC News]], which will publicize every piece of slime Brock can create. Only one word describes this: despicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

O'Reilly alleged that [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] personality [[Bill Moyers]] oversaw $500,000 worth of money transferred from the Shoeman Center Foundation (a group Soros donated to) to Media Matters.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,268043,00.html|title=Buying Political Power|publisher=Fox News Channel| author=Bill O'Reilly | date=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;you know, you've got to admire Soros for coming up with this organization. I mean, you know, he's made billions by doing this in business, by being in [[Curaçao]] and [[Bermuda]] and [[France]], where he was convicted of a [[felony]]. And he knows how to do this. He knows how to move the money around and use it to gain influence. And now he's set his sights on changing the basic fabric of this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,268045,00.html|title="Factor Investigation":George Soros|publisher=Fox News Channel| author=Bill O'Reilly | date=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The organization to which O'Reilly refers is the [[Open Society Institute]].&lt;ref name="foxnews1"/&gt;

===ACLU===
O'Reilly has been critical of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), calling it "the most dangerous organization in the United States of America" especially in their challenging of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] regarding the [[War on Terror]]. He has called them a "[[Fascism|fascist]]" organization in response to their threatened lawsuit against [[Los Angeles County]] for failing to remove a cross from its official seal.&lt;ref&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel, June 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly alleged hypocrisy on the part of the ACLU for stating that [[New York City]]'s random searches of bags in the public transportation as a breach of personal rights, but requiring people entering their New York headquarters to consent to a bag search.&lt;ref&gt;Fox News: [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164837,00.html Is the ACLU Bin Laden's Best Ally?].  August 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly asserted that the ACLU is now a political organization rather than an advocacy group, taking positions and cases based on politics rather than [[free speech]].{{fact|date=April 2017}}

He has come down hard on the organization for its actions on behalf of the North American Man Boy Love Association ([[NAMBLA]]) which is currently under suspicion of involvement with the [[rape]] and [[murder]] of a young boy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now many of these people subscribe to a philosophy of [[relativism]]. That is a theory which says there's no absolute right or wrong. All moral values are relative. What's wrong for you is not wrong for your neighbor if he or she doesn't think his or her actions are wrong.

That's what the North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) is all about. Those loons believe it's OK to rape kids because they want to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188084,00.html| date = 2006-03-16 | title = Failure to Punish| accessdate = 2007-07-15 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ACLU defends NAMBLA's [[freedom of speech]] surrounding their publications and has said that the legal blame in the murder should go to who committed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11289prs20000831.html | date = 2000-08-31 | title = ACLU Statement on Defending Free Speech of Unpopular Organizations | accessdate = 2007-03-04 | publisher = [[American Civil Liberties Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU has said that they sometimes have to defend "unpopular" speech or speech that they don't agree with, including the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s, saying their only "client" is the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aclufl.org/take_action/students/case_of_the_month/1999/faqs1099.cfm | publisher = American Civil Liberties Union of Florida | title = Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on why the ACLU defends free speech for racists and totalitarians | accessdate = 2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly alleges the ACLU "cherry picks" its cases to promote a left wing agenda while not supporting causes of free speech that conservatives support in his criticism of the ACLU defending live sex shows in [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,171995,00.html| publisher = Fox news Channel | title = The ACLU Exposed| accessdate = 2007-07-06 | date=2005-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly decried the group's criticism of [[Minuteman Civil Defense Corps|The Minutemen]], claiming the latter were only engaging in a form of protest, a right the ACLU defends. O'Reilly alleges that the organization is protesting the Minutemen because they are going against the ACLU's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oprah.com/tows/slide/200610/20061027/slide_20061027_350_107.jhtml | publisher = The Oprah Winfrey Show | title = What does Bill think about the ACLU? | accessdate = 2007-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,171995,00.html | work=Fox News | title=The ACLU Exposed | date=2005-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly accused the organization of having an [[anti-Christian]] bias when it protested the portrayal of the [[nativity scene]] in [[New York City Public Schools]], but did not protest displayal of the Jewish [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] or the Islamic [[star and crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,104596,00.html| publisher = Fox news Channel | title = More Controversy Over Anti-Christian Bias in NYC Schools| accessdate = 2007-07-16 | date=2003-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly criticized the ACLU for suing [[San Diego County]] for renting property to the [[Boy Scouts of America]] in [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]]. The ACLU brought up a law claiming that the Boy Scouts discriminated against [[gay]]s and [[atheists]]. O'Reilly criticized the San Diego City Council for voting 6-2 to vote the Scouts out before a ruling on the lawsuit was made.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It would be impossible for the Boy Scouts (search) or any children's organization to admit [[Coming out|avowed homosexual]]s because of the potential liability.  Say the Scouts put openly gay and [[heterosexual|straight]] kids together and some sexual activity occurred.  Well, parents could sue for millions, same way parents could sue if the Scouts put boys and girls together and underaged sex occurred.

As far as the atheist issue is concerned, the Scouts say no specific belief in [[God]] is necessary, only an acknowledgement of a higher power. And that power could be nature. Come on. The whole discrimination thing is bogus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Part of the Boy Scout Oath begins, "On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country" and the final point of the Scout Law reads, "A Scout is reverent,"  with the Boy Scouts' of America official explanation being that "a Scout is reverent toward God. He is faithful in his religious duties. He respects the beliefs of others."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-503a.aspx Fact Sheet: Boy Scout Oath, Law, Motto, and Slogan], [http://www.scouting.org The Boy Scouts of America], Retrieved 2007-10-23&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bylaws of the organization specifically state that Scouts must "respect the religious beliefs of others" and "in no case where a unit is connected with a church or other distinctively religious organization shall members of other denominations or faith be required, because of their membership in the unit, to take part in or observe a religious ceremony distinctly unique to that organization or church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp| publisher = Boy Scouts of America National Council| title = Boy Scout By Laws| accessdate = 2007-10-26| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509074048/http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp| archivedate = 2008-05-09| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly argues this is a liberal definition of what God may be, allowing diversity for anyone believing in a higher power to join.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

He went on to compare the ACLU to [[Nazi]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now the ACLU is free to come to your town and sue the heck out of it.  And believe me, that organization will.  The ACLU doesn't care about the law or [[U.S. Constitution|the Constitution]] or what the people want. It's a fascist organization that uses lawyers instead of [[Panzer]]s.  It'll find a way to inflict financial damage on any concern that opposes its secular agenda and its growing in power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He later went on to criticize the Boy Scout leadership for not standing up to the ACLU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,108106,00.html| publisher = Fox news Channel | title = Another Big Win for the ACLU| accessdate = 2007-07-19 | first=Bill | last=O'Reilly | date=2004-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2006 at [[Mount Pleasant High School (Michigan)|Mount Pleasant High School]] in [[Michigan]], a student stood up publicly in the cafeteria and called the principal of the school "a skank and a tramp." In addition to this, the student called the school administrators Nazis and questioned the [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] of the vice-principal. The school suspended the boy for 10 days, an action that brought a lawsuit by the ACLU. O'Reilly criticized the ACLU for defending the remarks as [[satire]] when he saw it as [[hate speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,102361,00.html| publisher = Fox news Channel | title = More Evidence That Our Freedoms are in Jeopardy| accessdate = 2007-07-16 | first=Bill | last=O'Reilly | date=2003-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social views==

===Abortion===
O'Reilly supported [[California Proposition 73 (2005)|California Proposition 73]] because it would have required [[Minors and abortion|parental notification]] of underage girls seeking an [[abortion]]. "[T]he left-wing media has been able to convince millions of Americans that the government knows what's best for families, not the parents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,175031,00.html| title=Election Day, 2005 | date=2005-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly strongly condemns doctors who provide legal abortion services. Since 2005, he has repeatedly referred to physician and abortion doctor [[George Tiller]] as "Tiller the baby killer" on his Fox News prime time show, claiming that there must be "a special place in hell" for him. In May 2009, Tiller was murdered by anti-abortion gunman Scott Roeder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill O'Reilly called George Tiller "a baby killer" without attribution|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/05/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-called-george-tiller-baby-killer/|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=PolitiFact|date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly ardently condemns the practice of [[partial birth abortion]]. He has criticized the practice being done without explanations being made and has criticized [[human rights]] groups such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] for not condemning the practice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once again, this isn't about a women's {{sic}} right to choose or the ''[[New York Times]]'' plea for [[pro-choice|reproductive rights]]. This is about late term abortions for just about any reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,283973,00.html| title=Kansas and Abortion | date=2007-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Education===
O'Reilly supports the discussion (but not the advocation) of [[intelligent design]] in schools and considers the opinion of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s opposition to such theories "fascist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164581,00.html|title= God versus science: that is the subject of this evening's "Talking Points Memo".|date=2005-08-03|accessdate=2006-10-10|publisher=FOX News}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly has also suggested that [[Richard Dawkins]]' argument for how science should be taught in school is equivalent to fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=O'Reilly Debates Atheist Richard Dawkins, Calls His View Of How To Teach Science "Fascism" (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/09/oreilly-debates-atheist-r_n_316178.html|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=Huffington Post|date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he supports teachers saying that some people, especially in religious groups, believe that [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] is wrong.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

O'Reilly has said that there is a lack of leadership among the traditionalists and this has emboldened the secular-progressive cause. He consistently says that using religion to justify public policy is wrong:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, religious people are the ones speaking out for traditional values. But America does not forge public policy based on religion. Thus as soon as God enters the debate, the secularists win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,113379,00.html|title=Reluctant Culture Warrior (Friday, March 5, 2004)|accessdate=2007-08-06 | work=Fox News | first=Bill | last=O'Reilly | date=2004-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gun rights===
O'Reilly supports some forms of gun control, such as gun registration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNrGfE3a7A0 John Stossel on The O'Reilly Factor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&amp;showID=530 BillO'Reilly.com: The O'Reilly Factor Flash], November 7, 2005: "Once I saw what happened in [[Hurricane Katrina]], I said every American household should have a firearm. If there's a tremendous [[earthquake]] in [[San Francisco]] and looting, you don't want your family protected? You don't want a firearm in your house? You're living in the world of [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. And the military is a noble enterprise. Why should the rest of the country protect your butt if San Francisco is going to thumb your nose at the military by passing this resolution?"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
O'Reilly opposed the [[nationalization|nationalized]] [[health care]] plan that filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] argues for in his film ''[[Sicko (film)|Sicko]]'', saying it would create huge backlogs. He also said, however, that he thinks the government should perform more oversight functions on health care:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[G]overnment-run health care would be a disaster, featuring long waits for treatment and an enormous rise in taxation. But there should be government oversight on private insurance companies and strict guidelines about abusing customers.

There can be compromise and effective government control of medical care abuse in the USA. It is possible. But if Michael Moore's plan ever gets traction, pray hard you never get sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,288936,00.html|title= Michael Moore and Your Health|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2007-07-12|publisher=FOX News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===LGBT issues===
O'Reilly's stance on LGBT issues has been evolving. {{fact|date=April 2017}}

On October 27, 2004, he was quoted saying: “I've been saying that all along, that if you open the door for gay marriage, then you have to have the polygamists and the triads and the commune people and everybody else, right?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amira|first1=Dan|title=Bill O’Reilly’s Gay-Marriage Evolution in 10 Quotes|website=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/bill-oreilly-gay-marriage-evolution-timeline.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
O'Reilly supports [[civil unions]] for [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] couples, but has said that nobody has the "right" to marry; he says that marriage, like driving a car, is a privilege, not a right. He has said that if the government felt marriage was a right, then it would not stop [[polygamy|polygamists]] and [[incest|incestuous couples]] from marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billoreilly.com/pg/jsp/general/genericpage.jsp?pageID=62|title=Bill's Talking Points Memo (Friday, February 20, 2004)|accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly further explained his position in his book ''Culture Warrior'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;To this culture warrior, gay marriage is not a vital issue. I don't believe the republic will collapse if Larry marries Brendan. However, it is clear that most Americans want heterosexual marriage to maintain its special place in American society. And as long as gays are not penalized in the civil arena, I think the folks should make the call at the ballot box. Traditional marriage is widely seen as a social stabilizer, and I believe that is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| year=2006| publisher=Random House Inc.| author=O'Reilly, Bill| isbn=0-7679-2092-9| title=Culture Warrior}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 26, 2013, O'Reilly stated "I support civil unions, I always have. The gay marriage thing, I don't feel that strongly about it one way or the other. I think the states should do it." O'Reilly then said, "The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals ... 'We're Americans, we just want to be treated like everybody else.' That's a compelling argument, and to deny that you've got to have a very strong argument on the other side. And the other side hasn't been able to do anything but thump the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, David Clark (March 27, 2013). [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2013/0327/Bill-O-Reilly-Gay-marriage-advocate-or-opponent "Bill O'Reilly: Gay marriage advocate or opponent? (+video)"]. ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly discussed a story surrounding around a teenage [[lesbian]] couple being elected as the "cutest couple" in their school yearbook. He stated that he believed that this couple was elected by the students to "tweak the adults" and to "cause trouble". He explains further here:

&lt;blockquote&gt;High school kids, they experiment. They experiment all over the place, they have a chip on their shoulder. They do things just to get a reaction, just to rebel. Parents might say "We don't want to normalize homosexuality in a public way in an academic setting among minors. We don't think that reflects how we feel about it".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g8VNUkIemw&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Reilly is known to favor adoption by a same-sex couple since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Bauder, David (September 16, 2002). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=20020916&amp;id=uqAfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zNUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1216,2266467 ""Fox News' Bill O'Reilly finds himself in fight with the right"]. ''[[Southeast Missourian]]''. p. 4B. [[Google News]]. Retrieved February 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly is opposed to the School Success and Opportunity Act (Assembly Bill 1266), which extends gender identity and expression discrimination protection to transgender and gender-nonconforming K-12 students in public schools. O'Reilly described the law as "madness" and "anarchy" on Fox News Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/video/2013/08/14/oreilly-doubles-down-ca-transgender-rights-law/195409 O'Reilly Doubles Down: CA Transgender Rights Law Is "Anarchy And Madness"] [[Media Matters for America]], 14 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the repeal of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" law banning homosexuals from openly serving in the military, he appeared on the Tonight Show and called the law "nonsense" and said he didn't understand why the President, in his role as commander in chief of the armed forces, simply didn't sign an executive order rescinding it.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

===US legal system===
He regularly criticizes jurists in controversial cases as "[[activist judges]]." He uses the issue of [[gay marriage]] as an example. "The folks decide that by voting and, in the case of gay marriage, the folks have decided. And that decision should be respected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Gay Marriage and the Culture War|publisher=FOX News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198343,00.html | date=2006-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has suggested convicted rapists, mass murderers, terrorists, and other people who commit crimes against humanity be sent to a [[gulag]] style prison in [[Alaska]] with strict rules and minimal privileges.  He has said this would serve as a replacement for the [[death penalty]], to which he is opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=23246|title=Work or die|date=2001-06-14|accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jessica's Law====
O'Reilly is a self-professed proponent of stricter penalties for [[child sexual abuse|child molesters]]. He has fervently supported [[Jessica's Law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billoreilly.com/outragefunnels|title=Jessica's Law Report Card|publisher=BillOReilly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized the law's detractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,182307,00.html |title=Protecting the Kids - Liberal Versus Conservative|date=2006-01-20|accessdate=2006-10-10|publisher=FOX News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has given verbal support for Republican [[Doug Forrester]] in the 2005 [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2005|New Jersey gubernatorial election]], suggesting that his opponent, Democrat [[Jon Corzine]], would be less likely to support a national version of the law, though stopped short of actually endorsing Forrester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,174551,00.html| title=Protecting the Kids in New Jersey... | date=2005-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly has been particularly critical of the [[Debra LaFave]] case, in which she was convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old boy, but was only sentenced to [[house arrest]] and seven years [[probation]].&lt;ref name="Fox_LaFave"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,213778,00.html|title=What Is Convicted Child Sex Offender Debra LaFave Doing on TV? | work=Fox News | date=2006-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He criticizes many politicians who oppose [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s for child molesters, and calls several states "child predator-friendly."&lt;ref name="Fox_LaFave" /&gt;

== Entertainment media ==

=== Film industry ===
O'Reilly has been very critical of the U.S. film industry for producing films featuring violence and human suffering, such as the ''[[Saw (film series)|Saw]]'' series. He has compared this to the brutal displays of death in the [[Roman Colosseum|Colosseums]] of [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShowByDate&amp;date=20061031#1 BillOReilly.com: The O'Reilly Factor Flash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly has said that films like these are marketed to children and can have consequences on their personal development. He commented on ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's the most violent movie ever made, featuring brutal dismemberments and a [[scalping]] close-up. And you should see the raves this movie is getting from the pinhead critics. And who's lining up to see it? Children, that's who.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,101028,00.html|title= Is O'Reilly a Cry Baby?|date=2003-10-23|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=Fox News Channel | first=Bill | last=O'Reilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
O'Reilly severely chastized billionaire [[Mark Cuban]], owner of the [[Dallas Mavericks]], for his support of [[Brian De Palma]]'s film ''[[Redacted (film)|Redacted]]'' that portrayed the [[rape]] of an Iraqi girl by American soldiers. O'Reilly claimed that the film would be used as a recruiting tool by terrorists.&lt;ref name="foxnews2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,311812,00.html|title=The Far-Left, Mark Cuban and A Movie That Will Put U.S. Troops in More Danger| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music industry ===
O'Reilly has criticized the [[Rap music|rap]] and [[hip hop]] industry for promoting an "[[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]]" culture. He has said he does not care if adults listen to the music, but argues that children are not able to process the information and determine it to be destructive behavior. He has gone after several rappers such as  [[50 Cent]], [[Jay Z]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Eminem]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Nas]], [[Ludacris]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Common (entertainer)|Common]], [[Nelly]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Young Jeezy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every educator that I've talked to, and I've talked to hundreds, say that the kind of [[gangsta rap]] that Ludacris traffics in has debased the culture, made it more difficult for them to teach children and indeed, led children into anti-social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,113061,00.html|title= What on Earth is Anheuser-Busch Thinking?|date= March 2004|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 2007, O'Reilly had a dispute with [[Nas]] after the rapper was hired to play a concert at [[Virginia Tech]] one year after the school had experienced the [[Virginia Tech massacre]]. "Having a rapper who trades in violence perform at Virginia Tech insults the victims, the university and the entire commonwealth," declared Bill O'Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1569047/20070906/nas.jhtml|title= Nas Slams Bill O'Reilly Over Virginia Tech Comments|date= September 2007|accessdate=2008-08-14|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nas]] subsequently called Bill O'Reilly a racist, and accused O'Reilly of going to extremes for publicity. He repeated this stance again in July 2008, when a dispute between Nas and O'Reilly led to Nas taking a petition to Fox News, and appearing on both Fox News, and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. Also in 2008, Nas challenged Bill O'Reilly to a public debate, to which O'Reilly did not accept.{{fact|date=April 2017}} 

In May 2015, O'Reilly blamed the decline of American religion particularly the declining numbers of American Christians on hip hop music citing the genre as "pernicious entertainment" and an adducing factor for contributing to the decline. O'Reilly remarked that people of faith are being marginalized by a secular media and pernicious entertainment and rap industry often glorifies depraved behavior causing the minds of people who consume the music as the least likely to reject religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6561515/bill-oreilly-hip-hop-decline-religion-christianity | title=Bill O'Reilly Blames Hip-Hop for Decline in U.S. Christianity | publisher=Billboard | date=May 13, 2015 | accessdate=16 May 2015 | author=Joe Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt; American rapper [[Killer Mike]] subsequently criticized him for his remarks calling O'Reilly "full of more s**t than an outhouse" and then mocked him while he was a guest ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/bill-maher-and-rapper-killer-mike-mock-bill-oreilly-hes-more-full-of-sht-than-an-outhouse/ | title=Bill Maher and rapper 'Killer Mike' mock Bill O'Reilly: 'He's more full of sh*t than an outhouse' | publisher=Raw Story | accessdate=16 May 2015 | author=Arturo Garcia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several rappers and hip hop producers have appeared on [[The O'Reilly Factor]].  Rapper [[Cam'ron]] and hip hop entrepreneur [[Damon Dash]] appeared on the program to defend their supposed corruption of young people, to which Damon Dash responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So, if you know there is negative in something, try to find the positive as opposed to always talking about the negative. That's the thing I don't understand, why we're criticized so hard within hip-hop. No one talks about the jobs we create, no one talks about the things we do within our community, and no one talks about the businesses we've done, how we've opened the doors and shown people that it's cool to be smart, it's cool to be a CEO, and it's cool to not take advantage but to reap the benefits of all your labor and to do it fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,103092,00.html|title= IS GANGSTA RAP HURTING AMERICA'S CHILDREN?|date= November 14, 2003|accessdate=2008-08-14|publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bill O'Reilly has also interviewed [[Marilyn Manson]] on the topic of being a "dangerous" influence on U.S. youth. O'Reilly asked Manson if he thought his work encouraged kids to have sex, homosexuality, use drugs and profanity. He also asked Manson whether his songs encouraged suicide or not. Marilyn Manson answered that in his view the songs were about getting through those feelings, and that ultimately people make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6n5Oi4714o&lt;/ref&gt;

==News media==
O'Reilly believes the American news media is corrupt and often criticizes it for not reporting topics that hurt the liberal agenda. He has often stated that he is the only one in the media holding people accountable on both sides. In June 2007, ''[[Adweek Magazine]]'' sponsored a survey that asked participants who they trusted more as a source of political information between [[ABC News]] and O'Reilly. According to the poll, 36 percent believe that O'Reilly is a better source than ABC News, while 26 percent believe the opposite. According to the survey, 23 percent of Democrats believed that O'Reilly was a better source while 55 percent of Republicans believed the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/magazine/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003596717|title= Where Voters Go for News|date=2007-06-11|accessdate=2007-06-11|publisher=Adweek Magazine |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614074606/http://www.adweek.com/aw/magazine/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003596717 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly has criticized the media for not highlighting [[Rosie O'Donnell]]'s controversial remarks saying the United States attacked itself on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]] while they highlighted [[Ann Coulter]]'s remarks about calling Senator [[John Edwards]] a "fag." O'Reilly said in response to the situation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Doing the math, Ms. O'Donnell says something 100 times more offensive than Ms. Coulter, in my opinion, yet there's no coverage about it. But there's no left wing media bias in this country. Oh no!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,263247,00.html| title=The Week in Review| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Reilly has criticized journalists who donate to political parties after a report stated that nine out of 10 journalists donated to Democrats or liberal causes; he has said this has resulted in news media tilting to the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286007,00.html|title=Journalists Giving Money to Political Candidates| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly says that news coverage about positive improvements for American and Iraqi objectives in Iraq have been largely ignored. He conjectured that the ignoring of the positive news took place to help a Democrat win a presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,315861,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly|title=Getting the Truth About Iraq|publisher=''[[Fox News]]''|accessdate = 2008-01-10 | date=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly has asked his viewers and listeners to not patronize the following media outfits, saying those organizations "have regularly helped distribute [[defamation|defamatory]], false or non-newsworthy information supplied by far-left websites":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billoreilly.com/pg/jsp/general/mediadef.jsp|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=Media Outlets that Traffic in Defamation|publisher= billoreilly.com |accessdate = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television news===
In an interview with commentator [[Bill Maher]], former [[CBS News]] anchor [[Dan Rather]] accused Fox News Channel of receiving "talking points" from the Republican controlled [[White House]]. O'Reilly criticized Rather heavily, responding that Rather did not offer any [[evidence]] to support the claim. O'Reilly cited his defense of Rather during the [[Killian documents controversy|Memogate]] incident:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As you may remember, I defended Rather in the Bush [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] debacle. I said Rather did not intentionally put on a bogus story. He just didn't check it out, he was too anxious for the story to be true.

Now many of you criticized me for that defense, but I'm a fact-based guy. And there's no evidence Dan Rather fabricated anything. It was sloppy reporting that did him in.

But now the fabrication word is in play again. If Dan Rather has evidence of White House dictums coming to FOX News employees, he needs to display that evidence. We are awaiting his appearance. We'll let you know when it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,234144,00.html|title=Dan Rather Owes FOX News an Apology| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Reilly has gone after [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] personality [[Bill Moyers]]. O'Reilly criticized Moyers for having no balance in his presentations, citing a criticism by PBS' own [[ombudsman]]. He also called Moyers dishonest for making disparaging remarks about O'Reilly to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and then later denying he made the remarks when confronted by one of O'Reilly's producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hotair.com/archives/2007/04/24/video-oreilly-catches-bill-moyers-telling-whoppers-michelle-comments/|title=Video: O'Reilly catches Bill Moyers telling whoppers, Michelle comments| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN journalists were prominent among those critical of O'Reilly when he stated that he "couldn't get over the fact" that a largely [[African-American]] crowd at a [[Harlem]] restaurant behaved no differently than patrons of a white restaurant and garnered media coverage O'Reilly objected to CNN's portrayal of his commentary, stating that CNN had been irresponsible in mischaracterizing his remark as [[racism|racist]], when in fact, he said, he was actually speaking against racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,298126,00.html|title=CNN Goes Over to the Dark Side| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly scolded MSNBC and CNN for not providing coverage of the ceremony that awarded Lieutenant [[Michael P. Murphy]] the [[Medal of Honor]] during their primetime shows. O'Reilly said that "[O]n their prime-time broadcast last night, CNN and MSNBC just said no to Lieutenant Michael Murphy and his proud family," that the networks "despise the Bush administration and believe anything positive like American heroes in war zones, detract from their negative assessment of the administration" and that they should not claim to support the troops and ignore their heroism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,304700,00.html|title=Disrespecting The American Military | publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MSNBC and CNN had covered the events during their daytime programs.&lt;ref&gt;''MSNBC Live'', October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CNN: ''The Situation Room'', October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== NBC News and MSNBC ====
O'Reilly has criticized [[NBC News]] and their affiliated cable service MSNBC several times for their coverage of the war in Iraq, claiming that it is biased toward the war's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,242550,00.html] "NBC's Anti-Iraq Bias"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16688461/ NBC reacts to Bill O'Reilly's bias criticism - MSNBC TV - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He later called NBC News the most "anti-military news operation in the country," when he cited an example of NBC correspondent [[William Arkin]] that called American troops "mercenaries."&lt;ref name="foxnews2"/&gt;

He also criticized the network of trying to downplay the War on Terror in the wake of American casualties in Iraq.&lt;ref name="foxnews3"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,288785,00.html|title=Blood in the Water Over Iraq| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Greenwald]], who had directed the controversial documentary ''[[Outfoxed]]'' that criticized O'Reilly and the Fox News Channel, put together an event of homeless veterans criticizing O'Reilly for calling [[John Edwards]] dishonest when Edwards asserted that there were about 200,000 homeless veterans. O'Reilly denied Edwards claim, stating "They may be out there, but there are not many of them out there, OK. So if you know where there is a veteran sleeping under a bridge, you call me immediately, and we will make sure that man does not do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323305,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Ed Schultz on Talk Radio's Handling of Presidential Candidates | date=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After government statistics supported Edwards{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, O'Reilly then said that there was no linkage between the economy and homeless veterans and claims that [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] has up to 150,000 beds ready for them every night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,325193,00.html|title=David Letterman, John Edwards and Homeless Vets| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly felt Greenwald's event was a "contrived" situation after O'Reilly's producers had interviewed some of the homeless veterans whom were protesting and found out that some did not actually hear O'Reilly's comments. O'Reilly blasted NBC's [[Steve Capus]] and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' for covering the event and claimed that Capus did not know about the nature of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328067,00.html|title=Far-Left Attack on FOX News Fails| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly called NBC hypocritical for putting supporters of legalizing [[prostitution]] in the wake of Democratic [[Governor of New York]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] resigning his post after allegedly engaging in the act in an effort and felt they would not be as defensive if a Republican had gotten in trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,337073,00.html|title=Far-Left Attack on FOX News Fails| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he praised the late ''[[Meet the Press]]'' host [[Tim Russert]] in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307219,00.html | work=Fox News | title=A Bad Night for Hillary Clinton | date=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly criticized Russert for what he saw as a misinterpretation of what were seen as potentially racially insensitive comments by former President [[Bill Clinton]]. In his comments, Russert challenged Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] about her husband's remarks regarding Senator [[Barack Obama]], when Mr. Clinton referred to Obama's position on Iraq as a "fairy tale." O'Reilly said that Russert "should have known better" and realized the former President's comments were regarding Obama's Iraq policy and not his entire candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,322780,00.html|title=Racial Politics and the Democratic Presidential Contest| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill|date= January 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tape doctoring incidents=====
O'Reilly would join in the criticism of others when NBC News was found to have doctored tapes on multiple occasions. The first was about accused killer [[George Zimmerman]] that portrayed Zimmerman as having a racial motivation.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/01/31/despite-criticism-from-left-and-right-msnbc-silence-is-deafening-about-doctored/ | work=Fox News | title=Despite criticism from left and right, MSNBC's silence is deafening about doctored 'heckling' video | date=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized veteran news correspondent [[Andrea Mitchell]] for her reporting of a doctored tape of [[Mitt Romney]] to portray him as out of touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/06/19/msnbc-edits-romney-rally-speech-portrays-candidate-as-out-touch/ | work=Fox News | title=NBC edits Romney rally speech to portray candidate as out of touch | date=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook Shooting]], O'Reilly and others criticized MSNBC's [[Martin Bashir]] of dishonesty when Bashir only played a part of the entire tape that portrayed the father of a victim being heckled when the entire tape showed the audience only saying something after he made it clear he was looking for an answer.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt; O'Reilly criticized MSNBC host [[Rachel Maddow]] showed a tape of Senator [[John McCain]] portraying him as insensitive to the plight of a person who lost a family member to gun violence. Although Maddow did readily admit the tape may have been doctored, O'Reilly criticized her nonetheless for airing it knowing that it could have been edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/2013/02/26/goldberg-more-deception-nbc-news | work=Fox News | title=Goldberg: More deception from NBC News | date=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press===
O'Reilly has accused the print press of purposely misquoting him and using their hard news pages to further their editorial points of view. He has said that print media is too liberal and attacks opposing viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286733,00.html|title=Lashing the Print Press| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, O'Reilly criticized the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' for endorsing then-governor [[Gray Davis]], who was running against [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and a whole field of different candidates, including Republicans, Democrats and Independents, in a [[California recall election, 2003|recall election]]. He said that he "has never seen a newspaper try to destroy someone as aggressively as the ''Times'' is doing." He also criticized ''[[The New York Times]]'' on the same issue for referring to Schwarzenegger solely as a bodybuilder. He made the claim that Californians have canceled their subscriptions due to the "extreme left-wing [[media bias|bias]]" of the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,99326,00.html|title=Would You Vote for Arnold Schwarzenegger?| publisher=FOX News| author=O'Reilly, Bill | date=2003-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly has accused the media of being hypercritical of President Bush's handling of [[North Korea]] and [[Iran]] pursuing [[nuclear weapons]] while not being critical of President [[Bill Clinton]] for what was the same course of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,219667,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=Blaming America First|date=October 11, 2006|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The New York Times''====
O'Reilly frequently criticizes ''[[The New York Times]]'', accusing them of omitting information that would be damaging to left-wing organizations and causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,254944,00.html | publisher = Fox News Channel | title = Covering the News the Left Wing Way | accessdate = 2007-05-24 | date=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2007, ''The New York Times'' ran an editorial titled "Immigration Misery" that had claimed a "screaming baby girl has been forcibly weaned from [[breast milk]] and taken dehydrated to an emergency room so that the nation's borders will be secure." Upon further investigation, the only two babies admitted to the hospital in the area of [[Bedford, Massachusetts]] (where the raid took place) were due to dehydration because of [[pneumonia]] and not as a result of being "forcibly weaned." O'Reilly alleged that the information in the editorial was falsified and claimed ''The Times'' wanted to promote illegal immigration in order to make the illegal immigrants into legal US citizens and register them as Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,260143,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=Illegal Immigration and the Left-Wing Media|date=March 21, 2007|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He accused ''The Times'' of promoting [[NBC News]] over [[ABC News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,258037,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=News Wars: NBC, CBS and the NY Times|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2007, [[Homeland Security]] stopped a [[2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot|plot]] by four terror suspects thought to be linked to Al Qaeda. Authorities have alleged that the suspects were trying to blow up an oil pipeline in the [[Howard Beach]] section of [[New York City]] that carries jet fuel to [[JFK Airport]]. O'Reilly went on his program and told his listeners that he expected ''The Times'' to report it as a featured story on its Sunday edition for June 3, but found that the story was on page 37{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. O'Reilly accused the newspaper of burying the story not to highlight a successful foiled terror plot because it contradicts the paper's editorial point of view.&lt;ref name="foxnews3"/&gt; O'Reilly claims that as polls show most Americans feel Republicans would do a better job of handling a terrorist threat than Democrats, ''The Times'' intentionally gave the news less exposure in hopes of influencing their readers' focus away from issues that Democrats tend to poll weaker than Republicans in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,278890,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=The New York Times Under Siege|date=June 7, 2007|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly has also said that the paper would highlight any terrorist attack if one was to occur so they may criticize the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So ''The Times'' wins both ways. The paper diminishes the War on Terror by putting it on page 37, but if something bad ever happened, it can attack President Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,278099,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=Relax, the War on Terror is Not That Big of A Deal|date=June 5, 2007|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Reilly has accused the paper of being deceptive about television ratings for ''The O'Reilly Factor'' against that of MSNBC during the same time slot, citing that the paper felt that MSNBC was "competitive" with his program when O'Reilly's ratings were significantly higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,308902,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=NBC News Wants to Hire Rosie O'Donnell|date=November 7, 2007|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly has questioned the paper's interpretation of violence statistics among veterans of the military. His contention is that the paper is out to disparage the military as being overly violent after returning home from deployment in the War on Terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323773,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=New York Times Story About Murders by American War Veterans Questionable|date=January 18, 2008|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly criticized the paper for running an article alleging Senator [[John McCain]] had an "inappropriate relationship" during the [[John McCain lobbyist controversy, February 2008|lobbyist controversy story]] the paper had. O'Reilly raised the question about why the paper had endorsed McCain on January 25, 2008 for the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] nomination if they had information that alleged an inappropriate relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| date = February 22, 2008
| author = Bill O'Reilly
| publisher = Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, O'Reilly severely criticized the paper as "corrupt" for dropping a story about a possible violation of campaign laws by [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]] and the Obama campaign. O'Reilly claimed that sworn testimony before Congress by a former ACORN employee, [[Anita Moncrief]] corroborated the story. O'Reilly stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strong evidence suggests the paper killed a story linking ACORN to some Obama people. Instead they ran a general piece stating ACORN has a left-wing bias, knowing that story would be largely ignored while the Obama connection would not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| date = May 19, 2009
| author = Bill O'Reilly
| publisher = Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response, the ''New York Times'' ombudsman, Clark Hoyt stated it "was a normal and reasonable editorial decision" not to run the article. He said the ''Times'' had run four other stories on ACORN. The story in question had remained unpublished because Anita Moncrief had not provided independently verifiable proof. In addition, The Times ombudsman stated that Moncrief had not given sworn testimony to Congress as claimed by O'Reilly, and that she had credibility problems, having been fired from Acorn for employee theft.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, Clark. [http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/a-last-word-on-the-acorn-matter/?scp=1&amp;sq=antia%20moncrief&amp;st=cse "A Last Word On The Acorn Matter"]. "NYTimes.com", May 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internet media ====
O'Reilly has accused a few liberal political websites of "distorting the truth" and "engaging in hatred":
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are no rules. These people will do and say pretty much anything to harm people with whom they disagree politically.

The trend started back in the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]-[[Monica Lewinsky|Lewinsky]] days, and now thousands of [[bloggers]] are operating, throwing dirt all over the place. Now they're not all bad. Some of these bloggers are good, accurate watchdogs. But there are plenty of awful ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,171328,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=Political Smear Sites|date=October 5, 2005|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He has criticized the ''[[Daily Kos]]'' website, accusing it of calling for increased attacks upon American troops in [[Iraq]], and for [[Iran]] to attack [[Israel]]. O'Reilly has also alleged that ''Daily Kos'' bloggers have called the [[Pope]] a [[wikt:Primates|primate]] and [[evangelicals]] "nut cases", that they wish for the success of any subsequent attempts at the [[assassination]] of Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] after he avoided an attempt on his life in [[Afghanistan]] during a 2007 visit, and have said that the world is "better off" without [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Tony Snow]] when Snow publicly said he had [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,289573,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=JetBlue and the Radical Left|date=July 17, 2007|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer of 2007, O'Reilly said that the entire field of 2008 Democratic presidential candidates (aside from Senator [[Joseph Biden]]) went to the [[Yearly Kos]] convention that was sponsored by the Daily Kos. He has said that sites like the Kos are taking control of the Democratic Party through intimidation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As we have been reporting, a group of far-left bloggers has succeeded in frightening most of the Democratic presidential candidates and moving the party significantly to the left, at least in the primary season.  The lead intimidators are ''[[MoveOn]]'', ''[[Media Matters]]'' and the vicious ''Daily Kos''. These people savagely attack those with whom they disagree. And the politicians don't want to become smear targets.

So most of the Democratic candidates have agreed to speak at the Kos convention this coming weekend, something that is beyond shameful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,291514,00.html|author=Bill O'Reilly, Headlines|title=Intimidating the Democrats|date=July 31, 2007|publisher=''[[Fox News Channel]]''|accessdate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Reilly has compared the [[Huffington Post]] to the Nazis and the KKK. He also called MoveOn.org the "new Klan."  In response, [[Arianna Huffington]] wrote that O'Reilly had confused bloggers with anonymous commentors and suggested he enroll in "How to Use the Internet 101."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/bill-oreilly-needs-to-en_b_92646.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Bill O'Reilly Needs to Enroll in "Understanding the Internet 101" | date=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huffington alleged that offensive comments are taken down from her site when confronted by one of O'Reilly's producers. She also noted that offensive comments are posted by users of O'Reilly's own site, billoreilly.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americablog.com/2007/07/billoreillycom-if-hillary-wins-my-guns.html BillOReilly.com: "If [Hillary&amp;#93; wins... my guns are loaded"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly alleged that Huffington had no standards of conduct and did not remove comments about wishing [[Nancy Reagan]] had died after she fell that were written on her site.  "She says it is down, but it is not. She does not tell the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = 'The Factor' Confronts Arianna Huffington | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,340349,00.html | author = Bill O'Reilly | publisher = Fox News Channel | date = March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Reilly later alleged that Huffington implied [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was a Nazi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Uncivil War Within the Democratic Party | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,341331,00.html | date = March 25, 2008 | author = Bill O'Reilly | publisher = Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Reilly referred to a satirical article written by comedian Chris Kelly, which mocked O'Reilly on Huffington's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kelly/oreilly-attends-easter-s_b_93005.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Chris | last=Kelly | title=O'Reilly Attends Easter Services At Church Led by Ex-Nazi | date=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental issues==
O'Reilly generally supports the notion of a clean environment, although he has said that he is not entirely certain that [[fossil fuel]]s are the cause of [[global warming]]. Nonetheless, he has expressed support for a long-term strategy to curb fossil fuel use. He has said he would not support the [[Kyoto Treaty]] for economic reasons, but supports the use of fewer polluting agents, more [[conservation ethic|conservation]], and "tons more innovation" such as [[tax credit]]s for [[alternative energy|alternative fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,54413,00.html|title=Global Warming &amp; the Bush Administration|author=O'Reilly, Bill|publisher=Fox News|date=June 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that renewable energy is a waste of time because "God controls the climate" and that "nobody can control the climate except God, so give a little extra at mass".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailydot.com/politics/bill-oreilly-long-list-of-lies/?fb=dd 99 times Bill O'Reilly lied to America]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic views ==

O'Reilly is a frequent critic of government [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] and [[poverty]] programs. He is also critical of the [[Estate tax (United States)|estate tax]]. However, he does not differentiate between the marginal tax rate (46 percent) and the ''effective'' tax rate (roughly 9 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billoreilly.com/site/product?printerFriendly=true&amp;pid=20104|title=A Taxing Proposition|author=O'Reilly, Bill|publisher=BillOReilly.com|date=June 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Reilly has said [[France|French]] unemployment and subsequent riots are the "common effects of socialist thinking". He claims the French unemployment rate is high because of entitlements sanctioned by the French government, and that these entitlements make employers hesitant to hire young employees for fear that they will be required to give benefits to underperforming workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/oreilly040306.asp|title=French whine|author=O'Reilly, Bill|date=April 3, 2006|publisher=Jewish World Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He says he supports income-based [[affirmative action]] as opposed to race-related affirmative action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/oreilly063003.asp|title=Affirmative action, negative reaction|author=O'Reilly, Bill|publisher=Jewish World Review|date=June 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade with hostile countries===
O'Reilly has been critical of companies doing business with countries that are hostile to the United States. O'Reilly criticized [[General Electric]] for doing business with Iran. O'Reilly cited how [[NBC News]]' correspondent John Hockenberry did a report on ''[[Dateline NBC|Dateline]]'' highlighting GE's business relationship with the [[Osama Bin Laden|Bin Laden]] family and was criticized by the company, who owns [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]], for the ''Dateline'' report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,321987,00.html|title=Is NBC's Parent Company Doing Business With Iran?|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=January 11, 2008|author=Bill O'Reilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free markets, profits, and the oil companies===
O'Reilly questions the free market by suggesting that the oil companies need an excuse to raise prices thereby overlooking the fact that in a free market, oil companies have the right to increase prices so as to increase profits or for any other reason.  Rather than praise oil companies for their record profits,  O'Reilly has been critical of oil companies, claiming their record profits are evidence that they have [[Price gouging|price-gouged]] Americans with artificially high gas prices.&lt;ref name="foxnews4"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,192158,00.html|title=Bigwigs at Big Oil Making Big Bucks|author=O'Reilly, Bill|publisher=Fox News|date=April 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said he is personally boycotting products by [[Exxon-Mobil]].&lt;ref name="foxnews5"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324803,00.html|title=Economic Woes and Your Money|author=O'Reilly, Bill|publisher=Fox News|date=January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore appears that O'Reilly does not recognize profit maximization as a virtue.  He has often taken an opposing point of view to conservatives such as fellow [[Fox News]] analyst and commentator, [[Neil Cavuto]].&lt;ref name="foxnews4"/&gt;  During one discussion on The O'Reilly Factor, Cavuto accused O'Reilly of "push[ing] populist nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0908/Cavuto_to_OReilly_You_push_populist_nonsense.html |title=Michael Calderone's Blog: Cavuto to O'Reilly: "You push populist nonsense" - Politico.com |publisher=Politico.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said blocking Brazilian ethanol imports was "awful" and has criticized both the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] and the [[Clinton Administration]] for not doing enough to stem the cost of oil from "foreign predators".&lt;ref name="foxnews5"/&gt;

===Protectionism===
In a May 8, 2006 article published at the Jewish World Review, O'Reilly said, "There is no question that illegal workers deliver more profit to business than American workers do. A Harvard study says that the employment of illegal foreign workers has driven down wages among American high school dropouts, the lowest labor pool rung, by 7 percent."&lt;ref name=oil_immigrants&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/oreilly050806.asp|title=Oil and immigrants|author=O'Reilly, Bill|publisher=Jewish World Review|date=May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idyllic civilization===
Bill O'Reilly on his show ''The O'Reilly Factor'' has expressed the view that "if everybody followed the teachings of Jesus Christ, [...] we'd have peace on earth, [...] everybody would love one another, and we'd almost be an idyllic civilization."&lt;ref name=idyllic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pub.mtholyoke.edu/journal/omg/entry/religious_explanations_for_the_origin|title=religious explanations for the origin of life in education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethanol===
O'Reilly claims that the United States is not doing enough to make itself independent of foreign oil, stating that "There's no way the ethanol industry could be dominated by five mega-companies. I mean corn and sugar cannot be carteled. The oil racket is simple: We control the marketplace, and you have to buy from us. ... If [[Brazil]] can develop an [[ethanol]] industry that makes it completely independent of foreign oil, then the USA can."&lt;ref name=oil_immigrants/&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011) was a British-American&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BS3i-Mz3I_UC&amp;pg=PT384|title=Hitch 22: A Memoir|publisher=Atlantic Books Ltd|date=20 May 2010|author=Christopher Hitchens|accessdate=7 July 2015|isbn=9781848877535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/8961815/Christopher-Hitchens-a-sober-perception-however-much-he-drank.html|title=Christopher Hitchens: a sober perception, however much he drank|date=17 December 2011|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1612244/posts|title=transcript: Hitchens on the Hugh Hewitt radio program ... on immigration|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; author, [[polemic]]ist, [[debate]]r and journalist who in his youth took part in demonstrations against the Vietnam War, joined organisations such as the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] while at university&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seymour|first1=Richard|title=The late Christopher Hitchens|journal=[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]|date=27 March 2012|issue=134|url=http://isj.org.uk/the-late-christopher-hitchens/|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to identify as a [[socialism|socialist]]. However, after the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]] he no longer regarded himself as a socialist and his political thinking became largely dominated by the issue of defending civilization from [[terrorism|terrorists]] and against the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes that protect them. Hitchens nonetheless continued to identify as a [[Marxism|Marxist]], endorsing the [[materialist conception of history]], but believed that [[Karl Marx]] had underestimated the revolutionary nature of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/04/the-revenge-of-karl-marx/307317/ |title=The Revenge of Karl Marx |work=The Atlantic |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=1 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He sympathized with [[libertarian]] ideals of [[limited government|limited state interference]], but considered libertarianism not to be a viable system. In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]], he supported the independent candidate [[Ralph Nader]]. After 9/11, Hitchens advocated the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. In the 2004 election, he very slightly favored the incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]] or was neutral&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/31/uselections2004.comment2 |title=Christopher Hitchens: Why I'm voting for Bush (but only just) |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=31 October 2004 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 he favored the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2008/10/vote_for_obama.html |title=Vote for Obama |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |publisher=''Slate'' |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political orientation==

===First principles===
Alexander Linklater has summarized Hitchens' basic intellectual outlook as follows:

{{quote|One of [Hitchens'] old strongholds [was] the 17th-century contest between king and parliament of the [[English civil war]]. For Hitchens, the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] revolt represents not just the foundational struggle for parliamentary rule, but the great rejection of [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]]. ... But he is no optimistic [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalist. He identifies himself with [[Thomas Paine]]'s disillusion at the [[Reign of Terror|French terror]], and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s famous warning to [[Lenin]] about the inexorability of one-man rule. He retains, however, from his [[Marxist]] youth an intellectual absolutism and a disdain for liberal dilemmas and trade-offs – hence a brutal assault on [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s genteel liberalism in a 1998 essay. He is incurious about what religious belief feels like, or what meaning it has for millions of people – even though, unlike his co-anti-religionist [[Richard Dawkins]], Hitchens concedes that religious feeling is ineradicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexander |last=Linklater |url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10157 |title=Christopher Hitchens |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]] |issue=146 |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=1 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===British republicanism===
Hitchens was a vocal supporter of [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom]], advocating the abolition of the Monarchy, and in 1990 published the book-long polemic ''The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favourite Fetish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|title=Waving? Or drowning?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/12/monarchy.features11|accessdate=9 July 2015|work=The Guardian|date=12 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1998 documentary ''Princess Diana: The Mourning After'' accused the British media of playing an essential role in creating a national, unchallengeable, and at times hysterical [[cult of personality]] surrounding the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], whereas previously they had been extremely critical of her and the monarchy after she had separated and divorced from [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and was having an affair with Egyptian billionaire son [[Dodi Fayed]]. Hitchens claimed the public were behaving irrationally, and that many appeared to not even know why they were mourning. He also scrutinised the level of censorship against criticism of Diana and the monarchy but was accused, in a review by ''[[The Independent]]'', of exaggerating on this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/television-its-a-state-of-total-dianarchy-1175026.html |title=Television: It's a state of total Dianarchy |author=Nicholas Barber |work=The Independent |date=30 August 1998 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour Party===

In 1965, Hitchens joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] on the very first day he was eligible to vote, but along with the majority of the [[Labour Students|Labour students' organization]] was expelled in 1967, because of what Hitchens called "[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]]'s contemptible support for the [[war in Vietnam]]". Since then he stated he had "re-enlisted a few times" back into the Labour Party.&lt;ref name="Tony Blair"&gt;{{cite news |first=Christoph |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2005/04/long_live_labor.html |title=Long Live Labor&amp;nbsp;– Why I'm for Tony Blair |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=25 April 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/hitchens200908|title=Christopher Hitchens on Britain's Labour Party|work=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', he said, in 1979, that even though he was a member of the Labour Party, that he wasn't going to vote for the Labour Party, nor could he bring himself to "vote conservative." He didn't vote at all in that election. He also stated that by not voting for the Labour Party he was effectively voting for [[Margaret Thatcher]] to win, which he said he had "secretly hoped would happen."&lt;ref name='reason' /&gt; In a 2005 [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']] article, he endorsed [[Tony Blair]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], mainly due to his support for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Tony Blair" /&gt; In a 2009 [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] article, he described that in the late 1970s the Labour Party moved to the right and stated that the downfall of the Labour Party was when [[Gordon Brown]] became the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Labour" /&gt;

===Northern Ireland===

During a debate with [[George Galloway]] in 2005, Hitchens revealed that he was "a lifelong supporter of the [[United Ireland|reunification of Ireland]]," and was critical of Galloway's opposing views on the war, as well as his "insulting" attitude towards the [[U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endusmilitarism.org/gallowayhitchensdebate091605.html |title=Galloway vs |publisher=Endusmilitarism.org |date=16 September 2005|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INy2ysHhgYM|title=George Galloway debates Christopher Hitchens|accessdate=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many times, when discussing "[[the Troubles]]" in Northern Ireland, Hitchens would refer to their location as simply "Ireland", rather than "Northern Ireland", as for example in an article written for ''Slate'' in 2007, discussing the power-sharing and devolved government in Northern Ireland and describing it as "an agreement to divide the spoils of Ireland's six northeastern counties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2163217/|title=Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams make me want to spew. – Slate Magazine|publisher=Slate.com|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing campaigns on the British mainland, which began in the nineteen-seventies, Hitchens claimed that he had "kept two sets of books: I didn’t like bombs, I didn’t like the partition of Ireland."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com" /&gt;

===Libertarianism and capitalism===

In a 2001 interview with ''Reason'', Hitchens said he had been interested in [[libertarian]] ideas when he was younger, but set aside those interests in the 1960s. He stated that [[capitalism]] had become the more revolutionary economic system, and he welcomed [[globalisation]] as "innovative and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]", but added, "I don't think that the contradictions, as we used to say, of the system, are by any means all resolved." He also stated that he had a renewed interest in the freedom of the individual from the state, but that he still considered libertarianism "ahistorical" both on the world stage and in the work of creating a stable and functional society, adding that libertarians are "more worried about the over-mighty state than the unaccountable corporation" whereas "the present state of affairs&amp;nbsp;... combines the worst of bureaucracy with the worst of the insurance companies." He also said that libertarians did not have a clear foreign policy stance.&lt;ref name='reason' /&gt;

In a 2001 C-SPAN appearance, he told a caller:

{{quote|If you are a libertarian you may find some nourishment in my book ''Letters to a Young Contrarian'' where I say that in the same breath as I-as I mourn the decay of some of my socialist allegiances that deep down I've always been a sympathizer of the libertarian [[anti-statist]] point of view. And one of the things that attracted me to socialism in the beginning was the idea of withering away of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMD68Q1vCYk|title=Christopher Hitchens Expresses Affinity w/ Libertarian Principles on CSPAN 2001|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Objectivism ===
Hitchens said of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], “I have always found it quaint, and rather touching, that there is a movement in the US that thinks Americans are not yet selfish enough.”&lt;ref name="masciotra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/libertarianism_is_for_petulant_children_ayn_rand_rand_paul_and_the_movements_sad_rebellion_partner/|title=Libertarianism is for petulant children: Ayn Rand, Rand Paul and the movement’s sad “rebellion”|author=DAVID MASCIOTRA|date=1 March 2015|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxism and socialism===

In a 2001 interview with ''Reason'', Hitchens said he became a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] in his teens, beliefs that further developed during his time at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. In 1966, he was demonstrating in [[Trafalgar Square]] against the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1967, he joined the [[International Socialist Tendency|International Socialists]] while at Balliol College, Oxford. Under the influence of [[Peter Sedgwick]], who translated the writings of Russian revolutionary and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dissident [[Victor Serge]], Hitchens forged an ideological interest in [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] and [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] socialism. Shortly after he joined "a small but growing post-Trotskyist [[Luxemburgism|Luxemburgist]] sect".&lt;ref name=PBSinterview /&gt; He became a socialist "largely [as] the outcome of a study of history, taking sides&amp;nbsp;... in the battles over industrialism and war and empire." He was also drawn into the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] by his anger over the [[Vietnam War]], [[nuclear weapon]]s, racism and "[[oligarchy]]", including that of "the unaccountable corporation." He also said in the same interview with ''Reason'' that he could no longer say "I am a socialist". Socialists, he claimed, had ceased to offer a positive alternative to the capitalist system.&lt;ref name='reason'&gt;{{cite news|author=Rhys Southan from the November 2001 issue|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/11/01/free-radical|title=Free Radical|work=Reason|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/hitch22-a-memoir-by-christopher-hitchens-1984845.html|title=Hitch-22: a memoir by Christopher Hitchens|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, in a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania debating the [[Judaism|Jewish Tradition]] with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his political philosophy by stating, "I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a [[Marxist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|K6rRA64f9ug|Martin Amis Christopher Hitchens a conversation about Antisemitism and Saul Bellow Part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2010 interview with ''The New York Times'', he stated that "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] is valid. I consider myself a very conservative Marxist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06fob-q4-t.html|title=The Contrarian|first=Deborah|last=Solomon|work=The New York Times|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, in an article for ''The Atlantic'' entitled "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the [[late-2000s recession]] in terms of [[Marxist economics|Marx's economic analysis]] and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200904/hitchens-marx |title=The Revenge of Karl Marx |work=The Atlantic |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens was an admirer of [[Che Guevara]], yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a "cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/jul/17/goodbye-to-all-that/ |title=Goodbye to All That |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=17 July 1997 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he re-emphasized his positive view of Che, commenting that "[Che's] death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us [[bourgeois]] [[Romanticism|romantics]] insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do&amp;nbsp;– fought and died for his beliefs."&lt;ref name=prettyface&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=O'Hagan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/11/features.review |title=Just a Pretty Face? |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2004 |accessdate=1 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to regard [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] as great men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Amis|first=Martin|title=Koba the Dread|publisher=Miramax|year=2002|page=25|isbn=978-0-7868-6876-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Parris |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/greatlives/index_series7.shtml |title=Great Lives&amp;nbsp;– Leon Trotsky |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=8 August 2006 |accessdate=1 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[October Revolution]] as a necessary event in the modernisation of Russia.&lt;ref name='reason' /&gt;&lt;ref name=PBSinterview&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Hithens |url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/interviews_hitchens.html |title=Heaven on Earth&amp;nbsp;– Interview with Christopher Hitchens |publisher=PBS |date=1 January 2005 |accessdate=1 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060612210516/http://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/interviews_hitchens.html |archivedate=12 June 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Hitchens praised Lenin's creation of "secular Russia" and his attacks on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], describing the church's power as "absolute warren of backwardness and evil and superstition".&lt;ref name=PBSinterview/&gt;

In ''[[God is not Great]]'', Hitchens called Marxism his "own secular faith" that "has been shaken and discarded, not without pain." He referred to his period of Marxist faith as "when I was a Marxist."&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (May 2007). God is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything. New York: Twelve Books, ch. 10 &lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Andrew Sullivan]], his last words were "Capitalism, downfall."&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/04/hitchs-service.html |title=The Hitch Has Landed |last1=Sullivan |first1=Andrew |date=20 April 2012 |publisher=The Daily Beast |accessdate=13 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423014036/http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/04/hitchs-service.html |archivedate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American presidential endorsements===

====President Bill Clinton====

Hitchens became increasingly disenchanted by the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]], accusing him of being a rapist and a liar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hitchens: Clinton could sell out Blair|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/354470.stm|date=3 June 1999|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=No One Left to Lie to: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|publisher=Verso Books|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85984-736-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens also claimed that the [[Operation Infinite Reach|missile attacks]] by Clinton on [[Sudan]] constituted a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hitchens, ''No One Left To Lie To'' (Verso, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000 United States presidential election====

==== President George Bush ====

Prior to 11 September 2001, and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], Hitchens was critical of President [[George W. Bush]]'s "[[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]]" foreign policy. He also criticised Bush's support of [[intelligent design]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news |last=Belz |first=Mindy |url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/11908 |title=According to Hitch |work=World Magazine |date=3 April 2006 |accessdate=1 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602004910/http://www.worldmag.com/articles/11908 |archivedate=2 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Capital punishment in Texas|capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=AWarToBeProudOf&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/7193 |title=A War To Be Proud Of |work=Weekly Standard |date=5 September 2005 |accessdate=1 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens defended Bush's post-11 September foreign policy, but he also criticised the actions of US troops in [[Abu Ghraib]] and [[Haditha]], and the US government's use of [[waterboarding]], which, after voluntarily undergoing it, he argued was definitely [[torture]].&lt;ref name=believeme&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/08/hitchens200808 |title=Believe Me, It's Torture |work=Vanity Fair |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=1 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vfwaterboardvideo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/video/2008/hitchens_video200808 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809003051/http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/video/2008/hitchens_video200808 |title=Video: On the Waterboard|archivedate=9 August 2011|work=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens shifted his opinion to "neutral", saying: "It's absurd for liberals to talk as if [[Kristallnacht]] is impending with Bush, and it's unwise and indecent for Republicans to equate Kerry with capitulation. There's no one to whom he can surrender, is there? I think that the nature of the [[jihad]]ist enemy will decide things in the end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christpher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2004/11/my_endorsement_and_osamas_video.html |title=My Endorsement and Osama's Video: The news in Bin Laden's comments had nothing to do with our election |work=Slate |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was critical of both main party candidates, Obama and [[John McCain]], but wrote that Obama would be the better choice. Hitchens went on to call McCain "senile", and his choice of running mate [[Sarah Palin]] "absurd", calling Palin a "pathological liar" and a "national disgrace". Hitchens also wrote that "Obama is greatly overrated" and that the Obama-Biden ticket "show[s] some signs of being able and willing to profit from experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2008/10/vote_for_obama.html |title=Vote for Obama |work=Slate |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Revolution===
After his disenchantment with socialism, Hitchens increasingly emphasized the centrality of the [[American Revolution]] and the [[U.S. Constitution]] to his political philosophy. As early as 2002, Hitchens wrote, "as the third millennium gets under way, and as the [[Russian Revolution|Russian]] and [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese]] and [[Cuban Revolution|Cuban]] revolutions drop below the horizon, it is possible to argue that the American revolution, with its promise of cosmopolitan democracy, is the only ‘model’ revolution that humanity has left to it".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (2002), ''[[Why Orwell Matters]]'', [[Basic Books]], pg 105&lt;/ref&gt; His enthusiasm for the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]] contrasts with a dim opinion of constitutional politics on the other side of the Atlantic. Hitchens notes, "the utter failure [of the EU] to compose a viable constitution" and the "brevity of the British constitution, perhaps because the motherland of the English-speaking peoples has absent-mindedly failed to evolve one in written form".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (2007), ''An Anglosphere Future'', [[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]], Reprinted in ''[[Arguably]]'', page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign policy==

===Bosnian War===
Hitchens cited the [[Bosnian War]] as something that monumentally changed his views on [[military intervention]], noting that he for the first time found himself on the side of [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]]. In an interview with [[Johann Hari]] he said:

{{quote|That war in the early 1990s changed a lot for me. I never thought I would see, in Europe, a full-dress reprise of internment camps, the mass murder of civilians, the reinstiutution [sic] of torture and rape as acts of policy. And I didn't expect so many of my comrades to be indifferent – or even take the side of the fascists. It was a time when many people on the left were saying 'Don't intervene, we'll only make things worse' or, 'Don't intervene, it might destabilise the region. And I thought – destabilisation of fascist regimes is a good thing. Why should the left care about the stability of undemocratic regimes? Wasn't it a good thing to destabilise the regime of General Franco? It was a time when the left was mostly taking the conservative, status quo position – leave the Balkans alone, leave Milosevic alone, do nothing. And that kind of conservatism can easily mutate into actual support for the aggressors. Weimar-style conservatism can easily mutate into National Socialism. So you had people like Noam Chomsky's co-author Ed Herman go from saying 'Do nothing in the Balkans', to actually supporting Milosevic, the most reactionary force in the region. That's when I began to first find myself on the same side as the neocons. I was signing petitions in favour of action in Bosnia, and I would look down the list of names and I kept finding, there's Richard Perle. There's Paul Wolfowitz. That seemed interesting to me. These people were saying that we had to act. Before, I had avoided them like the plague, especially because of what they said about General Sharon and about Nicaragua. But nobody could say they were interested in oil in the Balkans, or in strategic needs, and the people who tried to say that – like Chomsky – looked ridiculous. So now I was interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Johann – 23 September 2004|url=http://www.johannhari.com/2004/09/23/in-enemy-territory-an-interview-with-christopher-hitchens|title=In enemy territory? An interview with Christopher Hitchens. |publisher=Johannhari.com|date=23 September 2004|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitchens argued that the choice in [[Yugoslavia]] was between a [[Multiethnic society|multi-ethnic]] [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|plural]] democracy led by Muslim president [[Alija Izetbegović]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and a fascistic, nationalistically inspired [[ethnic cleansing|ethnically-cleansed]] state driven by Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]]. He called Milošević a fascist and a "[[Nazi|national-socialist]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB9uqI62ikA|title=In Defense of WWII: Chapter 5 of 5|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and condemned his war crimes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB9uqI62ikA|title=In Defense of WWII: Chapter 5 of 5|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. But he also considered the [[Croatia]]n nationalist president [[Franjo Tudjman]] "equally disgusting" for colluding with Milošević on a [[Partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina|partition of Bosnia]] and empowering Croatian war criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=5221|title=Shed No Tears for Milosevic|work=FrontPage Magazine|accessdate=7 September 2008|date=14 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''God Is Not Great'', he wrote about [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Orthodox]] Serbian and Roman Catholic Croatian nationalism- and religion-inspired crimes against the Muslim Bosnians, at the hands of proponents of "[[Greater Serbia]]" and Croatian "revived [[Ustashe]] formations" during this period which are "often forgotten".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (May 2007). God is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything. New York: Twelve Books, pp. 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; He was highly critical of Western inaction in protection of the Muslims, partially blaming this on the Clinton administration and specifically [[Hillary Clinton]].

{{quote|In effect, the extremist Catholic and Orthodox forces were colluding in a bloody partition and cleansing of [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. They were, and still are, largely spared the public shame of this, because the world's media preferred the simplification of "Croat" and "Serb," and only mentioned religion when discussing "the Muslims." But the triad of terms "Croat," "Serb," and "Muslim" is unequal and misleading, in that it equates two nationalities and one religion.

Hitchens deplored and opposed the 1990–91 [[Gulf War]] in which the US expelled Iraq from Kuwait after a seven-month invasion and occupation of its neighbor undertaken in an effort to absorb it as its [[Kuwait Governorate|19th province]]. He contended that President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s supposedly principled enthusiasm for the "cause" of "liberating" Kuwait was nothing more than ''[[realpolitik]]''. In the continuation of a national policy dating back to [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972, the latest "cause was yet another move in the policy of keeping a region divided and embittered, and therefore accessible to the franchisers of weaponry and the owners of black gold".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |url=http://harpers.org/archive/1991/01/why-we-are-stuck-in-the-sand/ |title=Why We Are Stuck in the Sand: Realpolitik in the Gulf |work=[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] |date=1 January 1991 |accessdate=1 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the war, Hitchens scolded those within the US who had opposed the war by observing that "the peace movement in this country in my opinion acted in a very narrow, isolationist, and almost chauvinistic way. It said that a war was more or less alright with it as long as it could be guaranteed in advance that American casualties could be kept low... I thought that was a dishonourably narrow way of approaching the question. ... When large numbers of Iraqis were turned into soap...and many others, as we've since found out, were bulldozed and buried alive and in other ways done away with and people don't even want to think about the body count ...because they’re afraid of what they might find out."&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euM_17PL8Fc  "The Middle East and American Democracy"], Keynote Speech, 45th Annual Conference of the [[Middle East Institute]]; Broadcast on [[CSPAN2]], 4 October 1991. (Comments are about 37 minutes into this Youtube clip.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli−Palestinian conflict===
Hitchens described [[Zionism]] as being based on [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]]'s "initial [[demagogue|demagogic]] lie (actually two lies) that [[A land without a people for a people without a land|a land without a people needs a people without a land]]." He went further, saying "Zionism is a form of Bourgeoisie Nationalism" when debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis at a Town hall function in Pennsylvania"&lt;ref name=FrontPage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=11253|title=Frontpage Interview: Christopher Hitchens Part II|publisher=Front Page Magazine|accessdate=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens supported [[Israel]]'s right to exist, but argued that "one must not insult or degrade or humiliate people"&lt;ref name=FrontPage /&gt; and that he "would be opposed to this maltreatment of the Palestinians if it took place on a remote island with no geopolitical implications".

Hitchens described Zionism as "an ethno-nationalist quasi-religious ideology" but argued that Zionism "...&amp;nbsp;nonetheless has founded a sort of democratic state which isn't any worse in its practice than many others with equally dubious origins." He stated that [[Israeli settlement|settlement]] in order to achieve security for Israel is "doomed to fail in the worst possible way", and the cessation of this "appallingly racist and messianic delusion" would "confront the internal clerical and chauvinist forces which want to instate a theocracy for Jews". Hitchens contended that the "solution of withdrawal would not satisfy the jihadists" and wondered "What did they imagine would be the response of the followers of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] [Muhammad]?" Hitchens bemoaned the transference of Arab secularism into [[religious terrorism]] as a means of democratisation: "the most depressing and wretched spectacle of the past decade, for all those who care about democracy and secularism, has been the degeneration of Palestinian Arab nationalism into the theocratic and thanatocratic hell of [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]]".&lt;ref name="Slate60"/&gt; He maintained that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a "trivial squabble" that has become "so dangerous to all of us" because of "the faith-based element."&lt;ref name="FrontPage"/&gt;

On 14 November 2004, Hitchens noted:
{{quote|Edward Said asked many times, in public and private, where the [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]] of Palestine could be. In rather bold contrast to this decent imagination, [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]] managed to be both a killer and a compromiser (Mandela was neither), both a [[Swiss bank account]] artist and a populist ranter (Mandela was neither), both an Islamic "martyrdom" blow-hard and a servile opportunist, and a man who managed to establish a dictatorship over his own people before they even had a state (here one simply refuses to mention Mandela in the same breath).&lt;ref name=Arafat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slate.com/id/2109860/|title=Arafat's Squalid End|publisher=Slate|accessdate=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitchens had previously collaborated on this issue with [[Edward Said]], publishing the 1988 book ''[[Blaming the Victims|Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=John C. |title=Blaming The Victims: Spurious Scholarship And The Palestinian Question |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=Spring 1988 |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1988-03-01/blaming-victims-spurious-scholarship-and-palestinian-question |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens had said of himself, "I am an [[anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist]]. I'm one of those people of Jewish descent who believes that [[Zionism]] would be a mistake even if there were no [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]."&lt;ref name="HölblingRieser-Wohlfarter2004"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Walter|last1= Hölbling|first2=Klaus|last2= Rieser-Wohlfarter|title=What is American?: new identities in U.S. culture| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Tn7LqhWI7IC&amp;pg=PA351|accessdate=6 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7734-7|pages=351–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of his autobiography ''Hitch-22'' in ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' refers to Hitchens "at the time [that he had learned that his grandparents were Jews, he had been] a prominent anti-Zionist" and says that he viewed Zionism "as an injustice against the Palestinians".&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/128323/ |title=Born Grumpy, with a Talent for It: Christopher Hitchens's Memoir is Too Happy by Far |last=Goldstein|first=Evan R.|journal=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have commented on his anti-Zionism as well.&lt;ref name="Rodden2006"&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last= Rodden |title=Every intellectual's big brother: George Orwell's literary siblings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlnwITCGcw8C&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=6 April 2011 |year=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-71308-6|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times for example speaking at 2nd annual Memorial for [[Daniel Pearl]], and in print in an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' he had made comments against the terrorism against Jews in the Middle East. Hitchens stated "But the Jews of the Arab lands were expelled again in revenge for the defeat of Palestinian nationalistic aspirations, in 1947–48, and now the absolute most evil and discredited fabrication of Jew-baiting Christian Europe&amp;nbsp;– The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&amp;nbsp;– is eagerly promulgated in the Hamas charter and on the group's Web site and recycled through a whole nexus of outlets that includes schools as well as state-run television stations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/chosen/308173/|title=Chosen|author=Christopher Hitchens|date=11 August 2010|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Slate'' magazine, Hitchens pondered the notion that, instead of curing [[antisemitism]] through the creation of a Jewish state, "Zionism has only replaced and repositioned"&lt;ref name="Slate60"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2191193/|title=Slate: Can Israel Survive for Another 60 Years?|work=Slate.com|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it, saying: "there are three groups of 6 million Jews. The first 6 million live in what the Zionist movement used to call Palestine. The second 6 million live in the United States. The third 6 million are distributed mainly among Russia, France, Britain, and Argentina. Only the first group lives daily in range of missiles that can be (and are) launched by people who hate Jews." Hitchens argued that instead of supporting Zionism, Jews should help "secularise and reform their own societies", believing that unless one is religious, "what the hell are you doing in the greater Jerusalem area in the first place?" Indeed, Hitchens claimed that the only justification for Zionism given by Jews is a religious one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerstein|first=Benjamin|title=Christopher Hitchens's Jewish Problem|url=http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/module/2010/12/13/main-feature/1/christopher-hitchenss-jewish-problem|publisher=[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurdistan===

Hitchens was a longtime observer of the cruelty of Saddam Hussein and publicly called for his removal, albeit only beginning in 1998.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; This led him to support the establishment of a self-governing state for the [[Kurds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_2_c7GW-ss|title=Christopher Hitchens talks about the Kurdish people|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with political autonomy, if not full independence.

{{quote|During the many years I spent on the Left, the cause of self-determination for [[Kurdistan]] was high on the list of principles and priorities – there are many more Kurds than there are Palestinians and they have been staunch fighters for democracy in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Cottee]], Thomas Cushman, Christopher Hitchens (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lctUC8fiaNsC ''Christopher Hitchens and His Critics: Terror, Iraq, and the Left''], page unknown (2nd of Chapter 21 ''I Wanted It to Rain on Their Parade'').&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also consistently wore a [[lapel pin]] with the [[flag of Kurdistan]] on it, to show his solidarity with the Kurds.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===War on Terror===

====September 11 attacks====

In the months following the 9/11 attacks, Hitchens and [[Noam Chomsky]] debated the nature of [[Islamism|radical Islam]] and the proper response to it in a highly charged exchange of letters in ''The Nation'', including discussion of whether any comparison could be legitimately made between the 9/11 attacks and the [[Operation Infinite Reach|1998 Al Shifa bombing]] by the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/sin-left-islamic-fascism |title=Of Sin, the Left &amp; Islamic Fascism |work=The Nation |date=4 September 2001 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/blaming-bin-laden-first |title=Blaming bin Laden First |work=The Nation |date=4 October 2001 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/reply-hitchens |title=Reply to Hitchens |work=thenation.com |date=1 October 2001 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christoph |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/rejoinder-noam-chomsky|title=A Rejoinder to Noam Chomsky|work=thenation.com |date=4 October 2001 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/reply-hitchenss-rejoinder |title=Reply to Hitchens's Rejoinder  |work=The Nation |date=4 October 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately a year after the 9/11 attacks and his exchanges with Chomsky, Hitchens left ''The Nation'', claiming that its editors, readers and contributors considered [[John Ashcroft]] a bigger threat than [[Osama bin Laden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/taking-sides |title=Taking Sides |work=The Nation |date=26 September 2002 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were making excuses on behalf of Islamist terrorism; in the following months he wrote articles increasingly at odds with his former colleagues. Hitchens was also severely criticized by [[Norman Finkelstein]], an American political scientist and Hitchens's former friend. Citing Hitchens's support for the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, as well as Hitchens's critique of [[Mel Gibson]]'s ''[[Passion of the Christ]]'', Finkelstein called Hitchens a "model apostate," a "dirt bag," and a "showboat run amuck" who is "dying for the camera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgB20YmqN6A|title=Norman Finkelstein Attacks The Holocaust Industry, Etc.|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====War in Afghanistan====

Hitchens strongly supported US military actions in [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cockburn |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Cockburn |title=Patrick Cockburn: Christopher Hitchens made a cogent case for war – but he was still wrong |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 April 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/patrick-cockburn-christopher-hitchens-made-a-cogent-case-for-war-but-he-was-still-wrong-7687385.html |accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in his "Fighting Words" columns in ''[[Slate magazine|Slate]]''.

====Iraq War====
Hitchens' employment of the term "Islamofascist" and his support for the [[Iraq War]] caused his critics to label him a "[[neoconservative]]". Hitchens, however, refused to embrace this designation,&lt;ref name=Debate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2004/10/12/tariq_ali_v_christopher_hitchens_a|title=Tariq Ali v.

Bush|Bush administration]] [...] has redefined the lazy term 'conservative' to mean someone who is impatient with the status quo."&lt;ref name=ahmad&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2004/05/ahmad_and_me.html |title=Ahmad and Me |work=Slate |date=27 May 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the ''[[fatwa]]'' [[The Satanic Verses controversy#Fatwā by Ayatollah Khomeini|issued against Salman Rushdie]] in response to his novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', Hitchens became increasingly critical of what he called "excuse making" on the left. At the same time, he was attracted to the foreign policy ideas of some on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-right that promoted pro-liberalism intervention, especially the [[neoconservative]] group that included [[Paul Wolfowitz]].&lt;ref name=bleeding&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2005/03/that_bleeding_heart_wolfowitz.html |title=That Bleeding Heart Wolfowitz |work=Slate |date=22 March 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he befriended the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] dissident and businessman [[Ahmed Chalabi]].&lt;ref name=ahmad /&gt;

Christopher Hitchens argued the case for the Iraq War in a 2003 collection of essays entitled ''[[A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq]]'', and participated in public debates on the topic with [[George Galloway]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZnUIeKOIgc|title=George Galloway vs Christopher Hitchens (1 of 12)|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Ritter]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU45ioYvx4k|title=Christopher Hitchens versus Ritter&amp;nbsp;– Iraq War debate part 1|publisher=YouTube|date=30 April 2009|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother [[Peter Hitchens]].&lt;ref name="FPW2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hauensteincenter.org/hitchens-vs-hitchens-faith-politics-war|title=Hitchens v.

====Human Rights Violations at Abu Ghraib and Haditha====

Hitchens criticised human rights abuses by US forces in Iraq but argued that conditions had improved considerably compared either to Saddam Hussein's previous regime or to previous US military actions in Vietnam.

In 2005, Hitchens criticised the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib but argued that overall "prison conditions at [[Abu Ghraib]] have improved markedly and dramatically since the arrival of Coalition troops in Baghdad",&lt;ref name=AWarToBeProudOf /&gt; arguing that "before March 2003, Abu Ghraib was an [[abattoir]], a [[torture chamber]], and a [[concentration camp]]."&lt;ref name=AWarToBeProudOf /&gt;

In a 5 June 2006 article on the alleged killings of Iraqi civilians by U.S. Marines in [[Haditha]], Hitchens argued that whether or not a massacre had taken place, comparisons with the [[My Lai]] massacre in Vietnam were "so much propaganda and hot air" that ignored substantial changes in the [[rules of engagement]] and US Army procedures and training designed to prevent and discourage such an event. He argued that lesson had been learned such that "as a consequence, a training film about My Lai – "if anything like this happens, you have really, truly screwed up" – has been in use for U. S. soldiers for some time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2143011/ |title=The Hell of War |work=Slate |date=5 June 2006 |accessdate=1 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-war American and British Intelligence====
In a variety of articles and interviews, Hitchens asserted that British intelligence was correct in [[Niger uranium forgeries|claiming]] that Saddam had attempted to buy [[uranium]] from [[Niger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rybczynski|first=Witold|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2139609/?nav/fo/|title=Wowie Zahawie|publisher=Slate|date=10 April 2006|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that US envoy [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph Wilson]] had been dishonest in his public denials of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landsburg|first=Steven E.|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2140058/|title=Clueless Joe Wilson|publisher=Slate|date=17 April 2006|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also pointed to discovered munitions in Iraq that violated [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 686|U. N. Security Council Resolutions 686]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687|687]], the cease-fire agreements ending the [[Invasion of Kuwait|1991 Iraq-Kuwait conflict]].

On 19 March 2007, Hitchens asked himself whether Western intelligence sources should have known that Iraq had "no stockpiles of [[weapons of mass destruction]]." In his response, Hitchens stated that:

{{quote|The entire record of [[United Nations Special Commission|UNSCOM]] until that date had shown a determination on the part of the Iraqi dictatorship to build dummy facilities to deceive inspectors, to refuse to allow scientists to be interviewed without coercion, to conceal [[chemical weapons|chemical]] and [[biological weapons|biological]] deposits, and to search the [[black market]] for material that would breach the sanctions. The defection of Saddam Hussein's sons-in-law, the Kamel brothers, had shown that this policy was even more systematic than had even been suspected. Moreover, Iraq did not account for&amp;nbsp;– has in fact never accounted for&amp;nbsp;– a number of the items that it admitted under pressure to possessing after the Kamel defection. We still do not know what happened to this weaponry. This is partly why all Western intelligence agencies, including French and German ones quite uninfluenced by Ahmad Chalabi, believed that Iraq had actual or latent programs for the production of WMD. Would it have been preferable to accept Saddam Hussein's word for it and to allow him the chance to re-equip once more once the sanctions had further decayed?&lt;ref name=deadurl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|title=So, Mr. Hitchens, weren't you wrong about Iraq?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162157/pagenum/all/#page_start|accessdate=7 July 2015|work=Slate|date=19 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812013912/http://www.slate.com/id/2162157/pagenum/all/#page_start|archivedate=12 August 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Saddam Hussein====
In July 2007, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' printed selected portions of a 1976 piece by Hitchens which they claimed "took a more admiring view of the Iraqi dictator" than his later strong support for ousting [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200707050056 |title=Iraq Flexes Arab Muscle |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711172014/http://www.newstatesman.com/200707050056 |archivedate=11 July 2007 |deadurl=yes }} (originally published 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In this Hitchens pointed to Iraq's military strength, oil reserves and young leadership to argue that [[Iraq]] was "a force to be reckoned with" and described Saddam Hussein as a leader "who has sprung from being an underground revolutionary gunman to perhaps the first visionary [[Arab]] statesman since [[Nasser]]." He also argued:

{{quote| Iraq, which has this dynamic combination and much else besides, has not until recently been very much regarded as a power. But with the new discussions in [[OPEC]], the ending of the Kurdistan war and the new round of fighting in [[Lebanon]], its political voice is being heard more and more. The [[Baghdad]] regime is the first oil-producing government to opt for 100-per-cent [[nationalisation]], a process completed with the acquisition of foreign assets in [[Basrah]] last December. It was the first to call for the use of oil as a political weapon against Israel and her backers. It gives strong economic and political support to the 'Rejection Front' Palestinians who oppose Arafat's conciliation and are currently trying to outface the Syrians in [[Beirut]].}}

He argued that the means through which the [[Baathist]] regime rose to power were similar to that of [[Iran]]: having crushed any political dissent and notions of an independent [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] state. He stated that the Ba'ath party "point to efforts made by the party press to stimulate criticism of [[Islamic Revolution|revolutionary]] shortcomings" but that these "fall rather short of permitting any organised opposition". He claimed that Iraq defended this by claiming "that the country is surrounded by enemies and attacked by imperialist intrigue" but that this had led to the repression of Kurdish nationalists.

====Waterboarding====
Hitchens was asked by ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'' to experience [[waterboarding]] for himself at a [[U.S. Army]] training facility. In May 2008, Hitchens voluntarily underwent the procedure. Hitchens stopped the procedure after 11 seconds and subsequently endorsed the view that it was "[[torture]]." He concluded, "If waterboarding does not constitute torture, then there is no such thing as torture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/08/hitchens200808 |title=Believe Me, It’s Torture |work=Vanity Fair |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |url=http://video.vanityfair.com/watch/watch-christopher-hitchens-get-waterboarded |title=Watch Christopher Hitchens Get Waterboarded |work=Vanity Fair |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=1 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanon===
Hitchens described Lebanon as "the most plural society in the region" and criticized the Syrian regime for continuing to manipulate the country by proxies and by surrogates notably [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Syrian National Socialist Party|SSNP]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/05/christopher-hitchens200905&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hezbollah====
In an article written on ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Hitchens stated:

{{quote|"In Greek legend there was a fighter named Antaeus who drew strength from the earth even when he was flung down. It took Hercules to work out his vulnerability as a wrestler. Hezbollah loves death, thrives on defeat and disaster, and is rapidly moving from being a [[state within a state]] to becoming the master of what was once the most cosmopolitan and democratic country in the Middle East. Meanwhile, a former superpower&amp;nbsp;– no Hercules&amp;nbsp;– is permitting itself to be made a hostage and laughing-stock by a squalid factional fight within the Israeli right wing involving the time and scale of petty land theft by zealots and fanatics. Only a few years from now, this, too, will seem hard to believe, as well as shameful and unpardonable."

Hitchens stated, "[an] unborn child seems to me to be a real concept. It's not a growth or an appendix. You can't say the rights question doesn't come up. I don't think a woman should be forced to choose, or even can be", and, "as a materialist, I think it has been demonstrated that an embryo is a separate body and entity".&lt;ref&gt;God Is Not Great : Is Religion Child Abuse : Page 220 &lt;/ref&gt; Showing a desire to recognise the unborn as a life, he also affirmed a need for the right to abortion, stating, "the second-best fallback solution, which may sometimes be desirable for other reasons, is termination of pregnancy... all thinking people recognise a painful conflict of rights and interest in this question"  &lt;ref&gt;God Is Not Great : Is Religion Child Abuse : Page 222 &lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens opposed the overturning of [[Roe v. Wade]] and instead hoped for science to develop new solutions to unwanted pregnancies "that will make abortion more like a contraceptive procedure than a surgical one." He strongly criticized the encouragement of [[sexual abstinence]] within the pro-life movement of the [[Christian right]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Lisa|title=No God&amp;nbsp;– And No Abortions|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/171240|website=newsweek.com|accessdate=7 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203095145/http://www.newsweek.com/id/171240|archivedate=3 December 2008|date=29 November 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the equating of contraceptives to abortion, as expressed by [[Mother Teresa]] and representatives of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvguide.lastown.com/bbc/preview/newsnight/paxman-meets-hitchens-a-newsnight-special.html |title=Preview Subtitles for Newsnight: Paxman Meets Hitchens: A Newsnight Special |work=TV Guide &amp; Subtitles |accessdate=1 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capital punishment====

Hitchens was a lifelong opponent of [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Why we should put an end to the death penalty |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2 January 2005 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/02/books/bk-hitchens2 |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2001 interview with ''Reason'', Hitchens recalled that this was the very first issue on which he ever decided to take a stand in his youth. The reason for his opposition to capital punishment was that it gave too much power to the government.&lt;ref name='reason' /&gt;  He later publicly opposed use of the [[Execution of Saddam Hussein|death penalty for Saddam Hussein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Anthony |first=Andrew |title=Christopher Hitchens: 'You have to choose your future regrets' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 November 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/14/christopher-hitchens-cancer-interview |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an issue he discussed at length in his November 2006 essay "Don't Hang Saddam" for ''Slate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Don't Hang Saddam: Why the dictator shouldn't get the death penalty. |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=6 November 2006 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/11/dont_hang_saddam.html |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drug policy====
Hitchens has called for the abolition of the "[[War on Drugs]]," which he described as an "authoritarian war" during a debate with [[William F. Buckley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YOU SAID YOU WANTED A REVOLUTION: 1968 and the Counter-Counterculture|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3420306.html|website=hoover.org|publisher=Hoover Institution|accessdate=7 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402175253/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3420306.html|archivedate=2 April 2010|date=29 July 1998|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens favored the legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for both recreational and [[Medical cannabis|medicinal purposes]], and said, "Marijuana is a medicine. I have heard and read convincing arguments and had convincing testimony from real people who say that marijuana is a very useful medicine for the treatment of [[chemotherapy]]-induced nausea and for [[glaucoma]]. To keep that out of the reach of the sick, it seems to me, is sadistic".&lt;ref name=prettyface /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 571 of the book titled "atheism" by By George H. Smith. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hf7TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA571 Page 571]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genital integrity====
Hitchens was a notable [[genital integrity]] activist, strongly criticizing the tradition of both [[male circumcision]] and [[female genital mutilation]]. In accordance with his [[antitheism]], Hitchens described the tolerance of ''[[metzitzah b'peh]]'' (a Jewish tradition of sucking blood from the penis after the removal of the male [[foreskin]]) as "another disgusting religious practice".&lt;ref name="slate. com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2125225/|title=Another disgusting religious practice|work=Slate Magazine|date=29 August 2005|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gun rights====

Hitchens philosophically supported [[right to keep and bear arms|gun rights]] and was generally opposed to [[gun control]]. On the subject of the second amendment, Hitchens argued that as both an outright ban on guns and relying on a citizen militia for the national defence were equally as idealistic and utopian, and that as [[gun control]] created a duopoly of force between the state and criminals, it would be more desirable to encourage training among average citizens so they might develop a better relationship with firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |url=http://www.hoboes.com/pub/Firearms/Essays/Myth%20of%20Gun%20Control/ |title=The Myth of Gun Control |work=The Nation |date=24 January 1994 |accessdate=1 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for the [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|right to keep and bear arms]], he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Julian Brown|title=Hitchens on Gun control opponents|date=2015-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5grweB5-Yk|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LGBT rights====

Hitchens was a supporter of LGBT rights. He opposed [[sodomy laws]] and supported same-sex marriage. He argued that the legalization of same-sex marriage was the "socialization of homosexuality" and "demonstrates the spread of conservatism" among the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB107827627378044934|title=The Married State|author=Christopher Hitchens|date=3 March 2004|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardminiter/2011/12/16/christopher-hitchens-as-i-knew-him/ |title=Christopher Hitchens, As I Knew Him|author=Richard Miniter |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=5 January 2012 |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NSA warrantless surveillance====

In January 2006, Hitchens joined with four other individuals and four organisations, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[Greenpeace]], as plaintiffs in a lawsuit, ''[[ACLU v. NSA]]'', challenging Bush's [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless domestic spying program]]; the lawsuit was filed by the ACLU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/17/politics/17nsa.html |title=Two Groups Planning to Sue Over Federal Eavesdropping |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 January 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/23485res20060116.html|title=Statement&amp;nbsp;– Christopher Hitchens, NSA Lawsuit Client|publisher=Aclu.org|date=16 January 2006|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthinjustice.org/govdeath.htm|title=Gov. Death|author=Hitchens, Christopher|accessdate=10 May 2009|date=7 August 1999|publisher=[[Salon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voting rights====

In March 2005, Hitchens supported further investigation into [[2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio|voting irregularities in Ohio]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2005/2/8/91132/-|title=Christopher Hitchens thinks the Ohio vote was stolen|publisher=dailykos.com|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

At the [[New York Public Library]] in May 2007, Hitchens debated [[Al Sharpton]] on the issue of [[theism]] and [[Antitheism|anti-theism]], giving rise to a memorable exchange about [[Mormonism]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WXSGmW8LHY|title=Christopher Hitchens vs Al Sharpton - Is god great? [2007]|publisher=Google |date=7 May 2007|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[God is Not Great]]'', Hitchens contended that,

{{quote|above all, we are in need of a renewed Enlightenment, which will base itself on the proposition that the proper study of mankind is man and woman [referencing [[Alexander Pope]]]. This Enlightenment will not need to depend, like its predecessors, on the heroic breakthroughs of a few gifted and exceptionally courageous people. It is within the compass of the average person. The study of literature and poetry, both for its own sake and for the eternal ethical questions with which it deals, can now easily depose the scrutiny of sacred texts that have been found to be corrupt and confected. The pursuit of unfettered scientific inquiry, and the availability of new findings to masses of people by electronic means, will revolutionize our concepts of research and development. Very importantly, the divorce between the sexual life and fear, and the sexual life and disease, and the sexual life and tyranny, can now at last be attempted, on the sole condition that we banish all religions from the discourse. And all this and more is, for the first time in our history, within the reach if not the grasp of everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=God is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|publisher=Twelve Books|date=May 2007|location=New York|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitchens was accused of "anti-Catholic bigotry" by others, including Brent Bozell and [[UCLA]] Law Professor [[Stephen Bainbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hood|first1=John|title=Hollowed Be Thy Name|url=http://www.miamisunpost.com/0517bound.htm|accessdate=7 July 2015|work=The SunPost|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521175846/http://www.miamisunpost.com/0517bound.htm|archivedate=21 May 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Joe Scarborough]] on 12 March 2004 asked Hitchens whether he was "consumed with hatred for conservative Catholics", Hitchens responded that he was not and that he just thinks that "all religious belief is sinister and infantile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Staff |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4515474/ |title=Scarborough County Transcripts |publisher=MSNBC |date=12 March 2004 |accessdate=1 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Hitchens praised [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s creation of "secular [[Russia]]" and his destruction of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], describing it as "an absolute warren of backwardness and evil and superstition."&lt;ref name=PBSinterview /&gt; In an interview with ''[[Radar (magazine)|Radar]]'' in 2007, Hitchens said that if the [[Christian right]]'s agenda were implemented in the United States "It wouldn't last very long and would, I hope, lead to civil war, which they will lose, but for which it would be a great pleasure to take part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holidaydmitri.com/hitch.html|title=Godless Provocateur Christopher Hitchens Pledges Allegiance to America|publisher=Holidaydmitri.com|date=1 May 2007|accessdate=18 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224095234/http://www.holidaydmitri.com/hitch.html|archivedate=24 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 2009, Hitchens debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] at [[Biola University]] on the topic "Does God Exist?" before both a live and closed circuit audience of over 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whittierdailynews.com/news/ci_12079851|title=Craig, Hitchens ask 'Does God Exist?' |publisher=[[Whittier Daily News]]|date=5 April 2009|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamism===

Hitchens was deeply shocked by the 14 February 1989 ''[[fatwa]]'' against his longtime friend [[Salman Rushdie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135499/|title=Cartoon Debate|publisher=Slate.com|date=4 February 2006|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became increasingly critical of what he called "[[theocracy|theocratic]] fascism" or "fascism with an Islamic face": radical [[Islamists]] who supported the ''fatwa'' against Rushdie and sought the recreation of the medieval [[caliphate]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Hitchens is often credited with coining the term "[[Islamofascism]]", but Hitchens himself denied it, attributing its coinage to [[Malise Ruthven]].&lt;ref name=Neiesbw&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|authorlink1=Christopher Hitchens|title=Defending Islamofascism|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2007/10/defending_islamofascism.html|accessdate=8 January 2016|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Safire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/opinion/01iht-edsafire.2988871.html |title=Islamofascism Anyone? |work=The New York Times |date=1 October 2006 |accessdate=25 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens did use the term ''Islamic fascism'' for an article he wrote for ''[[The Nation]]'', shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], but this phrase also had an earlier history. For example, it was used in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on 13 January 1979; it also appears to have been used by secularists in [[Turkey]] and [[Afghanistan]] to describe their opponents.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In February 2006, Hitchens helped organize a pro-[[Denmark]] rally outside the Danish Embassy in Washington, DC, in response to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lexi.net|url=http://www.fcpp.org/main/publication_detail.php?PubID=1377|title=Fronter Centre for Foreign Policy interview|publisher=Fcpp.org|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mormonism===

Hitchens was extremely critical of the doctrinal claims of [[Mormonism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/features/2007/god_is_not_great/mormonism_a_racket_becomes_a_religion.html|title=God Is Not Great|date=27 April 2007|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed the candidacy of [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2011/10/is_mormonism_a_cult_who_cares_it_s_their_weird_and_sinister_beli.html|title=Romney's Mormon Problem|date=17 October 2011|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quentin Hugh Crewe''' (14 November 1926 – 14 November 1998) was an English journalist, author, restaurateur and adventurer. He was diagnosed with [[muscular dystrophy]] at age 6 and it was predicted he would be dead by 16 years old.  He was not told this and lived to 72.  He wrote regularly for the [[London Evening Standard|''Evening Standard'']], [[Queen (magazine)|''Queen'']] magazine, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Sunday Mirror]],'' among others.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/01/world/quentin-crewe-72-bon-vivant-who-was-unfazed-by-disability.html|title=Quentin Crewe, 72, Bon Vivant Who Was Unfazed by Disability|last=Thomas|first=Robert McG.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1998-12-01|accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-quentin-crewe-1185256.html|title=Obituary: Quentin Crewe|last=De Moubray|first=Jocelyn|work=[[The Independent]]|date=1998-11-16|accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crewe travelled much of the world, writing 11 books on the subject of his journeys, biographies and cuisine. Crewe was co-proprietor of various restaurants, including the now-defunct Brasserie St. Quentin in [[Knightsbridge]], [[London]].

== Early life ==

Crewe was born Quentin Hugh Dodds in 1926, the second son of Major (James) Hugh Hamilton Dodds, CMG, a career diplomat (amongst other postings, Consul-General at Nice),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/crewe1911.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Extinct Peerage 1884-1971: Containing Extinct, Abeyant, Dormant and Suspended Peerages With Genealogies and Arms, L. G. Pine, Heraldry Today, 1972, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; and Lady Annabel Crewe-Milnes, the daughter of [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|the Marquess of Crewe]]. His older brother, [[Terence O'Neill]], was a politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]] from 1963 to 1969.

During Crewe's early childhood, his father was British Consul in Sicily, before being transferred to the French Riviera when his friendship with [[Haile Selassie]] made it impossible to remain in Italy. With his parents living abroad, the young Quentin spent much of his childhood in the care of various relatives in England. His father was keen that he should be a sportsman, and tried to teach him to shoot, fence or ride, without any success. Crewe would regularly fall over.

Crewe was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where he was expelled after copying a fire door key and secretly going to London for a day. He went on to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and tried to study law and economics, but he spent so much time partying that he was expelled for indolence. He was falling over so much that he took to walking with a stick, although he did achieve sporting success as a cox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Obituary: Quentin Crewe|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-quentin-crewe-1185256.html|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 his family changed their name to Crewe after his mother inherited what remained of Lord Crewe's estates.

Despite the doctor's gloomy prediction of a death by 16, Crewe survived his teens, although he did become weaker and his falls more frequent. His condition steadily deteriorated until he was using a wheelchair full-time at age 29.

Crewe was married three times; in 1956, to Martha Sharp, by whom he had a son and a daughter, in 1961, to Angela Huth, by whom he had a son and a daughter, and in 1970, to Sue Cavendish, by whom he had a son and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-quentin-crewe-1185256.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==

Crewe appeared as a "castaway" on the [[BBC Radio]] programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' twice, on 21 January 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/5890e5c6#p009mhtm|title=Desert Island Discs - Castaway : Quentin Crewe|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 16 June 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/5890e5c6#p0093nfq |title=Desert Island Discs - Castaway : Quentin Crewe|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Long History ==
Steve DeAngelo is a national cannabis activist, entrepreneur, educator and thought leader who has been on the forefront of cannabis legalization efforts for more than four decades. He is the co-founder and executive director of Oakland-based Harborside, which he established with his life partner, Yolanda Felix, in 2006 and has since grown to become the largest medical cannabis dispensary in the United States.

Harborside has more than 300,000 registered patients and was among the first dispensaries in the country to treat children with Dravet Syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. Rooted in DeAngelo’s belief that cannabis use should be wellness-centric, Harborside was one of the first cannabis businesses in the nation to support comprehensive cannabis education for seniors, veterans and families with severely ill children. Harborside continues to set the industry gold standard and is a leading advocate for diversity, environmental sustainability and economic justice in the cannabis sector. As part of DeAngelo’s push to foster environmentally sound agriculture practices practices, Harborside in 2014 launched its line of SunGrown cannabis products aimed at minimizing electricity consumption and promoting sustainable cannabis cultivation and production processes. In 2016, the holding company Flrish Inc, purchased an agricultural site in Salinas now called Harborside Farms, that grows cannabis plants for the Harborside dispensaries as well as others.

DeAngelo’s path to becoming a world-renown cannabis business mogul began in his youth. Deeply influenced by his parents’ involvement in the Civil Rights movement, he formed his political identity at a young age. He protested the atrocities of the Vietnam War and joined the peace movement in the ’70s. At the age of 16, DeAngelo began leading the charge against cannabis prohibition. Starting in 1974, he became the lead organizer of the annual Yippie Fourth of July Smoke-In in Washington D.C., a position he held for a decade. And in 1998, he spearheaded efforts to legalize medical cannabis through Initiative 59 in his hometown of D.C.

Although the ballot initiative was approved by 69 percent of voters and carried every precinct, Congress passed an amendment to block its implementation. Heartbroken, DeAngelo moved to California that year and has since become a distinguished member of the burgeoning cannabis business community in this country and around the globe.

In 2008 after establishing Harborside, DeAngelo co-founded the first commercial cannabis lab in the country, Steep Hill Labs, to support a socially responsible industry and ensure cannabis products comply with public safety standards. The company has grown to become a world leader in cannabis science and technology with extensive expertise in lab testing, remote testing, genetics, research and development, and intellectual property licensing. Steep Hill Labs has also positioned itself as a leading consultant to legislators and regulators around the world seeking to establish a unified set of industry best practices. With a keen understanding of the industry’s direction and future growth potential, DeAngelo decided in 2010 it was time to develop the next wave of American cannabis entrepreneurs. He co-founded The Arcview Group, a cannabis angel investment network and research firm dedicated to galvanizing progressive drug policy reform by empowering a responsible, profitable industry. The Arcview Angel Investor Network connects the brightest and most motivated entrepreneurs with vetted investors. The network includes more than 600 accredited investors, and has raised at least $150 million for 160 cannabis-related companies to date.

DeAngelo was named one of the seven “most powerful people” in America’s cannabis industry by Fortune in 2016, a “gatekeeper” of the cannabis industry in 2015 by the International Business Times, and one of the most influential people in the cannabis industry in 2014 by Cannabis Business Executive. Dubbed &amp;amp;quot;the father of the legal cannabis industry&amp; quote; by former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown Jr., DeAngelo has been an industry pioneer and lifelong advocate for legalization. He has received many awards including a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015 from High Times magazine.

His acclaimed book, “The Cannabis Manifesto: A New Paradigm for Wellness,” is a compelling account of DeAngelo’s personal journey with cannabis that outlines numerous solid arguments for legalization while presenting research-backed benefits of the plant. The book’s guiding statement: “Cannabis is not harmful, but prohibition is.” DeAngelo’s trailblazing activism and his creation of a model medical cannabis dispensary that sets best practices for an entire industry has made him one of the world’s foremost cannabis entrepreneurs and thought leaders.
