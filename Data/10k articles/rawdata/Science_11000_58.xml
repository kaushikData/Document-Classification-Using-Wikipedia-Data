'''The Agumbe Rainforest Research Station''' (ARRS) is a field based conservation and research organisation situated inside the Agumbe Reserved Forest at [[Agumbe]] in the central [[Western Ghats]] of southern India.  The  Agumbe Reserved Forests receives an annual rainfall in excess of {{convert|7000|mm|abbr=on}} and is at an elevation of about {{convert|640|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="Five wettest places in India you should know about"&gt;{{cite news|title=Five wettest places in India you should know about|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/five-wettest-places-in-india/1/445735.html|accessdate=17 July 2015|publisher=india today|date=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms a part of the Malnad-Kodagu corridor, which also includes the [[Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary|Someshwara]], [[Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary|Mookambika]], [[Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary|Bhadra]], and [[Sharavati Wildlife Sanctuary|Sharavati]] Wildlife Sanctuaries, [[Kudremukh National Park]], and various other forest tracts and reserve forests around Kundapur, Shankaranarayana, Hosanagara, Sringeri, and Thirthahalli.&lt;ref name="arrs_facts"&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Kalinga mane.JPG|thumb|right|Kalinga Mane at ARRS. It was the first building at ARRS. Others were later added]]
ARRS was founded in 2005, by leading Indian herpetologist [[Romulus Whitaker]]. Whitaker saw his very first [[king cobra]] (Ophiophagus hannah) here in 1971. He was also extremely taken by the reverence the people in the region showed for snakes, which was a major factor that drove him to establish a research station in Agumbe (Karnataka ).&lt;ref name="arrs_about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agumberainforest.com/about_us.html |title=About Us |work=agumberainforest.com |publisher=Agumbe Rainforest Research Station |accessdate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207235406/http://www.agumberainforest.com/about_us.html |archivedate=7 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The land is a revenue land was legally procured, the construction and activities are eco friendly and pose no disturbance to the wildlife.

[[Image:Agumbe Rain Forest Research Station.JPG|thumb|left|The cottages at ARRS for volunteers and researchers]]

==Activities==
ARRS managed the world’s first radio-telemetry project on the King Cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), which is also the first radio-telemetry study done on any snake in India. Insight gained from this ecological study is being put into practice into king cobra management in the region.
ARRS researchers have witnessed various unique behaviors among the species including a male king cobra killing a possibly pregnant female, a rare behavior even among mammals.

ARRS conducts and facilitates a wide variety of research projects, ranging from rainforest ecology, behavioral and population ecology, phenology, geoinformatics and socio economics.

Apart from research, ARRS focuses on education and outreach in the local community, schools and colleges. A well-developed volunteer and research intern programme makes the research station an ideal location for those interested in field based research and conservation The research station encourages and provides facilities for graduate and PHD students to conduct projects.

A '''basis swap''' is an [[interest rate swap]] which involves the exchange of two floating rate [[financial instrument]]s.  A basis swap functions as a floating-floating interest rate swap under which the floating rate payments are referenced to different bases.

==Usage of basis swaps for hedging==
[[Basis risk]] occurs for positions that have at least one paying and one receiving stream of cash flows that are driven by different factors and the [[correlation]] between those factors is less than one. Entering into a Basis Swap may offset the effect of gains or losses resulting from changes in the basis, thus reducing basis risk. 
# against exposure to currency fluctuations (for example, 1 mo USD LIBOR for 1 mo GBP LIBOR)
# against one index in the favor of another (for example, 1 mo USD T-bill for 1 mo USD LIBOR)
# different points on a [[yield curve]] (for example, 1 mo USD LIBOR for 6 mo USD LIBOR)

==Basis swaps in energy commodities==
In energy markets, a basis swap is a swap on the price differential for a product and a major index product (e.g. Brent Crude or Henry Hub gas).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">In [[general relativity]], the '''Bonnor beam''' is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] which models an infinitely long, straight beam of [[light]]. It is an explicit example of a [[pp-wave spacetime]]. It is named after [[William B. Bonnor]] who first described it.

The Bonnor beam is obtained by matching together two regions:

* a uniform plane wave interior region, which is shaped like the [[world tube]] of a solid cylinder, and models the electromagnetic and gravitational fields inside the beam,
* a vacuum exterior region, which models the gravitational field outside the beam.

On the "cylinder" where they meet, the two regions are required to obey matching conditions stating that the [[metric tensor]] and [[extrinsic curvature]] tensor must agree.

The interior part of the solution is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
     ds^2 = 
-8 \pi m r^2 \, du^2 - 2 \, du \, dv + dr^2 + r^2 \, d\theta^2,\\-\infty &lt; u,\\
     v &lt; \infty,\\
      0 &lt; r &lt; r_0,\\
       -\pi &lt; \theta &lt; \pi.\\
     \end{array}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[null dust solution]] and can be interpreted as incoherent [[electromagnetic radiation]].

The exterior part of the solution is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
     ds^2 = -8 \pi m r_0^2 \left( 1 + 2 \log(r/r_0) \right) \, du^2
- 2 \, du \, dv + dr^2 + r^2 \, d\theta^2 \\
-\infty &lt; u,\\
     v &lt; \infty,\\
      r_0 &lt; r &lt; \infty,\\
       -\pi &lt; \theta &lt; \pi.\\
     \end{array}
\right. &lt;/math&gt;

The Bonnor beam can be generalized to several parallel beams travelling in the same direction. Perhaps surprisingly, the beams do not curve toward one another. On the other hand, "anti-parallel" beams (travelling along parallel trajectories, but in opposite directions) ''do'' attract each other. This reflects a general phenomenon: two pp-waves with parallel [[wave vector]]s superimpose linearly, but pp-waves with nonparallel wave vectors (including antiparallel Bonnor beams) do ''not'' superimpose linearly, as we would expect from the [[nonlinear]] nature of the [[Einstein field equation]].

In 1969, the Canadarm was invited by the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) to participate in the [[Space Shuttle program]].&lt;ref name="25Years"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzVPAAAAMAAJ|title=A Heritage of Excellence: 25 years at Spar Aerospace Limited|last=Dotto|first=Lydia|date=1992|publisher=Spar Aerospace Limited|others=David Steel|isbn=0-9696618-0-0|location=Canada|pages=41–42|quote=[Frank] Mee is the inventor of the Canadarm hand, technically known as the "end effector.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time what that participation would entail had not yet been decided but a manipulator system was identified as an important component.&lt;ref name=25Years /&gt; Canadian company [[Dilworth Secord and Meagher|DSMA]] ATCON had developed a robot to load fuel into [[CANDU reactor|CANDU nuclear reactors]]; this robot attracted NASA's attention.&lt;ref name=25Years /&gt; In 1975, NASA and the [[National Research Council (Canada)|Canadian National Research Council]] (NRC) signed a memorandum of understanding that Canada would develop and construct the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqI6waJAUnEC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Browsing Science Research at the Federal Level in Canada: History, Research Activities and Publications|last=Wilks|first=Brian|date=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=117|access-date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NRC awarded the manipulator contract to [[Spar Aerospace]].&lt;ref name="UofAEngMag" /&gt; Three systems were constructed within this design, development, test and evaluation contract: an engineering model to assist in the design and testing of the Canadarm, a qualification model that was subjected to environmental testing to qualify the design for use in space, and a flight unit. Anthony "Tony" Zubrzycki, a design engineer at DSMA ATCON,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Make The Wind Blow|last=Melbourne|first=James V.|publisher=Heirloom Publishing Inc.|year=2001|isbn=0-9694247-8-7|location=|pages=62–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; while seconded to SPAR, originated the concept for the Canadarm End Effector, inspired by an elastic band around his fingers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tony formally presented this concept to NASA officials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frank Mee, head of the SPAR mechanical development laboratory, built the end effector prototype&lt;!--At his home, he fabricated a small model made out of cardboard and string; and brought it to work.&lt;ref name=25Years /&gt;--&gt; based on Tony's concept and is credited by SPAR&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as the inventor of the Canadarm End Effector. The three-wire crossover design won over the claw-like mechanisms and others, such as the camera iris model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that were being considered.

The main controls algorithms were developed by SPAR and by subcontractor [[Dynacon]] Inc. of [[Toronto]]. [[CAE Inc.|CAE Electronics]] Ltd. in [[Montreal]] provided the display and control panel and the hand controllers located in the Shuttle aft flight deck. Other electronic interfaces, servoamplifiers and power conditioners located on the Canadarm were designed and built by SPAR at its Montreal factory. The graphite composite boom that provides the structural connection between the shoulder and the elbow joint and the similar boom that connects the elbow to the wrist were produced by General Dynamics in the United States. Dilworth, Secord, Meagher and Associates, Ltd. in Toronto was contracted to produce the engineering model end effector then SPAR evolved the design and produced the qualification and flight units.The shuttle flight software that monitors and controls the Canadarm was developed in Houston, Texas, by the Federal Systems Division of [[IBM]]. Rockwell International's Space Transportation Systems Division designed, developed, tested and built the systems used to attach the Canadarm to the payload bay of the orbiter.

An acceptance ceremony for NASA was held at Spar's RMS Division in Toronto on the 11th of February 1981.&lt;ref name=25Years /&gt; Here [[Larkin Kerwin]], then the head of the NRC, gave the SRMS the informal name, Canadarm.&lt;ref name=25Years /&gt;

The first remote manipulator system was delivered to NASA in April 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/canadarm/canadarm_technical.html|title=The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System — The Canadarm|publisher=IEEE Canada|access-date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Astronaut [[Judith Resnik]] developed the NASA [[software]] and onboard operating procedures for the system.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Women: Re-visioning Women's Scientific Achievements and Impacts'', By Jill S. Tietjen, Springer 2016, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; In all, five arms—Nos. 201, 202, 301, 302, and 303—were built and delivered to NASA. Arm 302 was lost in the ''Challenger'' accident.&lt;ref name="canadarm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/canadarm/flight.asp | publisher=Canada Space Agency | title= Flight History of Canadarm | date=28 October 2011 | access-date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and capabilities==
[[File:Hubble First Servicing EVA - GPN-2000-001085.jpg|left|thumb|[[F. Story Musgrave]], anchored on the end of the Canadarm, prepares to be elevated to the top of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] during [[STS-61]].]]
The original Canadarm was capable of deploying and retrieving payloads [[mass|weighing]] up to {{convert|332.5|kg|abbr=on}} in space. In the mid-1990s the arm control system was redesigned to increase the payload capability to {{convert|3293|kg|abbr=on}} in order to support space station assembly operations. While able to maneuver payloads with the mass of a loaded bus in space, the arm motors cannot lift the arm's own weight when on the ground.&lt;ref name="UofAEngMag" /&gt; NASA therefore developed a model of the arm for use at its training facility within the Johnson Space Center located in Houston, Texas. The Canadarm can also retrieve, repair and deploy satellites, provide a mobile extension ladder for extravehicular activity crew members for work stations or foot restraints, and be used as an inspection aid to allow the flight crew members to view the orbiter's or payload's surfaces through a television camera on the Canadarm.

The basic Canadarm configuration consists of a manipulator arm, a Canadarm display and control panel, including rotational and translational hand controllers at the orbiter aft flight deck flight crew station, and a manipulator controller interface unit that interfaces with the orbiter computer.  Most of the time, the arm operators see what they are doing by looking at the [[Advanced Space Vision System]] screen next to the controllers.
[[File:Canadarm 1 End Effector.jpg|thumb|The Canadarm 1 End Effector.]]
One crew member operates the Canadarm from the aft flight deck control station, and a second crew member usually assists with television camera operations. This allows the Canadarm operator to view Canadarm operations through the aft flight deck payload and overhead windows and through the closed-circuit television monitors at the aft flight deck station.

The Canadarm is outfitted with an explosive-based mechanism to allow the arm to be jettisoned. This safety system allows the Orbiter's payload bay doors to be closed in the event that the arm fails in an extended position and is not able to be retracted.&lt;ref name=UofAEngMag&gt;{{cite news|author=Garry Lindberg|title=Canadarm and its U of A Connections|url=http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/uofaengineer/article.cfm?article=28369&amp;issue=28299|work=U of A Engineer Magazine|publisher=University of Alberta|access-date=7 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041129001731/http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/uofaengineer/article.cfm?article=28369&amp;issue=28299|archivedate=29 November 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadarm is {{convert|15.2|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} diameter with six [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. It weighs {{convert|410|kg|abbr=on}} by itself, and {{convert|450|kg|abbr=on}} as part of the total system. The Canadarm has six joints that correspond roughly to the joints of the human arm, with shoulder yaw and pitch joints, an elbow pitch joint, and wrist pitch, yaw, and roll joints. The [[Robot end effector|end effector]] is the unit at the end of the wrist that grapples the payload's [[grapple fixture]]. The two lightweight boom segments are called the upper and lower arms. The upper boom connects the shoulder and elbow joints, and the lower boom connects the elbow and wrist joints.

==Service history==

A simulated Canadarm installed on the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'']] was seen when the prototype orbiter's payload bay doors were open to test hangar facilities early in the shuttle program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Justin |last=Ray | url=http://spaceflightnow.com/delta/d352/omcf/  | title=Vandenberg's space shuttle hangar | date=5 January 2011 | work=Space Flight Now | access-date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadarm was first tested in orbit in 1981, on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia''{{'}}s]] [[STS-2]] mission. Its first operational use was on [[STS-3]] to deploy and maneuver the Plasma Diagnostics Package.&lt;ref name="canadarm" /&gt; Canadarm has since flown on more than 90 missions with all five orbiters.

Since the installation of the [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2|Canadarm2]] on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), the two arms have been used to hand over segments of the station for assembly from the Canadarm to the Canadarm2; the use of both elements in tandem has earned the nickname of "Canadian Handshake" in the media.

===Retirement===
The Canadarm's 90th and final shuttle mission was in July 2011 on [[STS-135]], delivering the [[Raffaello MPLM|Raffaello]] [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module|MPLM]] to the ISS and back.

During the [[Space Shuttle program]], several missions were canceled. Many were canceled as a result of the [[Challenger disaster|''Challenger'']] and the [[Columbia disaster|''Columbia'']] disasters. Many early missions were canceled due to delays in the development of the shuttle. Others were canceled because of changes in payload and missions requirements.

'''Crown eukaryotes''' are an artificial group of [[eukaryotes|eukaryotic organisms]] found at the top of molecular [[phylogenetic trees]] including both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. They were originally thought to represent a late step of eukaryotic evolution (somewhat similar to a [[crown group]]) because they include [[multicellular]] and macroscopic lifeforms that represent the majority of the [[biomass]] of the planet while accounting for less than 1% of the [[genetic diversity]]. However, they are in fact the result of an artificial clustering of eukaryotic organisms with slowly evolving gene sequences. They are thus not a crown that excludes simpler eukaryotes, but correspond roughly to the initial radiation of eukaryotes. All eukaryotic lineages branching below the "crown" in phylogenetic trees are misplaced because of the [[long branch attraction]] phenomenon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2421">'''Eigencolloid''' is a term derived from the German language (''eigen'': own) and used to designate [[colloid]]s made of pure phases. Most often such colloids are formed by the  [[hydrolysis]] of [[heavy metals]] [[cations]] or [[radionuclide]]s, such as, ''e.g.'', Tc(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Th(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, U(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Pu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or Am(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Colloids have been suspected for the long-range transport of [[plutonium]] on the [[Nevada Test Site]].

'''''Euclides Danicus''''' (the Danish Euclid) is one of three books of mathematics written by [[Georg Mohr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

It contains the first proof of the [[Mohr–Mascheroni theorem]], which states that every geometric construction that can be performed using a [[compass and straightedge]] can also be done with compass alone.&lt;ref name="gla"&gt;{{citation

 | issue = 3
 | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society
 | pages = 463–467
 | title = About the cover: Two theorems on geometric constructions
 | volume = 51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into two parts. In the first part, Mohr shows how to perform all of the constructions of [[Euclid]]'s [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']] using a compass alone. In the second part, he includes some other specific constructions, including some related to the mathematics of the [[sundial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Impression of Mathematics in Denmark in the Period 1600–1800|first=Kirsti|last=Andersen|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1980.tb00381.x|journal=Centaurus|volume=24|issue=1|year=1980|pages=316–334}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Euclides Danicus'' languished in obscurity, possibly caused by its choice of language, until its rediscovery in 1928 in a bookshop in Copenhagen. Until then, the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem had been credited to [[Lorenzo Mascheroni]], who published a proof in 1797, independently of Mohr's work.&lt;ref name="gla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nac"/&gt; Soon after the rediscovery of Mohr's book, publications about it by [[Florian Cajori]] and [[Nathan Altshiller Court]] made its existence much more widely known.&lt;ref name="gla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nac"&gt;{{citation

Only eight copies of the original publication of the book are known to survive. In 2005, one of these original copies was sold at auction, to [[Fry's Electronics]], for what [[Gerald L. Alexanderson]] calls a "ridiculously low price": US$13,000.&lt;ref name="gla"/&gt;

The '''European Microscopy Society''' is an international [[learned society]] which represents the field of [[microscopy]] in [[Europe]]. It was founded in 1998 following the disbanding of the ''Committee of European Societies of Electron Microscopy'' (which was founded in 1976) as a union of national microscopical societies.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The society acts as a regional committee of the [[International Federation of Societies for Microscopy]].&lt;ref name=UIA/&gt;

==Member societies==

In [[physics]], '''fractionalization''' is the phenomenon whereby the [[quasiparticle]]s of a system cannot be constructed as combinations of its elementary constituents. One of the earliest and most prominent examples is the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]], where the constituent particles are [[electrons]] but the quasiparticles carry fractions of the electron charge.&lt;ref&gt;

In the case of [[spin–charge separation]], for example, the electron can be viewed as a bound state of a '[[spinon]]' and a '[[chargon]]', which under certain conditions can become free to move separately.

== History ==
Quantized Hall conductance was discovered in 1980, related to the electron charge. Laughlin proposed a fluid of fractional charges in 1983, to explain the fractional quantum Hall effect seen in 1982, for which he shared the 1998 Physics Nobel Prize.  In 1997, experiments directly observed an electric current of one-third charge.  The one-fifth charge was seen in 1999 and various odd fractions have since been detected.

Disordered magnetic materials were later shown to form interesting spin phases.  Spin fractionalization was seen in spin ices in 2009 and spin liquids in 2012.

Fractional charges continue to be an active topic in condensed matter physics.  Studies of these quantum phases impact understanding of superconductivity, and insulators with surface transport for [[topological quantum computer]]s.

== Physics ==
Many-body effects in complicated condensed materials lead to emergent properties that can be described as quasiparticles existing in the substance.  Electron behavior in solids can be considered as quasi-particle magnons, excitons, holes, and charges with different effective mass.  Spinons, chargons, and anyons cannot be considered elementary particle combinations. Different quantum statistics have been seen; Anyons wavefunctions gain a continuous phase in exchange:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Viewpoint: Liberating anyons from two dimensions|date = Jan 2010|journal = Physics|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/Physics.3.7|pmid = |bibcode = 2010PhyOJ...3....7S |volume=3|pages = 7|last1 = Stern|first1 = Ady|last2 = Levin|first2 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(|\Psi_1\rangle|\Psi_2\rangle) = e^{i \theta}|\Psi_2\rangle|\Psi_1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

It has been realized many insulators have a conducting surface of 2D quantum electron gas states.

'''James Francis Hurley''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (15 October 1885 – 16 January 1962) was an Australian photographer and adventurer. He participated in a number of expeditions to [[Antarctica]] and served as an official photographer with Australian forces during both [[world wars]].

His artistic style produced many memorable images. He also used staged scenes, composites and photographic manipulation.

==Biography==
Hurley was the third of five children to parents Edward and Margaret Hurley and was raised in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe, a suburb of Sydney, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (2004) p 8&lt;/ref&gt; He ran away from home at the age of 13 to work on the Lithgow steel mill, returning home two years later to study at the local technical school and attend science lectures at the University of Sydney. When he was 17 he bought his first camera, a 15-shilling [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]] which he paid for at the rate of a shilling per week. He taught himself photography and set himself up in the postcard business, where he gained a reputation for putting himself in danger in order to produce stunning images, including placing himself in front of an oncoming train to capture it on film.

Hurley married Antoinette Rosalind Leighton on 11 April 1918.&lt;ref name="Hurley-ADB"/&gt; The couple had four children: three daughters and one son.&lt;ref name="Hurley-ADB"/&gt;

While living on [[Collaroy Plateau]], ([[Warringah]] LGA), Frank became involved with ABC radio. He was a frequent storyteller on the perennial children's program ''The Argonauts''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} He enjoyed even more a degree of commercial success by publishing his photos on advertising calendars, postcards and tourist booklets.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

His most successful book was ''Australia: A Camera Study ''published in 1955 and reprinted three times.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

He engaged in aerial photography with Brud Rees on his Piper Cub float plane. He travelled extensively throughout Australia commissioned on various photographic assignments.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (2004) p. 406-409&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antarctic expeditions==
Of his lifetime, Frank Hurley spent more than four years in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frank Hurley’s Antarctica.|last = Ennis|first = Helen|publisher = National Library of Australia.|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Australia|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 23, in 1908, Hurley learned that Australian explorer [[Douglas Mawson]] was planning an expedition to Antarctica; fellow Sydney-sider [[Henri Mallard]] in 1911, recommended Hurley for the position of official photographer to Mawson's [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]], ahead of himself.&lt;ref&gt;while Hurley records his approach to Mawson differently in his memoir, the fact of this introduction via Mallard was established by David P. Millar in Millar (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Hurley asserts in his biography that he then cornered Mawson as he was making his way to their interview on a train, using the advantage to talk his way into the job.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Cato]] in his obituary explains Hurley's motivation and enthusiasm; 'We were both fired with the Spirit of Adventure; we were both happy in the knowledge that the camera was the key that would open that Magic Door.' Cato, Jack, 'For the Late Frank Hurley, Three Tributes', ''Australian Popular Photography'', March 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Mawson was persuaded, while Mallard, who was the manager of Harringtons (a local Kodak franchise) to which Hurley was in debt, provided photographic equipment. The Expedition departed in 1911, returning in 1914. On his return, he edited and released a documentary, ''Home of the Blizzard'', using his footage from the expedition.&lt;ref name="Hurley-ADB"/&gt;

Hurley was also the official photographer on [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] which set out in 1914 and was marooned until August 1916; Hurley produced many pioneering colour images of the Expedition using the then-popular [[Paget process]] of colour photography. He photographed in [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] in 1917. He later compiled his records into the documentary film ''South'' in 1919. His footage was also used in the 2001 [[IMAX]] film ''[[Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure]]''. He returned to the Antarctic in 1929 and 1931 on Mawson's British Australian (and) New Zealand Antarctic Research Expeditions ([[BANZARE]]).

==Wartime photography==
In 1917, Hurley joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) as an honorary [[Captain (land)|captain]] and captured many stunning battlefield scenes during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]. In keeping with his adventurous spirit, he took considerable risks to photograph his subjects, also producing many rare panoramic and colour photographs of the conflict. Hurley kept a diary in 1917-1918 chronicling his time as a war photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Series 03: Frank Hurley diaries and related papers, 21 August 1917 – 13 August 1918, kept while official photographer to the Australian Imperial Force|url=http://acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=422460|website=Catalogue|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he describes his commitment "to illustrate to the public the things our fellows do and how war is conducted", as well as his short-lived resignation in October 1917 when he was ordered not to produce composite images.&lt;ref name="Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2012/D14653/a2826.htm|title=Frank Hurley war diary, 21 August-28 October 1917|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His period with the AIF ended in March 1918.

For the 1918 London exhibition ''Australian War Pictures and Photographs ''he employed composites for photomurals to convey drama of the war on a scale otherwise not possible using the technology available. This brought Hurley into conflict with the AIF on the grounds that montage diminished documentary value.&lt;ref&gt;for an account of the conflict between Hurley and the war correspondent Charles Bean, see Gough, Paul. "‘Exactitude is truth’: representing the British military through commissioned artworks". Journal of War and Culture Studies Volume: 1 | Issue: 3 December 2008 Page(s): 341–356 ({{ISSN|1752-6272}}), and also the excellent discussion of this, and Hurley's use of montage in some of his Antarctic imagery, in McGregor, Alasdair (2004) ''Frank Hurley: a photographer's life''.'' ''Camberwell:Viking/Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Bean]], official war historian, labelled Hurley's composite images "fake".&lt;ref name="Hurley-ADB"/&gt;

Hurley also served as a war photographer during [[World War II]].

Hurley also used a [[movie camera]] to record a range of experiences including the Antarctic expeditions, the building of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], and war in the Middle East during World War II. The camera was a [[Debrie Parvo]] L 35mm hand-crank camera made in France. This camera is now in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/frank_hurleys_movie_camera/|title=Frank Hurley's movie camera - National Museum of Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
Hurley made several documentaries throughout his career, most notably ''[[Pearls and Savages]]'' (1921). He wrote and directed several dramatic feature films, including ''[[Jungle Woman (1926 film)|Jungle Woman]]'' (1926) and ''[[The Hound of the Deep]]'' (1926). He also worked as cinematographer for [[Cinesound Productions]] where his best known film credits include ''[[The Squatter's Daughter (1933 film)|The Squatter's Daughter]]'' (1933), ''[[The Silence of Dean Maitland]]'' (1934) and ''[[Grandad Rudd]]'' (1935). His 1941 documentary short ''[[Sagebrush and Silver]]'' was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] at the [[14th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Short Subject (One-Reel)]].&lt;ref name="Oscars1942"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1942 |title=The 14th Academy Awards (1942) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2013-06-25 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The phrase was coined by [http://www.myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Ian Williams]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphic Medicine|url=http://graphicmedicine.org/#/graphic-medicine/4531707343|work=Why ''Graphic Medicine?"|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote "the intersection between the medium of comics and the discourse of healthcare". Comics offer an engaging, powerful, and accessible method of delivering [[illness]] [[narrative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hektoen International.|url=http://www.hektoeninternational.org/graphicMedicine.html|work=Graphic medicine: how comics are revolutionizing the representation of illness|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic appraisal of graphic fiction is in its infancy, but its examination by academics involved in [[healthcare]]-related studies is increasing, with work emerging in journals such as ''Configurations: A Journal of Literature, Science, and Technology'' (2.2) as well as ''Journal of the Medical Humanities'' and ''Literature and Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=IC|title=Graphic medicine: comics as medical narrative.|journal=Medical humanities|date=2012-01-25|pmid=22282425|doi=10.1136/medhum-2011-010093|volume=38|issue=1|pages=21–7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 January 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the [[Medical Humanities]] movement in many medical schools (e.g., Penn State University, http://www2.med.psu.edu/humanities/) advocates the framework and use of literature in exploring illness, from practitioner and patient perspectives. A recent entry to the scholarly study of graphic mediciine is the Einstein Foundation funded project at the Freie Universität Berlin (2016-2019) under the direction of Irmela Marei Krüger-Fürhoff and with the collaboration of Susan Merrill Squier, Einstein Visiting Fellow and Brill Professor at the Pennsylvania State University: ''PathoGraphics'', the study of illness narratives or pathographies and works of graphic medicine. 
[http://www.myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Williams] set up the [http://www.graphicmedicine.org Graphic Medicine website] in 2007 whilst writing a masters dissertation on medical narrative in comics and graphic novels, during which time he found Susan M. Squier's essays,  “Beyond Nescience: the intersectional insights of health humanities.” ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine''. 50:3 (summer 2007): 334-47, and “So Long as They Grow Out of It: Comics, The Discourse of Developmental Normalcy, and Disability.” Journal of Medical Humanities. 29:2 (June 2008): 71-88. Scholars from around the world who were interested in comics and healthcare began to get in touch, notably [http://www.pennstatehershey.org/findaprovider/provider/178 Prof Michael Green], who had recently set up a [http://www2.med.psu.edu/humanities/graphic-narratives/ graphic narratives course] at Hershey Medical School at Penn State University, and MK Czerwiec, aka [http://www.comicnurse.com "Comic Nurse"], who had, for many years, been recording her experiences as an [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] [[Hospice care in the United States|hospice]] nurse in [[comics]] form. Green invited his colleagues Kimberley Myers, of the Medical Humanities Program at Penn State Milton Hershey Medical School and Susan M. Squier, Brill Professor of English and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, who teaches graphic medicine to Ph.D. students at the Penn State University and whose work Williams had encountered earlier, to the discussion group, and Williams introduced [http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/persons/maria-vaccarella(74c125a2-f1d2-45e7-9132-75a9e2e07e52).html Maria Vaccarella], [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/giskin.day Giskin Day] and Columba Quigley. The group decided to hold a conference, in 2010 at The University of London, which led to a series of annual international conferences with presentations that are frequently posted as podcasts after the conference, on http://www.graphicmedicine.org

Penn State University Press published '''''The Graphic Medicine Manifesto''''' in 2015. Authors are MK Czerwiec, Ian Williams, Susan Merrill Squier, Michael J. Green, Kimberly R. Myers, and Scott T. Smith.  Content summary: "Combining scholarly essays with visual narratives and a conclusion in comics form, establishes graphic medicine as a new area of scholarship.  Demonstrates that graphic medicine narratives offer patients, family members, and medical caregivers new ways to negotiate the challenges of the medical experience.  Discusses comics as visual rhetoric"—Provided by publisher.  {{ISBN|9780271066493}}; 195 pages, includes bibliographic references.  This was the inaugural volume in the ongoing Graphic Medicine series at Penn State University Press, which is co-edited by Susan M. Squier and Ian Williams.  For recent publications in the Graphic Medicine series, see its website:

In 2014, the first American Library Association Will Eisner Graphic Novel Growth Grant was awarded to Ypsilanti District Library, (Ypsilanti, Michigan) for its proposal to build a collection of graphic medicine narratives.  To date, that collection contains over 100 titles, which can be viewed in a subject search '''Graphic Medicine''' on the library's website: www.ypsilibrary.org. Author MK Czerwiec lectured in the fall of 2014 at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital (Ypsilanti, Michigan) in support of this grant.

A '''honeycomb mirror''' is a large [[mirror]] usually used as the [[primary mirror]] in [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[reflecting telescope]]s whose face is supported by a ribbed structure that resembles a [[honeycomb]]. The design provides sufficient rigidity for ultra-high precision [[optics]] while reducing the weight of the mirror. The reduced weight, in turn, allows smaller, lighter support and control structures, reducing the overall cost of the telescope. The term may also refer to mirrors made up of a coordinated set of individual hexagonal mirrors.

The development of the honeycomb mirror has allowed the creation of larger instruments than would be feasible with solid mirrors. Solid mirrors are not only mechanically cumbersome, but are also difficult to cast and safely cool into a single, large blocks of glass. Honeycomb designs can reduce the weight of the mirror by as much as eighty percent.

The word "isentropic" is occasionally, though not customarily, interpreted in another way, reading it as if its meaning were deducible from its [[etymology]]. This is contrary to its original and customarily used definition. In this occasional reading, it means a process in which the [[entropy]] of the system remains unchanged. For example, this could occur in a system where the work done on the system includes friction internal to the system, and heat is withdrawn from the system in just the right amount to compensate for the internal friction, so as to leave the entropy unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Çengel, Y. A., Boles, M. A. (2015). ''Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach'', 8th edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-07-339817-4}}, pp. 340–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;TdS \ge \delta Q,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of energy the system gains by heating, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] of the system, and &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; is the change in entropy. The equal sign refers to a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]], which is an imagined idealized theoretical limit, never actually occurring in physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E. A.]] (1985). ''Thermodynamics. An Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists'', seventh edition, North Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0444869514}}, p. 12: "As a limiting case between natural and unnatural processes[,] we have reversible processes, which consist of the passage in either direction through a continuous series of equilibrium states. Reversible processes do not actually occur..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kestin, J. (1966). ''A Course in Thermodynamics'', Blaisdell Publishing Company, Waltham MA, p. 127: "However, by a stretch of imagination, it was accepted that a process, compression or expansion, as desired, could be performed 'infinitely slowly'[,] or as is sometimes said, ''quasistatically''."  P. 130: "It is clear that ''all natural processes are irreversible'' and that reversible processes constitute convenient idealizations only."&lt;/ref&gt; For an isentropic process, which by definition is reversible, there is no transfer of energy as heat because the process is [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]]. In an irreversible process of transfer of energy as work, entropy is produced within the system; consequently, in order to maintain constant entropy within the system, energy must be removed from the system as heat during the process.

For reversible processes, an isentropic transformation is carried out by thermally "insulating" the system from its surroundings. Temperature is the thermodynamic [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variable]] to entropy, thus the conjugate process would be an [[isothermal process]], in which the system is thermally "connected" to a constant-temperature heat bath.

== Isentropic processes in thermodynamic systems ==
[[File:Isentropic.jpg|thumb|T–s (entropy vs. temperature) diagram of an isentropic process, which is a vertical line segment]]
The entropy of a given mass does not change during a process that is internally reversible and adiabatic. A process during which the entropy remains constant is called an isentropic process, written &lt;math&gt; \Delta s=0 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; s_1 = s_2 &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;Cengel, Yunus A., and Michaeul A. Boles. Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach. 7th Edition ed. New York: Mcgraw-Hill, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some examples of theoretically isentropic thermodynamic devices are [[pump]]s, [[gas compressor]]s, [[turbine]]s, [[nozzle]]s, and [[Diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]]s.

===Isentropic efficiencies of steady-flow devices in thermodynamic systems===
Most steady-flow devices operate under adiabatic conditions, and the ideal process for these devices is the isentropic process. The parameter that describes how efficiently a device approximates a corresponding isentropic device is called isentropic or adiabatic efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Cengel, Yunus A., and Michaeul A. Boles. Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach. 7th Edition ed. New York: Mcgraw-Hill, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isentropic efficiency of turbines:
: &lt;math&gt; \eta_\text{t} = \frac{\text{actual turbine work}}{\text{isentropic turbine work}} = \frac{W_a}{W_s} \cong \frac{h_1 - h_{2a}}{h_1 - h_{2s}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Isentropic efficiency of compressors:
: &lt;math&gt; \eta_\text{c} = \frac{\text{isentropic compressor work}}{\text{actual compressor work}} = \frac{W_s}{W_a} \cong \frac{h_{2s} - h_1}{h_{2a} - h_1}. &lt;/math&gt;

Isentropic efficiency of nozzles:
: &lt;math&gt; \eta_\text{n} = \frac{\text{actual KE at nozzle exit}}{\text{isentropic KE at nozzle exit}} = \frac{V_{2a}^2}{V_{2s}^2} \cong \frac{h_1 - h_{2a}}{h_1 - h_{2s}}. &lt;/math&gt;

For all the above equations:
: &lt;math&gt; h_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the specific [[enthalpy]] at the entrance state,
: &lt;math&gt; h_{2a}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific enthalpy at the exit state for the actual process,
: &lt;math&gt; h_{2s}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific enthalpy at the exit state for the isentropic process.

Note: The isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles. Real cycles have inherent losses due to compressor and turbine inefficiencies and the second law of thermodynamics. Real systems are not truly isentropic, but isentropic behavior is an adequate approximation for many calculation purposes.

== Isentropic flow ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Shock wave]] --&gt;

In fluid dynamics, an '''isentropic flow''' is a [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flow]] that is both adiabatic and reversible. That is, no heat is added to the flow, and no energy transformations occur due to [[friction]] or [[dissipation|dissipative effects]]. For an isentropic flow of a perfect gas, several relations can be derived to define the pressure, density and temperature along a streamline.

Note that energy ''can'' be exchanged with the flow in an isentropic transformation, as long as it doesn't happen as heat exchange. An example of such an exchange would be an isentropic expansion or compression that entails work done on or by the flow.

For an isentropic flow, entropy density can vary between different streamlines.  If the entropy density is the same everywhere, then the flow is said to be [[Homentropic flow|homentropic]].

=== Derivation of the isentropic relations ===

For a closed system, the total change in energy of a system is the sum of the work done and the heat added:
: &lt;math&gt;dU = \delta W + \delta Q.&lt;/math&gt;
The reversible work done on a system by changing the volume is
:&lt;math&gt;dW = -p \,dV,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]], and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]]. The change in [[enthalpy]] (&lt;math&gt;H = U + pV&lt;/math&gt;) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;dH = dU + p \,dV + V \,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

Then for a process that is both reversible and adiabatic (i.e. no heat transfer occurs), &lt;math&gt; \delta Q_\text{rev} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;dS = \delta Q_\text{rev}/T = 0!&lt;/math&gt;.  All reversible adiabatic processes are isentropic.  This leads to two important observations:
: &lt;math&gt;dU = \delta W + \delta Q = -p \,dV + 0,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;dH = \delta W + \delta Q + p \,dV + V \,dp = -p \,dV + 0 + p \,dV + V \,dp = V \,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

Next, a great deal can be computed for isentropic processes of an ideal gas.  For any transformation of an ideal gas, it is always true that
:&lt;math&gt;dU = n C_v \,dT&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;dH = n C_p \,dT.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the general results derived above for &lt;math&gt;dU&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dH&lt;/math&gt;, then
: &lt;math&gt;dU = n C_v \,dT = -p \,dV,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;dH = n C_p \,dT = V \,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

So for an ideal gas, the [[heat capacity ratio]] can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_V} = -\frac{dp/p}{dV/V}.&lt;/math&gt;

For an ideal gas &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is constant. Hence on integrating the above equation, assuming a perfect gas, we get
: &lt;math&gt; pV^\gamma = \text{constant},&lt;/math&gt;
that is,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Equation of state#Classical ideal gas law|equation of state]] for an ideal gas, &lt;math&gt;p V = n R T&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;     
(Proof: &lt;math&gt;PV^\gamma = \text{constant} \Rightarrow PV\,V^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant} \Rightarrow nRT\,V^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant}.&lt;/math&gt; But ''nR'' = constant itself, so &lt;math&gt;TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant}&lt;/math&gt;.)

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{p^{\gamma-1}}{T^\gamma} = \text{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

also, for constant &lt;math&gt;C_p = C_v + R&lt;/math&gt; (per mole),
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{V}{T} = \frac{nR}{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p = \frac{nRT}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; S_2-S_1 = nC_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - nR\ln\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{S_2-S_1}{n} = C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - R\ln\left(\frac{T_2 V_1}{T_1 V_2}\right ) = C_v\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)+ R \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for isentropic processes with an ideal gas,
: &lt;math&gt; T_2 = T_1\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{(R/C_v)}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; V_2 = V_1\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^{(C_v/R)}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Liquid Jungle Lab''' (LJL) is a tropical marine research station on the island of [[Canales de Tierra]] on the western coast of Pacific [[Panamá]] along a primary marine biological corridor. The LJL research campus was completed in 2004 and is part of a private 3,500 hectare reserve composed of primary forest, mangroves, tide pools, and a rocky inter-tidal zone that transitions into fringing coral reefs.

The island laboratory is adjacent to two large coastal bays, [[Bahia Honda, Veraguas Province]] and [[Pixvae Bay]], which are important [[mangrove]], [[estuarine]] and riparian (stream) habitats. The island and laboratory serve as a strategic base for ecologic research of the [[Coiba National Park]], a  [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1138 Coiba National Park UNESCO World Heritage Site]&lt;/ref&gt; and Panama’s largest marine protected area. The tremendous biodiversity of the marine and terrestrial environments surrounding Isla Canales de Tierra allows visiting scientists to conduct multidisciplinary ecologic research in a pristine area and has even inspired a designer perfume fragrance, Fleur de Liane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artisanparfumeur.com/ Fleur de Liane] Artisan Parfumeur&lt;/ref&gt; The LJL was founded by [[Jean Pigozzi]], a Swiss [[venture capitalist]], photographer and art collector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caacart.com Contemporary African Art Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrestrial Science===

[[Image:Nueque.jpg|thumb|''[[Dasyprocta punctata]]'' (infant), a herbivorous animal commonly known as a "Nueque"]]
The local fauna includes a long list of avian species such as toucans (''Ramphastos sulfuratus''), owls (''Pulsatrix perspicillata'')  humming birds (''Hylocharys elicieae'', ''Phaetornis superciliosus''), manakins (''Chiroxiphia lanceolata'') pelicans and a plethora of other marine birds. Many mammals, unique to Central America inhabit the island such as [[howler monkey]]s (''Allouatta palliata'', and the endemic Coiba species ''Alouatta coibensis''), capuchin monkeys (''Cebus capucinus'') coatis (''Nasua narica''), raccoons (''Procyon cancrivorus''), pacas (''Agouti paca''), agoutis or nueques (''Dasyprocta sp''), tayras (''Eira barbara''), bats (''Glossophaga soricina'' &amp;''Carollia castanea'') sloths (''Bradypus variegatus'') margays (''Leopardus wiedii'') and white-tailed deer (''Odocoileus virginianus'').  Besides the thousands of species of plants and insects endemic to this region of the tropical Americas, many reptile and amphibian species are also found on the island.  Even occasionally the rare jungle cat (''Leopardus pardalis'') is spotted in the dense jungle surrounding nearby Bahia Honda and Pixvae. In 2004 botanists, herpetologists, entomologists, ornithologists, and biologists convened to create the first comprehensive catalog of tropical plants, reptiles, insect, birds, and mammal diversity of this Pacific Coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;Castroviejo S, &amp; Alicia Ibanez (2003) Estudio Sobre la Biodiversidad de la Region de Bahia Honda (Veraguas, Panama) Inventario de Biodiversidad.

==Regional Geography and Geology==
[[Geography of Panama]]
The Gulf of Chiriquí contains several prominent, offshore island complexes including Isla Coiba (493&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Isla Cébaco]] (80&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) Islas Ladrones, Islas Secas, and Islas Contreras. Other islands like Jicarón, Leones, Gobernadora, Verde, Canales de Afuera, Ranchería, Papagayo, Canales de Tierra, and Jicarita are part of a group of more than forty smaller island clusters scattered near the coast. Coastal areas in the gulf are a mélange of mid to late Tertiary volcanics, and much newer Quaternary period alluvial sedimentary series. Smaller island clusters are predominantly basalt outcrops once associated with the mainland before sea level rise. Coiba Island, the largest in the region, shares geomorphologies similar to the mainland Azuero peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Biology and geology of eastern Pacific Coral reefs. Coral Reefs 16: S39-S46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate and Oceanographic conditions of Pacific Panama.==
The climate of Panamá is largely affected by the position of a low atmospheric pressure zone known as the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) which also affects seasonal evolution of [[geostrophic current]]s in the Panamá Bight. During the rainy season (December through May), the ITCZ is located to the North of Panamá and produces light and variable winds and ocean circulation in the Panamá Bight is [[anticyclonic]] (west) which creates a southerly flowing coastal current. As a result of these punctuated seasonal movements of the ITCZ, Panamá experiences high seasonal rainfall often reaching more than 3000&amp;nbsp;mm/yr. Starting in October and continuing into the dry season (January to March) the ITCZ moves South of Panamá,&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Rubio E, Jose Stuardo (2002) Variability of photosynthetic pigments in the Colombian Pacific Ocean and its relationship with the wind field using ADEOS-I data. Proc. Indian Acad. Sci (Earth Planet. Sci.) 11: 227-236&lt;/ref&gt; producing a dominant period of northeasterly tradewinds known as the Panamá Jet, which results in a reversal of water circulation and becomes a cyclonic [[gyre]] with a coastal current flowing to the north. [[Upwelling]] develops in the [[Gulf of Panama]] during the dry season when northeast tradewinds from the Caribbean blow over to the Pacific through a physiographic gap in the central mountain range which divides the Isthmus. This wind stress creates seasonal [[Ekman spiral]] pumping and displaces nutrient-poor coastal surface water with cool, nutrient rich, water masses.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Rubio E, Wolfgang Schneider (2003) On the seasonal circulation within the Panama Bight derived from satellite observations of wind, altimetry and sea surface temperature. Geophysical Research Letters 30: 63-67
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seasonal effects on Marine Life==
[[Image:LJL divers.jpg|thumb|WHOI scientists at LJL installing a '''Video Plankton Recorder''']]This nutrient rich upwelling such as occurs in the Gulf of Panama, can stimulate [[Plankton]] production leading to blooms of centric, colonial, and penate diatoms and dinoflagellates. Zooplankton populations often respond to this by subsequently increasing growth and reproduction rates. Scientists are now able to quantify the abundance and diversity of these microscopic organisms ''in-situ'' with sensors such as the Video Plankton Recorder (a specialized underwater microscope and imaging system).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, CS, Hu, Q, SM Gallager, x Tang, C Ashjian. 2004 Real-time observation of taxa-specific plankton abundance: An optical sampling method. Mar. Ecol. Progr. Series 284:77-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panama Liquid Jungle Underwater Tropical Observatory [http://4dgeo.whoi.edu/panama/ PLUTO]==
[[Image:PLUTO.jpg|thumb|'''PLUTO''' measures real time oceanographic conditions at LJL]]
In order to understand oceanic and atmospheric coupling, and the potential effects of these phenomena on ocean life, scientists must collect time series data which measure weather patterns, ocean circulation and sea water chemistry. PLUTO is a fiber-optic cabled observatory deployed in January 2006 in approximately 18 m of water 1.5&amp;nbsp;km to the south west of Isla de Canales de Tierra. The observatory consists of sensors for salinity, temperature, pressure, water current speed and direction, chlorophyll, turbidity, oxygen, down-welling light at two depths, an array of temperature sensors. A remotely controlled, high definition pan and tilt underwater camera displays rapid image updates of the benthic habitat surrounding the PLUTO sensors. The data are distributed via satellite back to WHOI and made available on the web (http://4dgeo.whoi.edu/panama/).

==Coral Reefs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP)==
[[Image:SCUBA COP.jpg|thumb|3-D mapping of coral reef habitats with [https://web.archive.org/web/20090205144542/http://oceanalytic.com/ '''SCUBA COP'''] optical imaging dive sled]]Coral reefs usually exist in the [[euphotic]] zone (shallow areas of the sea where light can penetrate) along coastal or island areas, and require clear, [[oligotroph]]ic (low nutrient) water in a narrow temperature and salinity range.  [[Littoral]] areas located along the Southern [[Isthmus of Panamá]] demonstrate highly complex ecological interactions and distributions of endemic and migratory marine species due in part to the overlap of continental [[ecotones]], tropical weather patterns and the convergence of powerful sea currents.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn PW, J.S. Ault (2000) A biogeographic analysis and review of the far eastern Pacific coral reef region. Coral Reefs 19: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic of Panamá, there is estimated 290&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of reefs along both Caribbean and Pacific coasts, however much higher diversity (about 68 hard coral species) occurs in the Caribbean, compared to 33 known species from 11 genera living along the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;Cortes J, Guzman, Hector (1998) Organsimos de los arrecifes coralinos de Costa Rica: descripcion, distribucion geografica e historia natural de los corales zooxantelados (Anthozoa: Sleractinia) del Pacifico. Revista de Biologia Tropical 46&lt;/ref&gt;  
The [[Eastern Tropical Pacific]] (ETP) is a biotope known for intrinsically low coral species diversity which unfortunately enhances the potential threats to these coral reef systems. Besides the direct effects of overfishing, anchor damage, and coral mining, terrestrial land use affects coral reef habitats in more indirect ways.  Panamá experiences high seasonal rainfall (3000&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.) and  reefs can be severely impacted if corals are chronically exposed to the runoff of nutrients originating from deforestation and soil erosion, fertilizers, pesticides&lt;ref&gt;Glynn PW, L.S. Howard, Eugene Corcoran, Ana D. Freay (1984) The occurrence and toxicity of herbicides in reef building corals. Mar Poll Bulletin 15:370-374&lt;/ref&gt; or untreated sewage.  In addition to being a primary area for cattle ranching and agriculture, unregulated construction, septic waste increase and local coastal population expansion poses a tangible threat to the biological integrity of coral reefs &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  surrounding the Coiba Island Marine Protected Area (MPA).&lt;ref&gt;Guzman HM, Guevara, Carlos A., Breedy, Odalisca (2004) Distribution, diversity, and conservation of coral reefs and coral communities in the largest marine protected area of Pacific Panama (Coiba Island). Environmental Conservation 31: 111-121&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:LJL mangrove.jpg|thumb|WHOI scientist sampling the Bahia Honda mangroves]]  [[Mangrove]] areas of Bahia Honda, Pixvae, and Puerto Mutis are important for the health of the local reefs, because mangroves not only filter the nutrients emptying onto reefs, but are important nurseries for juvenile fish,&lt;ref&gt;

Scientists from around the world use the Liquid Jungle Lab facilities to study these reef systems in greater detail in order to establish ecologic baselines and understand natural and human impacts to the fish and marine life that rely on these habitats.

These official state soils share the same level of distinction as official [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flowers]] and [[List of U.S. state birds|birds]]. Also, representative soils have been selected for [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Soils |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |url=http://soils.usda.gov/gallery/state_soils/ |accessdate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313220600/http://soils.usda.gov/gallery/state_soils/ |archivedate=2007-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a '''list of the largest [[exoplanet]]s''' so far discovered, in terms of physical size, ordered by radius.
__TOC__
{{clear}}

==List==
The sizes are listed in units of [[Jupiter radius|Jupiter radii]] ({{Jupiter radius}}, {{Jupiter radius|greek=y}})(71,492km). All planets listed are larger than two times the size of the largest [[planet]] in the Solar System, [[Jupiter]]. Some planets that are smaller than {{jupiter radius|1.7}} have been included for comparison.

{{List dispute|date=May 2012}}
Below is a '''list of [[star]]s arranged in order of decreasing [[luminosity]]''' (increasing [[bolometric magnitude]]). Accurate measurement of stellar luminosities is quite difficult in practice, even when the apparent magnitude is measured accurately, for four reasons:

#The distance ''d'' to the star must be known, to convert apparent to absolute magnitude. Absolute magnitude is the [[apparent magnitude]] a star would have if it were 10 [[parsec]]s away from the viewer. Since apparent brightness decreases as the square of the distance (i.e. as 1/''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a small error (e.g. 10%) in determining ''d'' implies an error ~2× as large (thus 20%) in luminosity. Stellar distances are only directly measured accurately out to ''d'' ~1000 lt-yrs.
#The observed magnitudes must be corrected for the absorption or [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] of intervening interstellar or circumstellar dust and gas. This correction can be enormous and difficult to determine precisely. For example, until accurate [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] observations became possible ~50 years ago, the [[Galactic Center]] of the [[Milky Way]] was totally obscured to visual observations.
#The magnitudes at the wavelengths measured must be corrected for those not observed. "Absolute bolometric magnitude" (which term is redundant, practically speaking, since bolometric magnitudes are nearly always "absolute", i.e. corrected for distance) is a measure of the star's luminosity, summing over its emission at all wavelengths, and thus the total amount of [[energy]] [[solar radiation|radiated]] by a [[star]] every [[second]]. Bolometric magnitudes can only be estimated by correcting for unobserved portions of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] that have to be modeled, which is always an issue, and often a large correction. The list is dominated by hot blue stars which produce the majority of their energy output in the ultraviolet, but these may not necessarily be the brightest stars at visual wavelengths.
#A large proportion of stellar systems discovered with very high luminosity have later been found to be binary. Usually this results in the total system luminosity being reduced and spread among several components. These binaries are common both because the conditions that produce high mass high luminosity stars also favour multiple star systems, but also because searches for highly luminous stars are inevitably biased towards detecting systems with multiple more normal stars combining to appear luminous.

Because of all these problems, other references may give ''very'' different lists of the most luminous stars (different ordering or different stars altogether). Data on different stars can be of somewhat different reliability, depending on the attention one particular star has received as well as largely differing physical difficulties in analysis (see the [[Pistol Star]] for an example). The last stars in the list are familiar nearby stars put there for comparison, and not among the most luminous known. It may also interest the reader to know that the Sun is more luminous than approximately 95% of all known stars in the local neighborhood (out to, say, a few hundred light years), due to enormous numbers of somewhat less massive stars that are cooler and often much less luminous. For perspective, the overall range of stellar luminosities runs from dwarfs less than 1/10,000th as luminous as the Sun, to supergiants over 1,000,000 times more luminous.

==Data==
This list is currently limited mostly to galactic and Magellanic Cloud objects, but a few stars in other local group galaxies can now be examined in enough detail to determine the luminosities. As of mid-2012 the list is more or less complete for stars down to 1,000,000 times the luminosity of the Sun. Some suspected binaries in this magnitude range are excluded because there is insufficient information about the luminosity of the individual components. Selected fainter stars are also shown for comparison.

Despite their extreme luminosity, many of these stars are nevertheless too distant to be observed with the naked eye. Stars that are at least sometimes visible to the unaided eye have their apparent magnitude (6.5 or brighter) highlighted in blue.

Note that even the most luminous [[star]]s are much less luminous than the more luminous persistent extragalactic objects, such as [[quasar]]s. For example, [[3C 273]] has an average [[apparent magnitude]] of 12.8 (when observing with a [[telescope]]), but an [[absolute magnitude]] of −26.7. If this object were 10 parsecs away from Earth it would appear nearly as bright in the sky as the [[Sun]] (apparent magnitude −26.74). This quasar's [[luminosity]] is, therefore, about 2 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total [[light]] of average large [[galaxy|galaxies]] like our [[Milky Way]]. (Note that quasars often vary somewhat in luminosity.)

In terms of [[gamma rays]], a [[magnetar]] (type of [[neutron star]]) called [[SGR 1806-20]], had an extreme burst reach Earth on 27 December 2004. It was the brightest event known to have impacted this [[planet]] from an origin outside the [[Solar System]]; if these [[gamma rays]] were visible, with an [[absolute magnitude]] of approx. −29, it would be brighter than the Sun ''(as measured by the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] spacecraft)''.

The [[Gamma-ray burst]] [[GRB 971214]] measured in 1998 was at the time thought to be the most energetic event in the [[observable universe]], with the equivalent energy of several hundred [[supernova]]e. Later studies pointed out that the energy was probably the energy of one supernova which had been "beamed" towards Earth by the geometry of a relativistic jet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54396">[[File:Systems engineering application projects collage.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Systems engineering]] is an interdisciplinary field of [[engineering]], that focuses on the development and organization of complex [[system]]s.]] 
This '''list of systems engineering at universities''' gives an overview of the different forms of [[systems engineering]] (SE) programs, faculties, and institutes at universities worldwide. Since there is no clear consensus on what constitutes a systems engineering degree, this list simply identifies the college and department offering degrees and the degrees offered.

Education in systems engineering is often observed to be an extension to the regular [[engineering]] courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gaudisite.nl/DidacticRecommendationsSESlides.pdf | title=Didactic Recommendations for Education in Systems Engineering | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the industry attitude that engineering professionals need a foundational background in one of the traditional engineering disciplines (e.g. civil engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering) plus professional, real-world experience to be effective as systems engineers. Undergraduate university programs in systems engineering are rare.

Education in systems engineering can be viewed as ''systems-centric'' or ''domain-centric''. 
* ''Systems-centric'' programs treat systems engineering as a separate discipline with most courses focusing on systems engineering theory and practice.
* ''Domain-centric'' programs offer systems engineering topics as an option that can be imbedded within the major domains or fields of engineering.
Both categories strive to educate the systems engineer with capability to oversee interdisciplinary projects with the depth required of a core-engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf |title=Perspectives of Systems Engineering Accreditation |publisher=[[INCOSE]] |accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Council on Systems Engineering]] (INCOSE)  maintains a continuously updated Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs worldwide.&lt;ref name="edu_dir"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[INCOSE]] Education &amp; Research Technical Committee|url=http://www.incose.org/educationcareers/academicprogramdirectory.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040623/http://www.incose.org/educationcareers/academicprogramdirectory.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-02-21|title=Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs|accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marc Zabeau''' (born [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]], 1949) is a Belgian scientist and businessman.

== Biography ==
Marc Zabeau graduated in 1971 as a licentiate in zoology at the [[University of Ghent]] and obtained a PhD in 1974, studying the genetics of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' in the lab of [[Jeff Schell]].

In 1976, on an [[NFWO]] scholarship as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] Hayes postdoctoral fellow, he went for two years to the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], the United States. From 1978 until 1983 he worked at the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]]. during his stay in Heidelberg, he was appointed as professor of genetic engineering at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

In 1983, he became director of research of [[Plant Genetic Systems]] in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]] and in 1986 director of intellectual property and business development. He founded several biotech companies, such as Helix C.V. ([[Ghent]], 1988), KeyeGene N.V. ([[Wageningen]], 1989), GenScope Inc. (United States, 1995) and Methexis (Ghent, 1997). In 1999, he succeeded [[Marc Van Montagu]] as scientific director of the Department of Plant Systems Biology at the [[Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie|Flanders Institute for Biotechnology]] (VIB). In 2002, he was succeeded by [[Dirk Inzé]]. In 1999, he was appointed as full-time professor of genome biology and functional genomics at the University of Ghent.

Zabeau was formerly  CEO of Trinean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research///stocks/private/person.asp?personId=32388932&amp;privcapId=49713815&amp;previousCapId=49713815&amp;previousTitle=Trinean%20NV]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031021908/https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=32388932&amp;privcapId=49713815&amp;previousCapId=49713815&amp;previousTitle=Trinean%20NV |date=31 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9941">'''Mary Budd Rowe''' (1925–1996) was an American science educator and education researcher, best known for her work on "wait time," which showed that when teachers wait longer for children to answer a question, learning and inference can dramatically improve.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/96/960625roweobit.html|title=Science education innovator Mary Budd Rowe dies at 71 (6/96)|website=news.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bianchini|first=Julie A.|date=2008-06-04|title=Mary Budd Rowe: a storyteller of science|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11422-008-9132-y|journal=Cultural Studies of Science Education|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=799–810|doi=10.1007/s11422-008-9132-y|issn=1871-1502}}&lt;/ref&gt; She headed the science education research division of the [[National Science Foundation]], was an advisor to several influential educational television shows, and served on numerous national standards and review committees.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

Rowe authored over 100 journal articles and several books.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Born and raised in New Jersey, Rowe attributed her interest and approach to science education to an early encounter with [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/OBITUARY-Mary-Budd-Rowe-2976309.php|title=OBITUARY -- Mary Budd Rowe|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her middle school's annual visit to [[Princeton University|Princeton]], she encountered the physicist gesturing and moving his hands rapidly, looking at a fountain. He asked Rowe, then in seventh grade, if she could stop the water long enough to see the shapes of the droplets. He then showed her how to wave her fingers to create a [[Stroboscopic effect|strobe effect]] and examine the shapes the water made.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Rowe and Einstein experimented together for a few minutes to achieve the best effect. As Rowe would tell the story, as he left her he said "Never forget that science is just that kind of exploring and fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/92/920218Arc2408.html|title=Science "a special kind of story-making" to educator Rowe|website=news.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nearly half a century later," wrote Rowe in 1995, "I've spent an entire career trying to impart Einstein's words to adults and children all over the world: Science is exploring, and exploring is fun."&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

Rowe attended college in New Jersey, graduating with bachelor's degrees in biology and education in 1947. She earned a master's degree in zoology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1954. She earned a doctorate in science education from [[Stanford University]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

== Research ==

=== Wait Time ===
In the early 1970s, Rowe published research newly describing a variable of teacher behavior, "wait time," to measure the amount of time a teacher waits for a student to start answering a question and the amount of time a teacher waits once the student stops speaking before continuing the lesson or asking another question. Rowe found that a number of student outcomes improved when teachers waited longer for students to answer.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rowe collected hundreds of recordings of classroom talk, and fed the sound from the tapes into a mechanical plotter to allow her to measure the lengths of pauses in conversation. This work found that teachers were waiting an average of less than a second for the student to answer, or for the student to continue his or her answer after pausing.

When teachers were coached to wait longer, students use of language and logic improved, as did student and teacher attitudes and expectations.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=M. B.|date=2016-06-25|title=Wait Time: Slowing Down May Be A Way of Speeding Up!|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/002248718603700110|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=43–50|doi=10.1177/002248718603700110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students' answers increased in length by 300 to 700 percent, contained more inferences and speculative teaching, and shifted the classroom experience to more teacher and student exchanges — relying less on teacher show-and-tell. Moreover, the number of "I don't know" and non-responses decreased.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Additional studies found consistent results in a variety of educational settings, from elementary to college-age students, and from special educational to gifted and talented classes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Rowe and others' work also found that there was a significant threshold effect: when wait time increased to 2.7 seconds or longer, performance improved, smaller increases yielded significantly smaller benefits.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Praise and "fate control" ===
Rowe's classroom conversation studies also examined how teachers responded to student answers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Mary Budd|date=1974-12-01|year=|title=Relation of wait-time and rewards to the development of language, logic, and fate control: Part II-Rewards|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tea.3660110403/abstract|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=291–308|doi=10.1002/tea.3660110403|issn=1098-2736|archive-url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tea.3660110403/epdf|archive-date=31 Jan 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose found that "sanctioning behavior"—either positive praise or negative feedback—discouraged the quality of student responses. Even when positive praise was consistently offered, student response became questioning ("the answer is five?"); in essence, Rowe found, praise led students to be more focused on discovering whether the teacher would approve than on discovering how the scientific phenomenon worked.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rowe proposed that understanding science confers a sense of "fate control," giving the student confidence that they can control outcomes in the world, and that reliance on teacher praise eroded this sense of controlling one's own fate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Advocacy and education ==
As leader of the science education research division of the National Science Foundation from 1976 to 1980, and later in her career, Rowe advocated improved science education techniques across the United States and internationally.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; She served on several high-profile commissions, including the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment.

In 1993-94, Rowe co-chaired the blue ribbon Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology, which produced one of the most comprehensive federal reviews of science education programs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/27924/title/Experts-Laud-Call-For-Revamping-U-S--Science-Education-Programs/|title=Experts Laud Call For Revamping U.S. Science Education Programs {{!}} The Scientist Magazine®|website=The Scientist|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel recommended overhauling the approach to funding these programs, with far greater emphasis on assessing which programs were effective and coordinating across agencies. After the release of the report, Rowe said "We're in a competitive, almost life-death kind of struggle with other countries. And I don't think we can afford to invest big amounts in programs that don't work."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Rowe also brought her expertise in science education to a number of broader forums. She served as a science advisor to educational television shows, ''[[3-2-1 Contact]], Voyage of the Mimi, and [[Reading Rainbow]].''&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

== Impact ==
Rowe's research on wait time has had an lasting impact, influencing how science educators are trained for decades after first publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Deborah|last2=Tanner|first2=Kimberly|date=2002-03-20|title=Approaches in Cell Biology Teaching|url=http://www.lifescied.org/content/1/1/3|journal=Cell Biology Education|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–5|doi=10.1187/cbe.02-04-0430|issn=1931-7913|pmc=118377|pmid=12587024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Rowe's death in 1996, Richard Shavelson, dean of the Stanford School of Education, lauded Rowe as "one of the giants in the field of science education and clearly looked upon as a leader."&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

'''Mercury-Redstone BD''' was an unmanned booster development flight in the U.S. [[Mercury program]]. It was launched on March 24, 1961 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 5|Launch Complex 5]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. The mission used a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] Mercury spacecraft and Redstone MRLV-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm |title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury - NASA SP-4201 |authors=Loyd S. Swenson Jr., James M. Grimwood, Charles C. Alexander |chapter=10 |page=7 |publisher=NASA Special Publication-4201 in the NASA History Series |year=1966 |accessdate=26 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the problems that developed during the [[Mercury-Redstone 2|MR-2]] mission carrying the chimpanzee Ham, it was apparent that the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone]] needed further development before it could be trusted to carry a human passenger.

[[Wernher von Braun|Dr. Wernher von Braun]] added Mercury-Redstone BD (''Booster Development'') to the launch schedule between the MR-2 and MR-3 missions. This went over the protests of some, including astronaut [[Alan Shepard]], who argued that the problems on MR-2 had been quickly identified and easily fixed. Von Braun was adamant that the Redstone could not be considered man-rated until a completely perfect test flight and that the launch vehicle performance on MR-1A and MR-2 had not met acceptable standards for carrying a human passenger.

The cause of previous Redstone rocket over-accelerations was a servo valve that did not properly regulate the flow of hydrogen peroxide to the steam generator. This in turn overpowered the fuel pumps. The thrust regulator and velocity integrator were modified on the MR-BD and later Mercury-Redstone rockets to prevent them from exceeding the speed limit again. Other modifications were made to prevent engine cutoff from propellant depletion rather than a programmed signal, which had led to an inadvertent abort and LES activation on MR-2.

Another problem encountered in previous Mercury-Redstone flights were harmonic vibrations induced by aerodynamic stress in the topmost section of the elongated Redstone. To fix this problem, four stiffeners were added to the ballast section and 210 pounds (95&amp;nbsp;kg) of insulation was applied to the inner skin of the upper part of the Mercury Redstone instrument compartment.

The mission used a boilerplate Mercury spacecraft with an inert escape rocket. The spacecraft also did not have a retro package or posigrade rockets.

The MR-BD mission lasted eight minutes and 23 seconds. It reached an apogee of 113.5 miles (183&amp;nbsp;km) and a range of 307 miles (494&amp;nbsp;km). The peak velocity was 5,123&amp;nbsp;mph (8,245&amp;nbsp;km/h).
The spacecraft experienced a peak load of 11 ''g'' (108&amp;nbsp;m/s²). There was no intention to separate the Redstone rocket and boilerplate Mercury spacecraft and they impacted together 307 miles (494&amp;nbsp;km) downrange, 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) short of the plan. They sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, exploding a [[sofar bomb]] en route. Booster performance was excellent other than some vibration issues in the adapter area.

MR-BD was highly successful and led the way to the flight of [[Alan Shepard]] aboard [[Mercury-Redstone 3|MR-3]].

==Trivia==
In the USSR, the mission was erroneously recognized as failure:
{{quote|The Commander reported that the Americans are planning to fly into space on April 28. I told him that they will not launch a man before us. On March 24 they had a big failure: capsule "Mercury" failed to separate from the carrier and sank in the ocean.|[[Nikolai Kamanin]]|[http://militera.lib.ru/db/kamanin_np/61.html Hidden space//Year 1961//April 7]}}

A '''monolithic HPLC column''', or monolithic column, is a column used in [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC).  The internal structure of the monolithic column is created in such a way that many channels form inside the column.  The material inside the column which separates the channels can be porous and functionalized.  In contrast, most HPLC configurations use particulate packed columns; in these configurations, tiny beads of an inert substance, typically a modified [[silica]], are used inside the column.&lt;ref name=Miller2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=James|title=Chromatography|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0471472077|page=212|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology overview ==
In analytical chromatography, the goal is to separate and uniquely identify each of the compounds in a substance. Alternatively, preparative scale chromatography is a method of purification of large batches of material in a production environment. The basic methods of separation in HPLC rely on a [[mobile phase]] (water, [[organic solvent]]s, etc.) being passed through a [[Stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]] (particulate silica packings, monoliths, etc.) in a closed environment (column); the differences in reactivity among the solvent of interest and the mobile and stationary phases distinguish compounds from one another in a series of adsorption and desorption phenomena. The results are then visually displayed in a resulting [[chromatogram]]. Stationary phases are available in many varieties of packing styles as well as chemical structures and can be functionalized for added specificity. Monolithic-style columns, or monoliths, are one of many types of stationary phase structure.

Monoliths, in chromatographic terms, are porous rod structures characterized by [[mesopores]] and macropores. These pores provide monoliths with high permeability, a large number of channels, and a high surface area available for reactivity. The backbone of a monolithic column is composed of either an organic or [[inorganic]] substrate, and can easily be chemically altered for specific applications. Their unique structure gives them several physico-mechanical properties that enable them to perform competitively against traditionally packed columns.

Historically, the typical HPLC column consists of high-purity particulate silica compressed into stainless steel tubing. To decrease run times and increase selectivity, smaller diffusion distances have been pursued. To achieve smaller diffusion distances there has been a decrease in the particle sizes. However, as the particle size decreases, the [[backpressure]] (for a given column diameter and a given volumetric flow) increases proportionally. Pressure is inversely proportional to the square of the particle size; i.e., when particle size is halved, pressure increases by a factor of four. This is because as the particle sizes get smaller, the interstitial voids (the spaces between the particles) do as well, and it is harder to push the compounds through the smaller spaces.  Modern HPLC systems are generally designed to withstand about {{convert|18000|psi|bar}} of backpressure in order to deal with this problem.

Monoliths also have very short [[diffusion]] distances, while also providing multiple pathways for solute dispersion. Packed particle columns have pore connectivity values of about 1.5, while monoliths have values ranging from 6 to greater than 10. This means that, in a particulate column, a given analyte may diffuse into and out of the same pore, or enter through one pore and exit through a connected pore. By contrast, an analyte in a monolith is able to enter one channel and exit through any of 6 or more different venues.&lt;ref name="Gagnon2008"&gt;“Eliminating the downstream processing bottleneck with monoliths and simulated moving bed chromatography.” Pete Gagnon, BioProcess International, September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Little of the [[surface area]] in a monolith is inaccessible to compounds in the mobile phase. The high degree of interconnectivity in monoliths confers an advantage seen in the low backpressures and readily achievable high flow rates.

Monoliths are ideally suited for large [[molecules]]. As mentioned previously, particle sizes are decreasing in an attempt to achieve higher resolution and faster separations, which led to higher backpressures. When the smaller particle sizes are used to separate [[biomolecules]], backpressures increase further because of the large molecule size. In monoliths, where backpressures are low and channel sizes are large, small molecule separations are less efficient. This is demonstrated by the dynamic binding capacities, a measure of how much sample can bind to the surface of the stationary phase. Dynamic binding capacities of monoliths for large molecules can be an order of ten times greater than that for particulate packings.&lt;ref name="Gagnon2008" /&gt;

Monoliths exhibit no shear forces or eddying effects. High interconnectivity of the mesopores allows for multiple avenues of convective flow through the column. [[Mass transport]] of solutes through the column is relatively unaffected by flow rate. This is completely at odds to traditional particulate packings, whereby eddy effects and shear forces contribute greatly to the loss of resolution and capacity, as seen in the vanDeemter curve. Monoliths can, however, suffer from a different flow disadvantage: wall effects. Silica monoliths, especially, have a tendency to pull away from the sides of their column encasing. When this happens, the flow of the mobile phase occurs around the stationary phase as well as through it, decreasing resolution. Wall effects have been reduced greatly by advances in column construction.

Other advantages of monoliths conferred by their individual construction include greater column to column and batch to batch reproducibility. One technique of creating monolith columns is to [[polymerize]] the structure [[in situ]]. This involves filling the mold or column tubing with a mixture of [[monomer]]s, a cross-linking agent, a free-radical initiator, and a porogenic solvent, then initiating the polymerization process under carefully controlled thermal or irradiating conditions. Monolithic in situ [[polymerization]] avoids the primary source of column to column variability, which is the packing procedure.&lt;ref&gt;“Porous monoliths: the newest generation of stationary phases for HPLC and related methods.” Recent developments in LC column technology, June 2003, 24-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, packed particle columns must be maintained in a solvent environment and cannot be exposed to air during or after the packing procedure. If exposed to air, the pores dry out and no longer provide adequate surface area for reactivity; the column must be repacked or discarded. Further, because particle compression and packing uniformity are not relevant to monoliths, they exhibit greater mechanical robustness; if particulate columns are dropped, for example, the integrity of the column may be corrupted. Monolithic columns are more physically stable than their particulate counterparts.

== Technology development ==

The roots of [[liquid chromatography]] extend back over a century ago to 1900, when Russian botanist [[Mikhail Tsvet]] began experimenting with plant [[pigment]]s in [[chlorophyll]].&lt;ref&gt;[[History of chromatography]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}} He noted that, when a solvent was applied, distinct bands appeared that migrated at different rates along a stationary phase. For this new observation, he coined the term “chromatography,” a colored picture. His first lecture on the subject was presented in 1903, but his most important contribution occurred three years later, in 1906, when the paper “[[Adsorption]] analysis and chromatographic method. Applications on the chemistry of chlorophyll,” was published. Rivalry with a colleague who readily and vocally denounced his work meant that chromatographic analysis was shelved for almost 25 years. The great irony of the matter is that it was his rival’s students who later took up the chromatography banner in their work with carotins.

Greatly unchanged from Tswett’s time until the 1940s, [[normal phase chromatography]] was performed by passing a [[gravity]]-fed solvent through small glass tubes packed with pellicular adsorbent beads.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It was in the 1940s, however, that there was a great revolution in [[gas chromatography]] (GC). Although GC was a wonderful technique for analyzing [[inorganic]] compounds, less than 20% of organic molecules are able to be separated using this technique. It was [[Richard Synge]], who in 1952 won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry for his work with [[partition chromatography]], who applied the theoretical knowledge gained from his work in GC to LC. From this revolution, the 1950s also saw the advent of paper chromatography, reversed-phase partition chromatography (RPC), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). The first gels for use in LC were created using cross-linked dextrans ([[Sephadex]]) in an attempt to realize Synge’s prediction that a unique single-piece stationary phase could provide an ideal chromatographic solution.

In the 1960s, [[polyacrylamide]] and [[agarose]] gels were created in a further attempt to create a single-piece stationary phase, but the purity of and stability of available components did not prove useful for implementation in the HPLC. In this decade, affinity chromatography was invented, an ultra-violet ([[ultra-violet|UV]]) detector was used for the first time in conjunction with LC, and, most importantly, the modern HPLC was born. [[Csaba Horváth (chemical engineer)|Csaba Horvath]] led the development of modern HPLC by piecing together laboratory equipment to suit his purposes. In 1968, Picker Nuclear Company marketed the first commercially available HPLC as a “Nucleic Acid Analyzer.” The following year, the first international symposia on HPLC was held, and Kirkland at [[DuPont]] was able to functionalize controlled porosity pellicular particles for the first time.

The 1970s and 1980s witnessed a renewed interest in separations media with reduced interparticular void volumes.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Perfusion]] chromatography showed, for the first time, that chromatography media could support high flow rates without sacrificing resolution.&lt;ref name="GE&amp;BNews2006"&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=1906 “Monoliths seen to revitalize bioseparations: new research will broaden the range of applications.”]{{dead link|date=April 2015}} Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News, October 2006 (Volume 26, No. 17).&lt;/ref&gt; Monoliths aptly fit into this new class of media, as they exhibit no void volume and can withstand flow rates up to 9mL/minute. [[Polymeric]] monoliths as they exist today were developed independently by three different labs in the late 1980s led by Hjerten, Svec, and Tennikova. Simultaneously, bioseparations became increasingly important, and monolith technologies proved beneficial in biotechnology separations.

Though industry focus in the 1980s was on biotechnology, focus in the 1990s shifted to process engineering.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} While mainstream chromatographers were using 3[[μm]] particulate columns, sub-2μm columns were in research phase. The smaller particles meant better resolution and shorter run times; there was also an associated increase in backpressure. In order to withstand the pressure, a new field of chromatography came into being: UHPLC or UPLC- ultra high pressure liquid chromatography. The new instruments were able to endure pressures of up to {{convert|15000|psi|bar}}, as opposed to conventional machines, which, as previously state, can hold up to {{convert|5000|psi|bar}}. UPLC is an alternative solution to the same problems monolithic columns solve. Similarly to UPLC, monolith chromatography can help the bottom line by increasing sample throughput, but without the need to spend capital on new equipment.

In 1996, [[Nobuo Tanaka (scientist)|Nobuo Tanaka]], at the [[Kyoto Institute of Technology]], prepared silica monoliths using a [[colloidal]] suspension synthesis (aka “[[sol-gel]]”) developed by a colleague.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The process is different from that used in polymeric monoliths. Polymeric monoliths, as mentioned above, are created in situ, using a mixture of monomers and a porogen within the column tubing. Silica monoliths, on the other hand, are created in a mold, undergo a significant amount of shrinkage, and are then clad in a polymeric shrink tubing like [[PEEK]] (polyetheretherketone) to reduce wall effects. This method limits the size of columns that can be produced to less than 15&amp;nbsp;cm long, and though standard analytical [[inner diameter]]s are readily achieved, there is currently a trend in developing [[nanoscale]] [[capillary]] and prep scale silica monoliths.

== Technology life cycle ==
Silica monoliths have only been commercially available since 2001, when [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] began their Chromolith campaign. &lt;ref name="Trends in Analytical Chemistry"&gt; "SilicaRODTM A new challenge in fast high-performance liquid chromatography separations." Trends in Analytical Chemistry, vol. 17, 1998, 50-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chromolith technology was licensed from Soga and Nakanishi’s group at Kyoto University. The new product won the PittCon Editors’ Gold Award for Best New Product, as well as an [[R&amp;D 100 Award]], both in 2001.

Individual monolith columns have a [[technology lifecycle|life cycle]] that generally exceeds that of its particulate competitors. When selecting an HPLC column supplier, column lifetime was second only to column-to-column reproducibility in importance to the purchaser. Chromolith columns, for example, have demonstrated [[reproducibility]] of 3,300 sample injections and 50,000 column volumes of mobile phase. Also important to the life cycle of the monolith is its increased mechanical robustness; polymeric monoliths are able to withstand [[pH]] ranges from 1 to 14, can endure elevated temperatures, and do not need to be handled delicately. “Monoliths are still teenagers,” affirms Frantisec Svec, a leader in the field of novel stationary phases for LC.&lt;ref name="C&amp;ENews2006"&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/84/8450cover.html “Monolithic chromatography: nontraditional column materials improve separations of biomixtures.”]{{dead link|date=April 2015}} Chemical &amp; Engineering News, December 2006, 84(50), 14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry evolution ==

Liquid chromatography as we know it today really got its start in 1969, when the first modern HPLC was designed and marketed as a [[nucleic acid]] analyzer.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Columns throughout the 1970s were unreliable, pump flow rates were inconsistent, and many biologically active compounds escaped detection by UV and [[fluorescence]] detectors. Focus on purification methods in the '70s morphed into faster analyses in the 1980s, when computerized controls were integrated into HPLC equipment. Higher degrees of computerization then led to emphasis on more precise, faster, automated equipment in the 1990s. Atypical of many technologies of the '60s and '70s, the emphasis in improvements was not on “bigger and better,” but on “smaller and better”. At the same time the HPLC user-interface was improving, it was critical to be able to isolate hundreds of [[peptides]] or [[biomarkers]] from ever decreasing sample sizes.

Laboratory analytical instrumentation has only been recognized as a separate and distinct industry by [[NAICS]] and [[United Kingdom Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities|SIC]] since 1987.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} This [[market segmentation]] includes not only gas and liquid chromatography, but also [[mass spectrometry]] and spectrophotometric instruments. Since first recognized as a separate market, sales of analytical laboratory equipment increased from about $3.5 billion in 1987 to more than $26 billion in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;“Laboratory Analytical Instruments: Industry Snapshot.” www.galenet.galegroup.com, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Revenues in the world liquid chromatography market, specifically, are expected to grow from $3.4 billion in 2007 to $4.7 billion in 2013, with a slight decrease in spending expected in 2008 and 2009 from the worldwide economic slump and decreased or stagnant spending. The pharmaceutical industry alone accounts for 35% of all the HPLC instruments in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laboratoryequipmentworld.com/hpcl-market.html |title=HPLC market worldwide is worth more than $2.5 billion. |publisher=www.laboratoryequipmentworld.com |accessdate=2009-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204080923/http://www.laboratoryequipmentworld.com/hpcl-market.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main source of growth in LC stems from [[biosciences]] and [[pharmaceutical]] companies.

== Technology applications ==

In its earliest form, liquid chromatography was used to separate the pigments of chlorophyll by a Russian botanist. Decades later, other chemists used the procedure for the study of carotins. Liquid chromatography was then used for the isolation of small molecules and organic compounds like [[amino acids]], and most recently has been used in [[peptide]] and [[DNA]] research. Monolith columns have been instrumental in advancing the field of biomolecular research.

In recent trade shows and international meetings for HPLC, interest in column monoliths and biomolecular applications has grown steadily, and this correlation is no coincidence. Monoliths have been shown to possess great potential in the “omics” fields- [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[metabolomics]], and [[pharmacogenomics]], among others. The reductionist approach to understanding the chemical pathways of the body and reactions to different stimuli, like drugs, are essential to new waves of [[healthcare]] like [[personalized medicine]].

Pharmacogenomics studies how responses to pharmaceutical products differ in efficacy and [[toxicity]] based on variations in the patient’s genome; it is a correlation of drug response to gene expression in a patient. [[Jeremy K. Nicholson]] of the [[Imperial College]], [[London]], used a postgenomic viewpoint to understand adverse drug reactions and the molecular basis of human disesase.&lt;ref name="LCGC25-10"&gt;[http://chromatographyonline.findanalytichem.com/lcgc/Column%3A+Column+Watch/Technology-and-Application-Highlights-of-HPLC-2007/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/460299 “Technology and application highlights of HPLC 2007.”] LCGC North America, 25(10), 1000–1012.&lt;/ref&gt; His group studied gut [[microbial]] metabolic profiles and were able to see distinct differences in reactions to drug toxicity and metabolism even among various geographical distributions of the same race. Affinity monolith chromatography provides another approach to drug response measurements. David Hage at the [[University of Nebraska]] binds [[ligands]] to monolithic supports and measures the [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] phenomena of binding interactions between drugs and [[Blood serum|serum]] proteins.&lt;ref name="C&amp;ENews2006" /&gt; A monolith-based approach at the [[University of Bologna]], [[Italy]], is currently in use for high-speed screening of drug candidates in the treatment of [[Alzheimer's]].&lt;ref name="GE&amp;BNews2006" /&gt; In 2003, Regnier and Liu of [[Purdue University]] described a multi-dimensional LC procedure for identifying [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) in [[proteins]].&lt;ref name="LCGC21-9"&gt;[http://chromatographyonline.findanalytichem.com/lcgc/data/articlestandard//lcgc/372003/68927/article.pdf “Highlights of HPLC 2003.”] LCGC North America, 21(9), 872-887.&lt;/ref&gt; SNPs are alterations in the [[genetic code]] that can sometimes cause changes in [[protein conformation]], as is the case with [[sickle cell anemia]]. Monoliths are particularly useful in these kinds of separations because of their superior [[mass transport]] capabilities, low backpressures coupled with faster flow rates, and relative ease of modification of the support surface.

Bioseparations on a production scale are enhanced by monolith column technologies as well. The fast separations and high resolving power of monoliths for large molecules means that real-time analysis on production fermentors is possible. [[Industrial fermentation|Fermentation]] is well known for its use in making [[alcoholic beverages]], but is also an essential step in the production of [[vaccines]] for [[rabies]] and other [[viruses]]. Real-time, on-line analysis is critical for monitoring of production conditions, and adjustments can be made if necessary. Boehringer Ingelheim Austria has validated a method with cGMP (commercial good manufacturing practices) for production of pharmaceutical-grade DNA [[plasmids]]. They are able to process 200L of fermentation [[broth]] on an 800mL monolith.&lt;ref name="GE&amp;BNews2006" /&gt; At [[BIA Separations]], processing time of the [[tomato mosaic virus]] decreased considerably from the standard five days of manually intensive work to equivalent purity and better recovery in only two hours with a monolith column.&lt;ref name="GE&amp;BNews2006" /&gt; Other viruses have been purified on monoliths as well.

Another area of interest for HPLC is [[forensics]]. [[GC-MS]] (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy) is generally considered the gold standard for forensic analysis. It is used in conjunction with online databases for rapid analysis of compounds in tests for [[blood alcohol]], cause of death, street drugs, and food analysis, especially in poisoning cases.&lt;ref name="LCGC21-9" /&gt; Analysis of [[buprenorphine]], a [[heroin]] substitute, demonstrated the potential utility of multidimensional LC as a low-level detection method. HPLC methods can measure this compound at 40 [[Nanogram|ng]]/[[Millilitre|mL]], compared to GC-MS at 0.5&amp;nbsp;ng/mL, but LC-MS-MS can detect buprenorphine at levels as low as 0.02&amp;nbsp;ng/mL. The sensitivity of multidimensional LC is therefore 2000 times greater than that of conventional HPLC.

== Industry applications ==

The liquid chromatography marketplace is incredibly diverse. Five to ten firms are consistently market leaders, yet nearly half of the market is made up of small, fragmented companies. This section of the report will focus on the roles that a few companies have had in bringing monolith column technologies to the commercial market.

In 1998, start-up biotechnology company [[BIA Separations]] of [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], came into being. The technology was originally developed by Tatiana Tennikova and Frantisek Svec during a collaboration between their respective institutes. The patent for these columns was acquired by BIA Separations and Ales Podgornik and Milos Barut developed the first commercially available monolith column in the form of a short disc encapsulated in a plastic housing. Trademarked CIM, BIA Separations has since introduced full lines of reversed-phase, normal-phase, ion-exchange, and affinity polymeric monoliths. Ales Podgornik and Janez Jancar then went on to develop large scale tube monolithic columns for industrial use. The largest column currently available is 8L. In May 2008, LC instrumentation powerhouse [[Agilent]] technologies agreed to market BIA Separations’ analytical columns based on monolith technology. Agilent’s commercialized the columns with strong and weak [[ion exchange]] phases and Protein A in September 2008 when they unveiled their new Bio-Monolith product line at the BioProcess International conference.

While BIA Separations was the first to commercially market polymeric monoliths, Merck KGaA was the first company to market silica monoliths. In 1996, Tanaka and coworkers at the Kyoto Institute of Technology published extensive work on silica monolith technologies. Merck was later issued a license from Kyoto Institute of Technology to develop and produce the silica monoliths. Promptly thereafter, in 2001, Merck introduced its Chromolith line of monolithic HPLC columns at analytical instrumentation trade show PittCon. Initially, says Karin Cabrera, senior scientist at Merck, the high flow rate was the selling point for the Chromolith line. Based on customer feedback, though, Merck soon learned that the columns were more stable and longer-lived than particle-packed columns.&lt;ref name="C&amp;ENews2006" /&gt; The columns were the recipients of various new product awards. Difficulties in production of the silica monoliths and tight [[patent]] protection have precluded attempts by other companies at developing a similar product. It has been noted that there are more patents concerning how to encapsulate the silica rod than there are on the manufacture of the silica itself.

Historically, Merck has been known for its superior chemical products, and, in liquid chromatography, for the purity and reliability of its particulate silica. Merck is not known for its LC columns. Five years after the introduction of its Chromolith line, Merck made a very strategic marketing decision. They granted a worldwide sublicense of the technology to a small (less than $100M in sales), innovative company well known for its cutting-edge column technology: Phenomenex. This was a superior strategic move for two reasons. As mentioned above, Merck is not well known for its column manufacturing. Furthermore, having more than one silica monolith manufacturer serves to better validate the technology. Having sublicensed the technology from Merck, Phenomenex introduced its Onyx product line in January 2005.

On the other side of monolith technologies are the polymerics. Unlike the inorganic silica columns, the polymer monoliths are made of an organic polymer base. [[Dionex]], traditionally known for its ion chromatography capabilities, has led this side of the field. In the 1990s, Dionex first acquired a license for the polymeric monolith technology developed by leading monolithic chromatography researcher Frantisec Svec while he was at [[Cornell University]]. In 2000, they acquired LC Packings, whose competencies were in LC column packings. LC Packings/Dionex revealed their first monolithic capillary column at the Montreux LC-MS Conference. Earlier that year, another company, Isco, introduced a polystyrene divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) monolith column under the brand SWIFT. In January 2005, Dionex was sold the rights to Teledyne Isco’s SWIFT media products, intellectual property, technology, and related assets. Though the core competencies of Dionex have traditionally been in ion chromatography, through strategic acquisitions and technology transfers, it has quickly established itself as the primary producer of polymeric monoliths.

== Economic impact ==

Though the many advances of HPLC and monoliths are highly visible within the confines of the analytical and pharmaceutical industries, it is unlikely that general society is aware of these developments. Currently, consumers may witness technology developments in the analytical sciences industry in the form of a broader array of available [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] products of higher purity, advanced [[forensic testing]] in criminal trials, better [[environmental monitoring]], and faster returns on [[medical tests]]. In the future, presumably, this may not be the case. As medicine becomes more individualized over time, consumer awareness that something is improving their quality of care seems more likely. The further thought that monoliths or HPLC are involved is unlikely to concern the general public, however.

There are two main [[cost driver]]s behind technological change in this industry. Though many different analytical areas use LC, including food and beverage industries, forensics labs, and clinical testing facilities, the largest impetus toward technology developments comes from the research and development and production arms of the pharmaceutical industry. The areas in which high-throughput monolithic column technologies are likely to have the largest economic impact are R&amp;D and downstream processing.

From the [[Research and Development]] field comes the desire for more resolved, faster separations from smaller sample quantities. The only phase of drug development under direct control of a pharmaceutical company is the R&amp;D stage. The goal of [[Analytical chemistry|analytical]] work is to obtain as much information as possible from the sample. At this stage, high-throughput and analysis of tiny sample quantities are critical. Pharmaceutical companies are looking for tools that will better enable them to measure and predict the efficacy of candidate drugs in shorter times and with less expensive clinical trials.&lt;ref name="LCGC25-10" /&gt; To this end, nano-scale separations, highly automated HPLC equipment, and multi-dimensional chromatography have become influential.

The prevailing method to increase the sensitivity of analytical methods has been multi-dimensional chromatography. This practice uses other analysis techniques in conjunction with liquid chromatography. For example, [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) has very much gained in popularity as an on-line analytical technique following HPLC. It is limited, however, in that MS, like nuclear [[magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR) or [[electrospray ionization]] techniques (ESI), is only feasible when using very small quantities of solute and solvent; LC-MS is used with nano or capillary scale techniques, but cannot be used in prep-scale. Another tactic for increasing selectivity in multi-dimensional chromatography is to use two columns with different selectivity orthogonally; ie… linking an ion exchange column to a C18 endcapped column. In 2007, Karger reported that, through multi-dimensional chromatography and other techniques, starting with only about 12,000 cells containing 1-4μg of protein, he was able to identify 1867 unique proteins. Of those, Karger can isolate 4 that may be of interest as cervical cancer markers.&lt;ref name="LCGC25-10" /&gt; Today, liquid chromatographers using multi-dimensional LC can isolate compounds at the femtomole (10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; mole) and attomole (10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; mole) levels.

After a drug has been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the emphasis at a pharmaceutical company is on getting a product to market. This is where prep or process scale chromatography has a role. In contrast to analytical analysis, preparatory scale chromatography focuses on isolation and purity of compounds. There is a trade-off between the degree of purity of compound and the amount of time required to achieve that purity. Unfortunately, many of the preparatory or process scale solutions used by pharmaceutical companies are proprietary, due to difficulties in patenting a process. Hence, there is not a great deal of literature available. However, some attempts to address the problems of prep scale chromatography include monoliths and [[simulated moving bed]]s.

A comparison of [[immunoglobulin]] protein capture on a conventional column and a monolithic column yields some economically interesting results.&lt;ref name="Gagnon2008" /&gt; If processing times are equivalent, process volumes of [[IgG]], an [[antibody]], are 3,120L for conventional columns versus 5,538L for monolithic columns. This represents a 78% increase in process volume efficiency, while at the same time only a tenth of the media waste volume is generated. Not only is the monolith column more economically prudent when considering the value of product processing times, but, at the same time, less media is used, representing a significant reduction in variable costs.

'''Muhammed Ahmed Faris''' ({{lang-ar|محمد أحمد فارس}} ''Muḥammad ʾAḥmad Fāris''; born 26 May 1951) is a [[Syria]]n military aviator. He was the first Syrian and the second [[Arab]] in space.

Born in [[Aleppo]], Syria, he was a pilot in the [[Syrian Air Force]] with the rank of a colonel. He specialized in navigation when he was selected to participate in the [[Intercosmos]] spaceflight program on 30 September 1985.

He flew as [[Astronaut ranks and positions#Ranks 2|Research Cosmonaut]] in the [[Interkosmos]] program on [[Soyuz TM-3]] to the [[Mir]] space station in July 1987, spending 7 days 23 hours and 5 minutes in space. He returned to Earth aboard [[Soyuz TM-2]].

Faris was awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] on 30 July 1987. He was also awarded the [[Order of Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2298 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

After his spaceflight, he returned to the Syrian Air Force and lived in Aleppo. He is married and has three children.

On 4 August 2012, during the [[Syrian civil war]], he [[List of Syrian defectors|defected]] from [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region#Al-Assad Era: 1970–present|Assad's government]] and joined the armed opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabnews.com/syria’s-first-astronaut-defects-turkey-report-0 |title=Syria’s first astronaut defects to Turkey: report |publisher=ArabNews |accessdate=5 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805154819/http://arabnews.com/syria%E2%80%99s-first-astronaut-defects-turkey-report-0 |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|jAEKtby9Ymk|رائد الفضاء اللواء محمد فارس يعلن انشقاقه}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2012, made an exclusive interview with [[Al Aan TV]] and covered many topics regarding the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Al Aan |first=Akhbar |title=لقاء خاص مع رائد الفضاء السوري المنشق محمد فارس |url=http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/Syria-Revolution-violence-bombing-army-free-mass-Bashar-Assad-Damascus-Aleppo-Idlib-weapon-aircraft-opposition-Mohammed-Fares-astronaut-yaman-shawaf-akhbar-alaan/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105233444/http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/Syria-Revolution-violence-bombing-army-free-mass-Bashar-Assad-Damascus-Aleppo-Idlib-weapon-aircraft-opposition-Mohammed-Fares-astronaut-yaman-shawaf-akhbar-alaan/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 November 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2012 |newspaper=Akhbar Al Aan |date=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also part of the [[National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change|Syrian National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change]], an anti-Assad grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/01/from-astronaut-to-refugee-how-the-syrian-spaceman-fell-to-earth|title=From astronaut to refugee: how the Syrian spaceman fell to Earth|first=Rosie|last=Garthwaite|date=1 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2016 interview as a [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee]] in Turkey, Faris stated regarding the ongoing Syrian Civil War "I tell Europe if you don't want refugees, then you should help us get rid of this regime," adding "I am very sorry about the Russian interference, which has stood on the side of dictator Bashar Assad, and has begun to kill the Syrian people with their planes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3484013/AP-Interview-Syrian-cosmonaut-Europe-help-oust-Assad.html|title=AP Interview: Syrian cosmonaut: Europe must help oust Assad|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Faris was appointed Defense Minister of the [[Syrian Interim Government]], a self-appointed opposition grouping.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.zamanalwsl.net/news/article/29686&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mechanical engineering]], a '''parallel force system''' is a situation in which two [[force]]s of equal magnitude act in the same direction [[Coplanarity|within the same plane]], with the counter force in the middle.  An example of this is a [[see saw]].  The children are applying the two forces at the ends, and the [[Lever|fulcrum]] in the middle gives the counter force to maintain the see saw in neutral position.  Another example are the major vertical forces on an [[airplane]] in flight (see image at right).

Subsequently, in 1991, their work was included as a chapter in “The Handbook of Optical Constants”.&lt;ref name=OpticalHandbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Forouhi|first=A.R.|title=Handbook of Optical Constants II|date=1991|publisher=Academic Press|page=Chapter 7|author2=Bloomer, I. |editor=Palik, E.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations describe how photons of varying energies interact with thin films. When used with a spectroscopic [[reflectometry]] tool, the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations specify ''n'' and ''k'' for amorphous and crystalline materials as a function of photon energy ''E''. Values of ''n'' and ''k'' as a function of photon energy, ''E'', are referred to as the spectra of ''n'' and ''k'', which can also be expressed as functions of wavelength of light, λ, since ''E = hc/λ''. The symbol ''h'' represents [[Planck’s constant]] and ''c'', the speed of light in vacuum. Together, ''n'' and ''k'' are often referred to as the “optical constants” of a material (though they are not constants since their values depend on photon energy).

The derivation of the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations is based on obtaining an expression for ''k'' as a function of photon energy, symbolically written as ''k''(E), starting from first principles quantum mechanics and solid state physics. An expression for ''n'' as a function of photon energy, symbolically written as ''n''(E), is then determined from the expression for ''k''(E) in accordance to the [[Kramers–Kronig relations]]&lt;ref name=Roman&gt;{{cite book|last=Roman|first=P.|title=Advanced Quantum Theory|date=1965|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that ''n''(E) is the [[Hilbert Transform]] of ''k''(E).

The Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations for ''n''(E) and ''k''(E) of amorphous materials are given as:

&lt;math&gt; k(E) = \frac{A(E-E_g)^2}{E^2-BE+C} \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; n(E) = n(\infty)+\frac{(B_0 E + C_0 )}{E^2-BE+C} \ &lt;/math&gt;

The five parameters A, B, C, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''n''(∞) each have physical significance.&lt;ref name=FB1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=OpticalHandbook /&gt; E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the optical energy band gap of the material. A, B, and C depend on the band structure of the material. They are positive constants such that 4C-B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0. Finally, n(∞), a constant greater than unity, represents the value of ''n'' at ''E'' = ∞. The parameters B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the equation for ''n''(E) are not independent parameters, but depend on A, B, C, and E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. They are given by:

&lt;math&gt; B_0 = \frac{A}{Q} \ \left (\frac{-B^2}{2} \ + E_gB - {E_g}^2 + C \right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C_0 = \frac{A}{Q} \ \left [({E_g}^2 + C) \frac{B}{2} \ - 2E_g C \right] &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt; Q = \frac{1}{2} \ (4C - B^2 )^{\frac{1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for amorphous materials, a total of five parameters are sufficient to fully describe the dependence of both ''n'' and ''k'' on photon energy, E.

For crystalline materials which have multiple peaks in their ''n'' and ''k'' spectra, the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations can be extended as follows:

&lt;math&gt; k(E) = \sum_{i=1}^q \left [\frac{A_i(E - E_{g_i})^2}{E^2-B_iE+C_i} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; n(E) = n(\infty)+\sum_{i=1}^q \left [\frac{B_{0_i}E+C_{0_i}}{E^2-B_iE+C_i} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

The number of terms in each sum, q, is equal to the number of peaks in the ''n'' and ''k'' spectra of the material. Every term in the sum has its own values of the parameters A, B, C, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as its own values of B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Analogous to the amorphous case, the terms all have physical significance.&lt;ref name=FB1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=OpticalHandbook /&gt;

== Characterizing thin films ==
The refractive index (''n'') and extinction coefficient (''k'') are related to the interaction between a material and incident light, and are associated with refraction and absorption (respectively). They can be considered as the “fingerprint of the material". Thin film material coatings on various substrates provide important functionalities for the [[Microfabrication|microfabrication industry]], and the ''n'', ''k'', as well as the thickness, ''t'', of these thin film constituents must be measured and controlled to allow for repeatable [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacturing]].

In the following discussions, all variables of photon energy, ''E'', will be described in terms of wavelength of light, λ, since experimentally variables involving thin films are typically measured over a spectrum of wavelengths. The ''n'' and ''k'' spectra of a thin film cannot be measured directly, but must be determined indirectly from measurable quantities that depend on them. Spectroscopic reflectance, ''R(λ''), is one such measurable quantity. Another, is spectroscopic transmittance, ''T(λ)'', applicable when the substrate is transparent. Spectroscopic reflectance of a thin film on a substrate represents the ratio of the intensity of light reflected from the sample to the intensity of incident light, measured over a range of wavelengths, whereas spectroscopic transmittance, ''T(λ)'', represents the ratio of the intensity of light transmitted through the sample to the intensity of incident light, measured over a range of wavelengths; typically, there will also be a reflected signal, ''R(λ)'', accompanying ''T(λ)''.

The measurable quantities, ''R(λ)'' and ''T(λ)'' depend not only on ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' of the film, but also on film thickness, ''t'', and ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' of the substrate. For a silicon substrate, the ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' values are known and are taken as a given input. The challenge of characterizing thin films involves extracting ''t'', ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' of the film from the measurement of ''R(λ)'' and/or ''T(λ)''. This can be achieved by combining the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations for ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' with the [[Fresnel equations]] for the reflection and transmission of light at an interface&lt;ref name=Heavens2&gt;{{cite book|last=Heavens|first=O.S.|title=Optical Properties of Thin Solid Films|date=1965|publisher=Dover|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain theoretical, physically valid, expressions for reflectance and transmittance. In so doing, the challenge is reduced to extracting the five parameters A, B, C, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''n(∞)'' that constitute ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'', along with film thickness, ''t'', by utilizing a nonlinear least squares regression analysis&lt;ref name=Levenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levenberg|first=K.|title=A Method for the Solution of Certain Non-Linear Problems in Least Squares|journal=The Quarterly of Applied Mathematics|date=1944|volume=2|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marquardt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marquardt|first=D.W.|title=An Algorithm for Least-Squares Estimation of Nonlinear Parameters|journal=Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|date=1963|volume=11|series=2|pages=431–441|doi=10.1137/0111030}}&lt;/ref&gt; fitting procedure. The fitting procedure entails an iterative improvement of the values of A, B, C, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n(∞)'', ''t'', in order to reduce the sum of the squares of the errors between the theoretical ''R(λ)'' or theoretical ''T(λ)'' and the measured spectrum of ''R(λ)'' or ''T(λ)''.
 
Besides spectroscopic reflectance and transmittance, spectroscopic [[ellipsometry]] can also be used in an analogous way to characterize thin films and determine ''t'', ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)''.

== Measurement examples ==
The following examples show the versatility of using the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations to characterize thin films utilizing a tool based on near-normal incident spectroscopic reflectance. Near-normal spectroscopic transmittance is also utilized when the substrate is transparent. The ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra of each film are obtained along with film thickness, over a wide range of wavelengths from deep ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths (190–1000&amp;nbsp;nm).

In the following examples, the notation for theoretical and measured reflectance in the spectral plots is expressed as “R-theor” and “R-meas”, respectively.

Below are schematics depicting the thin film measurement process:

[[File:Thin Film Analysis Process.gif|center|800px|Thin film characterization involves determining the film’s thickness (''t'') plus its refractive index (''n'') and extinction coefficient (''k'') over as wide a wavelength range as possible, preferably covering ultra-violet through near infra-red wavelengths (190–1000 nm). By measuring near-normal incident reflectance (''R'') of the film (from 190–1000 nm), and analyzing ''R'' utilizing the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations, the film can be completely characterized.]]

The Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations in combination with [[Rigorous coupled-wave analysis|Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA)]] have also been used to obtain detailed profile information (depth, CD, sidewall angle) of trench structures. In order to extract structure information, polarized broadband reflectance data, [[Polarization (waves)|''Rs'' and ''Rp'']], must be collected over a large wavelength range from a periodic structure (grating), and then analyzed with a model that incorporates Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations and RCWA. Inputs into the model include grating pitch and ''n'' and ''k'' spectra of all materials within the structure, while outputs can include Depth, CDs at multiple locations, and even sidewall angle. The ''n'' and ''k'' spectra of such materials can be obtained in accordance with the methodology described in this section for thin film measurements.

Below are schematics depicting the measurement process for trench structures. Examples of trench measurements then follow.

[[File:OCD Analysis Flow New.PNG|center|800px|The key properties of trench structures are trench depth, critical dimensions, plus profile (or sidewall angle). The term "critical dimension" is usually abbreviated as "CD". CDs signify widths of the trench at various levels inside the trench – top, middle, and bottom of trench.

These key properties can be determined by measuring polarized reflectance ''Rs'' and ''Rp'' over as wide a wavelength range as possible, preferably covering ultra-violet through near infra-red wavelengths (190–1000&amp;nbsp;nm).

Analysis of the measured ''Rs'' and ''Rp'', based on the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations (to characterize any films within the trench structure), combined with Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) (to determine the geometry), will provide trench depth, CDs and profiles.

As a material transitions from the amorphous state to the fully crystalline state, the broad maximum sharpens up and other sharp peaks start to appear in the ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra. This is demonstrated for the case of amorphous silicon progressing to poly-silicon and further progressing to crystalline silicon.

Example 1 shows one broad maximum in the ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra of the a-Si film, as is expected for amorphous materials. As a material transitions toward crystallinity, the broad maximum gives way to several sharper peaks in its ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra, as demonstrated in the graphics.

When the measurement involves two or more films in a stack of films, the theoretical expression for reflectance must be expanded to include the ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra, plus thickness, ''t'', of each film. However, the regression may not converge to unique values of the parameters, due to the non-linear nature of the expression for reflectance. So it is helpful to eliminate some of the unknowns . For example, the ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra of one or more of the films may be known from the literature or previous measurements, and held fixed (not allowed to vary) during the regression. To obtain the results shown in Example 1, the ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra of the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer was fixed, and the other parameters, ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' of a-Si, plus thicknesses of both a-Si and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were allowed to vary.

Polymers such as [[photoresist]] consist of long chains of molecules which do not form a crystallographic structure in the classic sense. However, their ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra exhibit several sharp peaks rather than a broad maximum expected for non-crystalline materials. Thus, the measurement results for a polymer are based on the Forouhi–Bloomer formulation for crystalline materials. Most of the structure in the ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra occurs in the deep UV wavelength range and thus to properly characterize a film of this nature, it is necessary that the measured reflectance data in the deep UV range is accurate.

The figure shows a measurement example of a photoresist (polymer) material used for 248&amp;nbsp;nm micro-lithography. Six terms were used in the Forouhi–Bloomer equations for crystalline materials to fit the data and achieve the results.

[[Indium tin oxide]] (ITO) is a conducting material with the unusual property that it is transparent, so it is widely used in the flat panel display industry. Reflectance and transmittance measurements of the uncoated glass substrate were needed in order to determine the previously unknown ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra of the glass. The reflectance and transmittance of ITO deposited on the same glass substrate were then measured simultaneously, and analyzed using the Forouhi–Bloomer equations.

As expected, the ''k(λ)'' spectrum of ITO is zero in the visible wavelength range, since ITO is transparent. The behavior of the ''k(λ)'' spectrum of ITO in the near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) wavelength ranges resembles that of a metal: non-zero in the NIR range of 750–1000&amp;nbsp;nm (difficult to discern in the graphics since its values are very small) and reaching a maximum value in the IR range (λ&gt;1000&amp;nbsp;nm). The average ''k'' value of the ITO film in the NIR and IR range is 0.05.

When dealing with complex films, in some instances the parameters cannot be resolved uniquely. To constrain the solution to a set of unique values, a technique involving multi-spectral analysis can be used. In the simplest case, this entails depositing the film on two different substrates and then simultaneously analyzing the results using the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations.

For example, the single measurement of reflectance in 190–1000&amp;nbsp;nm range of Ge&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;/Si does not provide unique ''n(λ)'' and ''k(λ)'' spectra of the film. However, this problem can be solved by depositing the same Ge&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; film on another substrate, in this case oxidized silicon, and then simultaneously analyzing the measured reflectance data to determine:

:*Thickness of the Ge&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;/Si film on the silicon substrate as 34.5nm,
:*Thickness of the Ge&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;/Si film on the oxidized silicon substrate as 33.6nm,
:*Thickness of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (with ''n'' and ''k'' spectra of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; held fixed), and
:*''n'' and ''k'' spectra, in 190–1000 nm range, of Ge&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;/Si.

In this example, the reflectance spectrum of the poly-silicon was measured on a blanket area containing the poly-silicon, from which its ''n'' and ''k'' spectra were determined in accordance with the methodology described in this article that utilizes the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations. Fixed tables of ''n'' and ''k'' values were used for the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; films.

Combining the ''n'' and ''k'' spectra of the films with [[Rigorous coupled-wave analysis|Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA)]] the following critical parameters were determined (with measured results as well):

'''Reinhard Baumeister''' (19 March 1833 in [[Hamburg]] &amp;ndash; 11 February 1917 in [[Karlsruhe]]) was a German engineer and [[urban planner]], the author of one of the earliest texts on [[urban planning]] ''Stadterweiterungen in technischer, baupolizeilicher und Wirtschaftlicher Beziehung '' (Town extensions: their links with technical and economic concerns and with building regulations) published in 1876. It was used as a textbook at the first urban planning course in Germany, at the college of technology in [[Aachen]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, Stephen V.: ''Planning the Twentieth-Century City: The Advanced Capitalist World'', Wiley, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; An early translation of one of his writings into English was ''The Cleaning and Sewerage of Cities'' published in New York in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/150books/2011/02/06/1891/ MIT Library: "150 Years in the Stacks"], retrieved 11 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Baumeister was a professor of civil engineering with experience in railway construction when he entered the field of planning by winning the 1872 competition for the urban extension of [[Mannheim]].&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;

'''Remote laboratory''' (also known as '''online laboratory''' or '''remote workbench''') is the use of [[telecommunications]] to remotely conduct real (as opposed to [[Virtuality|virtual]]) experiments, at the physical [[Location (geography)|location]] of the operating technology, whilst the [[scientist]] is utilizing [[technology]] from a separate geographical location. Remote laboratory comprehends one or more [[remote experiment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Callaghan, Harkin, Maguire (2007). "Paradigms in Remote Experimentation", ''International Journal of Online Engineering (iJOE)'', Vol 3, No 4 (2007)[http://online-journals.org/i-joe/article/view/468]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The benefits of remote laboratories are predominantly in [[engineering education]]:&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, Sousa, Nafalski, Machotka, Nedic (2010). "Collaborative learning based on a
micro-webserver remote test controller", ''Bridgeport'', University of South Australia, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Relax time constraints''', adapting to pace of each student, if there was insufficient time in lab
* '''Relax geographical constraints''', disregarding the physical locality of the student
* '''Economies of scale''', as sharing labs allows sharing of large fixed costs of traditional buildings
* '''Improve quality of experiment''', as it can be repeated to clarify doubtful measurements in lab
* '''Improve effectiveness''', as student may improve effectiveness of time spent at lab by rehearsal
* '''Improved safety and security''', as no risk of catastrophic failure

Researchers from the [[Labshare]] describe the advantages as being:
* Increasing accessibility to laboratories by a factor of 4 within 3 years, since current lab utilization is less than 10%
* Decrease fixed and variable expenditure by 50%, since faculty budget spends between 15-40% on lab infrastructure and personnel, around $400m per year
* Improve learning objectives and outcomes to support better learning
* Enhance sharing of knowledge, expertise and experience
* Reduce start-up costs of laboratories

This allows for [[economies of scale]] production.

Another benefit is that this technology can be integrated into [[Moodle]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_ejsapp EJSApp Moodle Plugin]&lt;/ref&gt; which is probably the most used [[Learning Management System]] around the world.

==Disadvantages==
The disadvantages differ depending on the type of remote laboratory and the topic area.
The general disadvantages compared to a proximal (hands on) laboratory are:

* Lack of hands on trouble shooting and debugging experience.
* Lack of equipment setup experience.

==Future direction==
Current system capabilities include:
* Online session booking, utilizing a [[database]] and online interface
* Authentication to satisfy [[security]] requirements
* Desktop, generalized screen for [[online chat|chat]], [[emoticon]], [[time]] limit, [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] limit
* Live lab [[camera]] which allows panning, tilting, zooming, showing, hiding, refresh
* Circuit builder (this is just simulative)
* Function generator (this is just simulative)
* Digital multimeter (this is just simulative)
* Oscilloscope (this is just simulative)

[[File:WaterDepthSalinity.png|thumb|Ocean salinity at different latitudes in the Atlantic and Pacific]]

'''Seawater''', or '''salt water''', is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a [[salinity]] of about 3.5% (35&amp;nbsp;g/L, 599 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately {{convert|35|g|oz}} of [[sea salt|dissolved salts]] (predominantly [[sodium]] ({{chem|Na||+}}) and [[chloride]] ({{chem|Cl||-}}) [[ions]]). Average density at the surface is 1.025&amp;nbsp;kg/L. Seawater is [[density|denser]] than both [[fresh water]] and pure water (density 1.0&amp;nbsp;kg/L at {{convert|4|C|F}}) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The [[Melting point|freezing point]] of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about {{convert|-2|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/Focus/ocean/water/temp3.htm |title=U.S. Office of Naval Research Ocean, Water: Temperature |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212151229/http://www.onr.navy.mil/Focus/ocean/water/temp3.htm |archivedate=12 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an [[Antarctic]] [[glacier]], and measured {{convert|-2.6|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= Sylte, Gudrun Urd |title= Den aller kaldaste havstraumen |url= http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2010/mai/250690 |language= Norwegian |date= 24 May 2010 |work= forskning.no |accessdate= 24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seawater [[pH]] is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4.&lt;ref name="Chester Marine Geochem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chester, Jickells|first=Roy, Tim|title=Marine Geochemistry|date=2012|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-118-34907-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units.&lt;ref&gt;Stumm, W, Morgan, J. J. (1981) ''Aquatic Chemistry, An Introduction Emphasizing Chemical Equilibria in Natural Waters''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 414–416. {{ISBN|0471048313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 31 g/kg and 38 g/kg, that is 3.1-3.8%, seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world. Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths, near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation (e.g. [[Monsoon]]), seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the [[Red Sea]], where high rates of [[evaporation]], low [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and low river run-off, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water can be considerably greater still - about ten times higher in the case of the [[Dead Sea]]. Historically, several salinity scales were used to approximate the absolute salinity of seawater. A popular scale was the "Practical Salinity Scale" where salinity was measured in "practical salinity units (psu)". The current standard for salinity is the "Reference Salinity" scale &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millero|first1=Frank J.|last2=Feistel|first2=Rainer|last3=Wright|first3=Daniel G.|last4=McDougall|first4=Trevor J.|title=The composition of Standard Seawater and the definition of the Reference-Composition Salinity Scale|journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers|date=January 2008|volume=55|issue=1|pages=50–72|doi=10.1016/j.dsr.2007.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the salinity expressed in units of "g/kg".

===Thermophysical properties of Seawater===
The [[density]] of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, depending on the temperature and salinity. At a temperature of 25&amp;nbsp;°C, salinity of 35 g/kg and 1 atm pressure, the density of seawater is 1023.6 &amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nayar&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nayar|first1=Kishor G.|last2=Sharqawy|first2=Mostafa H.|last3=Banchik|first3=Leonardo D.|last4=Lienhard V|first4=John H.|title=Thermophysical properties of seawater: A review and new correlations that include pressure dependence|journal=Desalination|date=July 2016|volume=390|pages=1–24|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2016.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web |title=Thermophysical properties of seawater|url=http://web.mit.edu/seawater|publisher=Department of Mechanical Engineering, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=February 24, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep in the ocean, under high pressure, seawater can reach a density of 1050&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or higher. The density of seawater also changes with salinity. Brines generated by seawater desalination plants can have salinities up to 120 g/kg. The density of typical seawater brine of 120 g/kg salinity at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and atmospheric pressure is 1088&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nayar/&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT/&gt; Seawater [[pH]] is limited to the range 7.5 to 8.4. The [[speed of sound]] in seawater is about 1,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (whereas speed of sound is usually around 330&amp;nbsp;m/s in air at roughly 1000hPa pressure, 1 atmosphere), and varies with water temperature, salinity, and pressure. The [[thermal conductivity]] of seawater is 0.6&amp;nbsp;W/mK at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and a salinity of 35&amp;nbsp;g/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/Thermophysical_properties_of_seawater-DWT-16-354-2010.pdf |title=Desalination and Water Treatment |publisher=Department of Mechanical Engineering, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |date = April 2010|accessdate=17 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The thermal conductivity decreases with increasing salinity and increases with increasing temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twt.mpei.ac.ru/tthb/2/Tab-5-5-13-2-Ther-Cond-Seawater.html |title=Thermal conductivity of seawater and its concentrates |accessdate=17 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seawater contains more dissolved [[ion]]s than all types of freshwater.&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Mi-Oc/Ocean-Chemical-Processes.html |last=Gale |first=Thomson |title=Ocean Chemical Processes |accessdate=2 December 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ratios of solutes differ dramatically. For instance, although seawater contains about 2.8 times more [[bicarbonate]] than river water, the [[percentage]] of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of ''all'' dissolved [[ion]]s is far lower than in river water. Bicarbonate ions constitute 48% of river water solutes but only 0.14% for seawater.&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinet&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences like these are due to the varying [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]]s of seawater solutes; [[sodium]] and [[chlorine|chloride]] have very long residence times, while [[calcium]] (vital for [[carbonate]] formation) tends to precipitate much more quickly.&lt;ref name=Pinet/&gt; The most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium, chloride, [[magnesium]], [[sulfate]] and calcium.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.

Small amounts of other substances are found, including [[amino acids]] at concentrations of up to 2 micrograms of nitrogen atoms per liter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02742615|url=http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/JO/pdf/5404/54040313.pdf| title = Dissolved free amino acids in coastal seawater using a modified fluorometric method| journal = Journal of Oceanography| volume = 54| issue = 4| pages = 313–321| year = 1998| last1 = Tada | first1 = K. | last2 = Tada | first2 = M. | last3 = Maita | first3 = Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are thought to have played a key role in the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]].

==Microbial components==
Research in 1957 by the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] sampled water in both [[pelagic]] and [[neritic]] locations in the Pacific Ocean. Direct microscopic counts and cultures were used, the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures. These differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates, selective effects of the culture media, and the presence of inactive cells. A marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the [[thermocline]], but not by direct microscopic observation. Large numbers of [[spirilli]]-like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation. The disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_4/issue_2/0128.pdf | title= Bacterial Populations in Sea Water as Determined by Different Methods of Enumeration | first1= Holger W. | last1= Jannasch | first2= Galen E. | last2= Jones | volume= 4 | number= 2 | journal= Limnology and Oceanography | publisher= Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography | pages= 128–139 | accessdate= 13 May 2013 | doi= 10.4319/lo.1959.4.2.0128 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130619213159/http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_4/issue_2/0128.pdf | archivedate= 19 June 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of [[DNA]], enabled researchers taking part in the [[Census of Marine Life]] to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers. This revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected, so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20,000 species. [[Mitchell Sogin]] from the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] feels that "the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060829081744.htm| work= ScienceDaily | title= Ocean Microbe Census Discovers Diverse World of Rare Bacteria | date= 2 September 2006 | publisher= | accessdate= 13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteria are found at all depths in the [[water column]], as well as in the sediments, some being aerobic, others anaerobic. Most are free-swimming, but some exist as [[symbionts]] within other organisms – examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria. [[Cyanobacteria]] played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes, enabling the development of [[stromatolites]] and oxygen in the atmosphere.

Some bacteria interact with [[diatoms]], and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean. One anaerobic species, ''[[Thiomargarita namibiensis]]'', plays an important part in the breakdown of [[hydrogen sulfide]] eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the Namibian coast, and generated by high rates of [[phytoplankton]] growth in the [[Benguela Current]] upwelling zone, eventually falling to the seafloor.

Bacteria-like [[Archaea]] surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments, such as the [[hydrothermal vents]] on the ocean floor. Alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Vibrio]]'' spp. survive in a [[pH]] range of 7.3 to 10.6, while some species will grow only at pH 10 to 10.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/2/m002p105.pdf |title= Alkalotolerant and Alkalophilic Bacteria in Seawater |first1= M. |last1= Maeda |first2= N. |last2= Taga | journal= Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume= 2 | pages= 105–108 | date= 31 March 1980 | publisher=  | accessdate= 13 May 2013 | doi=10.3354/meps002105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the ocean's [[biomass]], clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5232928.stm | date= 31 July 2006 | title= Thousands of microbes in one gulp | first= Louisa |last= Cheung | work= BBC News | accessdate= 13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of Archaea that breaks down [[methane]], an important [[greenhouse]] gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/10/05-01.html | title= The Case of the Missing Methane | first= Mitchell | last= Leslie | date= 5 October 2000 | work= ScienceNOW | publisher= American Association for the Advancement of Science | accessdate= 13 May 2013 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130526182906/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/10/05-01.html | archivedate= 26 May 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor, influencing seawater chemistry. Oil spills, and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity, as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life. The protist [[dinoflagellates]] may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or [[red tide]]s, often after human-caused pollution. The process may produce [[metabolites]] known as biotoxins, which move along the ocean food chain, tainting higher-order animal consumers.

''[[Pandoravirus salinus]]'', a species of very large virus, with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species, was discovered in 2013. Like the other very large viruses ''[[Mimivirus]]'' and ''[[Megavirus]]'', ''Pandoravirus'' infects amoebas, but its genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA, is twice as large as that of ''Megavirus'', and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure.

In 2013 researchers from [[Aberdeen University]] announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that have evolved in deep sea trenches, hoping to find "the next generation" of antibiotics, anticipating an "antibiotic apocalypse" with a dearth of new infection-fighting drugs. The EU-funded research will start in the [[Atacama Trench]] and then move on to search trenches off New Zealand and Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21457149 |title= Antibiotics search to focus on sea bed | date= 14 February 2013 | work= BBC News | accessdate= 13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ocean has a long history of human waste disposal on the assumption that its vast size makes it capable of absorbing and diluting all noxious material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nKkrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 |title= Radioactivity in the marine environment| work= National Academies, 1971 page 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While this may be true on a small scale, the large amounts of sewage routinely dumped has damaged many coastal ecosystems, and rendered them life-threatening. Pathogenic viruses and bacteria occur in such waters, such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' the cause of [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[polio]], along with protozoans causing [[giardiasis]] and [[cryptosporidiosis]]. These pathogens are routinely present in the ballast water of large vessels, and are widely spread when the ballast is discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Mi-Oc/Microbes-in-the-Ocean.html |title= Microbes in the Ocean |first1= Brian D. |last1= Hoyle | first2= Richard |last2= Robinson | work= Water Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientific theory|Scientific theories]] behind the origins of sea salt started with Sir [[Edmond Halley]] in 1715, who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground. Upon reaching the ocean, these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time (see [[Water cycle|Hydrologic cycle]]). Halley noted that most lakes that don't have ocean outlets (such as the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], see [[endorheic basin]]), have high salt content. Halley termed this process "continental weathering".

Halley's theory was partly correct. In addition, sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed. The presence of salt's other dominant ion, chloride, results from [[outgassing]] of chloride (as [[hydrochloric acid]]) with other gases from Earth's interior via [[volcano]]s and [[hydrothermal vent]]s. The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt.

Ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years, most likely as a consequence of a chemical/[[plate tectonics|tectonic]] system which removes as much salt as is deposited; for instance, sodium and chloride sinks include [[evaporite]] deposits, pore-water burial, and reactions with seafloor [[basalt]]s.&lt;ref name=Pinet/&gt;{{rp|133}}

==Human impacts==
[[Climate change]], rising atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], excess nutrients, and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry. Rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record. Major trends include an increasing [[ocean acidification|acidity]], reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increases in [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and persistent organic pollutants. Most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer, and industrial activity. Concentrations are projected to grow in coming decades, with negative impacts on ocean biota and other marine resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doney|first=Scott C.|title=The Growing Human Footprint on Coastal and Open-Ocean Biogeochemistry|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=18 June 2010|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1512–1516|doi=10.1126/science.1185198|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5985/1512.full|accessdate=16 December 2011|pmid=20558706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most striking features of this is [[ocean acidification]], resulting from increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake of the oceans related to higher atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and higher temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-01-01|title=Ocean Acidification: The Other CO2 Problem|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163834|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=1|issue=1|pages=169–192|doi=10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163834|pmid=21141034}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it severely affects [[coral reef]]s and [[crustacean]]s (see [[coral bleaching]]).

==Human consumption==
{{main|Sea water poisoning}}{{See also|Desalination}}
Accidentally consuming small quantities of clean seawater is not harmful, especially if the seawater is taken along with a larger quantity of fresh water. However, drinking seawater to maintain hydration is counterproductive; more water must be excreted to eliminate the salt (via [[urine]]) than the amount of water obtained from the seawater itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/drinksw.html |title=Can humans drink seawater? |publisher=[[National Ocean Service]] ([[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Urinary system|renal system]] actively regulates sodium chloride in the blood within a very narrow range around 9 g/L (0.9% by weight).

In most open waters concentrations vary somewhat around typical values of about 3.5%, far higher than the body can tolerate and most beyond what the kidney can process. A point frequently overlooked in claims that the kidney can excrete NaCl in Baltic concentrations of 2% (in arguments to the contrary) is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations, so that there is no benefit in drinking such water. Drinking seawater temporarily increases blood's NaCl concentration. This signals the [[kidney]] to excrete sodium, but seawater's sodium concentration is above the kidney's maximum concentrating ability. Eventually the blood's sodium concentration rises to toxic levels, removing water from cells and interfering with [[nerve]] conduction, ultimately producing fatal [[Non-epileptic seizure|seizure]] and [[cardiac arrhythmia]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Survival skills|Survival manual]]s consistently advise against drinking seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/harshEnv2/HE2ch29.pdf |chapter=29 |title=Shipboard Medicine |accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of 163 [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|life raft]] voyages estimated the risk of death at 39% for those who drank seawater, compared to 3% for those who did not. The effect of seawater intake on rats confirmed the negative effects of drinking seawater when dehydrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The temptation to drink seawater was greatest for sailors who had expended their supply of fresh water, and were unable to capture enough rainwater for drinking. This frustration was described famously by a line from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'':

::: ''"Water, water, everywhere,&lt;br /&gt;And all the boards did shrink;&lt;br /&gt; Water, water, everywhere,&lt;br /&gt;Nor any drop to drink."''

Although humans cannot survive on seawater, some people claim that up to two cups a day, mixed with fresh water in a 2:3 ratio, produces no ill effect. The French physician [[Alain Bombard]] survived an ocean crossing in a small Zodiak rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat, which contains about 40 percent water (like most living tissues), as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean. His findings were challenged, but an alternative explanation was not given. In his 1948 book, ''[[Kon-Tiki]]'', [[Thor Heyerdahl]] reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 2:3 ratio during the 1947 expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Heyerdahl, Thor; Lyon, F.H. (translator) (1950). ''Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft''.  Rand McNally &amp; Company, Chicago, Ill.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, another adventurer, [[William Willis (sailor)|William Willis]], claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the 18th century, [[Richard Russell (doctor)|Richard Russell]] advocated the practice's medical use in the UK, and [[René Quinton]] expanded the advocation of the practice other countries, notably France, in the 20th century. Currently, the practice is widely used in Nicaragua and other countries, supposedly taking advantage of the latest medical discoveries.{{Citation needed|reason=Unfounded and google shows no results|date=May 2018}}

Most ocean-going vessels [[desalination|desalinate]] [[Drinking water|potable]] water from seawater using processes such as [[vacuum distillation]] or [[multi-stage flash distillation]] in an [[evaporator (marine)|evaporator]], or, more recently, [[reverse osmosis]]. These energy-intensive processes were not usually available during the [[Age of Sail]]. Larger sailing warships with large crews, such as [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s {{HMS|Victory}}, were fitted with distilling apparatus in their [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]s.&lt;ref name="Rippon, Vol 1, 78-79" &gt;{{Cite book

Animals such as fish, whales, [[sea turtle]]s, and [[seabird]]s, such as penguins and [[albatross]]es have adapted to living in a high saline habitat. For example, sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles remove excess salt from their bodies through their [[tear ducts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9-eBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT158&amp;dq=Animals+such+as+fish,+whales,+sea+turtles,+and+seabirds+can+adapt+to+high+saline+habitat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP2quP7PzUAhVC7WMKHeVJBEwQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Animals%20such%20as%20seabirds%20can%20adapt%20to%20high%20saline%20habitat&amp;f=false|title=The Bird in the Waterfall: Exploring the Wonders of Water|last=Dennis|first=Jerry|date=2014-09-23|publisher=Diversion Books|isbn=9781940941547|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shafi Ahmed''' is a surgeon, teacher, [[futurist]], innovator and entrepreneur. 

Shafi was born on 26 January 1969 in [[Sylhet District]], [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) and came to the United Kingdom as a child. His father, the late Mimbor Ali, was honoured by the Bangladeshi government for his significant contribution to the [[liberation of Bangladesh]].

He was appointed as a Consultant General, Laparoscopic and Colorectal surgeon to the [[Royal London Hospital]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]s,
[[Barts Health NHS Trust|Barts Health]] in 2007.

He was appointed as an honorary professor at The University of Bradford in May 2017.

==Education==

Shafi attended Chadwell Heath High School (now [[Chadwell Heath Academy]]) and then attended Redbridge technical college.

===Undergraduate===

He studied medicine between 1988 and 1993 at [[King's College Hospital]] School of Medicine. At university he was elected President of the Medical and Dental Society from 1989 to 1990 and helped introduce medical ethics into the curriculum. He was awarded the Jelf medal in 1990 for outstanding academic and social achievement at King's College London. He was also won the WG Oakley prize in Diabetes in 1992 for an original dissertation entitled "Diabetic Neuroarthropathy: the Pathogenesis of the Charcot joint".

He played football for the 1st XI between 1988–1993 and the United Hospitals' representative team 1990–1992. He captained the Cricket 1st XI 1991–1993.

===Postgraduate===

Shafi completed his basic and higher surgical training in London in general surgery.

During his surgical training he undertook a period of research at The Royal London Hospital and Queen Mary University of London and obtained a PhD in 2010 with a thesis entitled "The role of microarray profiling in predicting outcome in patients with colorectal cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microarray profiling of colorectal cancer in Bangladeshi patients|first1=S.|last1=Ahmed|first2=A.|last2=Banerjea|first3=R.

He obtained his FRCS(Eng), FRCS(Ed) and FRCSI (Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Edinburgh and Ireland) in 2007–2008. He completed his intercollegiate final FRCS(Gen.Surg) in 2006.

He also obtained a Certificate in Medical Informatics from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 2005.

He has been awarded 4 Honorary PhDs (Honoris Causa) from Udabol University Bolivia, SIISDET Colombia, University of Peru of Science and Informatics and EXIBED, Spain.

==Career==
===Clinical practice===

Shafi works in the Academic Centre of Surgery and has established [[minimally invasive]] [[colorectal surgery]] at the [[Royal London Hospital]], Barts Health NHS Trust.

His main clinical interest is [[colorectal cancer]] and he performs radical pelvic surgery for primary and recurrent disease as well as multi-visceral resections. His other interests include [[diverticular disease]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and pouch surgery, [[coloproctology]] and the modern management of [[haemorrhoids]].

He has pioneered single incision [[laparoscopic]] colorectal surgery (virtual scarless surgery) and also works with liver surgeons to perform simultaneous laparoscopic liver and [[bowel resection]]s for cancer. His other clinical interest is advanced stage 3/4 [[endometriosis]], performing laparoscopic surgery with [[gynaecologists]]. This has led to the development and recognition of a national centre for endometriosis. In addition, he has specialist experience in complex abdominal wall [[hernia]]s and reconstruction.

From 2010 to 2015 he was the lead clinician and multi-disciplinary team lead for colorectal cancer at Barts Health NHS Trust. He is also a CQC specialist advisor in general surgery.

He undertakes private work at the London Independent Hospital and the Spire Roding Hospital.

===Teaching===

Shafi is the Associate Dean for Barts and the London undergraduate medical students at the Royal London Hospital and is the module lead for surgery in year 3 and year 5. He was programme director for core surgical trainees for North East London 2012–2013 and Tutor in Surgery for the Royal London Hospital 2011–2013.

=== Barts X Medicine ===
Shafi is the module lead for an innovative new course at Barts and The London Medical School which aims to teach the 3rd year medical students about future medicine and how to generate ideas to improve clinical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.j1694|title=The rise of medical entrepreneurs {{!}} Student BMJ|website=student.bmj.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.doctorpreneurs.com/mr-shafi-ahmed-director-medical-realities-virtual-medics-founder-barts-x-medicine/|title=Mr Shafi Ahmed, Director Medical Realities &amp; Virtual Medics, Founder Barts X Medicine - Doctorpreneurs|date=2017-01-11|work=Doctorpreneurs|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students are taught by [[digital health]] innovators and those involved in Medtech from the UK and US. BMJ digital and QMUL are supporting a [[hackathon]] and taking ideas to market by [[crowdsource]] funding.

===Royal College of Surgeons of England===

Shafi was elected onto the council of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/about-the-rcs/college-governance/council/|title=Council – Royal College of Surgeons|first=|last=sitecore\lewis.ashman@rcseng.ac.uk|work=rcseng.ac.uk|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has numerous roles and leads the International Surgical Training Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/about-the-rcs/international-affairs/international-surgical-training-programme/|title=International Surgical Training Programme (ISTP) – Royal College of Surgeons|first=|last=sitecore\julie@redweb.com|work=rcseng.ac.uk|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the Cancer 2020 5 Year Forward View Task force 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-strategy-in-england|title=Cancer Strategy in England|date=20 January 2015|work=cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the court of examiners and is an international convenor of the MRCS for Bangladesh.

==Technology, innovation and global surgical education==
Shafi has been working on new technologies enhancing surgical education globally. His online videos have been watched hundreds of thousands of times, earning him the accolade of most-watched surgeon in human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medgadget.com/2017/04/shafi-ahmed-virtual-surgeon-discusses-live-streaming-vr-surgery-medical-education.html|title=Shafi Ahmed—The Virtual Surgeon—Discusses Live Streaming and VR in Surgery and Med Education {{!}}|date=2017-04-06|work=Medgadget|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''thermal power station Regina Margherita''' was a large power station for the production of electricity, preserved at the [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia "Leonardo da Vinci"|Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] in [[Milan]], Italy. The station opened in 1895 and was originally installed in the Egidio e Pio Gavazzi silk factory in [[Desio]] (Milan), where it operated until 1954. It supplied electricity for lighting and for the operation of 1,800 [[loom]]s, generating [[Alternating current|alternating electric current]] at a voltage of 200 V.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/catalogo_collezioni/scheda_oggetto.asp|title=Catalogo collezioni - Centrale termoelettrica Regina Margherita|website=Museoscienza.org|publisher=Museo nazionale scienza e tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milano|language=it|accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Designed at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]], it was built by combining a [[steam engine]] from the [[Franco Tosi]] company of [[Legnano]] and a pair of [[alternator]]s from the [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie|Brown Boveri]] company.&lt;ref name="genMus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/approfondimenti/documenti/centrale_reginamargherita/|title=Centrale Termoelettrica Regina Margherita|website=Museoscienza.org|publisher=Museo nazionale scienza e tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milano|language=it|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power station opened on November 9, 1895; the ceremony was attended by [[King Umberto I]] and [[Margherita of Savoy]], to whom the plant was dedicated.&lt;ref name="genMus"/&gt;

=== Museum ===
[[File:3421 - Milano - Museo Scienza e tecnica - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 6-Mar-2008.jpg|thumb|Detail]]

In 1958 Egidio e Pio Gavazzi proposed to donate the power plant to the [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia "Leonardo da Vinci"|Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]]. In order to exhibit the large machine, the floor was demolished, a stronger basement was built to support the item and the technical press consultation room was moved. Then the Desio plant was dismantled using  maintenance cranes and it was transported with a Riva lorry to the museum, where it was reassembled by hand and connected to an electric motor, coupled with a [[reduction gear]], and set in motion. The furnace and boiler, with their connected steam distribution pipes and pumps, were not transferred to the museum.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt;

== Description ==
The station contains two parts: thermal, consisting of a steam engine with two horizontal cylinders, and electric, consisting of two alternators and two exciter [[dynamo]]s. There is also an electric control panel and a lighting system with 8 lamps.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt; The machine is activated by an electric motor, connected to it by a chain which encircles a [[pulley]], and it no longer produces current.

== Technique ==
This machine is an example of a compound steam engine.&lt;ref name="SchedaCERL"/&gt;

Although it relied on the finest nineteenth-century technologies, the "Regina Margherita" was not a cutting-edge piece of machinery. Ten years before its making, the Englishman Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons]] had already invented the [[steam turbine]]. In the latter device the force of the steam acts directly on the blades of the wheel, producing the rotation necessary to operate the [[alternator]]s. The steam turbine is more efficient than a cylinder and [[piston]] system because it reduces energy waste from the transformation of alternating motion into rotary motion and from the transmission of movement through connecting rods, cranks and belts.&lt;ref name="genMus"/&gt;

[[File:The Friese-Greene grave in Highgate Cemetery.jpg|thumb|270px|The Friese-Greene grave in Highgate Cemetery]]
'''William Friese-Greene''' (born '''William Edward Green''', 7 September 1855 – 5 May 1921) was a prolific English inventor and professional photographer. He is principally known as a pioneer in the field of motion pictures, creating a series of cameras in the period 1888–1891 with which he shot moving pictures in London. He went on to patent an early two-colour filming process in 1905. His inventions in the field of printing – including photo-typesetting and a method of printing without ink – brought him wealth, as did his chain of photographic studios. However, he spent everything he earned on inventing, going bankrupt three times and to jail once, before dying in poverty.

==Early life==
William Edward Green was born on 7 September 1855, in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/508948/ |title=Friese-Greene, William (1855–1921) Biography |last= |first= |date= |website=BFI Screenonline |language=en |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1871 he was apprenticed to the Bristol photographer Marcus Guttenberg,&lt;ref name="natmedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cartedevisite.co.uk/photographers-category/biographies/g-to-l/marcus-guttenberg/ |title=Marcus Guttenberg 1828 – 1891 |last=Cosens |first=Ron |date=29 December 2017 |website=Photographers of Great Britain and Ireland 1840 to 1940 |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later successfully went to court to be freed early from the indentures of his seven-year apprenticeship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Davis |first=Bertram |date=March 1947 |title=WILLIAM FRIESE GREENE |url= |journal=The Elizabethan |volume=XVIII |pages=10–14 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married the Swiss Helena Friese on 24 March 1874, and in a remarkable move for the era, decided to add her maiden name to his surname. In 1877 he set up his own studio in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and by 1881 had expanded his business with more studios in Bath, Bristol and Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.victorianphotographers.co.uk/ |title=Victorian Photographers of Great Britain and Ireland 1840-1940 |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematic inventor==
===Experiments with magic lanterns===
In Bath he came into contact with [[John Arthur Roebuck Rudge]]. Rudge was a scientific instrument maker who also worked with electricity and [[magic lantern]]s to create popular entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/rudge |title=John Arthur Roebuck Rudge |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudge built what he called the Biophantic Lantern, which could display seven photographic slides in rapid succession, producing the illusion of movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web 
|url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/fr/catalogues/appareils/collection/lanterne-de-projectionap-94-33.html |title=The Biophantic Lantern |last= |first= |date= |website=Catalogue des appareils cinématographiques de la Cinémathèque française et du CNC |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed a sequence in which Rudge (with the invisible help of Friese-Greene) apparently took off his head. Friese-Greene was fascinated by the machine and worked with Rudge on a variety of devices over the 1880s, various of which Rudge called the Biophantascope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=Collection Will Day : les débuts du cinéma anglais |url= |journal=1895, revue d'histoire du cinéma |volume=1997 |pages=162, 163 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving his base to London in 1885, Friese-Greene realised that glass plates would never be a practical medium for continuously capturing life as it happens and began to experiment with the new Eastman paper roll film, made transparent with castor oil, before turning his attention to experimenting with [[celluloid]] as a medium for motion picture cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celluloid and Photography part three: The Beginnings of Cinema |url=http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/~/media/Files/NMeM/PDF/Collections/Photography/TheBeginningsOfCinema.pdf |publisher=National Media Museum |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie camera===
On 21 June 1889, Friese-Greene was issued patent no. 10131 for his camera.&lt;ref name="screenonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/508948/ |title=Friese-Greene, William (1855-1921) |publisher=Screen Online |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was apparently capable of taking up to ten photographs per second using paper and celluloid film. A report on the camera was published in the British ''Photographic News'' on 28 February 1890. On 18 March, Friese-Greene sent a clipping of the story to [[Thomas Edison]], whose laboratory had been developing a motion picture system, with a peephole viewer, christened the [[Kinetoscope]]. The report was reprinted in ''[[Scientific American]]'' on 19 April.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Marta, (1992) ''Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830–1904)'', p. 190, Chicago: University of Chicago Press {{ISBN|0-226-07173-1}}''';''' Robinson, David, (1997) ''From Peepshow to Palace: The Birth of American Film'', p. 28, New York and Chichester, West Sussex, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-10338-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friese-Greene worked on a series of moving picture cameras until early 1891, but although many individuals recount seeing his projected images privately, he did not ever give a successful public projection of moving pictures. In 1890 he developed a camera with Frederick Varley to shoot [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] moving images. The camera ran at a slower frame rate, and although the 3-D arrangement images worked, there are no records of projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zone |first1=Ray |title=Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838–1952 |date=2014 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=9780813145891 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UXTAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=William+Friese-Greene+stereoscopic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K_pYnatF53&amp;sig=97odMUopqFojQCE9mPPa13CibHo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwC2oVChMI5-m7sbfiyAIVy2sUCh3oVwRp#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Friese-Greene%20stereoscopic&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friese-Greene's experiments in the field of motion pictures were at the expense of his other business interests and in 1891 he was declared [[bankrupt]]. To cover his debts he had already sold the rights to the 1889 moving picture camera patent for £500 (£60,000 in 2016 terms). The renewal fee was never paid and the patent eventually lapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Breverton |first1=Terry |authorlink=Terry Breverton |title=Breverton's Encyclopedia of Inventions: A Compendium of Technological Leaps, Groundbreaking Discoveries and Scientific Breakthroughs that Changed the World |date=2012 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=9781780873404 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VepgBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT418&amp;lpg=PT418&amp;dq=William+Friese-Greene+chronophotographic+patent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KGdazpyk_6&amp;sig=JkcJKbNZGOM51fmSUPgofMM-oiA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBGoVChMIr9WL67fiyAIViz4UCh2H_QqF#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Friese-Greene%20chronophotographic%20patent&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour film===
Friese-Greene's later exploits were in the field of colour in motion pictures. From 1903 he lived in Brighton where there were a number of experimenters developing still and moving pictures in colour. Initially working with [[William Norman Lascelles Davidson]], Friese-Greene patented a two-colour moving picture system using prisms in 1905. He and Davidson gave public demonstrations of this in January&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Moving Pictures |last=Talbot |first=Frederick |publisher=William Heinemann |year=1912 |isbn= |location=London |pages=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; and July 1906&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= |title=Novelties at the Convention |last= |first= |date=August 2, 1906 |work=''Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette'' |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Friese-Greene held screenings at his photographic studio.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=December 28, 1906 |title=Cinematography in Colours |url= |journal=''British Journal of Photography''|volume= |pages=1033 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also experimented with a system which he called "Biocolour". This process produced the illusion of true colour by exposing each alternate frame of ordinary black-and-white film stock through two or three different coloured filters. Each alternate frame of the monochrome print was then stained red or green (and/or blue). Although the projection of Biocolour prints did provide an impression of true colour, it suffered from noticeable flickering and red and green fringing when the subject was in rapid motion, as did the more popular and famous system, [[Kinemacolor]].

In 1911, [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]] and [[Charles Urban]] filed a lawsuit against Friese-Greene, claiming that the Biocolour process infringed upon Smith's [[Kinemacolor]] patents, despite the fact that Friese-Greene had both patented and demonstrated his work before Smith. Urban was granted an injunction against Biocolour in 1912, but the Sussex-based, flamboyant racing driver [[Selwyn Edge]] decided to help Friese-Greene by funding an appeal to the High Court. This overturned the original verdict on the grounds that Kinemacolor made claims for itself which it could not deliver. Urban fought back and pushed it up to the House of Lords, who in 1915 upheld the decision of the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cinema-by-Sea |last=Fisher |first=David |publisher=Terra Media |year=2012 |isbn= |location=Brighton |pages=141–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision benefited nobody. For Urban it was a case of hubris because now he could no longer exercise control over his own system, so it became worthless. For Friese-Greene, the arrival of the war and personal poverty meant there was nothing more to be done with colour for some years.

His son [[Claude Friese-Greene]] continued to develop the system with his father and, after his death, in the early 1920s, now calling it "The Friese-Greene Natural Colour Process" and shooting the documentary films "The Open Road" with it, which are a rare portrait of 1920s Britain in colour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-the-open-road-2006-online |title=Watch The Open Road - BFI Player |website=BFI Player |language=en |access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These were featured in a BBC series [[The Lost World of Friese-Greene]] and then issued in a digitally restored form by the BFI on DVD in 2006.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Death==
On 5 May 1921 Friese-Greene – now a largely forgotten figure – attended an important and stormy meeting of the cinema trade at the Connaught Rooms in London. The meeting had been called to discuss the current poor state of British film distribution and was chaired by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]]. Disturbed by the tone of the proceedings, Friese-Greene got to his feet to speak. The chairman asked him to come forward onto the platform to be heard better, which he did, appealing for the two sides to come together. Shortly after returning to his seat, he collapsed. People came to his aid and took him outside, but he died almost immediately of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= |title=Inquiry Into Death of Mr Friese Greene |last= |first= |date=10 May 1926 |work=Dundee Evening Telegraph |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given his dramatic death, surrounded by film industry representatives who had almost entirely forgotten about his role in motion pictures, there was a spasm of collective shock and guilt. A very grand funeral was staged for him, a two minute silence was observed in some cinemas and a fund was raised to commission the famous architect [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]] to design a memorial for his grave. This memorial describes him as "The Inventor of Kinematography", a term William Friese-Greene never used in talking about his achievements. Indeed, he often spoke generously about other workers in the field of capturing movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=11 December 1896 |title=Croydon Camera Club meeting |url= |journal=British Journal of Photography |volume=43 |pages=703 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the eastern section of London's [[Highgate Cemetery]], just south of the entrance and visible from the street through the railings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1378873 |title=Tomb of William Friese-Greene in Highgate (Eastern) Cemetery |last= |first= |date= |website=Historic England |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife, Edith Jane, died a few months later of cancer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= |title=Death of Mrs Friese Greene |last= |first= |date=23 July 1921 |work=Bath Chronicle |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried with him.

==Legacy==
In 1951 a biopic was made, starring [[Robert Donat]], as part of the [[Festival of Britain]]. The film, ''[[The Magic Box]],'' was not premiered until the festival was nearly over, and only went on full release after it had finished. Despite the all-star cast and a great deal of publicity, it was a costly box office flop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bufvc.ac.uk/oldwebsite/publications/articles/festofbritain.pdf Film and the Festival of Britain 1951]&lt;/ref&gt; Domankiewicz and Herbert have written, "He was the subject of a romantic and unreliable biography, ''Friese-Greene, Close-Up of an Inventor'',&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ray Allister (pseudonym for Muriel Forth) (1948) ''Friese-Greene, Close Up of An Inventor'', Marsland Publications, London&lt;br&gt; (reprinted by Arno Press Cinema Program (1972) [Facsimile, Hardcover] {{ISBN|0-405-03908-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; which was then turned into an even more misleading film, ''The Magic Box''."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/friesegreene.php |title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |website=www.victorian-cinema.net |access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Martin Scosese has many times cited it as one of his favourite films, and one that inspired him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://robert-donat.com/2011/12/02/martin-scorseses-hugo-inspired-by-the-magic-box/ |title=Martin Scorsese’s Hugo inspired by The Magic Box|date=2011-12-02 |work=Robert Donat |access-date=2018-10-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a campaign by Bristol photographer [[Reece Winstone]] for the retention of Friese-Greene's birthplace for use as a Museum of Cinematography, among other purposes, it was demolished by Bristol Corporation in 1958 to provide parking space for six cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bristol As It Was 1956–1959 |first=Reece |last=Winstone |publisher=Reece Winstone Archive and Publishing |pages=57–59 |year=1972 |isbn=0-900814-39-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friese-Greene plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Middle Street, Brighton]]Premises in Brighton's Middle Street where Friese-Greene shared workshop space in 1905 are often wrongly described as his home. They bear a plaque in a 1924 design by [[Eric Gill]] commemorating Friese-Greene's achievements, wrongly stating that it is the place where he invented cinematography. The plaque was unveiled by [[Michael Redgrave]], who had appeared in ''[[The Magic Box]]'', in September 1957. A modern office building a few yards away is named Friese-Greene House. Other plaues include the 1930s Odeon Cinema in Kings Road, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London, with its iconic facade, which carries high upon it a large sculpted head-and-shoulders medallion of "William Friese-Greene" and his years of birth and death. There is a bronze statue of him at [[Pinewood Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diana Thomson FRBS |url=http://rbs.org.uk/artists/diana-thomson |publisher=British Society of Sculptors |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[BBC]] ran a series of programmes called ''[[The Lost World of Friese-Greene]]'', presented by [[Dan Cruickshank]] about Claude Friese-Greene's road trip from [[Land's End to John o' Groats]], entitled ''The Open Road'', which he filmed from 1924 to 1926 using the Biocolour process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bufvc.ac.uk/dvdfind/index.php/title/AV69017 ''The Open Road'' (2007) British Universities Film &amp; Video Council]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern television production techniques meant they were able to remove the issues of flickering and colour fringing around moving objects, which Kinemacolor and Biocolour had when projected. The result was a unique view of Britain in colour in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost World of Friese-Greene'' (2006) British Universities Film &amp; Video Council, [http://bufvc.ac.uk/dvdfind/index.php/title/AV37498]&lt;/ref&gt;

William Friese-Greene was more or less banished to obscurity by film historians from the 1960s onwards, but new research is leading to a rehabilitation of his reputation and a better understanding of his achievements and his influence on the technical development of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cinema-By-Sea |last=Fisher |first=David |publisher=Terra Media |year=2012 |isbn= |location=Brighton |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://friesegreene.com/ |title=William Friese-Greene &amp; Me |last= |first= |date= |website=William Friese-Greene &amp; Me |language=en-UK |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=2018-10-23|registration=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=William Friese-Greene &amp; The Art of Collaboration |date=2018-04-24 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_MA4LQmrYQ |volume= |pages= |access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
