      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8641">The '''Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer''' (AATSR) is one of the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) instruments on board the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA)'s [[Envisat]] satellite.

This instrument is a multi-channel imaging [[radiometer]] with the principal objective of providing data concerning global [[Sea surface temperature#Measuring SST|Sea Surface Temperature (SST)]] to the high levels of accuracy and stability required for monitoring and carrying out research into the behaviour of the Earth’s [[climate]].

AATSR can measure Earth's surface temperature to a precision of {{convert|0.3|K-change|sigfig=1}}, for [[climatology|climate research]]. Among the secondary objectives of AATSR is the observation of environmental parameters such as aerosols, clouds, fires, gas flares, water content, biomass, and vegetal health and growth.
AATSR is the successor of ATSR-1 and ATSR-2, payloads of [[ERS-1]] and [[ERS-2]].

==Details==

=== Accuracy ===
The required accuracies are better than 0.3&amp;nbsp;°C with a stability approaching 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C /decade. Because of its wide angle lens it is possible to make very precise measurements of atmospheric effects on how emissions from the Earth's surface propagate.

In order to achieve this accuracy while viewing the Earth's surface through the [[Earth’s atmosphere|atmosphere]], AATSR views the surface at two angles, one close to the [[nadir]] (immediately below the satellite) and the other along the satellite track at close to 55° from the nadir, thereby providing two views of each point on the Earth's surface, each  with a different effective atmospheric thickness.  This dual-view system enables a particularly accurate estimate to be made of the signal degradation due to atmospheric absorption and [[Scattering#Electromagnetic scattering|scattering]].

=== Calibration ===
AATSR also embodies an exceptionally precise and stable on-board calibration system, comprising two reference targets specially designed for high uniformity and stability.  These two targets, known as [[Black body|'black bodies']] are maintained at temperatures near to the extremes of the Earth temperatures as measured by AATSR and they are both viewed during each scan cycle of the instrument.  This calibration system ensures that measurements of thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface are properly calibrated and do not rely on ground-based measurements, although such measurements are continually used to evaluate AATSR’s performance.

=== Channels ===
AATSR has three channels at thermal infrared wavelengths, from which surface temperatures are derived over both sea and land surfaces.  In addition, AATSR has four visible and near-infrared wavelength channels which are used to identify cloudy areas and to measure [[solar radiation]] that is scattered and reflected from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere.  These channels provide measurements from which land-cover properties, for example, [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index|NDVI]], as well as [[clouds]] and atmospheric particulate matter (or [[aerosol]]s) can be studied.

The dual-view measurements provided by the along-track scanning technique is also a key feature of AATSR when used for atmospheric or vegetation measurements. As with the SST measurements, the two measurements of each point on the surface through different atmospheric path lengths greatly simplifies the task of separating the surface and atmospheric contributions to the measured signal. Thus the effects of atmospheric aerosols can be removed from surface products (such as surface reflectance or NDVI).&lt;ref name=north_etal&gt;{{cite news|last=North |first=Peter |date=1999 |url=http://geography.swansea.ac.uk/personal/prjn/papers/ieeeatsr99.pdf |title=Retrieval of Land Surface Bidirectional Reflectance and Aerosol Opacity from ATSR-2 Multiangle Imagery |periodical=IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=526–537 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817034640/http://geography.swansea.ac.uk/personal/prjn/papers/ieeeatsr99.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-17 |bibcode=1999ITGRS..37..526N |doi=10.1109/36.739106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a similar approach can be used to account for the surface reflectance in determining aerosol or cloud properties. Additionally, the [[parallax]] between the two views can be used to determine [[cloud top]] and aerosol plume heights using geometric means.&lt;ref name=muller_etal&gt;{{cite news | last=Muller | first=J.-P. | date=2007 | url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/9852/ | title=Stereo cloud-top heights and cloud fraction retrieval from ATSR-2 | periodical=International Journal of Remote Sensing | volume=28 | issue=9 | pages=1921–1938 | display-authors=etal | bibcode=2007IJRS...28.1921M | doi=10.1080/01431160601030975 | access-date=2010-09-11 | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516161244/http%3A//discovery.ucl.ac.uk/9852/ | archive-date=2016-05-16 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance ===
One of the most important aspects of the ATSR series of space instruments is that it has, over a period of just over 15 years, undergone the transition from experimental sensor on the ERS satellites, developing the technique and demonstrating the accuracy that can be achieved with along-track scanning, to that of an operational system, within Europe’s Envisat and future GMES Programmes.

== Funding and Origin ==
The AATSR is a nationally-provided instrument, funded by the UK’s [[Defra|Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)]] in order to support their programme of climate prediction and research. It was developed and is operated in collaboration with ESA. There is also a significant Australian contribution to the AATSR programme, now managed by the [[CSIRO|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]. The predecessor instruments, ATSR-1 and ATSR-2, were funded by the UK's Science and Engineering Research Council. This funding responsibility was transferred to the UK's [[Natural Environment Research Council]] in 1993.

== Predecessors ==
AATSR is the third in a series of instruments started by ATSR-1, which was launched in 1991 on the European Remote-Sensing Satellite, [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1]]. This was followed by ATSR-2 on ERS-2 in 1995 and by AATSR on the Envisat satellite in 2002. The original ATSR-1 instrument lacked the three shortest wavelength channels provided by AATSR, whereas ATSR-2 was functionally identical. This has led to a near-continuous SST dataset extending from 1991 to the present day. Looking to the future, a successor instrument is being developed to fly on ESA’s [[Sentinel 3]] satellite, which is part of the space segment of the European [[GMES|Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES)]] programme. This will ensure the continuity of AATSR-standard SST data into the foreseeable future.

==Successor==

The [[Sentinel 3]] Earth observational satellite will house many earth observational instruments including SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) which is the successor to AATSR.

&lt;!-- Envisat instruments have an identical panel here --&gt;

'''Ahmad ibn Rustah Isfahani''' ({{lang-fa|احمد ابن رسته اصفهانی}} ''Aḥmad ibn Rusta Iṣfahānī''), more commonly known as '''Ibn Rustah''' ({{lang|fa|ابن رسته}}, also spelled ''Ibn Rusta'' and ''Ibn Ruste''), was a 10th-century [[Iranian people|Persian]] explorer and geographer born in [[Rosta]] district, [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Rustah was identified with the writer ibn Dasta, by [[Mihály Kmoskó]] (1876–1931). {{cite web |url=http://www.arabcin.net/areen/areen_english/29/prespectives.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040857/http://www.arabcin.net/areen/areen_english/29/prespectives.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a geographical compendium known as ''Book of Precious Records''. The information on his home town of [[Isfahan]] is especially extensive and valuable. Ibn Rustah states that, while for other lands he had to depend on second-hand reports, often acquired with great difficulty and with no means of checking their veracity, for Isfahan he could use his own experience and observations or statements from others known to be reliable. Thus we have a description of the twenty districts (''rostaqs'') of Isfahan containing details not found in other geographers' works. Concerning the town itself, we learn that it was perfectly circular in shape, with a circumference of half a [[Parasang|farsang]], walls defended by a hundred towers, and four gates.

== Recorded information ==
His information on the non-Islamic peoples of Europe and Inner Asia makes him a useful source for these obscure regions (he was even aware of the existence of the British Isles and of the [[Heptarchy]] of Anglo-Saxon England) and for the prehistory of the Turks and other [[steppe]] peoples.

He travelled to [[Novgorod]] with the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] and compiled books relating his own travels, as well as second-hand knowledge of the [[Khazars]], [[Magyars]], [[Slavs]], [[Bulgars]] and other peoples.
* He wrote of a 10th-century city of the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]':
::''"As for the Rus, they live on an island … that takes three days to walk round and is covered with thick undergrowth and forests; … They harry the [[Slavs]], using ships to reach them; they carry them off as slaves and … sell them. They have no fields but simply live on what they get from the Slav's lands … When a son is born, the father will go up to the newborn baby, sword in hand; throwing it down, he says, 'I shall not leave you with any property: You have only what you can provide with this weapon.'"'' &lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic'', March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

:His impression of the Rus' seems to be very favourable:
::''"They carry clean clothes and the men adorn themselves with bracelets and gold. They treat their slaves well and also they carry exquisite clothes, because they put great effort in trade. They have many towns. They have a most friendly attitude towards foreigners and strangers who seek refuge."''

:This is in contrast to the account of [[Ibn Fadlan]] and other Arab authors whose views on hygiene (based on [[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence|Islamic teachings on cleanliness]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Islamic medical knowledge]]) contrasted with that of the [[Rus' people|Rus']]. However, the word ''clean'' initially appeared in the first Russian translation of Ibn Rustah by professor [[Daniel Chwolson]] (who also misspelled his name as '''Ibn Dasta(h)'''). Consecutive Russian editions of Chwolson's translation include a footnote saying that the Arabic original clearly says the opposite, ''unclean'' or ''impure'', and suggesting that Chwolson made such a correction intentionally, out of a remote concern that modern [[Russians]] might be offended by such characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Russ/X/Garkavi_mus_pis/23.htm See footnote 35.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Of ancient [[Croatia]] he wrote in the chronicle ''Al-Djarmi'':
::''"Their ruler is crowned … He dwells in the midst of the [[Slavs]] … He bears the title of 'ruler of rulers' and is called 'sacred king'. He is more powerful than the Zupan (viceroy), who is his deputy … His capital is called Drzvab where is held a fair of three days every month."''
* About a certain king of the [[Caucasus]] Ibn Rustah wrote:
::''"He prayed on Fridays with the Muslims, on Saturdays with the Jews and on Sundays with the Christians. 'Since each religion claims that it is the only true one and that the others are invalid', the king explained, 'I have decided to hedge my bets.'"''
* He also travelled extensively in Arabia and is one of the early Persian explorers to describe the city of [[Sana'a]]. In his ''Book of Precious Records'', he writes:
::''"It is the city of Yemen &amp;mdash; there not being found in the highland or the Tihama or the Hijaz a city greater, more populous or more prosperous, of more noble origin or more delicious food than it. … San'a is a populous city with fine dwellings, some above others, but most of them are decorated with plaster, burned bricks and dressed stones."''

[[Image:AlluvialPlain.JPG|thumb|A small, [[incised]] alluvial plain from [[Red Rock Canyon State Park (California)]].]]
An '''alluvial plain''' is a largely flat [[landform]] created by the deposition of [[sediment]] over a long period of time by one or more [[river]]s coming from highland regions, from which [[Alluvium|alluvial]] soil forms. A [[floodplain]] is part of the process, being the smaller area over which the rivers flood at a particular period of time, whereas the alluvial plain is the larger area representing the region over which the floodplains have shifted over geological time.

As the highlands [[erosion|erode]] due to [[weathering]] and water flow, the [[sediment]] from the hills is [[sediment transport|transported]] to the lower [[plain]]. Various [[stream|creek]]s will carry the water further to a river, [[lake]], [[bay]], or [[ocean]]. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the [[floodplain]] of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will, over time, seek new, lower paths, forming a [[meander]] (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural [[levee]]s at the margins of the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by lateral stream erosion and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses. These processes, over geologic time, will form the plain, a region with little [[relief]] (local changes in elevation), yet with a constant but small slope.

The ''Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms'', maintained by the United States' [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], defines an "alluvial plain" as "a large assemblage of fluvial landforms (braided streams, terraces, etc.,) that form low gradient, regional ramps along the flanks of mountains and extend great distances from their sources (e.g., High Plains of North America)"  Use of "alluvial plain" as a general, informal term for a broad flood plain or a low-gradient delta is explicitly discouraged.  The NCSS glossary instead suggests "flood plain".&lt;ref name="LandformGloss"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/PA_NRCSConsumption/download?cid=nrcs142p2_053182&amp;ext=pdf | title=Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms | publisher=[[National Cooperative Soil Survey]] | work=National Soil Survey Handbook—Part 629 | date=April 2013 | format=PDF | accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cape of Good Hope''' ({{lang-af|Kaap die Goeie Hoop}} {{IPA-af|ˌkɑːp di ˌχujə ˈɦʊəp|}}, {{lang-nl|Kaap de Goede Hoop}} {{IPA-nl|ˌkaːb də ˌɣudə ˈɦoːp||Nl-Kaap de Goede Hoop.ogg}},&lt;ref&gt;Every word in isolation {{IPA-nl|ˌkaːp də ˌɣudə ˈɦoːp|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-pt|Cabo da Boa Esperança}} {{IPA-pt|ˈkaβu ðɐ ˈβoɐ ʃpɨˈɾɐ̃sɐ|}}) is a rocky [[headlands and bays|headland]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the [[Cape Peninsula]] in [[South Africa]].

A common misconception is that the Cape of Good Hope is the southern tip of [[Africa]]. This misconception was based on the misbelief that the Cape was the dividing point between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. Contemporary geographic knowledge instead states the southernmost point of Africa is [[Cape Agulhas]] about {{convert|150|km|-1}} to the [[east-southeast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.airpano.com/360Degree-VirtualTour.php?3D=cape-good-hope-rsa|title=Cape of Good Hope, South Africa - 360° Aerial Panoramas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currents of the two oceans meet at the point where the warm-water [[Agulhas current]] meets the cold-water [[Benguela current]] and turns back on itself. That oceanic meeting point fluctuates between Cape Agulhas and [[Cape Point]] (about {{convert|1.2|km}} east of the Cape of Good Hope).

When following the western side of the African coastline from the equator, however, the Cape of Good Hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel more eastward than southward. Thus, the first modern rounding of the cape in 1488 by [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] was a milestone in the attempts by the Portuguese to establish direct trade relations with the [[Far East]] (although [[Herodotus]] mentioned a claim that the [[Phoenicia]]ns had done so [[Necho II#Phoenician expedition|far earlier]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/hist01.htm The first circumnavigation of Africa]. livius.org&lt;/ref&gt; Dias called the cape ''Cabo das Tormentas'' ("Cape of Storms"; {{lang-nl|Stormkaap}}), which was the original name of the "Cape of Good Hope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Englishwoman In America|year=1848|author=Sarah Mytton Maury|page=33|authorlink=Sarah Mytton Maury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the [[great capes]] of the South Atlantic Ocean, the Cape of Good Hope has long been of special significance to sailors, many of whom refer to it simply as "'''the Cape'''".&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way'', Francis Chichester; page 78. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1966. {{ISBN|0-340-00191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[waypoint]] on the [[Cape Route]] and the [[clipper route]] followed by [[clipper ship]]s to the [[Far East]] and [[Australia]], and still followed by several offshore [[yacht racing|yacht races]].

The term ''Cape of Good Hope'' is also used in three other ways:

* It is a section of the [[Table Mountain National Park]], within which the cape of the same name, as well as [[Cape Point]], falls. Prior to its incorporation into the national park, this section constituted the Cape Point Nature Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/tourism/map.php Map of the Park, showing the Cape of Good Hope section (retrieved 27 March 2010).]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was the name of the early [[Cape Colony]] established by the Dutch in 1652, on the [[Cape Peninsula]].
* Just before the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed, the term referred to the entire region that in 1910 was to become the [[Cape of Good Hope Province]] (usually shortened to ''the Cape Province'').

== History ==

[[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|d|ə|k|s|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Εὔδοξος}}, ''Eúdoxos''; fl. c. 130 BC) was a [[ethnic Greek|Greek]] [[navigator]] for [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]], king of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] in [[Egypt]], who found the wreck of a ship in the [[Indian Ocean]] that appeared to have come from [[Cádiz|Gades]] (today's [[Cádiz]] in Spain), rounding the Cape.

When Eudoxus was returning from his second voyage to India the wind forced him south of the [[Gulf of Aden]] and down the coast of Africa for some distance. Somewhere along the coast of East Africa, he found the remains of the ship. Due to its appearance and the story told by the natives, Eudoxus concluded that the ship was from Gades and had sailed anti-clockwise around Africa, passing the Cape and entering the Indian Ocean. This inspired him to repeat the voyage and attempt a [[circumnavigation]] of the continent. Organising the expedition on his own account he set sail from Gades and began to work down the African coast. The difficulties were too great, however, and he was obliged to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tozer |first= Henry F. |title= ''History of Ancient Geography'' |year= 1997 |publisher= Biblo &amp; Tannen |isbn= 0-8196-0138-1 |pages= 189–190}}; online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=svsNTIU3EskC Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

After this failure he again set out to circumnavigate Africa. His eventual fate is unknown. Although some, such as [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], claimed that Eudoxus did achieve his goal, the most probable conclusion is that he perished on the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tozer |first= Henry F. |title= History of Ancient Geography |year= 1997 |publisher= Biblo &amp; Tannen |isbn= 0-8196-0138-1 |pages= xxiii}}; online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=svsNTIU3EskC Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1450 [[Fra Mauro map]], the Indian Ocean is depicted as connected to the Atlantic. Fra Mauro puts the following inscription by the southern tip of Africa, which he names the "Cape of Diab", describing the exploration by a ship from the East around 1420:&lt;ref name="Marco Polo"&gt;{{harvnb|Marco Polo||p=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1971|p=501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FraMauroChineseShip.jpg|thumb|Detail of the Fra Mauro Map describing the construction of the junks that navigate in the Indian Ocean.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Around 1420 a ship, or junk, from India crossed the Sea of India  towards the Island of Men and the Island of Women, off Cape Diab, between the Green Islands and the shadows. It sailed for 40 days in a south-westerly direction  without ever finding anything other than wind and water. According to these people themselves, the ship  went some 2,000 miles ahead until - once favourable conditions came to an end - it turned round and sailed back to Cape Diab in 70 days".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ships called junks (lit. "Zonchi") that navigate these seas carry four masts or more, some of which can be raised or lowered, and have 40 to 60 cabins for the merchants and only one tiller. They can navigate without a [[compass]], because they have an [[astrologer]], who stands on the side and, with an [[astrolabe]] in hand, gives orders to the navigator". (Text from the Fra Mauro map, 09-P25.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fra Mauro explained that he obtained the information from "a trustworthy source", who traveled with the expedition, possibly the Venetian explorer [[Niccolò da Conti]] who happened to be in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[India]] at the time the expedition left:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"What is more, I have spoken  with a person worthy of trust, who says that  he sailed in an Indian ship caught in the fury  of a tempest  for 40 days out in the Sea of India, beyond the [[Sofala|Cape of Soffala]] and the Green Islands towards west-southwest; and according to the astrologers who act as their guides, they had advanced almost 2,000 miles. Thus one can believe and confirm  what is said by both these and those, and that they had therefore sailed 4,000 miles".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fra Mauro also comments that the account of the expedition, together with the relation by [[Strabo]] of the travels of [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] to [[Gibraltar]] through the southern Ocean in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], led him to believe that the [[Indian Ocean]] was not a closed sea and that [[Africa]] could be circumnavigated by her southern end (Text from Fra Mauro map, 11, G2). This knowledge, together with the map depiction of the African continent, probably encouraged the Portuguese to intensify their effort to round the tip of Africa.

In the [[Early Modern Era]], the first European to reach the cape was the Portuguese explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] on 12 March 1488, who named it the "Cape of Storms" (''Cabo das Tormentas''). It was later renamed by [[John II of Portugal]] as "Cape of Good Hope" (''Cabo da Boa Esperança'') because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to [[India]] and the East.

The [[Khoikhoi]] people lived in the cape area when the Dutch first settled there in 1652. The Khoikhoi had arrived in this area about fifteen hundred years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehret|first1=Christopher|title=An African Classical Age|date=2001|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville, VA|isbn=0-8139-2057-4|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch called them [[Khoikhoi|Hottentot]]s, a term that has now come to be regarded as pejorative.

[[Dutch people|Dutch]] colonial administrator [[Jan van Riebeeck]] established a resupply camp for the [[Dutch East India Company]] some 50&amp;nbsp;km north of the cape in [[Table Bay]] on 6 April 1652 and this eventually developed into [[Cape Town]]. Supplies of fresh food were vital on the long journey around Africa and Cape Town became known as "The Tavern of the Seas".

On 31 December 1687 a community of [[Huguenots]] (French Protestants) arrived at the Cape of Good Hope from the Netherlands. They had escaped from France and fled to the Netherlands to flee religious persecution in France. One example was Pierre Joubert who came from [[La Motte-d'Aigues]]. The Dutch East India Company needed skilled farmers at the Cape of Good Hope and the Dutch Government saw opportunities to settle Huguenots at the Cape and sent them there. The Cape colony gradually grew over the next 150 years or so until it stretched for hundreds of kilometres to the north and north-east.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Dutch Republic was occupied by the French in 1795. Thus the Cape Colony became a French vassal and enemy of the British. Therefore, the United Kingdom invaded and occupied the Cape Colony that same year. The British relinquished control of the territory in 1803 but returned and reoccupied the Colony on 19 January 1806 following the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]]. The Dutch ceded the territory to the British in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]] The Cape was then administered as the [[Cape Colony]] and it remained a British colony until it was incorporated into the independent [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 (now known as the Republic of South Africa).

The Portuguese government erected two navigational beacons, '''Dias Cross''' and '''Gama Cross''', to commemorate [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] as explorers who as mentioned were the first explorers to reach the cape. When lined up, the crosses point to Whittle Rock ({{Coord|34|21|24.63|S|18|28|26.36|E}}), a large, permanently submerged shipping hazard in [[False Bay]]. Two other beacons in [[Simon's Town]] provide the intersection.

== Geography ==
[[File:Cape of Good Hope sign (01).jpg|thumb|Sign at the Cape of Good Hope, 2018]]

The Cape of Good Hope is at the southern tip of the [[Cape Peninsula]], about 2.3&amp;nbsp;kilometres (1.4&amp;nbsp;mi) west and a little south of [[Cape Point]] on the south-east corner. [[Cape Town]] is about 50 kilometres to the north of the Cape, in [[Table Bay]] at the north end of the peninsula.  The peninsula forms the western boundary of [[False Bay]].  Geologically, the rocks found at the two capes, and indeed over much of the peninsula, are part of the [[Cape Peninsula#Geology|Cape Supergroup]], and are formed of the same type of sandstones as [[Table Mountain (South Africa)|Table Mountain]] itself. Both the Cape of Good Hope and [[Cape Point]] offer spectacular scenery; the whole of the southernmost portion of the Cape Peninsula is a wild, rugged, scenic and generally unspoiled national park.

The term ''the Cape '' has also been used in a wider sense, to indicate the area of [[Cape Colony|the European colony]] centred on [[Cape Town]], and the later [[Cape Province|South African province]]. Since 1994, it has been broken up into three smaller provinces: the [[Western Cape]], [[Eastern Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]]; parts of the province were also absorbed into the [[North West (South African province)|North West]].

== Fauna ==
[[File:Avestruz de cuello azul (Struthio camelus australis), cabo de Buena Esparanza, Sudáfrica, 2018-07-23, DD 85.jpg|thumb|Male [[ostrich]] at the Cape of Good Hope]]
With its diverse habitat, ranging from rocky mountain tops to beaches and open sea, the Cape of Good Hope is home to at least 250 species of birds including one of the two mainland colonies of [[Spheniscus demersus|African penguin]]s.

"Bush birds" tend to be rather scarce because of the coarse, scrubby nature of [[fynbos]] vegetation. When flowering, however, [[protea]]s and [[erica]]s attract [[sunbird]]s, [[sugarbird]]s, and other species in search of nectar. For most of the year, there are more small birds in coastal thicket than in fynbos.

The Cape of Good Hope section of Table Mountain National Park is home to several species of antelope. Bontebok and eland are easily seen, and [[red hartebeest]] can be seen in the grazing lawns in Smitswinkel Flats. Grey rhebok are less commonly seen and are scarce, but may be observed along the beach hills at Olifantsbos. Most visitors are unlikely to ever see either Cape grysbok or klipspringer.

The Cape of Good Hope section is home to four [[Cape mountain zebra]]. They might be seen by the attentive or lucky visitor, usually in Smitswinkel Flats.

[[File:Rock hyrax at Cape of Good Hope.jpg|thumb|[[Rock hyrax|Dassie]] at the Cape of Good Hope]]
There are a wealth of small animals such as [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[tortoise]]s and [[insect]]s. Small mammals include [[rock hyrax]], [[four-striped grass mouse]], [[marsh mongoose|water mongoose]], [[Cape clawless otter]] and [[fallow deer]].

The area offers excellent vantage points for whale watching. The [[southern right whale]] is the species most likely to be seen in [[False Bay]] between June and November. Other species are the [[humpback whale]] and [[Bryde's whale]]. [[pinniped|Seals]], [[dusky dolphin]]s and [[killer whale]]s have also been seen.

The strategic position of the Cape of Good Hope between two major ocean currents, ensures a rich diversity of marine life. There is a difference between the sea life west of Cape Point and that to the east due to the markedly differing sea temperatures.

The South African Marine Living Resources Act is strictly enforced throughout the [[Table Mountain National Park]], and especially in marine protected areas. Disturbance or removal of any marine organisms is strictly prohibited between Schusters Bay and Hoek van Bobbejaan, but is allowed in other areas during season and with relevant permits.

=== Chacma baboons ===
Chacma baboons (''[[Papio ursinus]]'') are the mammals most intimately associated with the Cape of Good Hope. Baboons inside the Cape of Good Hope section of the park are a major tourist attraction. There are 11 troops consisting of about 375 individuals throughout the entire Cape Peninsula. Six of these 11 troops either live entirely within the Cape of Good Hope section of the park, or use the section as part of their range. The Cape Point, Kanonkop, Klein Olifantsbos, and Buffels Bay troops live entirely inside the Cape of Good Hope section of the Park. The Groot Olifantsbos and Plateau Road troops range into the park.

Chacma baboons are widely distributed across southern Africa and are classified as ″least concern" in the {{IUCNlink|16022|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species}}. However, the South African Parks Department states in its publication ''Mountains in the Sea'' that the baboon population on the Cape is "critically endangered." This is due to habitat loss, genetic isolation, and conflicts with humans. Cape baboons have been eliminated from the majority of their range across the Cape Peninsula, and the Cape of Good Hope section of Table Mountain National Park provides a sanctuary for the troops that live within its boundaries. It provides relative safety from nearby towns, where people have killed many baboons after the baboons raid their houses looking for food. Baboons are also frequently injured or killed outside of the park by cars and by electrocution on power lines. Inside the park, some management policies such as allowing barbecues and picnics in the baboon home ranges cause detriment to the troops, as they become embroiled in conflicts with guests to the park.

== Flora ==
[[File:Flora at Cape Peninsula.JPG|thumb|[[Fynbos]] at Cape Peninsula]]
The Cape of Good Hope is an integral part of the [[Cape Floristic Kingdom]], the smallest but richest of the world's six floral kingdoms. This comprises a treasure trove of 1100 species of indigenous plants, of which a number are [[endemism|endemic]] (occur naturally nowhere else on earth). The main type of [[fynbos]] ("fine bush") vegetation at the Cape of Good Hope is [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]], an endangered vegetation type that is endemic to the Cape Peninsula. Coastal [[Hangklip Sand Fynbos]] grows on low-lying alkaline sands and, right by the sea, small patches of [[Cape Flats Dune Strandveld]] can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_2_PenSandFyn_2010-03.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111212124021/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_2_PenSandFyn_2010-03.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-12-12 |title=Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos.

Cape Town Biodiversity Factsheets }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristic fynbos plants include [[protea]]s, [[erica]]s (heath), and [[restio]]s (reeds). Some of the most striking and well-known members belong to the [[Proteacae]] family, of which up to 24 species occur. These include [[king protea]], [[Protea|sugarbush]], [[tree pincushion]] and golden [[cone bush]] (''[[Leucadendron]] laureolum'').

Many popular horticultural plants like [[pelargonium]]s, [[freesia]]s, [[Asteraceae|daisies]], [[lily|lilies]] and [[iris (plant)|iris]]es also have their origins in fynbos.

== Legends ==
[[File:Playa Dias, Cape Point, Sudáfrica, 2018-07-23, DD 93-99 PAN.jpg |center|thumb|860px|Cape of Good Hope panorama]]

*The Cape of Good Hope is the legendary home of ''[[The Flying Dutchman]]''. Crewed by tormented and damned ghostly sailors, it is doomed forever to beat its way through the adjacent waters without ever succeeding in rounding the headland.
*''[[Adamastor]]'' is a Greek-type mythological character invented by the Portuguese poet [[Luís de Camões]] in his epic poem ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' (first printed in 1572), as a symbol of the forces of nature Portuguese navigators had to overcome during their discoveries and more specifically of the dangers Portuguese sailors faced when trying to round the Cape of Storms.

The '''Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat''' ('''CTBUH''') is an international body in the field of tall buildings and [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] urban design.

==Ranking tall buildings==

{{see also|List of tallest buildings and structures in the world}}
The CTBUH ranks the [[height]] of buildings using three different methods:&lt;ref name="CTBUH Height"&gt;{{cite web|title=CTBUH Height Criteria|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/TallBuildings/HeightStatistics/Criteria/tabid/446/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|publisher=CTBUH|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Height to architectural top: This is the main criterion under which the CTBUH ranks the height of buildings. Heights are measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the top of the building, inclusive of spires but excluding items such as flagpoles and antennae.
#Highest occupied [[Storey|floor]]: Height to the floor level of the highest floor that is occupied by residents, workers or other building users on a consistent basis.
#Height to tip: Height to the highest point of the building, including antennae, flagpoles, and technical equipment.

A category measuring to the top of the roof was removed from the ranking criteria in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/NewsMedia/PR_091117_ChangeHeightCriteria/tabid/1273/language/en-US/Default.aspx|title= CTBUH changes height criteria, Burj Dubai height increases|date=17 November 2009|publisher=''Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat''|accessdate=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because flat-topped skyscrapers are not as common in the modern era as skyscrapers with intricate spire designs and parapet features atop their roofs, making it more difficult to define the roof of a building.

The CTBUH insist that a building should only be added to the official tallest list when it is (i) topped out structurally and architecturally, (ii) fully clad, and (iii) open for business, or at least partially open. This became the CTBUH official definition of a building's "completion".&lt;ref name=CTBUHhistoryofmeasuring&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerometta|first=Marshall|title=Height: The History of Measuring Tall Buildings|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/HistoryMeasuringTallBuildings/tabid/1320/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|publisher=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tallest database===
The CTBUH maintains an extensive database of the tallest buildings in the world, organized by various categories. Buildings under construction are also included, although not ranked until completion. The CTBUH also produces an annual list of the ten tallest buildings completed in that particular year. Topping the 2008 list was the {{convert|492|m|ft|0|adj=on}} [[Shanghai World Financial Center]] in [[Shanghai]], the then tallest building in the world according to the criteria of highest occupied floor, and home to the world's highest observation deck. Second on the 2008 list was the {{convert|363|m|ft|0|adj=on}} [[Almas Tower]] in [[Dubai]], third was the [[Minsheng Bank Building]] in [[Wuhan]] which stands at {{convert|331|m|ft|0}}, whilst fourth was [[The Address Downtown Burj Dubai]] ({{convert|306|m|ft|0}}). All in all, six of the ten tallest buildings completed in 2008 are located in Asia, three in the Middle East and one in North America.

==Events==
The CTBUH also hosts annual conferences and a World Congress every three to five years. The most recent World Congress was held in [[Shanghai]] between 19 and 21 September 2012.&lt;ref name=Shanghai2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Default.aspx?alias=www.ctbuh.org/shanghai2012 |title=Asia Ascending: CTBUH 2012 World Congress |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next World Congress will be held in [[Chicago]] between 28 October and 02 November 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbuh2019.com |title=Shanghai 2014 |publisher=Ctbuh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The CTBUH also bestows Tall Building Awards each year, with four regional awards to the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and Asia and Australasia. Among these four regional awards, one is given the "Best Tall Building Award Overall." There are also two lifetime achievement awards. Starting in 2010, these awards are presented at a symposium and dinner held on the Illinois Institute of Technology's campus.&lt;ref name=Awards2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Events/Conferences/Awards2011Symposium/tabid/2248/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |title=Awards 2011 Symposium |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the CTBUH added two new awards for Innovation and Performance.&lt;ref name=AwardsCriteria&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Awards/Criteria/tabid/432/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=CTBUH Awards Criteria |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In addition to the monthly newsletter and daily updated global news archive, the CTBUH publishes a quarterly CTBUH Journal.  The Journal includes peer-reviewed technical papers, in-depth project case studies,&lt;ref name=CaseStudies&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/Journal/CaseStudies/tabid/1090/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |title=CTBUH Journal Case Studies |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; book reviews,&lt;ref name=reviews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/Journal/Reviews/tabid/1091/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |title=CTBUH Reviews |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; interviews with prominent persons in the tall building industry,&lt;ref name=Interviews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/Journal/Interviews/tabid/1541/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |title=CTBUH Interviews |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much more.

The CTBUH also publishes guidebooks, reference manuals, and monographs related to the tall building industry.  In 2006 it published the book ''101 of the World's Tallest Buildings'' in conjunction with author and CTBUH member Georges Binder, a reference to 101 of the world's tallest skyscrapers. It includes photos, plans, details on architects, engineers and stakeholders, and comprehensive technical data on each building. Since 2008 it has published a ''Best Tall Buildings'' book to accompany that year's awards.&lt;ref name=AwardsBook&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Awards/AwardsBook/tabid/849/language/en-US/Default.aspx|title=Awards Book |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cross-boundary subsidies''' are caused by organisms or materials that cross or traverse habitat [[landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] boundaries, subsidizing the resident [[populations]]. The transferred organisms and materials may provide additional predators, prey, or nutrients to resident species, which can affect [[community]] and [[food web]] structure. Cross-boundary subsidies of materials and organisms occur in landscapes composed of different habitat patch types, and so depend on characteristics of those patches and on the boundaries in between them. Human alteration of the landscape, primarily through [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], has the potential to alter important cross-boundary subsidies to increasingly isolated habitat patches. Understanding how processes that occur outside of habitat patches can affect populations within them may be important to habitat management.

==Introduction and development of the concept==
The concept of cross-boundary subsidies developed out of a merging of ideas from the studies of [[landscape ecology]] and [[food web]] ecology. The ideas from landscape ecology allow the study of population, community, and food web dynamics to incorporate spatial relationships between landscape elements into an understanding of such dynamics (Polis et al. 1997).

Janzen (1986) first defined cross-boundary subsidies as a process whereby organisms that disperse from one patch into another impact resident organisms by providing increased food resources or opportunities for reproduction, thus serving as a subsidy to the residents. By this definition, only the cross-boundary movement of organisms is considered, but broader definitions of cross-boundary subsidies can also include materials such as nutrients and [[detritus]] (i.e. Marburg et al. 2006, Facelli and Pickett 1991).

Cross-boundary subsidies are a subset of the more general process of spatial subsidies (see Polis et al. 1997). Cross-boundary subsidies acknowledge the presence and role of the boundary between different habitat patches in mediating flows of organisms and materials. In contrast, spatial subsidies require only that external inputs of materials and organisms originate from outside the patch of interest.

===Conceptual models===
Few attempts have been made to combine landscape and [[food web]] ecology in such a way that explicitly recognizes the importance of cross-boundary subsidies and spatial features of the landscape on food web dynamics. Often, spatial subsidies are treated as subsidies that simply arrive from outside the patch of interest, not addressing the landscape patterns and processes that may affect the movement of these inputs, such as boundary characteristics and patch connectivity. Polis et al. (1997) published a thorough review of spatially subsidized food web dynamics, focusing on the effect of subsidies on population, [[community]], consumer-resource, and food web dynamics. One of the main conclusions was that subsidies of consumer species (organisms that eat other organisms to obtain energy) resulted in declines of food resources in the recipient patch. Callaway and Hastings (2002) built off Polis et al.’s conclusion with a model to show that subsidized consumers may not always drive down the resource in the recipient patch if consumers move between patches frequently. This might occur because consumers often move for reasons other than food resource acquisition.

Cadenasso et al. (2003) developed a framework for studying ecological boundaries, which has implications for understanding the dynamics of specific cross-boundary subsidies. The boundary is defined as the zone of the steepest gradient of change in some characteristic from one patch to another, such as rapidly decreasing light levels as habitat transitions from a field to a forest. In this framework, flows across variable landscapes are characterized by the type of flow (materials, energy, organisms, etc.), patch contrast (architecture, composition, process), and boundary structure (architecture, composition, symbolic and perceptual features). Considering a cross-boundary subsidy in terms of this framework shows how the boundary itself can mediate the subsidy. For example, Cadenasso and Pickett (2001) found that the decreased lateral vegetation at the boundary between a forest and field increased the amount of seeds transferred into the forest interior.

Another conceptual model that specifically considers cross-boundary subsidies is a model developed by Rand et al. (2006) of spillover from agriculture to wildland patches by predatory insects. The edge is permeable to insects that are habitat generalists and therefore capable of easily crossing the boundary between agriculture and wildland patches, whereas it is considered impermeable to insects that specialize on a particular patch type and cannot cross the boundary. In this model, edge permeability (habitat specialists vs. generalists), patch [[productivity]], and complementary resource use (use of resources obtained in both agriculture and wildland patches) determine the expected impact of cross-boundary subsidies by predatory insects (Fig. 1).

[[Image:Rand2006 adapted.JPG|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Conceptual model of cross-boundary subsidies of insect predators from agricultural to adjacent wildland patches. '''a.''' Habitat specialization, the boundary is a hard edge to predators such that they do not disperse to the wildland patch. '''b.''' Differences in [[productivity]], increased productivity in the agricultural patch allows a generalist insect predator to disperse to the lower productivity wildland patch. This is an example of a directional positive edge response. '''c.''' Complementary resource use, insect predator abundance is highest near the edge because they need resources present in both patches. This is an example of a reciprocal positive edge response.

==Relation to selected ecological concepts==

===Landscape ecology===
A spatial subsidy, in the context of landscape ecology, is a doner-mediated resource (nutrient, detritus, prey) which is passed from one habitat to a recipient (consumer) in a second habitat. As a result, the productivity of the recipient is increased (Polis et al., 1997). For example, a bear eats a salmon and acquires the resources that have passed through the marine environment across the habitat boundary and into a terrestrial environment.

===Source sink dynamics===
The idea of a subsidy of materials or organisms across a patch boundary affecting resident populations has clear parallels with [[source-sink dynamics]] (Fagan et al. 1999). In this theory, local populations are connected by dispersal, and the extinction of local populations can be prevented through immigration from neighboring patches (Pulliam 1988). In source-sink dynamics, it is assumed that individuals from more productive patches will move to less productive patches with unsustainable populations (Pulliam 1988). Many examples of cross-boundary subsidies can be thought of as exhibiting source-sink dynamics. Rand et al. (2006) found that insects in a high productivity agricultural patch were able to sustain local populations in a lower productivity wildland patch through continued dispersal from the agricultural patch. The effect of these subsidies to local patches can also impact populations of other species in the recipient [[food web]], because the subsidized population may compete with or prey upon other species more effectively than they would be able to without such an influx (Fagan et al. 1999).

===Biotic interactions and trophic structure===
Cross-boundary subsidies have important impacts on species interactions and food web dynamics. Subsidies of materials and organisms can affect all trophic, or feeding, levels of food webs either directly or indirectly. Inputs of nutrient and [[detritus]] from another patch generally increase the population growth of the resident producers (plants) and [[detritus|detritivores]] (Polis et al. 1997). Increased growth at the producer level can result in a bottom-up trophic effect, in which increases in [[populations]] at lower [[trophic level]]s support a higher population of consumers than would otherwise be possible in a closed system (Polis et al. 1997). [[allochthonous]] detrital inputs can also have strong impacts on food web dynamics over a variety of temporal scales, ranging from seconds to millennia, as in the case of [[fossil fuel]] formation from build-up of detritus over millennia (Moore et al. 2004).

====Coarse woody debris====
Many food webs rely on cross-boundary subsidies of detritus for sources of energy and nutrients (Huxel and McCann 1998). For example, a series of lakes in Wisconsin were examined for the presence of [[Coarse woody debris]] (CWD) and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape that might control its input to lakes. Coarse woody debris in these lakes is important for providing habitat and food resources for a variety of organisms including small fish (Werner and Hall 1988), algae, and detritivores (Bowen et al. 1998). Marburg et al. (2006) compared variation within and among lakes in CWD. They found that subsidies of CWD to lakes were lower when the lakes had human development along the shore. Development along the lakeshore can be thought of as an alteration to the characteristics of the patch boundary between the lake and forest. In this case, development decreased both forest density that is the source of CWD and also the permeability of the boundary to flows of CWD (Marburg et al. 2006).

====Predator-prey====
In addition to bottom-up effects, top-down effects may also occur due to cross-boundary subsidies. In top-down effects, subsidies of consumers at the top level of the food web control populations at lower levels more so than would be expected by only the action of resident consumers (Polis et al. 1997). Consumers that cross boundaries may have a greater effect on the recipient patch population if prey in the recipient patch have a lower population growth rate than prey in the source patch (Fagan et al. 1999, Rand et al. 2006). Thus, cross-boundary subsidies may alter predator-prey/competitive interactions that can result in a disproportionate impact on the communities of the recipient patch.

====Trophic cascade====
In subsidizing top trophic levels, effects may also be felt at all lower trophic levels in a phenomenon known as a [[trophic cascade]]. An example of a trophic cascade that also acted as a cross-boundary subsidy is illustrated in a study by Knight et al. (2005) in which changes in the trophic structure of one ecosystem resulted in an effect that cascaded to the adjacent ecosystem. In ponds containing fish, dragonfly larvae were kept to a minimum by fish predation. The resulting low density of adult dragonfly predators led to a high density of bee pollinators. With fish present in adjacent ponds, bees were able to pollinate more flowers in the adjacent upland ecosystem than they were when fish were absent. The dragonfly population could be thought of as subsidized by the absence of fish predation. That subsidy was then transferred across the pond-upland boundary by adult dragonfly movement to affect the interaction between bee pollinators and plants.

===Subsidy cascade===
Native species that forage on resources that don't originate in their same habitat. This may increase their local abundances thereby affecting other species in the ecosystem. For example, Luskin et al (2017) found that native animals living protected primary rainforest in Malaysia found food subsidies in neighboring oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=9 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsidy allowed native animal populations to increase, which then triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on forest tree community. Specically, crop-raiding wild boar (Sus scofa) built thousands of nests from the forest understory vegatation and this caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over a 24-year study period. Such cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

==Human activities affecting cross-boundary subsidies==

===Agriculture ===
Native species that forage in farmland may increase their local abundances thereby affecting adjacent ecosystems within their landscape. For example, Luskin et al (2017) used two decades of ecological data from a protected primary rainforest in Malaysia to illustrate how subsidies from neighboring oil palm plantations triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on natural habitats located &gt;1.3 km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=8 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that (i) oil palm fruit drove 100-fold increases in crop-raiding native wild boar (Sus scrofa), (ii) wild boar used thousands of understory plants to construct birthing nests in the pristine forest interior, and (iii) nest building caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over the 24-year study period. The long-term, landscape-scale indirect effects from agriculture suggest its full ecological footprint may be larger in extent than is currently recognized. Cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

===Fragmentation===
As landscapes become increasingly fragmented due to human activity, the influence of patch boundaries on individual patches becomes relatively more important (Murcia 1995). [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] can both cut off necessary subsidies to patches and increase the magnitude of subsidies from adjacent patches. For example, in a study of fragmentation of wildlands in an agriculturally dominated landscape, subsidies of habitat specialist insects to wildland patches were prevented by surrounding small, wildland patches with inhospitable agricultural land. This isolation reduced the potential for [[gene flow]] and long-term persistence of the population. Subsidies of other insects that specialized on agricultural crops were increased to wildland [[populations]], increasing their effect on the resident wildland species (Duelli 1990).

===Alteration of patch and boundary characteristics===
Changing the internal structure and composition of a patch may substantially alter cross-boundary subsidies. [[Logging]] may temporarily increase subsidies of nutrients and detritus to adjacent streams (Likens et al. 1970). [[Invasive species]] introduced to agricultural patches may act as a subsidy to adjacent wildland invasive populations, preventing native species establishment, even within the protected area (Janzen 1983).

====Marine systems====
Human alterations of patch characteristics may also curtail cross-boundary subsidies such as [[overfishing]] in marine systems, which may drastically reduce potentially crucial marine subsidies of organisms to freshwater and riparian systems (Zhang et al. 2003). For example, Helfield and Naiman (2002) found that riparian trees in [[Alaska]] obtain 24-26% of their nitrogen from marine sources, transferred from migrating [[salmon]]. In this system, [[salmon]] that feed in the ocean, incorporating marine nitrogen into their biomass, later return to their natal small streams where they spawn and die. [[Salmon]] carcasses transferred across the stream-riparian zone boundary by terrestrial predators or flooding events subsidized growth of terrestrial plants. Thus, marine overfishing may affect the productivity of Alaskan forests that depend on subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen.

As discussed above, cross-boundary subsidies depend on the characteristics of the patch boundary. Human-induced changes in these characteristics can affect boundary permeability to certain organisms or materials. For example, a cross-boundary subsidy of leaf litter from forest to an adjacent open field may be attenuated at the boundary if a road is present, making the boundary less permeable to flows of leaf litter (Facelli and Pickett 1991).

==Implications for management and future research needs==
Habitat management might benefit from recognizing the effect that humans may have on both individual patches and on the dynamics between patches. In such cases, managers may need to focus on patterns and processes that occur outside of their patch of interest, as these factors may also be important to internal [[population dynamics]]. An understanding of boundary features that influence the various flows of interest is necessary in managing for those flows.

The implications of [[invasive species]] and the use of [[biological control]] agents may also be closely related to the idea of cross-boundary subsidies. Introducing species into one patch for [[biocontrol]] may have unforeseen consequences on dynamics within adjacent patches.

Other fields, such as public policy, can also benefit from considering cross-boundary subsidies. For example, governments often provide [[subsidy|financial subsidies]] to [[fisheries]], which have a negative effect on those ecosystems by encouraging overfishing (Munro and Sumaila 2002). Understanding what processes affect how those financial resources flow across that particular government-industry boundary is important to the maintenance of marine [[food web]]s. Considering cross-boundary effects will be essential to a complete understanding of potential consequences of human action on the landscape.

'''Cuxhaven''' ({{IPA-de|kʊksˈhaːfən}}) is an independent town and seat of the [[Cuxhaven (district)|Cuxhaven district]], in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]]. The town includes the northernmost point of Lower Saxony. It is situated on the shore of the [[North Sea]] at the mouth of the [[Elbe]] River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cuxhaven |volume=7 |page=677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuxhaven has a footprint of {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} (east–west) by {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} (north–south). Its town quarters [[Duhnen]], [[Döse]] and [[Sahlenburg]] are especially popular vacation spots on the [[North Sea]] and home to about 52,000 residents.

Cuxhaven is home to an important fisherman's wharf and ship registration point for [[Hamburg]] as well as the [[Kiel Canal]] until 2008. Tourism is also of great importance. The city and its precursor Ritzebüttel belonged to Hamburg from the 13th century until 1937. The island of [[Neuwerk]], a Hamburg dependency, is located just northwest of Cuxhaven in the North Sea. The city's symbol, known as the [[Kugelbake]], is a beacon once used as a [[lighthouse]]; the wooden landmark on the mouth of the Elbe marks the boundary between the river and the North Sea and also adorns the city's coat of arms.

== History ==
[[File:Cuxhaven 07-2016 photo04 Water tower.jpg|thumb|left|Water tower in Cuxhaven.]]

Ritzebüttel, today a part of Cuxhaven, belonged to the [[Land of Hadeln]], first an exclave of the [[Saxe-Wittenberg|younger Duchy of Saxony]] and after its de facto dynastic partition in 1296 of the [[Saxe-Lauenburg|Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg]], established ''[[de jure]]'' in 1260. In 1394 the city of [[Hamburg]] conquered the fortress of Ritzebüttel and made it its stronghold to protect the estuary of the river [[Elbe]], which connects that city with the open sea.

The [[Hamburg America Line]] built a large [[ocean liner]] terminal at Cuxhaven in 1900. Connected directly to Hamburg by a dedicated railway line and station, it served as the major departure point for German and European emigrants until 1969 when ocean liner travel ceased. The ornate assembly hall and associated buildings survived wartime damage and peacetime demolition to be restored in 1998 for use as a museum and [[cruise ship]] terminal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hapag-hallen-cuxhaven-eng.jimdo.com/history/ Hapag Halle Museum Cuxhaven]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 1907 Cuxhaven gained city status within the state of Hamburg. In 1937 Cuxhaven became an [[Independent city|urban district]] of the [[Stade (region)|Stade Region]] within the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]] by the [[Greater Hamburg Act]]. In 1972 some municipalities of the neighboured rural district of ''Land of Hadeln'' were incorporated into the urban district of Cuxhaven. In 1977 Cuxhaven lost the status as urban district and was integrated into the new rural [[Cuxhaven (district)|District of Cuxhaven]], being its capital.

During the [[First World War]] [[Nordholz Naval Airbase|Nordholz Airbase]] with its [[airship hangar]]s, near [[Nordholz]] to the south of Cuxhaven, was one of the major German naval [[airship]] stations. On Christmas Day 1914 it was attacked by Royal Navy seaplanes in the [[Cuxhaven Raid]].

Between 1945 and 1964 various [[Rocket experiments in the area of Cuxhaven|experiments in rocketry]] were performed near Cuxhaven.

=== Tourism ===
&lt;div style="float:right;clear:right;"&gt;[[File:Cuxhaven 07-2016 photo19 port area.jpg|thumb|The fishing harbour by the Fischmarkt]]
[[File:Cuxhaven 07-2016 photo29 Outer Elbe.jpg|thumb|A shrimp cutter returns]]
[[File:Cuxhaven Bahnhof Westseite 2008 by-RaBoe 02.jpg|thumb|Cuxhaven station from the west 2008]]&lt;/div&gt;
The origins of tourism go back to the year 1816 when a seaside resort was founded in Cuxhaven. Since 1964 Cuxhaven has been a state-recognized climate seaside resort (''Seeheilbad'') and centre of the so-called holiday region of [[Cuxland]].

== Geographical and cultural background ==
[[File:map of cuxhaven hamburg lauenburg lubeck.png|thumb|left|Elbe estuary.]]

The town is served by [[Cuxhaven station]].

The island of [[Neuwerk]] is situated {{convert|8|km|0}} off the coast from Cuxhaven. At [[tide|low tide]] the water recedes so far from the coast that the island can be reached either by [[mudflat hiking]] or by [[carriage|horse carriage]].

A modern landmark of Cuxhaven is the [[Friedrich-Clemens-Gerke Tower]], a telecommunication tower built of concrete, which is not accessible to the public. It is not really a landmark, for all the cities in Germany have a similar tower.

The [[high test peroxide]] ('''HTP''') submarine [[U 1407]], was raised from where she had been scuttled in Cuxhaven after [[World War II|WWII]] and rebuilt by the British, being commissioned as [[HMS Meteorite|HMS ''Meteorite'']]. It was the catalyst for a series of German-made [[Air-independent propulsion]] submarines such as the [[Type 212 submarine]] and [[Type 214 submarine]].

The '''Dimensionally Extended nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM)''' is a [[topological]] [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]
and a [[Specification (technical standard)|standard]] used to describe the [[spatial relation]]s of
two regions (two [[2D geometric model|geometries in two-dimensions]], '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),
in [[Geometry]], [[Point-set topology]], [[Geospatial topology]], and fields related to [[Spatial analysis|computer spatial analysis]].
Since the spatial relations expressed by the model are topological they are invariant to [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] transformations.

The matrix provides an approach for classifying geometry relations.  Roughly speaking, with a true/false matrix domain,
there are 512 possible 2D topologic relations, that can be grouped into ''binary classification schemes''.
For English speakers, there are about 10 schemes (relations) that have a name that reflects their semantics (e.g. "Intersects", "Touches", "Equals", and others.) When testing two geometries against a scheme, the result of this test is a '''''spatial predicate''''' named by the scheme.

The model was developed by Clementini and others&lt;ref&gt;

It has been used as a basis for standards of ''[[Information retrieval|queries]]'' and ''[[First-order logic|assertions]]'' in [[geographic information systems]] (GIS) and [[spatial database]]s.

== Matrix model ==
The '''DE-9IM''' model is based on a 3×3 intersection [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with the form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{DE9IM}(a,b) = \begin{bmatrix}
\dim(I(a) \cap I(b)) &amp; \dim(I(a) \cap B(b)) &amp; \dim(I(a) \cap E(b)) \\
\dim(B(a) \cap I(b)) &amp; \dim(B(a) \cap B(b)) &amp; \dim(B(a) \cap E(b))\\
\dim(E(a) \cap I(b)) &amp; \dim(E(a) \cap B(b)) &amp; \dim(E(a) \cap E(b))
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where {{tmath|\dim}} is the maximum number of [[dimension]]s of the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] (∩) of the [[Interior of a manifold|interior]] (I), [[Boundary of a manifold|boundary]] (B), and [[Exterior (topology)|exterior]] (E) of geometries ''a'' and ''b''.

Note that in this article the words ''interior'' and ''boundary'' are used in the sense used in algebraic topology and manifold theory, not in the sense used in general topology: e.g. by the interior of a line segment we mean the line segment without its endpoints and by its boundary, the two endpoints (in the general topology sense, the interior of a line segment in the plane is empty and the line segment is its own boundary).

In the notation of topological space operators, the matrix elements can be expressed also as
{{NumBlk|:|{{math|1=''I''(''a'')=''a''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''B''(''a'')=∂''a'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''E''(''a'')=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''e''&lt;/sup&gt;}}|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The dimension of [[empty set]]s (∅) are denoted as −1 or {{mono|F}} (false). The dimension of non-empty sets (¬∅) are denoted with the maximum number of dimensions of the intersection, specifically {{mono|0}} for [[Point (geometry)|points]], {{mono|1}} for [[Line (geometry)|lines]], {{mono|2}} for [[area]]s.  Then, the [[Data domain|domain]] of the model is {{mset|1={{mono|0}},{{mono|1}},{{mono|2}},{{mono|F}} }}.

A simplified version of {{tmath|\dim(x)}} values are obtained mapping the values {{mset|1={{mono|0,1,2}} }} to {{mono|T}} (true), so using the [[boolean domain]] {{mset|1={{mono|T}},{{mono|F}} }}.  The matrix, denoted with operators, can be expressed as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{bin}(\operatorname{DE9IM}(a,b)) = \operatorname{9IM}(a,b) = \begin{bmatrix}
a^o  \cap b^o \ne \emptyset   &amp;   a^o \cap \partial{b} \ne \emptyset &amp; a^o \cap b^e \ne \emptyset \\
\partial{a} \cap b^o\ne\emptyset   &amp;    \partial{a} \cap \partial{b}\ne\emptyset  &amp;  \partial{a} \cap b^e\ne\emptyset \\
a^e \cap b^o\ne\emptyset    &amp;    a^e \cap \partial{b}\ne\emptyset   &amp;   a^e  \cap b^e\ne\emptyset
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Both matrix forms, with dimensional and boolean domains, can be [[Serialization|serialized]] as "'''''DE-9IM''' string codes''", which represent them in a single-line string pattern. Since 1999 the ''string codes'' have a [[#Standards|standard]]&lt;ref name="firstStd"&gt;The "[[OpenGIS]] Simple Features Specification For SQL", [http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=829 Revision 1.1], was released at May 5, 1999. It was the first international standard to establish the format conventions for ''DE-9IM string codes'', and the names of the "Named Spatial Relationship predicates based on the DE-9IM" (see section with this title).&lt;/ref&gt; format.

For output checking or pattern analysis, a matrix value (or a string code) can be checked by a "[[Mask (computing)|mask]]": a desired output value with optional [[asterisk]] symbols as [[Wildcard character|wildcards]] — that is, "{{mono|*}}" indicating output positions that the designer does not care about (free values or "don't-care positions").
Then, the mask's domain is {{mset|1={{mono|0}},{{mono|1}},{{mono|2}},{{mono|F}},{{mono|*}} }}, or {{mset|1={{mono|T}},{{mono|F}},{{mono|*}} }} for the boolean form.

The simpler models ''4-Intersection'' and ''9-Intersection'' were proposed before '''DE-9IM''' for expressing ''spatial relations''&lt;ref name="4vs9"&gt;M. J. Egenhofer, J. Sharma, and D. Mark (1993) "[http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~max/4Vs9.pdf A Critical Comparison of the 4-Intersection and 9-Intersection Models for Spatial Relations: Formal Analysis]", In: [http://mapcontext.com/autocarto/proceedings/auto-carto-11/index.html Auto-Carto XI].&lt;/ref&gt; (and originated the terms ''4IM'' and ''9IM'').  They can be used instead of the '''DE-9IM''' to optimize computation when input conditions satisfy specific constraints.

Reading from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, the '''DE-9IM'''(''a'',''b'') string code is '{{mono|'''212101212'''}}', the compact representation of {{tmath|1=II=2,\,IB=1,\,IE=2,\,BI=1,\,BB=0,\,BE=1,\,EI=2,\,EB=1,\,EE=2}}.

== Spatial predicates ==
'''Spatial predicates''' are [[Binary relation|binary]] invariant ''space relations'' based on the '''DE-9IM'''.  For ease of use "named spatial predicates" have been defined for some common relations.

The ''spatial predicate'' [[Subroutine|functions]] that can be derived (expressed by masks) from '''DE-9IM''' include:&lt;ref name="sdh1990"/&gt;

Notice that:

* The ''topologically equal'' definition does not imply that they have the same points or even that they are of the same class.
* The output of {{tmath|\operatorname{DE-9IM}(a,b)}} have the information contained in a list of all interpretable predicates about geometries ''a'' and ''b''.
* All predicates are computed by masks. Only ''Crosses'' and ''Overlaps'' have additional conditions about {{tmath|\dim(a)}} and {{tmath|\dim(b)}}.&lt;!--
** ''Overlaps'': ''da=db''. If the geometries have different dimensions (ex. surface and line), the predicate is false.
** ''Crosses'':  ''(da,db)'' is in {(0,1); (0,2); (1,2); (1,0); (1,2); (2,1); (1,1)}, for any other combination of dimensions the predicate is false.&lt;ref name="ST_Crosses" /&gt;  There are also mask selection rules: &lt;code&gt;T*T******&lt;/code&gt; for {(0,1); (0,2); (1,2)} situations, &lt;code&gt;T*****T**&lt;/code&gt; for {(1,0); (1,2); (2,1)} situations, and &lt;code&gt;0********&lt;/code&gt; for (1,1) situations.
--&gt;

* All mask string codes end with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;.  This is because ''EE'' is trivially true, and thus provides no useful information&lt;!--, it is the opposite of ''II''? --&gt;.
* The ''Equals'' mask, &lt;code&gt;T*F**FFF*&lt;/code&gt;, is the "merge" of ''Contains'' (&lt;code&gt;T*****FF*&lt;/code&gt;) and ''Within'' (&lt;code&gt;T*F**F***&lt;/code&gt;): {{math|(''II'' ∧ ~''EI'' ∧ ~''EB'') ∧ (''II'' ∧ ~''IE'' ∧ ~''BE'')}}.
*  There are no mask for situations involving complex types, like a Point/Multipoint situation. Example: with the above definition the code &lt;code&gt;0FFFFF0F2&lt;/code&gt; have the ''Crosses'' predicate (satisfies the mask &lt;code&gt;T*****T**&lt;/code&gt;), but by a more rigorous definition, like the ''JTS'' definition, not.&lt;ref name="test1case4"&gt;JTS test case of "point A within one of B points", http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/tests/Run1Case4.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mask &lt;code&gt;T*****FF*&lt;/code&gt; occurs in the definition of both ''Contains'' and ''Covers''.  ''Covers'' is a more inclusive relation. In particular, unlike ''Contains'' it does not distinguish between points in the boundary and in the interior of geometries. For most situations, ''Covers'' should be used in preference to ''Contains''.
* Similarly, the mask &lt;code&gt;T*F**F***&lt;/code&gt; occurs in the definition of both ''Within'' and ''CoveredBy''.  For most situations, ''CoveredBy'' should be used in preference to ''Within''.

=== Interpretation ===
[[File:TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png|thumb|400px|Examples of spatial relations.]]
The choice of terminology and semantics for the spatial predicates is based on reasonable conventions and the tradition of topological studies.&lt;ref name="sdh1990"/&gt;
Relationships such as ''Intersects'', ''Disjoint'', ''Touches'', ''Within'', ''Equals''  (between two geometries ''a'' and ''b'')  have an obvious semantic:&lt;ref name="davis2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cafrca"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = G. | last1 = Câmara | first2 = U. M. | last2 = Freitas | first3 = M. A. | last3 = Casanova | year = 1995 | title = Fields and Objects Algebras for GIS Operations | citeseerx = 10.1.1.17.991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; ''Equals'':   ''a'' = ''b''  that is  (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a'') ∧ (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b'')
; ''Within'':   ''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a''
; ''Intersects'':   ''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅
; ''Touches'': (''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅) ∧ (''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; = ∅)

The predicates ''Contains'' and ''Within''  have subtle aspects to their definition which are contrary to intuition.
For example,&lt;ref name="davis2007"/&gt;  a line ''L'' which is completely contained in the boundary of a polygon ''P'' is ''not'' considered to be contained in ''P''.   This quirk can be expressed as "Polygons do not contain their boundary". This issue is caused by the final clause of the ''Contains'' definition above: "at least one point of the interior of B lies in the interior of A".  For this case, the predicate ''Covers''  has more intuitive semantics (see definition), avoiding boundary considerations.

For better understanding, the dimensionality of inputs can be used as justification for a gradual introduction of semantic complexity:

|''Touches'' is a refinement of ''Intersects'', about "boundaries" only. ''Crosses'' is about "only one point".
|}

=== Coverage on possible matrix results ===
The number of possible results in a boolean ''9IM'' matrix is 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;=512, and in a '''DE-9IM''' matrix is 3&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;=6561. The probability of one of these results come to satisfy a specific predicate is determined as following,
{{aligned table|class=wikitable|cols=2|row1header=y|col1style=text-align:right;
|Probability|Name
| 93.7% |''Intersects''
| 43.8% |''Touches''
| 25% |''Crosses'' (for valid inputs, 0% otherwise)
| 23.4% |''Covers'' and ''CoveredBy''
| 12.5% |''Contains'', ''Overlaps'' (for valid inputs, 0% otherwise) and ''Within''
| 6.3%   |''Disjoint''
| 3.1%   |''Equals''
}}
On usual applications the geometries intersects ''a priori'', and the other relations are checked.

The composite predicates "''Intersects'' OR ''Disjoint''" and "''Equals'' OR ''Different''"  have the sum 100% (always true predicates),
but "''Covers'' OR ''CoveredBy''" have 41%, that is not the sum, because they are not logical complements neither independent relations; idem "''Contains'' OR ''Within''", that have 21%. The sum 25%+12.5%=37.5% is obtained when ignoring overlapping of lines in "''Crosses''  OR ''Overlaps''", because the valid input sets are disjoints.

== Queries and assertions ==
The ''DE-9IM'' offers a full descriptive assertion about the two input geometries. It is a mathematical function that represents a [[Functional completeness|complete set]] of all possible relations about two entities, like a [[Truth table]], the [[Three-way comparison]], a [[Karnaugh map#2-variable map examples|Karnaugh map]] or a [[Venn diagram]]. Each output value is like a truth table line, that represent relations of specific inputs.

As illustrated above, the output '212101212' resulted from ''DE-9IM''(''a'',''b'') is a complete description of all topologic relations between specific geometries ''a'' and ''b''. It say to us that {{tmath|1=II=2,\,IB=1,\,IE=2,\,BI=1,\,BB=0,\,BE=1,\,EI=2,\,EB=1,\,EE=2}}.

By other hand, if we check predicates like ''Intersects''(''a'',''b'') or  ''Touches''(''a'',''b'') — for the same example we have "''Intersects''={{mono|true}} and ''Touches''={{mono|true}}" — it is an incomplete description of "all topologic relations".
Predicates also do not say any thing about the dimensionality of the geometries (it doesn't matter if ''a'' and ''b'' are lines, areas or points).

This independence of geometry-type and the lack of [[Completeness (logic)|completeness]], on ''predicates'', are useful for [[Query language|general queries]] about two geometries:
:{|border="0" class="wikitable"
|
!interior/boundary/exterior semantic
!usual semantic
|-
!Assertions
|style="background-color:#DDC" align="center"|'''more descriptive'''&lt;br&gt;  " ''a'' and ''b'' have {{math|1=DE-9IM(''a'',''b'')='212101212'}} "
|style="background-color:#DDC" align="center"|'''less descriptive'''&lt;br&gt; " ''a Touches b'' "
|-
!Queries

|style="background-color:#DDC" align="center"|'''more general'''&lt;br&gt;" Show all pair of geometries where ''Touches''(''a'',''b'') "
|}

For usual applications, the use of ''spatial predicates'' also is justified by being more [[Human-readable medium|human-readable]] than ''DE-9IM'' descriptions: a typical user  have better intuition about predicates (than a set of interiors/border/exterior intersections).

Predicates have useful [[Semantics (computer science)|semantic]] into usual applications, so it is useful the translation of a ''DE-9IM'' description into a list of all associated predicates,&lt;ref&gt;A [https://github.com/ppKrauss/postgis-st-relate-summary ''DE-9IM'' translator], of all associated predicates of a spatial relation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SDO_RELATE"&gt;Note. The [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14255/sdo_operat.htm#i78531 Oracle's spatial funcion {{mono|SDO_RELATE()}}] do only a partial translation, internally, offering to user a mask for a or-list of predicates to be checked, instead the DE-9IM string.&lt;/ref&gt; that is like a [[Type conversion|casting process]] between the two different semantic types. Examples:

* The string codes "{{mono|0F1F00102}}" and "{{mono|0F1FF0102}}" have the semantic of "''Intersects &amp; Crosses &amp; Overlaps''".
* The string code "{{mono|1FFF0FFF2}}" have the semantic of "''Equals''".
* The string codes "{{mono|F01FF0102}}",  "{{mono|FF10F0102}}", "{{mono|FF1F00102}}", "{{mono|F01FFF102}}",  and "{{mono|FF1F0F1F2}}" have the semantic of "''Intersects &amp; Touches''".

=== Standards ===
The [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]  (OGC) has standardized the typical spatial predicates (Contains, Crosses, Intersects, Touches, etc.) as boolean functions, and the DE-9IM model,&lt;ref name="ogs1"&gt;"OpenGIS Implementation Specification for Geographic information - Simple feature access - Part 2: SQL option", [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]], http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs&lt;/ref&gt; as a function that returns a string (the DE-9IM code), with domain of {{mset|1={{mono|0}},{{mono|1}},{{mono|2}},{{mono|F}} }},  meaning {{mono|0}}=point, {{mono|1}}=line, {{mono|2}}=area, and {{mono|F}}="empty set". This DE-9IM string code is a standardized format for data interchange.

The [[Simple feature access]] (ISO 19125) standard,&lt;ref name="SFS2007"&gt;
[[Open Geospatial Consortium|Open Geospatial Consortium Inc.]] (2007), "OpenGIS® Implementation Standard for Geographic
information - Simple feature access - Part 2: SQL option", [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs OGC document] ''06-104r4'' version 1.2.1 (review of 2010-08-04).&lt;/ref&gt; in the chapter 7.2.8, "SQL routines on type Geometry", recommends as supported routines the ''SQL/MM Spatial''&lt;ref&gt;ISO 13249-3 Part 3: Spatial, summarized in  [http://www.sigmod.org/record/issues/0112/standards.pdf SQL Multimedia and Application Packages (SQL/MM)].&lt;/ref&gt; (ISO 13249-3 Part 3: Spatial)  ''ST_Dimension'', ''ST_GeometryType'', ''ST_IsEmpty'', ''ST_IsSimple'', ''ST_Boundary'' for all Geometry Types.
The same standard, consistent with the definitions of relations in "Part 1, Clause 6.1.2.3"
of the SQL/MM, recommends (shall be supported) the function labels: ''ST_Equals'', ''ST_Disjoint'', ''ST_Intersects'', ''ST_Touches'', ''ST_Crosses'', ''ST_Within'', ''ST_Contains'', ''ST_Overlaps'' and ''ST_Relate''.

The DE-9IM in the OGC standards use the following definitions of Interior and Boundary, for the main OGC standard geometry types:&lt;ref&gt;"Encyclopedia of GIS", edited by Shashi Shekhar and Hui Xiong. SpringerScience 2008. pg. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation and practical use ===
Most spatial databases, such as [[PostGIS]], implements the ''DE-9IM()'' model by the standard functions:&lt;ref&gt;
ST_Relate() [[PostGIS]] function  [http://www.postgis.org/docs/ST_Relate.html online documentation].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;code&gt;ST_Relate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ST_Equals&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ST_Intersects&lt;/code&gt;, etc. The function &lt;code&gt;ST_Relate(a,b)&lt;/code&gt; outputs the standard OGC's ''DE-9IM string code''.

Examples: two geometries, ''a'' and ''b'', that intersects and touches with a point (for instance with {{tmath|1=\dim(B(a)\cap I(b))=0}} and {{tmath|1=\dim(I(a)\cap I(b))=F}}), can be &lt;code&gt;ST_Relate(a,b)='FF1F0F1F2'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ST_Relate(a,b)='FF10F0102'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ST_Relate(a,b)='FF1F0F1F2'&lt;/code&gt;. It also satisfies &lt;code&gt;ST_Intersects(a,b)=true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ST_Touches(a,b)=true&lt;/code&gt;.
When &lt;code&gt;ST_Relate(a,b)='0FFFFF212'&lt;/code&gt;, the returned DE-9IM code have the semantic of "Intersects(a,b) &amp; Crosses(a,b) &amp; Within(a,b) &amp; CoveredBy(a,b)", that is, returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; on the boolean expression &lt;code&gt;ST_Intersects(a,b) AND ST_Crosses(a,b) AND ST_Within(a,b) AND  ST_Coveredby(a,b)&lt;/code&gt;.

The use of {{mono|ST_Relate()}} is faster than direct computing of a set of correspondent predicates.&lt;ref name="PostGISch4"&gt;[http://www.postgis.org/docs/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html#DE-9IM Chapter 4. Using PostGIS: Data Management and Queries]&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases where the use of {{mono|ST_Relate()}} is the unique access form of a complex predicate — see the example of the code &lt;code&gt;0FFFFF0F2&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref name="test1case4"/&gt; of a point that not "crosses" a multipoint (a object that is a set of points), but predicate ''Crosses'' (when defined by a mask) returns ''true''.

It is usual also to [[Function overloading|overload]] the {{mono|ST_Relate()}} by a mask parameter,
or use a returned {{mono|ST_Relate(a,b)}} string into the {{mono|ST_RelateMatch()}} function.&lt;ref&gt;
ST_RelateMatch() [[PostGIS]] function  [http://www.postgis.org/docs/ST_RelateMatch.html online documentation].&lt;/ref&gt;
When using {{mono|ST_Relate(a,b,mask)}}, it returns a boolean. Examples:
* &lt;code&gt;ST_Relate(a,b,'*FF*FF212')&lt;/code&gt; returns ''true'' when &lt;code&gt;ST_Relate(a,b)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0FFFFF212&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;01FFFF212&lt;/code&gt;, and returns ''false''  when &lt;code&gt;01FFFF122&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0FF1FFFFF&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;ST_RelateMatch('0FFFFF212','*FF*FF212')&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ST_RelateMatch('01FFFF212','TTF*FF212')&lt;/code&gt; are ''true'',  &lt;code&gt;ST_RelateMatch('01FFFF122','*FF*FF212')&lt;/code&gt; is ''false''.

== Synonyms  ==
* "Egenhofer-Matrix" is a synonym for the ''9IM'' 3x3 matrix of boolean domain.&lt;ref name="encygis"&gt;"Encyclopedia of GIS", S. Shekhar, H. Xiong. {{ISBN|978-0-387-35975-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Clementini-Matrix" is a synonym for the [[#Matrix_model|DE-9IM]] 3x3 matrix of {{mset|1={{mono|0}},{{mono|1}},{{mono|2}},{{mono|F}} }} domain.&lt;ref name="encygis"/&gt;
* "Egenhofer operators" and "Clementini operators" are sometimes a reference to matrix elements as ''II'', ''IE'', etc. that can be used in boolean operations. Example: the predicate "''G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' contains ''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''"  can be expressed by "{{math|{{angbr|''G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''{{!}} II ∧ ~EI ∧ ~EB {{!}}''G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}}", that can be translated to mask syntax, &lt;code&gt;T*****FF*&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[#Spatial_predicates|Predicate]]s "meets" is a synonym for ''touches''; "inside" is a synonym for ''within''
* Oracle's&lt;ref name="SDO_RELATE"/&gt; "ANYINTERACT" is  a synonym for ''intersects'' and  "OVERLAPBDYINTERSECT" is  a synonym for ''overlaps''.  Its  "OVERLAPBDYDISJOINT" does not have a corresponding named predicate.
* In [[Region connection calculus]]  operators offer some synonyms for [[#Spatial_predicates|predicate]]s: ''disjoint'' is DC (disconnected), ''touches'' is EC (externally connected), ''equals'' is EQ. Other, like ''Overlaps'' as PO (partially overlapping),  need context analysis or composition.&lt;ref&gt;"Multidimensional Region Connection Calculus" (2017), http://qrg.northwestern.edu/qr2017/papers/QR2017_paper_8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Identification of Relations in Region Connection Calculus: 9-Intersection Reduced to 3+ -Intersection Predicates" (2013), https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8184/abc9b25ed340f9195cc904249bda415bb0c3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Different conventions exist around the world for '''date and time representation''', both written and spoken.

== Differences ==
Differences can exist in:
*The [[calendar]] that is used.
*The order in which the [[year]], [[month]] and [[day]] are represented. (Year-month-day, day-month-year, and month-day-year are the common combinations.)
*How weeks are identified (see [[seven-day week]])
*Whether written months are identified by name, by number (1–12), or by Roman numeral (I-XII). 
*Whether the [[24-hour clock]], [[12-hour clock]] or [[6-hour clock]] is used.
*The [[punctuation]] used to separate elements in all-numeric [[calendar date|dates]] and [[time]]s.
*Which days are considered the [[weekend]].

== ISO 8601 ==
{{Main|ISO 8601}}
International standard [[ISO 8601]] (''Representation of dates and times'') defines unambiguous written all-numeric [[big-endian]] formats for dates, such as 1999-12-31 for 31 December 1999, and time, such as 23:59:58 for 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 58 seconds.

These standard notations have been [[ISO 8601 usage|adopted by many countries as a national standard]], e.g., [[British Standard|BS]] [[European Standard|EN]] 28601 in the UK and similarly in other EU countries, [[ANSI]] INCITS 30-1997 (R2008), and [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] PUB 4-2 in the United States (FIPS PUB 4-2 withdrawn in United States 2008-09-02).&lt;ref name="itl.nist.gov"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/itl/upload/Withdrawn-FIPS-by-Numerical-Order-Index.pdf itl.nist.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; They are, in particular, increasingly widely used in computer applications, since the most to least significant digit order provides a simple method to order and sort time readings.

==Local conventions==
{{See also|Category:Date and time representation by country}}

===Date===
{{main|Date format by country}}

The little-endian format (day, month, year) is the most popular format worldwide, followed by the big-endian format (year, month, day)&lt;ref&gt;[[Date format by country]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular inline|date=November 2017}}. Dates may be written partly in Roman numerals (i.e. the month){{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} or written out partly or completely in words in the local language.

===Time===
The [[24-hour clock]] enjoys broad everyday usage in most non-English speaking countries, at least when time is written or displayed. In some regions, for example where German, French and Romanian are spoken, the 24-hour clock can be used today even when speaking casually, while in other countries the [[12-hour clock]] is used more often in spoken form.

In most English-speaking regions, particularly the [[United States]] and the [[Commonwealth Realms|Commonwealth]], the 12-hour clock is the predominant form of stating the time, with the 24-hour clock used in contexts where unambiguity and accurate timekeeping are important, such as for public transport schedules. Nonetheless, usage is inconsistent: in the UK, train timetables will typically use 24-hour time, but road signs indicating time restrictions (e.g. on [[bus lane]]s) typically use 12-hour time, e.g. "Monday–Friday 6.30–8.30pm". The [[BBC website]] uses the 24-hour clock for its TV and radio programme listings, while BBC promotions for upcoming programmes give their times according to the 12-hour clock.  Punctuation and spacing styles differ, even within English-speaking countries (6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm, 6.30pm, etc.).

Most people in "24-hour countries" are so used to both systems being alternately used in spoken language that they have no problem switching between the two, perceiving the statements "three o'clock" and "15:00" simply as synonyms{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. When speaking, a person may often pronounce time in 12-hour notation, even when reading a 24-hour display{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. It is also common that a person uses the 24-hour clock in ''spoken'' language when referring to an exact point in time ("The train leaves at fourteen forty-five&amp;nbsp;..."), while using some variant of the 12-hour notation to refer vaguely to a time ("...&amp;nbsp;so I will be back tonight some time after five."){{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. However, encountering a p.m. time written in the 12-hour notation (e.g. 6:30 meaning 18:30) is likely to cause confusion with people used to the 24-hour written notation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In certain languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]] and [[Czech language|Czech]] the hour is divided into quarters and halves, spoken of relative to the closest hour.

In many Germanic languages the half-hour is referred to the next hour (''half to nine'' rather than ''half past eight''). In colloquial language, this can cause confusion between English and German, Dutch or Swedish diction: in conversational English as spoken in the UK, ''half past eight'' (for 8:30) is often reduced to ''half eight'', while in German {{lang|de|halb acht}}, in Dutch {{lang|nl|half acht}} and in Swedish {{lang|sv|halv åtta}} invariably means 7:30. For the quarters, in German different dialects use {{lang|de|Viertel nach sieben}} or {{lang|de|viertel acht}} (literally "quarter past seven" or "quarter eight"), and {{lang|de|Viertel vor acht}} or {{lang|de|dreiviertel acht}} (literally "quarter to eight" or "three quarters eight").

In the [[French language]], the quarters are expressed as additions or subtractions of the full hour: {{lang|fr|sept heures et quart}} (literally "seven hours and quarter"), {{lang|fr|sept heures et demie}} ("seven hours and half"), {{lang|fr|huit heures moins le quart}} ("eight hours less the quarter").

The separator between hours and minutes is the letter h (18&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;45, for example).

==Geography==
The DFNS lies to the west of the [[Tigris]] along the [[Turkey|Turkish]] border. It is composed of three regions: [[Jazira Region|Jazira]], [[Euphrates Region|Euphrates]] and [[Afrin Region]]. Jazira Region borders [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] to the southeast. Other borders are fluid in the Syrian Civil War. All regions are at latitude approximately 36°30' north. They are relatively flat except for the [[Kurd Mountains]] in Afrin Region.

In terms of governorates of Syria, the DFNS is formed from most of [[al-Hasakah Governorate]], the northern parts of [[Raqqa Governorate]], the northwestern parts of the [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]] and the northwestern and northeastern [[Aleppo Governorate]].

[[File:TellHalaf,NE-palace1.jpg|thumb|Having been part of the [[Fertile Crescent]], Northern Syria has several Neolithic sites such as [[Tell Halaf]].]]
Northern Syria is part of the [[Fertile Crescent]], and includes archaeological sites dating to the Neolithic, such as [[Tell Halaf]]. In antiquity, the area was part of the [[Mitanni]] kingdom, its centre being the Khabur river valley in modern-day Jazira Region. It was then part of [[Assyria]], with the last surviving Assyrian imperial records, from between 604 BC and 599 BC, were found in and around the Assyrian city of [[Dūr-Katlimmu]].&lt;ref&gt;Assyria 1995: Proceedings of the 10th Anniversary Symposium of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project / Helsinki, September 7–11, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was ruled by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], [[Hellenistic period|Hellenes]], [[Artaxiad dynasty|Artaxiads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crook|first1=et al.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume 9: The Last Age of the Roman Republic, 146–43 BC|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1139054379|page=603}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrea,|first1=Alfred J.|last2=Overfield|first2=James H.|title=The Human Record: Sources of Global History, Volume I: To 1500|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1305537460|page=133|edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daryaee|first1=Touraj|authorlink1=Touraj Daryaee|title=Sasanian Persia: The Rise and Fall of an Empire|date=2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0857716668|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and successive Arab Islamic caliphates.

Kurdish settlement in Syria goes back to before the [[Crusades]] of the 11th century. A number of Kurdish military and feudal settlements from before this period have been found in Syria. Such settlements have been found in the [[Alawite]] and north Lebanese mountains and around [[Hama]] and its surroundings. The Crusade fortress of [[Krak des Chevaliers]], which is known in Arabic as ''Hisn al-Akrad'' (Castle of the Kurds), was originally a Kurdish military settlement before it was enlarged by the French Crusaders. Similarly, the [[Kurd-Dagh]] (Kurdish Mount) has been inhabited by Kurds for more than a millennium.&lt;ref name=Kreyenbroek&gt;{{cite book|last=Philip G.

In the 12th century, Kurdish and other Muslim regiments accompanied [[Saladin]], who was a Kurd from [[Tikrit]], on his conquest of the [[Middle East]] and establishment of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] (1171–1341), which was administered from [[Damascus]]. The Kurdish regiments that accompanied Saladin established self-ruled areas in and around Damascus. These settlements evolved into the Kurdish sections of Damascus of ''Hayy al-Akrad'' (the Kurdish quarter) and the Salhiyya districts located in the north-east of Damasacus on [[Mount Qasioun]].&lt;ref name=Yildiz&gt;{{cite book|last=Yildiz|first=Kerim|title=The Kurds in Syria : the forgotten people|year=2005|publisher=Pluto Press, in association with Kurdish Human Rights Project|location=London [etc.]|isbn=0745324991|pages=25|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurdish community’s role in the military continued under the Ottomans. Kurdish soldiers and policemen from city were tasked with both maintaining order and protecting the pilgrims’ route toward [[Mecca]]. Many Kurds from Syria’s rural hinterland joined the local [[Janissary]] corp in Damascus. Later, Kurdish migrants from diverse areas, such as [[Diyarbakir]], [[Mosul]] and [[Kirkuk]], also joined these military units which caused an expansion of the Kurdish community in the city.&lt;ref name=Tejel3&gt;{{cite book|last=Tejel|first=Jordi|title=Syria's Kurds: history, politics and society|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415424402|pages=10|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1516–1922), large [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish-speaking]] tribal groups both settled in and were deported to areas of northern Syria from [[Anatolia]]. The demographics of this area underwent a huge shift in the early part of the [[20th century]]. Some Circassian, Kurdish and Chechen tribes cooperated with the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] ([[Turkish people|Turkish]]) authorities in the massacres of [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]] Christians in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], between 1914 and 1920, with further attacks on unarmed fleeing civilians conducted by local Arab militias.&lt;ref name="Travis2"&gt;Travis, Hannibal.

In many instances, the Syrian government arbitrarily deprived ethnic Kurdish citizens of their citizenship.

In 1973, the Syrian authorities confiscated {{convert|750|km2|abbr=off}} of fertile agricultural land in [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]], which was owned and cultivated by tens of thousands of Kurdish citizens, and gave it to Arab families brought in from other provinces.&lt;ref name="OHCHR-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSmonitor-2005"/&gt; In 2007, in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, {{convert|6,00|km2|abbr=off}} around [[Al-Malikiyah]] were granted to Arab families, while tens of thousands of Kurdish inhabitants of the villages concerned were evicted.&lt;ref name="OHCHR-2009"/&gt; These and other expropriations was part of the so-called "Arab Belt initiative" which aimed to change the demographic fabric of the resource-rich region.&lt;ref name=HRW1996 /&gt;

In 2012, in the early stages of the [[Syrian Civil War]], Syrian government forces withdrew from three mainly Kurdish areas, leaving control to local militias. Existing underground Kurdish political parties, namely the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]] (PYD) and the [[Kurdish National Council]] (KNC), joined to form the [[Kurdish Supreme Committee]] (KSC) and the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) militia was established to defend Kurdish-inhabited areas in northern Syria. In July 2012, the YPG established control in the towns of [[Kobanî]], [[Amuda]] and [[Afrin, Syria|Afrin]], and the Kurdish Supreme Committee established a joint leadership council to administer the towns. Soon YPG also gained control of the cities of [[Al-Malikiyah]], [[Ras al-Ayn]], [[al-Darbasiyah]], and [[al-Muabbada]] and parts of [[al-Hasakah|Hasakah]] and [[Qamishli]].&lt;ref name=casualties&gt;{{cite news|title=Armed Kurds Surround Syrian Security Forces in Qamishli |url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/4984.html |accessdate=27 July 2012 |newspaper=Rudaw |date=22 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724224808/http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/4984.html |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="girkelege"&gt;{{cite news|title=Girke Lege Becomes Sixth Kurdish City Liberated in Syria |url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/4992.html |accessdate=27 July 2012 |newspaper=Rudaw |date=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129100410/http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/4992.html |archivedate=29 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 2014 to spring 2015, the YPG forces in Kobanî Canton, supported by some secular [[Free Syrian Army]] militias and leftist international and [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) volunteers, fought and finally repelled an assault by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) during the [[Siege of Kobanî]], and in the YPG's [[Tell Abyad offensive]] of summer of 2015, the regions of Jazira and Kobanî were connected.

In December 2015, the [[Syrian Democratic Council]] was created. On 17 March 2016, at a TEV-DEM-organized conference in [[Rmelan]] the establishment the ''Democratic Federation of Rojava – Northern Syria'' was declared in the areas they controlled in Northern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria’s Kurds declare de-facto federal region in north|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2016/Syria%27s_Kurds_declare_de-facto_federal_region_in_north/id-882b101de1024e63bd9525bb32c708e3|accessdate=17 January 2017|agency=Associated Press|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was quickly denounced by both the Syrian government and the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]].&lt;ref name=AlJazeeraFederal/&gt;

{{See also|List of political parties in the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria}} {{Politics of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria}}
The political system of the DFNS is based on its constitution, which is called the "Charter of the Social Contract."&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt;&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web|url=https://peaceinkurdistancampaign.com/charter-of-the-social-contract/|title=2014 Charter of the Social Contract of Rojava|publisher=Peace in Kurdistan|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution was ratified on 9 January 2014; it provides that all residents of the region shall enjoy fundamental rights such as [[gender equality]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt; It also provides for [[property rights]].&lt;ref name="Glioti"&gt;Andrea Glioti, [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/08/rojava-libertarian-myth-scrutiny-160804083743648.html Rojava: A libertarian myth under scrutiny], Al-Jazeera (6 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdullah Öcalan]], a [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) leader imprisoned in [[İmralı]], [[Turkey]], has become an iconic figure in the region whose libertarian socialist ideology has shaped the region's society and politics through the ruling TEV-DEM coalition.&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/writings-of-obscure-american-leftist-drive-kurdish-forces-to-syria/3678233.html|title=Writings of Obscure American Leftist Drive Kurdish Forces in Syria|work=Voice of America|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Öcalan has envisioned municipal assemblies forming a pan-[[Kurdistan]] confederation, united for purposes of [[self-defense]] and with shared values of [[environmentalism]], gender equality, and ethnic, [[Cultural pluralism|cultural]], and [[religious pluralism]].&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt; Hundreds of neighborhood-based communes with aspirations towards this ideological vision have been established in the region.&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt; The DFNS has a "co-governance" policy in which each position at each level of government in the DFNS includes a "female equivalent of equal authority" to a male.&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt; Similarly, there is an aspiration for equal political representation of all ethno-religious components – Arabs, Kurds and Syriac-Assyrians being the most sizeable ones. Some have compared this to the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[National Pact|confessionalist]] system, which is based on that country's major religions.&lt;ref name="Glioti"/&gt; The politics of the region has been described as having "libertarian transnational aspirations" influenced by the PKK's shift toward [[anarchism]], but also includes various "tribal, ethno-sectarian, capitalist and patriarchal structures."&lt;ref name="Glioti"/&gt;

The DFNS is divided into three administrative regions: [[Jazira Region|Jazira]], [[Euphrates Region|Euphrates]], and [[Afrin Region|Afrin]].&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt; The governance model of the DFNS has an emphasis on local management, with democratically elected committees to make decisions. The TEV-DEM coalition, led by the Democratic Union Party (PYD), is the political coalition governing the DFNS. It succeeds a brief intermediate period from 2012–2013, when a [[Kurdish Supreme Committee]] was established by the PYD and the [[Kurdish National Council]] (KNC) as the governing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mesop.de/2012/07/27/kurdish-supreme-committee-in-syria-holds-first-meeting/|title=Kurdish Supreme Committee in Syria Holds First Meeting|publisher=Rudaw|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2012/7/syriakurd563.htm|title=Now Kurds are in charge of their fate: Syrian Kurdish official|publisher=Rudaw|date=29 July 2012|website=[[Ekurd.net]] |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also governor/president positions, with Hediye Yusuf and [[Humaydi Daham al-Hadi]] being co-governors of [[Jazira Region]].&lt;ref name="syriahr2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=YPG, backed by al-Khabour Guards Forces, al-Sanadid army and the Syriac Military Council, expels IS out of more than 230 towns, villages and farmlands |url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/05/ypg-backed-by-al-khabour-guards-forces-al-sanadid-army-and-the-syriac-military-council-expels-is-out-of-more-than-230-towns-villages-and-farmlands/ |website=[[Syrian Observatory For Human Rights]] |accessdate=28 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529003959/http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/05/ypg-backed-by-al-khabour-guards-forces-al-sanadid-army-and-the-syriac-military-council-expels-is-out-of-more-than-230-towns-villages-and-farmlands/ |archivedate=29 May 2015 |date=28 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opendem"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Rahila|title=Rojava’s commitment to Jineolojî: the science of women|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/rahila-gupta/rojava-s-commitment-to-jineoloj-science-of-women|website=[[openDemocracy]]|accessdate=28 February 2017|language=en|date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janes360"&gt;{{cite web|title=SDF plays central role in Syrian civil war|url=http://www.janes360.com/images/assets/333/57333/SDF_plays_central_role_in_Syrian_civil_war__1_.pdf|website=IHS Jane's 360|publisher=[[IHS (disambiguation)|IHS]]|accessdate=28 February 2017|pages=3–4|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opendem"/&gt;

=== Community government ===
[[File:De facto cantons of Rojava.png|thumb|200px|The [[Regions of Rojava]] per the reorganization in July 2017.]]

[[Rojava local elections, 2015|Local elections]] were held in March 2015. The DFNS system of community government has [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/29012015|title=A Very Different Ideology in the Middle East|publisher=Rudaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its programme aimed to be inclusive towards all the ethnoreligious groups of the region, including [[Kurds]], [[Arabs]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Syrian Turkmen]] and [[Yazidis]]. A September 2015 report in the ''[[New York Times]]'' observed:&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt;
{{quote|''For a former diplomat like me, I found it confusing: I kept looking for a hierarchy, the singular leader, or signs of a government line, when, in fact, there was none; there were just groups. There was none of that stifling obedience to the party, or the obsequious deference to the “big man”&amp;nbsp;— a form of government all too evident just across the borders, in Turkey to the north, and the Kurdish regional government of Iraq to the south. The confident assertiveness of young people was striking.''}} However, a 2016 paper from [[Chatham House]]&lt;ref name="Khalaf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khalaf|first1=Rana|title=Governing Rojava Layers of Legitimacy in Syria|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2016-12-08-governing-rojava-khalaf.pdf|publisher=The Royal Institute of International Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that power is heavily centralized in the hands of the PYD.

The first [[Northern Syria local elections, 2017|communal elections]] in the DFNS under the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria system were held on 22 September 2017. 12,421 candidates competed for around 3,700 communal positions during the elections, which were organized by the DFNS High Electoral Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hilbijartin.org/|title=المفوضية العليا للانتخابات - Komseriya Bilind Ya Hilbijartinan|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-kurds/syrians-vote-in-kurdish-led-regions-of-north-idUSKCN1BX1PY?il=0|title=Syrians vote in Kurdish-led regions of north|work=Reuters|author=Rodi Said|date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional government===
{{Main|Regions of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria}}
Article 8 of the 2014 constitution stipulates that "all Cantons in the Autonomous Regions are founded on the principle of local self-government. Cantons may freely elect their representatives and representative bodies, and may pursue their rights insofar as it does not contravene the articles of the Charter."&lt;ref name=charter/&gt;

In January 2014, the legislative assembly of [[Afrin Canton]] elected [[Hêvî Îbrahîm Mustefa]] prime minister, who appointed Remzi Şêxmus and Ebdil Hemid Mistefa her deputies, and the legislative assembly of [[Kobanî Canton]] elected Enver Müslim prime minister, who appointed Bêrîvan Hesen and Xalid Birgil his deputies. In [[Jazira Canton]], the legislative assembly has elected ethnic Kurd Akram Hesso as prime minister and ethnic Arab Hussein Taza Al Azam and ethnic Assyrian Elizabeth Gawrie as deputy prime ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2014/10/democracy-is-radical-in-northern-syria|title=Democracy is "Radical" in Northern Syria|author=Karlos Zurutuza |work=Inter Press Service|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three cantons were later reorganized into three regions with subordinate cantons/provinces, areas, districts and communes.
Elections for the local councils of the [[Jazira Region]], [[Euphrates Region]] and [[Afrin Region]] were held in [[Northern Syria regional elections, 2017|December 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electoral Commission publish video of elections 2nd stage {{!}} ANHA |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032359/https://en.hawarnews.com/electoral-commission-publish-video-of-elections-2nd-stage/ |website=hawarnews.com |date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal, regional and local administrations in the DFNS put much emphasis on promoting libraries and educational centers, to facilitate learning and social and artistic activities. Examples are the Nahawand Center for Developing Children’s Talents in [[Amuda]] (est. 2015) and the Rodî û Perwîn Library in [[Kobani]] (May 2016).&lt;ref name=k24education&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/dfa4b335-fe1c-4a3c-b5b6-7bc5848e9e97/Kurds-establish-university-in-Rojava-amid-Syrian-instability|title=Kurds establish university in Rojava amid Syrian instability|publisher=Kurdistan24|date=2016-07-07|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education===
{{See also|Education in Syria}}

While there was no institution of tertiary education on the territory of the DFNS at the onset of the Syrian Civil War, an increasing number of such institutions have been established by the regional administrations in the DFNS since.

* In September 2014, the [[Mesopotamian Social Sciences Academy]] in Qamishli started classes.&lt;ref name=utopia/&gt; More such academies designed under a [[libertarian socialist]] academic philosophy and concept are in the process of founding or planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/revolutionary-education-rojava|title=Revolutionary Education in Rojava|publisher=New Compass|date=2015-02-17|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2015, the traditionally-designed [[University of Afrin]] in Afrin started teaching, with initial programs in literature, engineering and economics, including institutes for medicine, topographic engineering, music and theater, business administration and the Kurdish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/kurds-rojava-afrin-first-university-ideology-ocalan.html|title=Syria's first Kurdish university attracts controversy as well as students|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=2016-05-18|accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2016, Jazira Canton Board of Education started the [[University of Rojava]] in Qamishli, with faculties for Medicine, Engineering, Sciences, and Arts and Humanities. Programs taught include health, oil, computer and agricultural engineering; physics, chemistry, history, psychology, geography, mathematics and primary school teaching and Kurdish literature.&lt;ref name=k24education/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anfenglish.com/kurdistan/university-of-rojava-to-be-opened|title='University of Rojava' to be opened|publisher=ANF|date=2016-07-04|accessdate=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its language of instruction is Kurdish, and with an agreement with [[Paris 8 University]] in France for cooperation, the university opened registration for students in the academic year 2016–2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/08/rojava-university-seeks-eliminate-constraints-education-syrias-kurdish-region/|title=Rojava university seeks to eliminate constraints on education in Syria’s Kurdish region|publisher=[[ARA News]]|date=2016-08-15|accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2016 [[Jazira Canton]] police forces [[Battle of al-Hasakah (2016)|took control]] of the remaining parts of [[Al-Hasakah|Hasakah]] city, which included the Hasakah campus of the Arabic-language [[Al-Furat University]], and with mutual agreement the institution continues to be operated under the authority of the Damascus government's Ministry of Higher Education.

===Media===

Incorporating the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], as well as other internationally recognized human rights conventions, the 2014 [[Constitution of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. As a result, a diverse media landscape has developed in the DFNS,&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/syria|title=Syria Country report, Freedom of the Press 2015|work=Freedom House|date=2015|accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in each of the [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], [[Arabic]], [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Syriac-Aramaic]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages of the land, as well as in English, and media outlets frequently use more than one language. Among the most prominent media in the DFNS are ''[[Hawar News Agency]]'' and ''[[ARA News]]'' news agencies and websites as well as TV outlets ''Rojava Kurdistan TV'', ''Ronahî TV'', and the bimonthly magazine ''Nudem''. A landscape of local newspapers and radio stations has developed. However, media agencies often face economic pressure, as was demonstrated by the closure of news website ''Welati'' in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/05/blow-kurdish-independent-media-syrian-kurdish-website-shuts/|title=In blow to Kurdish independent media, Syrian Kurdish website shuts down|publisher=[[ARA News]]|date=2016-05-15|accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political extremism in the context of the Syrian Civil War can put media outlets under pressure; for example in April 2016 the premises of [[Arta FM]] ("the first, and only, independent radio station staffed and broadcast by Syrians inside Syria") in [[Amuda]] was threatened and burned down by unidentified assailants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/b2cd5731-94cf-4181-94bf-debfa4208992/Syria%E2%80%99s-first-Kurdish-radio-station-burnt|title=Syria’s first Kurdish radio station burnt|publisher=Kurdistan24|date=2016-04-27|accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/04/syrian-kurdish-administration-condemns-burning-radio-arta-fm-office-amude/|title=Syrian Kurdish administration condemns burning of radio ARTA FM office in Amude|publisher=[[ARA News]]|date=2016-04-27|accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Turkish military operation in Afrin]], the [[KDP]]-affiliated Iraqi Kurdish [[Rudaw Media Network]] was also banned from reporting in the region.&lt;ref name=www.rudaw.net/&gt;

International media and journalists operate with few restrictions in the DFNS, one of the only regions in Syria where they can operate with some degree of freedom.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse2015/&gt; This has led to several international media reports regarding the region, including major TV documentaries like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKhjJfH0ra4 BBC documentary (2014): Rojava: Syria's Secret Revolution] or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JgM8JTvL_o Sky1 documentary (2016): Rojava – the fight against ISIS].

Internet connections in the DFNS are often slow due to inadequate infrastructure. Internet lines are operated by [[Syrian Telecom]], which as of January 2017 is working on a major extension of the fibre optic cable network in southern [[Jazira Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriannewscenter.net/ar/article/23775-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-10-%D8%A3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%85.html|title=انترنت في الحسكة والقامشلي خلال 10 أيام |publisher=syriannewscenter.net|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The arts===
After the establishment of the de facto autonomous region, the Center of Art and Democratic Culture, located in Jazira Region, has become a venue for aspiring artists who showcase their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/syria-kurdish-rojava-revolutionary-art.html|title=Kurdish art, music flourish as regime fades from northeast Syria|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=2016-07-19|accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=هيئة الثقافة تفتتح معرضاً في سري كانيه بالحسكة|url=http://aranews.org/2015/09/هيئة-الثقافة-تفتتح-معرضاً-في-سري-كانيه/|agency=ARA News|date=12 September 2015|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among major cultural events in the region is the annual ''Festival of Theater'' in March/April as well as the ''Rojava Short Story Festival'' in June, both in the city of Qamishli, and the ''Afrin Short Film Festival'' in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/3cfd84f7-b2fb-4370-a8b0-67fcfadbb58f/Syrian-Kurds-hold-theatre-festival-in-Rojava-amid-war|title=Syrian Kurds hold theatre festival in Rojava amid war|publisher=[[Kurdistan24]]|date=April 2017|accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|The autonomous administration is supporting efforts for workers to form cooperatives, such as this sewing cooperative in Derik.]]

The DFNS pursues a model of economy that blends co-operative and private enterprise.&lt;ref name=vancouver&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/opinion/rojava-syria-revolution-hope-and-healing|title=Rojava, Syria: A revolution of hope and healing|publisher=[[Vancouver Observer]]|date=19 April 2017|accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the PYD launched what it called the Social Economy Plan, later renamed the People's Economy Plan (PEP). PEP's policies are based primarily on the libertarian socialist ideology of [[Abdullah Öcalan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Small Key Can Open a Large Door: The Rojava Revolution|date=4 March 2015|publisher=Strangers In A Tangled Wilderness|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Private property]] and entrepreneurship are protected under the principle of "ownership by use". Dr. Dara Kurdaxi, a DFNS official, has stated: "The method in Rojava is not so much against private property, but rather has the goal of putting private property in the service of all the peoples who live in Rojava."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Knapp, [http://peaceinkurdistancampaign.com/2015/02/06/rojava-the-formation-of-an-economic-alternative-private-property-in-the-service-of-all/ 'Rojava{{snd}} the formation of an economic alternative: Private property in the service of all'].&lt;/ref&gt;

There were at first no direct or indirect [[tax]]es on people or businesses in the DFNS; the administration raises money through [[tariff]]s and through selling oil and other natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/poor-in-means/|title=Poor in means but rich in spirit|work=Ecology or Catastrophe|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diclenews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diclenews.com/en/news/content/view/436354|title=Efrîn Economy Minister Yousef: Rojava challenging norms of class, gender and power|website=Diclenews.com|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in July 2017, it was reported that the administration in the Jazira Region had started to collect income tax to provide for public services in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Wladimir van Wilgenburg |title=Rojava Administration to Impose Tax System in Northern Syria |url=https://mesopotamia.coop/rojava-administration-to-impose-tax-system-in-northern-syria/ |website=Co-operation in Mesopotamia |date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, The ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that traders in Syria experience the DFNS as "the one place where they aren't forced to pay bribes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-syrias-mangled-economy-truckers-stitch-together-warring-regions-1464106368|title=In Syria's Mangled Economy, Truckers Stitch Together Warring Regions |publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2016-05-24|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jazira Region]] is a major wheat and cotton producer and has a considerable oil industry. The [[Euphrates Region]] suffered most destruction of the three regions and has huge challenges in reconstruction, and has recently seen some [[greenhouse]] agriculture construction. The [[Afrin Region]] have had a traditional specialization on olive oil including [[Aleppo soap]] made from it, and had drawn much industrial production from the nearby city of [[Aleppo]] due to longstanding civil war fighting in that city. [[Price controls]] are managed by democratic committees per region, which can set the price of basic goods such as food and medical goods.&lt;ref name="diclenews.com"/&gt;

===General development assessments===
It has been theorized that the Assad government had deliberately underdeveloped parts of Northern Syria for the purposes of pursuing a demographic shift and Arabization of the region.&lt;ref name=pkk/&gt; During the [[Syrian Civil War]], the infrastructure of the region has on average experienced less destruction than other parts of Syria. In May 2016, Ahmed Yousef, head of the DFNS Economic Body and chairman of Afrin University, claimed that at the time, the economic output of the DFNS (including agriculture, industry and oil) accounted for about 55% of Syria's gross domestic product.&lt;ref name="Will Syria's Kurds succeed at self-sufficiency?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/kurdish-areas-norther-syria-economy-self-sufficiency.html|title=Will Syria's Kurds succeed at self-sufficiency?|date=2016-05-03|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Constitution of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria|Human rights in the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria}}

===Legal system===
Syrian civil laws are valid in the DFNS if they do not conflict with the Constitution of the DFNS. One notable example for amendment is personal status law, which in Syria is based on [[Sharia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Syria_APS.doc|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|page=13|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by Sharia Courts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/islamic-family-law/home/research/legal-profiles/syria-syrian-arab-republic/|title=Islamic Family Law: Syria (Syrian Arab Republic)|publisher=Law.emory.edu|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Secularism|secular]] DFNS proclaims absolute equality of women under the law, allowing [[civil marriage]] and banning [[forced marriage]], [[polygamy]]&lt;ref name=jolie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37337908|title=Kurdish 'Angelina Jolie' devalued by media hype|work=BBC|date=2016-09-12|accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and underage marriage.&lt;ref name=underage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/11/syrian-kurds-tackle-underage-marriages-polygamy/|title=Syrian Kurds tackle conscription, underage marriages and polygamy|publisher=[[ARA News]]|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria Kurds challenging traditions, promote civil marriage|url=http://aranews.net/2016/02/syria-kurds-challenging-traditions-promote-civil-marriage/|publisher=[[ARA News]]|date=2016-02-20|accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new criminal justice approach was implemented that emphasizes [[restorative justice|restoration]] over retribution.&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/50102294-77fd-11e5-a95a-27d368e1ddf7.html|title=Power to the people: a Syrian experiment in democracy|publisher=Financial Times|date=2015-10-23|accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty was abolished.&lt;ref name="The New Justice System in Rojava"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/justice-system-in-rojava/|title=The New Justice System in Rojava|publisher=biehlonbookchin.com|date=2014-10-13|accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisons house mostly people charged with terrorist activity related to ISIL and other extremist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian Kurds Get Outside Help to Manage Prisons |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/syria-kurds-prisons/2976077.html|accessdate=2016-06-06|publisher=Voice of America|date=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2015 report of [[Amnesty International]] noted that 400 people were incarcerated by DFNS authorities and criticized deficiencies in [[due process]] of the judicial system of the region.&lt;ref name=AI-prisonreport&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/09/syria-abuses-mar-pyd-fight-against-terrorism/|title=Syria: Arbitrary detentions and blatantly unfair trials mar PYD fight against terrorism|publisher=Amnesty International|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="utopia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison_population_rate|title=Highest to Lowest – Prison Population Rate|publisher=World Prison Brief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The justice system in the DFNS is influenced by [[Abdullah Öcalan#Democratic confederalism|Abdullah Öcalan's libertarian socialist ideology]]. At the local level, citizens create ''Peace and Consensus Committees'', which make group decisions on minor criminal cases and disputes as well as in separate committees resolve issues of specific concern to women's rights like domestic violence and marriage. At the regional level, citizens (who need not be trained jurists) are elected by the regional ''People's Councils'' to serve on seven-member ''People's Courts''. At the next level are four ''Appeals Courts'', composed of trained jurists. The court of last resort is the ''Regional Court'', which serves the DFNS as a whole. Separate from this system, the ''Constitutional Court'' renders decisions on compatibility of acts of government and legal proceedings with the constitution of the DFNS (called the Social Contract).&lt;ref name="The New Justice System in Rojava"/&gt;

===Policing and security===

[[File:Members of the Raqqa internal security forces.png|250px|thumb|Members of the [[Raqqa Internal Security Forces]] (RISF) in [[Ayn Issa]].]]
Policing in the DFNS is performed by the [[Asayish (Syria)|Asayish]] armed formation. Asayish was established on July 25, 2013 to fill the gap of security when the Syrian security forces withdrew.&lt;ref name="asayish"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rojava Asayish: Security institution not above but within the society|url=http://www.anfenglish.com/features/rojava-asayish-security-institution-not-above-but-within-the-society|accessdate=2016-06-06|publisher=ANF|date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Constitution of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]], policing is a competence of the regions. The Asayish forces of the regions are composed of 26 official bureaus that aim to provide security and solutions to social problems. The six main units of DFNS Asayish are Checkpoints Administration, Anti-Terror Forces Command (HAT), Intelligence Directorate, Organized Crime Directorate, Traffic Directorate and Treasury Directorate. 218 Asayish centers were established and 385 checkpoints with 10 Asayish members in each checkpoint were set up. 105 Asayish offices provide security against ISIL on the frontlines across Northern Syria. Larger cities have general directorates responsible for all aspects of security including road controls. Each region has a HAT command, and each Asayish center organizes itself autonomously.&lt;ref name="asayish"/&gt;

Throughout the DFNS, the municipal Civilian Defense Forces (HPC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernslavery.calpress.org/?p=949|title=Rojava Dispatch Six: Innovations, the Formation of the Hêza Parastina Cewherî (HPC)|publisher=Modern Slavery}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regional [[Self-Defense Forces (DFNS regions)|Self-Defense Forces]] (HXP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rudaw|url=http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/04062015|title=Rojava defense force draws thousands of recruits|work=Rudaw|date=6 April 2015|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also serve local-level security. In [[Jazira Region]], the Asayish are further complemented by the Assyrian [[Sutoro]] police force, which is organized in every area with Assyrian population, provides security and solutions to social problems in collaboration with other Asayish units.&lt;ref name="asayish"/&gt; The [[Khabour Guards]] and [[Nattoreh]], though not police units, also have a presence in the area, providing security in towns along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]]. The [[Bethnahrain Women's Protection Forces]] also maintain a police branch. In the areas taken from ISIL during the [[Raqqa campaign (2016–present)|Raqqa campaign]], the [[Raqqa Internal Security Forces]]  and Manbij Internal Security Forces operate as police forces.

Northern Syria Internal Security Forces is an umbrella terms for internal security forces (minus Sutoro and the police branch of Bethnahrain Women's Protection Forces)

===Militias===

{{Main|Syrian Democratic Forces|Self-Defense Forces (DFNS regions)}}
{{See also|Syrian Kurdish–Islamist conflict (2013–present)}}
The main military force of the DFNS is the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]], an alliance of Syrian rebel groups formed in 2015. The SDF is led by the Kurdish majority [[People's Protection Units]] (''{{lang|ku|Yekîneyên Parastina Gel}}'', YPG). The YPG was founded by the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|PYD]] after the [[2004 Qamishli riots|2004 Qamishli clashes]], but was first active in the Syrian Civil War.&lt;ref name=Vice&gt;{{cite web|last = Gold |first= Danny|url = https://www.vice.com/read/meet-the-ypg |title = Meet the YPG, the Kurdish Militia That Doesn't Want Help from Anyone |work =Vice|date=31 October 2010|accessdate= 9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[Syriac Military Council]] (MFS), an Assyrian militia associated with the [[Syriac Union Party (Syria)|Syriac Union Party]]. There are also [[Free Syrian Army]] groups in the alliance such as [[Jaysh al-Thuwar]] and the [[Northern Democratic Brigade]], tribal militias like the [[Al-Sanadid Forces]], and municipal military councils in the [[Shahba region]], like the [[Manbij Military Council]], the [[Al-Bab Military Council]] or the [[Jarablus Military Council]].

The [[Self-Defense Forces (DFNS regions)|Self-Defence Forces]] (HXP) is a territorial defense militia and the only conscript armed force in the DFNS. HXP is locally recruited to garrison their municipal area and is under the responsibility and command of the respective regions of the DFNS. Occasionally, HXP units have supported the YPG, and SDF in general, during combat operations against ISIL outside their own municipality and region.

In the course of the Syrian Civil War, [[Human rights in the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria#DFNS-associated militias|militias associated with the DFNS]] have been accused of war crimes, in particular members of the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG), including 2014 and 2015 reports by [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], both of which operate freely in the DFNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014-06-18|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|title= Syria: Abuses in Kurdish-run Enclaves|url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/06/18/syria-abuses-kurdish-run-enclaves}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/|title=Syria|work=[[Amnesty International]]|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims from 2014 include claims of arbitrary arrests and torture, other claims include the use of [[child soldiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/10/syria-kurdish-forces-violating-child-soldier-ban-0|title=Syria: Kurdish Forces Violating Child Soldier Ban|date=15 July 2015|website=Hrw.org|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Prevent-the-rise-of-a-North-Korea-style-Kurdish-dictatorship-408405|title=Prevent the rise of a North Korea-style Kurdish dictatorship|website=Jpost.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/06/19/under-kurdish-rule/abuses-pyd-run-enclaves-syria|title=Under Kurdish Rule - Abuses in PYD-run Enclaves of Syria|date=19 June 2014|website=Hrw.org|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=[[United Nations Security Council|U.N.

==Demographics==
{{See also|Demographics of Syria}}
The demographics of the region have historically been highly diverse. One major shift in modern times was in the early part of the 20th century due to the [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrian]] and [[Armenian Genocide]]s, when many Assyrians and Armenians fled to Syria from Turkey. This was followed by many Kurds fleeing Turkey in the aftermath of [[Sheikh Said rebellion]]. Another major shift in modern times was the Baath policy of settling additional Arab tribes in Northern Syria. Most recently, during the [[Syrian Civil War]], many refugees have fled to the north of the country. Some ethnic Arab citizens from Iraq have fled to Northern Syria as well.&lt;ref name=Sheppard&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/10/kurds-rojava-syria-isis-iraq-assad/505037/|title=What the Syrian Kurds Have Wrought.

Two ethnic groups have a significant presence in certain regions of Northern Syria:
[[File:Qamishli in winter.jpg|thumb|The streets of Qamishli during Christmas]]

*'''[[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]]''' are an [[ethnic group]] with a major presence in the area between [[Afrin Region]] and [[Euphrates Region]], where they form regional majorities in the countryside from [[Azaz]] and [[Mare']] to [[Jarabulus]], and a minor presence in [[Afrin Region]] and [[Euphrates Region]].

There are also smaller minorities of '''[[Armenians in Syria|Armenians]]''' throughout Northern Syria as well as '''[[Chechens]]''' in [[Ras al-Ayn]].

===Languages===
Four languages from three different language families are spoken in Northern Syria: 
*[[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] (in [[Northern Kurdish]] dialect), a [[Western Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranian language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i|title=HISTORY OF THE KURDISH LANGUAGE|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D.

*[[Arabic language|Arabic]] (in [[North Mesopotamian Arabic]] dialect, in writing [[Modern Standard Arabic]]), a [[Central Semitic language]] from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic language family]]
*[[Eastern Aramaic languages|Syriac-Aramaic]] mainly in the [[Turoyo|Surayt/Turoyo]] and [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] varieties (mainly [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]] in writing), [[Northwest Semitic languages]] from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic language family]].
*[[Turkish language|Turkish]] (in [[Turkish dialects#Syrian Turkmen dialect|Syrian Turkmen]] dialect), from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]].

For these four languages, three different scripts are in use in Northern Syria:
*The [[Latin alphabet]] for Kurdish and Turkish
*The [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic alphabet (abjad)]] for Arabic
*The [[Syriac alphabet]] for Syriac-Aramaic

===Religion===
Most ethnic Kurdish and Arab people in Northern Syria adhere to [[Sunni Islam]], while ethnic Assyrian people generally are [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholic]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] or adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. There are also adherents to other religions, such as [[Yazidis]]m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Could Christianity be driven from Middle East?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32287806|accessdate=15 April 2015|publisher=BBC|date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant PYD party and the political administration in the DFNS are decidedly [[secularism|secular]] and [[laicism|laicist]].&lt;ref name=Dawronoye&gt;{{cite web|author=Carl Drott|url=http://www.warscapes.com/reportage/revolutionaries-bethnahrin|title=The Revolutionaries of Bethnahrin|publisher=Warscapes|date=25 May 2015|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population centres===
This list includes all cities and towns self-administered under the DFNS framework with more than 10,000 inhabitants. The population figures are given according to the 2004 Syrian census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbssyr.org/General%20census/census%202004/pop-man.pdf |title=2004 Syrian Census |date=2004 |website=Cbssyr.org |access-date=2016-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310211017/http://www.cbssyr.org/General%20census/census%202004/pop-man.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities highlighted in white are fully under DFNS administration.

==External relations==

===Relations with the Syrian Ba'athist government===
{{Main|DFNS–Syria relations}}
{{See also|Federalization of Syria}}
[[File:Flag of Syrian Democratic Forces.svg|thumb|Flag of [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] ]]
Currently, the relations of the DFNS to the Damascus government are determined by the context of the [[Syrian civil war]]. The [[Constitution of Syria]] and the [[Constitution of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] are legally incompatible with respect to legislative and executive authority. In the military realm, combat between the DFNS [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) and Syrian government forces has been rare, in the most notable instances some of the territory still controlled by the Syrian government in Qamishli and al-Hasakah has been lost to the YPG. In some military campaigns, in particular in northern Aleppo governate and in al-Hasakah, YPG and Syrian government forces have tacitly cooperated against Islamist forces, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and others.&lt;ref name=russia-mediates&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria’s war: Assad on the offensive|url=https://www.economist.com/news/21690203-city-was-once-syrias-largest-faces-siege-assadu2019s-grip-tightens|accessdate=2016-05-01|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region does not claim to pursue full independence but rather autonomy within a federal and democratic Syria.&lt;ref name=MiddleEastEye&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/analysis-kurds-syria-rojava-1925945786|title=ANALYSIS: 'This is a new Syria, not a new Kurdistan'|publisher=MiddleEastEye|date=2016-03-21|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Constituent Assembly co-chair [[Hediya Yousef]] formulated the DFNS's approach towards Syria as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20160712/1042855292/syrian-kurds-do-not-want-fragmentation.html|title=Syrian Kurdish Official to Sputnik: 'We Won't Allow Dismemberment of Syria'|publisher=Sputnis News|date=2016-07-12|accessdate=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|''We believe that a federal system is ideal form of governance for Syria. We see that in many parts of the world, a federal framework enables people to live peacefully and freely within territorial borders. The people of Syria can also live freely in Syria. We will not allow for Syria to be divided; all we want is the democratization of Syria; its citizens must live in peace, and enjoy and cherish the ethnic diversity of the national groups inhabiting the country.''}}

In March 2015, the Syrian Information Minister announced that his government considered recognizing the Kurdish autonomy "within the law and constitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KRG: Elections in Jazira are Not Acceptable|publisher=Basnews|url=http://basnews.com/en/news/2015/03/14/krg-elections-in-jazira-are-not-acceptable/|date=14 March 2015|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the DFNS administration is not invited to the [[Geneva peace talks on Syria (2016)|Geneva III peace talks on Syria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-kurds-idUSKCN0YE2NI|title=Syrian Kurds point finger at Western-backed opposition|publisher=Reuters|date=2016-05-23|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any of the earlier talks, in particular Russia, which calls for the DFNS's inclusion, does to some degree carry the DFNS's positions into the talks, as documented in Russia's May 2016 draft for a new constitution for Syria.&lt;ref name="Now.MMedia/Al-Akhbar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/NewsReports/567021-russia-finishes-draft-for-new-syria-constitution-report|title=Russia finishes draft for new Syria constitution|publisher=Now.MMedia/Al-Akhbar|date=2016-05-24|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, there were reports of a Russian initiative for federalization with a focus on northern Syria, which at its core called to turn the existing institutions of the region into legitimate institutions of Syria; also reported was its rejection for the time being by the Syrian government.&lt;ref name="Al-Monitor"/&gt; The Damascus ruling elite is split over the question whether the new model in the DFNS can work in parallel and converge with the Syrian government, for the benefit of both, or if the agenda should be to centralize again all power at the end of the civil war, necessitating preparation for ultimate confrontation with the DFNS institutions.&lt;ref name=chatham&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2016-09-15-kurdish-self-governance-syria-sary_0.pdf|title=Kurdish Self-governance in Syria: Survival and Ambition|author=Ghadi Sary|publisher=Chatham House|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2017 analysis described the DFNS's "relationship with the regime fraught but functional" and a "semi-cooperative dynamic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://warontherocks.com/2017/06/the-signal-in-syrias-noise/|title=The Signal in Syria’s Noise|author=Sam Heller|publisher=warontherocks.com|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2017, Syria's Foreign Minister said that Damascus would consider granting Kurds more autonomy in the DFNS once ISIL is defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/syria-granting-kurds-greater-autonomy-170926121821968.html|title=Syria to consider granting Kurds greater autonomy|website=Aljazeera.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''The autonomous region of Rojava, as it exists today, is one of few bright spots{{snd}} albeit a very bright one{{snd}} to emerge from the tragedy of the Syrian revolution. Having driven out agents of the Assad regime in 2011, and despite the hostility of almost all of its neighbours, Rojava has not only maintained its independence, but is a remarkable democratic experiment. Popular assemblies have been created as the ultimate decision-making bodies, councils selected with careful ethnic balance (in each municipality, for instance, the top three officers have to include one Kurd, one Arab and one Assyrian or Armenian Christian, and at least one of the three has to be a woman), there are women's and youth councils, and, in a remarkable echo of the armed Mujeres Libres (Free Women) of Spain, a feminist army, the "YJA Star" militia (the "Union of Free Women", the star here referring to the ancient Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar), that has carried out a large proportion of the combat operations against the forces of Islamic State.''}}

===Kurdish question===
{{See also|Kurdistan|Kurdish nationalism}} [[File:Kurdish-inhabited area by CIA (1992).jpg|thumb|Kurdish-inhabited areas in 1992 according to the [[CIA]] ]]
The DFNS's dominant political party, the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]] (PYD), is a member organisation of the [[Kurdistan Communities Union]] (KCK) organisation. As KCK member organisations in the neighbouring states with Kurdish minorities are either outlawed ([[Turkish Kurdistan|Turkey]], [[Iranian Kurdistan|Iran]]) or politically marginal with respect to other Kurdish parties (Iraq). Expressions of sympathy for Syrian Kurds have been numerous among [[Kurds in Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kobani-means-turkeys-kurds|title=What Kobani Means for Turkey’s Kurds|publisher=The New Yorker|date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Siege of Kobanî]], some ethnic Kurdish citizens of Turkey crossed the border and volunteered in the defense of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-kurds-pkk-daglica-war-be-sustained-bloody-day.html|title=6 reasons why Turkey's war against the PKK won't last|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=2015-09-08|accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/kurdish-militants-and-turkeys-new-urban-insurgency/|title=Kurdish Militants and Turkey’s New Urban Insurgency|publisher=War On The Rocks|date=2016-03-23|accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DFNS's relationship with the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] in Iraq is complicated. One context is that the governing party there, the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] (KDP), views itself and its affiliated Kurdish parties in other countries as a more conservative and nationalist alternative and competitor to the KCK political agenda and blueprint in general.&lt;ref name="MiddleEastEye"/&gt; The political system of Iraqi Kurdistan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegie-mec.org/2015/08/17/kurdistan-s-politicized-society-confronts-sultanistic-system/ieta|title=Kurdistan’s Politicized Society Confronts a Sultanistic System|publisher=Carnegie Middle East Center|date=2015-08-18|accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; stands in stark contrast to the DFNS system.

== Environmentalism ==
The DFNS has made efforts in implementing reforms to protect the ecosystems of Northern Syria and achieve a degree of self-sufficiency. Before the Syrian Civil War, the region had been ecologically damaged by [[monoculture]], oil extraction, damming of rivers, [[deforestation]], [[drought]], [[Erosion|topsoil loss]] and general pollution. The DFNS launched a campaign titled 'Make Rojava Green Again' which is attempting to provide [[renewable energy]] to communities (especially [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|solar energy]]), [[reforestation]], protecting water sources, planting gardens, promoting [[urban agriculture]], creating [[Nature reserve|wildlife reserves]], [[Reclaimed water|water recycling]], [[beekeeping]], expanding [[Public Transportation|public transportation]] and promoting environmental awareness within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicornriot.ninja/2018/building-autonomy-ecology-rojava/|title=Building Autonomy through Ecology in Rojava|last=|first=|date=28 February 2018|work=Unicorn Riot|access-date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
The '''East Korea Warm Current''' (동한난류, 東韓暖流) is an [[ocean current]] in the [[Sea of Japan]] (East Sea). It branches off from the [[Tsushima Current]] at the eastern end of the [[Korea Strait]], and flows north along the southeastern coast of the [[Korean peninsula]]. Between 36° and 38° N, it encounters the [[North Korea Cold Current]] and veers southeast into the open sea.  The boundary between the two currents fluctuates throughout the year, creating large eddies. As it flows northeastward, the East Korea current eventually rejoins the Tsushima Current. It's very hot and rainy in the Summer.

'''East Scotia Basin''' is a [[oceanic basin|submarine basin]] that lies in the [[Scotia Sea]] of the [[South Atlantic]] ocean, behind the [[South Sandwich Trench|South Sandwich trench]] and between [[latitude]]s 55&amp;ndash;60°&amp;nbsp;S. It is bounded to the north by the North Scotia Ridge, which includes the island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], and to the east by the [[South Sandwich Islands]]. A rise that runs from South Georgia to the [[South Orkney Islands]] separates the East Scotia Basin from the [[West Scotia Basin]].&lt;ref name=christie2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=pce8/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18006">The history of '''French cartography''' can be traced to developments in the Middle Ages. This period was marked by improvements in measuring instruments and also by an upgrade of work in registers of all types.

The first map of [[France]] was drawn by [[Oronce Finé]] and printed in [[woodcut]]s in 1525.&lt;ref&gt;Available on the site of [http://www.bnf.fr/pages/zNavigat/frame/collections.htm?ancre=departements.htm National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt; It testifies to the will of the political power to mark its presence on the territory; to affirm, to build limits, borders, to arrange its territory, and to consolidate the internal economic markets.

In the sixteenth century, [[Dieppe (Seine-Maritime)|Dieppe]] appeared as an important school of cartography. [[Pierre Desceliers]] allowed the realization of many maps. At the same time, the Portolan maps of the Portuguese sailors had the most recent knowledge obtained by the Dieppois sailors in their exploration of [[Canada]].

Then, cartography progressed more and more, through the development of new techniques and by the will of the political powers to control their territories. Very powerful companies testify support to some of the cartographic missions at the end of the nineteenth century.

There were two decisive stages in cartography. One was determining [[longitude]] and [[latitude]]. Florence Trystram, 2001, '' the lawsuit of the stars '' is an account of the research of three French scientists that was done in South America, 1735-1771.

== {{anchor|Cassini}}Cassini maps ==
In France, the first general maps of the territory using a measuring apparatus were made by the Cassini family during the 18th century on a scale of 1:86,400 (one centimeter on the chart corresponds to approximately 864 meters on the ground). These maps were, for their time, a technical innovation. They were the first maps based on [[geodesy|geodetic]] [[triangulation]], and took more than fifty years to complete; four generations of the Cassini family were involved in their production. These maps, known as "Cassini Maps" or "maps of the Academy," are still referenced by geographers, historians and genealogists.

The work of the Cassinis left its mark on the world; toponyms known as "Cassini signs" still exist, revealing where triangulated measurements at that time were made.

[[File:Olne-cassini.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hand-drawn map of one side of the Valley of [[Vesdre]] by French geographers (led by the Cassini family) from 1745 to 1748]]
The "map of Cassini" or "map of the Academy" is the first general map of the kingdom of [[France]]. It was drawn up by the Cassini family—primarily [[César-François Cassini de Thury]] (Cassini III) and his son [[Dominique, comte de Cassini|Jean-Dominique Cassini]] (Cassini IV)—during the 18th century. The adopted scale is one [[Line (unit)|line]] to 100 [[toise]]s, or 1:86,400 (the measuring apparatus contained 864 lines).

The map does not pinpoint dwellings or the boundaries of marshes and forests; however, the level of precision of the road networks is such that satellite photographs correspond almost completely with drawn roads more than 200 years later.

This map is still consulted today by researchers. It interests historians, in particular those in the fields of geography, genealogy and [[ecology]].

=== {{anchor|First operations}}Introduction ===
[[Image:France cotes academie.png|thumb|300px|Map of the French coast, corrected by the Academy of Science]]
The map of Cassini is the first geometrical map covering the entire kingdom of France. Before the surveys, it was necessary to carry out a triangulation of the territory.

=== {{anchor|Objectives}}Purpose ===
[[César-François Cassini de Thury|César-François Cassini]] (Cassini III) began the map:
* To measure distances by triangulation, ensuring the exact positioning of locations
* To measure the kingdom, determining the number of boroughs, cities and villages
* To depict unchanging landscape features

===Survey maps===
The surveys were carried out between 1756 and 1789 and the 181 sheets composing the map were published from 1756 to 1815. [[César-François Cassini de Thury|César-François Cassini]] died in 1784 with his work unfinished. His son, [[Dominique, comte de Cassini|Jean-Dominique Cassini]] (1748–1845), later finished the work of his father.

The departments of [[Savoy]], [[Haute-Savoie]] and part of the [[Maritime Alps]] were not part of the Kingdom of France at the time, and are not represented on the map; neither are the [[Île d'Yeu]] and [[Corsica]]. Most of the map sheets were published as a new edition in 1815.

== Replacement by Napoleon I ==
In 1808, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]] decided to produce a map intended to be more accurate than that of Cassini. However, Napoleon demanded that the primary goal of the work was to produce battlefield maps.

The triangulation for this new map began also from the [[Paris meridian]] arc or French meridian line (French: Méridienne de France) surveyed this time by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] and [[Pierre Méchain|Méchain]]. Work on this map took place between 1817 and 1866. During this period several different scales were tested, with the scale 1:80,000 being chosen. This became known as the "Geological Survey" map. The funding for this work was provided by the Department of War. The first work was done by the ''Dépôt de la guerre'', and later by the Geographical Service of the Army, whose first director General [[François Perrier (French Army officer)|François Perrier]] and his successor General Bassot remeasured the French [[meridian arc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Earth, Figure of the|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Earth,_Figure_of_the|journal=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|volume= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally produced as a mosaic of maps, pasted to fabric, folded and protected by a hard case. This allowed it to be transported with the army, and to survive the rigors of ground combat.

At the beginning of the [[First World War]] (1914–1918), the difficulties of reading a map on this scale led the generals to request new map drawn to the 1:50 000 scale. This was more convenient, and practical, since one metre on the map equaled 50 kilometres. These new maps formed the basis for the current "Map of Excursion", which is at a scale of 1:25,000.

== IGN ==

The Institut Géographique National (English: National Geographic Institute) or IGN is a French public state administrative establishment founded in 1940[1] to produce and maintain geographical information for France and its overseas departments and territories.

“Intense cartographic work planned for the beginning of the war was stopped by the defeat of France in June 1940. Shortly afterward the great map service known to the world as the [[Service Géographique de l’Armée Française]] was demilitarized and renamed Institut National Géographique. Under this label, which it still bears, it continued to function, its activities including the opening of a new school for cartographers in the famous building of the [[Hotel de Rohan]] in Paris. A few more sheets of the 1:50,000 map of France were published. The main progress was achieved by the [[African Army Map Service]], which was able to pursue field work, particularly in the [[Sahara]]. The list of maps of French Africa have lengthened notably."&lt;ref&gt;Gottman, Jean. 1946. “French Geography in Wartime.” The Geographical Review. Volume 36, 1946. Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Institut Géographique National}}

=== Recent developments ===
Its activities abroad begin into 1986 within a new subsidiary private company IGN France International.

From 2000, the IGN develops the concept of Reference frame on a Large Scale (référentiel à grande échelle = RGE); it is a question of completing within a deadline short digitalization the cartography of the French territory with a meter scale and according to four components: topography, land registry and address. This RGE is entirely completed at the end of 2008. Then it enter in a cycle of maintenance In June 2006, the IGN opened the service [[Géoportail]] allowing the cartographic visualization of the French territory on a Web navigator and using on one hand funds of air photographs and on the other hand the digitized maps to the 1/25 000. “Phase 2” of Géoportail was put on line one year later, with a new ergonomics.

At the end of 2006, the IGN was implied in the production of a receiver [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], for the excursion and automobile navigation, called Evadeo. The software of [[navigation]] was provided by [[BCI SA|BCI]] navigation (replaced in 2008 by [http://www.compegps.com CompeGPS]), the road data are of [[Navteq]] and it [[Circuit intégré|puce]] GPS of [[SiRF]], and the IGN provides a part with extracts of its maps at various scales.

In June 2007, the IGN started offering a service whereby it is possible to have a map printed centred on any location in France. This is similar to the service offered in [[Great Britain]] by the [[Ordnance Survey]].

In July 2007, Géportail - an online map service - began offering 3D movable views in a similar style to GoogleEarth. To use this function, it is necessary to install the plugin [[TerraExplorer]].

=== History ===

The IGN is the successor to the geographical Service of the Army (SGA), which was founded in 1887 and disbanded in 1940. The old maps produced by the SCA were divided into two batches: one which remained at the Institute and one which joined the military files of [[Vincennes]]. The general Louis Hurault, who was at the origin of these modifications, was the first director of the IGN. He tried, in vain, to recover the material shared by the Germans. A law in ten articles is signed the 14 in order to define the functions of the IGN. The statutes had been signed the 8. This established, in example, the national School of geographical sciences in order to train Cartographical engineers.
&lt;!--was created by law the 27--&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the IGN became famous for its counterfeiters. The cartographers are indeed experts in penmanship and the material necessary to the production of fake identity papers was available to the Institute. Certain engineers of the IGN were in contact with the services of allied information based in London. In secret, they brought a complete set of maps to London covering France and North Africa in order to replace maps destroyed in a bombardment.

The agents of the IGN took an active part in armed resistance in 1943. Several agents were shot by the Germans or died in action. Between September 1944 and on May 8, 1945, the IGN was under the control of the “provisional government” and most of its personnel and of his services are transformed into “military geographical Service”. At the end of the war, the IGN received the thanks of Generals Bradley and Eisenhower.

Between 1945 and 1946, the debate is intense concerning the future of the IGN, last creation of the Third Republic. A law is finally signed the 8. It confirms the membership of the IGN to the Ministry of works and create the “geographical Section of staff of the Army”, new section in charge of the military map.

In 1947, the IGN receives the mission of covering the whole France, but also all the dependents’ territories, like North Africa, Western Africa, Madagascar, the countries associated with Indochina and the departments and overseas territories. The task is considerable with more than 12 million km ² being covered. The independence of these countries will have as a consequence the creation of national services in each country (examples: DTGC in Senegal, IGN-N in Niger).

The IGN then initiates a period of active co-operation with the majority of these organizations by providing some engineers of the IGN and also receive the students of the ENSG who intended to become the executives of the cartographic services of new independent countries. The activity of the IGN apart from the French territory also develops by the control geodesic project(Ecuador 1975, Libya 1979, Saudi Arabia 1981), of cartography (Saudi Arabia, Burundi, Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin…).

1982 to 1988, the control of a large topometric project and numerical cartography in Riyadh is the occasion to massively introduce digital techniques into the processing production; in parallel, the idea of a topoland data base emerges at meetings of the “national Commission of the geographical information” chaired by Guy Lengagne; this commission returns his report in 1983 and outlines numerical geographical information then in agreement with the period of the basic map with 1:25 000. Publicly owned establishment related to administration since the January 1, 1967, it is placed under the supervision of the ministry for Transport, the equipment, tourism and the sea.

In 1971, the IGN and the CNES form the “Group of research of geodesic space”. This collaboration between the IGN and the CNES continues with the launching of the program SPOT the 5. The launching of satellite SPOT-1 takes place the 22.Six days after take SPOT-1 in orbit, the IGN create its programme of “data bases launches”, the “data bases”. The data base of the cities, the data base of leveling distribution, the data base of geodesic distribution, the aerial missions data base and the toponyms data base were progressively establish . The “Topo data base”, bases of topographic data digitized, covers from now on the whole
France and include nearly two million toponyms .

The '''geography of Hong Kong''' primarily consists of three main territories: [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Kowloon Peninsula]], and the [[New Territories]].

The name "[[Hong Kong]]", literally meaning "fragrant harbour", is derived from the area around present-day [[Aberdeen, Hong Kong|Aberdeen]] on Hong Kong Island, where fragrant wood products and  incense were once traded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.hku.hk/visithk/Volumes/Vol_1/VHK_Vol-1_6.pdf Visit Hong Kong: Volume 1, Spring, 2004 (p.14)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207083030/http://ec.hku.hk/visithk/Volumes/Vol_1/VHK_Vol-1_6.pdf |date=7 December 2006 }}, University of Hong Kong English Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrow body of water separating Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula, [[Victoria Harbour]], is one of the deepest natural maritime [[port]]s in the world. Hong Kong and its 260 territorial islands and peninsulas are located in the [[South China Sea]], at the mouth of the [[Pearl River Delta]].

The Kowloon Peninsula to the south of [[Boundary Street]] and the New Territories to the north of Hong Kong Island were added to [[Colonial Hong Kong]] in 1860 and 1898 respectively. The landscape of Hong Kong is fairly hilly to mountainous with steep slopes. The highest point in the territory is [[Tai Mo Shan]], at a height of 958 metres.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hk.html "Hong Kong"] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5glwctzKV?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hk.html |date=14 May 2009 }}. ''The World Factbook''. CIA. Retrieved 18 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Lowlands exist in the northwestern part of the New Territories.

Hong Kong is 60&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Macau]] on the opposite side of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River estuary]]. It has a land border with [[Shenzhen]] to the north.  The remaining land is reserved as country parks and nature reserves.

===Natural resources===
The natural resources of Hong Kong can be divided into three main categories:

*Metalliferous minerals and non-metalliferous industrial minerals in the onshore area;
*Quarried rock and building stone;
*Offshore sand deposits.

Despite its small size, Hong Kong has a relatively large number of mineral occurrences. Some mineral deposits have been exploited commercially. Metalliferous mineral occurrences are grouped into four broad categories: [[tin]]-[[tungsten]]-[[molybdenum]] mineralisation, [[copper]]-[[lead]]-[[zinc]] mineralisation, [[iron]] mineralisation and placer deposits of [[tin]] and [[gold]]. [[Mesozoic]] igneous activity is largely responsible for this diversity of mineral deposits and the mineral concentrations have been variably enhanced by hydrothermal activity associated with faulting. Concentrations of non-metalliferous minerals that have been commercially exploited include [[kaolin clay]], [[feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[beryl]] and [[graphite]].&lt;ref name = "rypjxf"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=R.J. Sewell |author2=S.D.G. Campbell |author3=C.J.N. Fletcher |author4=K.W. Lai |author5=P.A. Kirk |title=The Pre-Quaternary Geology of Hong Kong|year=2000|publisher=Government of Hong Kong SAR|isbn=962-02-0299-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, [[granite]] and [[volcanic rocks]] have been quarried locally for road base metal, riprap, armour stone and asphalt, although the main purpose now is for concrete [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]]. At present, there are three quarries operating in Hong Kong. These are principally in granite and are located at [[Lam Tei]], [[Shek O]] and [[Anderson Road, Hong Kong|Anderson Road]]. All the quarries are in the process of rehabilitation and have a life expectancy of between two and eight years.&lt;ref name = "rypjxf"/&gt;

Offshore sand bodies have been dredged for aggregate sand and reclamation fill in Hong Kong as the rate of urban development has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=J.A. Fyfe, R.Shaw, S.D.G. Campbell, K.W. Lai &amp; P.A. Kirk|title=The Quaternary Geology of Hong Kong|year=2000|publisher=Government of Hong Kong SAR|isbn=962-02-0298-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional natural resources include forest and wildlife.

'''Green Cross International''' ('''GCI''') is a global independent non-profit and non-governmental [[List of environmental organisations|environmental organisation]] ([[NGO]]) working to address the inter-connected global challenges of [[security]], [[poverty]] eradication and [[environmental degradation]] through a combination of advocacy and local projects. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/|title=Green Cross International Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded by former [[Soviet Union]] President and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1993, building upon the work started by the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalgreen.org/about/gci.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121035932/http://www.globalgreen.org/about/gci.html |archivedate=21 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Cross International has been an active player in the [[Rio+20]] conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gcint.org/news/green-cross-returns-rio| title= Green Cross returns to Rio| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20141126170413/http://www.gcint.org/news/green-cross-returns-rio| archivedate= 26 November 2014| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GCI is headquartered in [[Geneva]] and has a growing network of national organizations in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/who-we-are/our-network|title= Our network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In January 1990 during an address to the Global Forum on Environment and Development for Survival, President Mikhail Gorbachev (the former President of the [[USSR]]) brought up the idea for an organisation that would apply the medical emergency response model of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] to ecological issues and expedite solutions to [[environmental problems]] that transcend national boundaries.

Developing this idea, delegates at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro (June 1992), approached Mikhail Gorbachev urging him to create and launch such an organisation. Meanwhile, the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] Parliamentarian Roland Wiederkehr founded the 'World Green Cross' with the same objective. The two organisations merged in 1993 to form Green Cross International (GCI).
 
GCI was then formally launched in [[Kyoto]] on 18 April 1993. Upon the invitation of Mikhail Gorbachev, many renowned figures joined its [[Board of Directors]] and its [[Honorary Board]].

Green Cross International has a general consultative status with the [[Economic and Social Council of the United Nations]] and with [[UNESCO]]. It is also an [[observer organisation]] with the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and has regular cooperation with [[UNEP]], [[UN-OCHA]] and [[UN-HABITAT]] as well as other [[international organisations]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/our-history|title= Our history }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
To date, Green Cross International is represented in 31 countries around the world. National offices are located in Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Canada, Côte d'Ivoire, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/who-we-are/our-network|title= Our network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mikhail Gorbachev==
[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] – [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate and former President of the [[USSR]] - is the Founding President of Green Cross International, which he established in 1993 in response to the 1992 Rio Earth Summit call to create a “Red Cross for the environment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/our-history|title= Our history }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of Activity==
From [[advocacy]] programmes at national and international levels to training individuals on how to construct [[rainwater harvesting]] systems, Green Cross provides comprehensive programmes that further the values of cooperation among all stakeholders. The human relationship with nature crosses all boundaries and transcends all ideas of class, which necessitates a solution that goes beyond [[good governance]] and good policy, and hinges on the shared responsibility for a [[sustainable]] and just [[future]] for all.

=== Water for Peace Programme ===
GCI has various [[water]] related activities seeking to [[Pollution prevention|prevent]] and resolve [[Organizational conflict|conflict]]s over [[natural resources]]. The objectives are to promote [[cooperation]] between countries that share [[river]] waters and [[sanitation]] needs of people for [[water]]. GCI focuses its programs on the nexus between [[security]], [[poverty]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. The organization works to address these issues both at an [[advocacy]] level with key international stakeholders, [[Advertising campaign|campaign]]s and local projects to address these inter-connected challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/water-for-life-and-peace |title= Water for Life and Peace }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
GCI has launched the following initiatives:
*''' Right to Water and [[Sanitation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/right-to-water-and-sanitation |title= Right to Water and Sanitation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''' Water for [[Peace]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/water-for-peace |title= Water for Peace }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''' Smart Water for Green Schools &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/smart-water-for-green-schools |title= Smart Water for Green Schools }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Right to Water and Sanitation ====
Green Cross supported the drive for safe-drinking water and sanitation to be recognized as a Human Right in 2010.

In August 2014, the UN Watercourses Convention entered into force following Vietnam’s ratification of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/right-to-water-and-sanitation |title= Right to Water and Sanitation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Smart Water for Green Schools ====
The Smart Water for Green Schools (SWGS) project is our flagship on-the-ground activity for providing sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation to tens of thousands of people in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe, with more countries coming online in the future.

SWGS is currently providing safe drinking water to more than 70,000 people within around 70 communities in Argentina, Bolivia, China, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mexico and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/smart-water-for-green-schools |title= Smart Water for Green Schools }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental Security and Sustainability ===
[[Weapons of mass destruction]] pose clear threats to the environment and people. [[Oil spills]] and [[toxic waste dumps]] are common. These toxic waste dumps can result in a variety of [[List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]]. The Green Cross Environmental Security and Sustainability (ESS) programme works to address these challenges with [[education]], outreach, dialogue, assessments, and action. 20,000 [[nuclear weapons]] are stockpiled in nine countries – enough to destroy [[civilization]]. The program has managed to clean up dumped toxic [[chemicals]], including pesticides and agricultural fertilizers, in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/environmental-security-and-sustainability |title= Environmental Security and Sustainability }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following initiatives are part of the Environmental Security and Sustainability Programme:
*''' [[Nonproliferation]], [[arms control]], [[disarmament]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/nonproliferation-arms-control-disarmament |title= Non-proliferation and arms control disarmament }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''' Weapons demilitarization &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/weapons-demilitarization |title= Weapons demilitarization }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''' [[Pollution]] reduction, toxic waste cleanup &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/pollution-reduction-and-toxic-waste-cleanup |title= Pollution reduction and toxic waste cleanup |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010104/http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/pollution-reduction-and-toxic-waste-cleanup |archivedate= 27 October 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''' Environmental emergencies preparedness &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/environmental-emergencies-preparedness |title= Environmental emergencies preparedness |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010059/http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/environmental-emergencies-preparedness |archivedate= 27 October 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value Change ===
GCI seeks to attain a value and behaviour shift through initiatives such as the [[Earth Charter]], the Earth Dialogues and the Environmental Education and Awareness Programme. The idea is to sensitise people with a positive awareness of and responsibility towards these common threats to [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]] posed by [[poverty]], insecurity and environmental destruction. Positive awareness of, and responsibility of actions and environment are important in order to promotes and secure conditions for all people to enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/value-change |title= Value Change }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The following three initiatives fall under the Value Change programme:
*''' Education for Environmental Sustainability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/environmental-education |title= Environmental Education }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''' Earth Charter &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/earth-charter |title= Earth Charter }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''' Earth Dialogues &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/earth-dialogues |title= Earth Dialogues }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social and Medical (SOCMED) ===
The Legacy of the [[Cold War]] Programme, the Social and Medical Care Programme and Post-War Environmental Analysis are implemented worldwide to assist those affected by the environmental consequences of [[wars]], conflicts and man-made calamities. Activities include support to children, families and communities suffering long-term socio-economic, medical and psychological stresses brought on by exposure to the [[Chernobyl]] nuclear disaster and the use of [[Agent Orange]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/social-and-medical |title= Social and Medical }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of previously implemented projects include analysis of the environmental impacts of wars and conflicts in [[Kuwait]], [[the Middle East]], [[the Balkans]], [[Argentina]], [[Burkina Faso]], and [[South Asia]], ensuring that environmental rehabilitation is now regularly included within the umbrella of humanitarian assistance during and following conflicts. Expertise has also been developed in the [[clean-up]] and conversion of military bases to civilian use, dealing with [[nuclear contamination]], and the environmentally responsible destruction of conventional and [[chemical weapons]] stockpiles.

The following initiatives address GCI’s SOCMED programme:
*''' [[Health care]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/health-care |title= Health Care }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' Social care &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/social-care |title= Social Care }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' [[Education]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/education |title= Education }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart Energy ===
Rising [[global energy]] demand and over-reliance on [[fossil fuels]] are the main drivers of [[climate change]]. To meet the needs of over 9 billion people by 2050, [[energy production]] must double. But to protect the climate, [[greenhouse gas emissions]] must be cut by 80%. Maintaining the same path is a recipe for environmental and humanitarian disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/smart-energy |title= Smart Energy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smart Energy programme works to foster a secure, equitable and [[sustainable energy]] future. Advocacy and practical projects are means to promote energy conservation and accelerate the transition from a carbon-based [[economy]] to a clean and [[sustainable energy]] model accessible to all.

Elements of the Smart Energy Programme:

The '''Grenadines''' are a chain of small islands that lie on a line between the larger islands of [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]] and [[Grenada]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. The northern two-thirds of the chain, including about 32 islands and cays, are part of the country of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. Nine are inhabited, including the mainland Saint Vincent and the Grenadines islands: Young Island, Bequia, Mustique, Canouan, Union Island, Mayreau, Petit St Vincent, and Palm Island.  The southern third of the chain belongs to the country of [[Grenada]]. [[Carriacou]] is the largest And most populated (excluding Grenada)

==Geographic boundaries==
They are divided between the [[island nations]] of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Grenada]]. They lie between the islands of [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] in the north and Grenada in the south. Neither Saint Vincent nor Grenada are Grenadine islands. The islands north of the [[Martinique Channel]] belong to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the islands south of the channel belong to Grenada.

==Larger islands of the Grenadines==

===Saint Vincent and the Grenadines===
The total population of the Grenadine islands within Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is estimated to be 10,234.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Vincent and the Grenadines, Population and Housing Census Preliminary Report 2012|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_-rZ48NySpgNUIya2pfVk5lR1U|publisher=The Census Office, SVG Government|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huascarán''' ({{IPA-es|waskaˈɾan}}) ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: '''Waskaran''') is a [[mountain]] in the [[Peru]]vian province of [[Yungay Province|Yungay]] ([[Ancash Region]]), situated in the [[Cordillera Blanca]] range of the western [[Andes]].  The highest southern summit of Huascarán (Huascarán Sur) is the highest point in [[Peru]], the northern part of Andes (north of [[Lake Titicaca]]) and in all of the [[Earth]]'s [[Tropics]].  Huascarán is the fourth highest mountain in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and South America after [[Aconcagua]], [[Ojos del Salado]], and [[Monte Pissis]].  The mountain was named after [[Huáscar]], a 16th-century [[Inca]] emperor who was the [[Sapa Inca]] of the [[Inca empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The mountain has two distinct summits, the higher being the south one (Huascarán Sur) with an elevation of {{convert|6768|m|0}}.&lt;ref name=h/&gt; The north summit (Huascarán Norte) has an elevation of {{convert|6654|m|0}}.&lt;ref name=h/&gt;  Both summits are separated by a saddle (called 'Garganta'). The core of Huascarán, like much of the Cordillera Blanca, consists of [[Cenozoic]] era [[granite]].&lt;ref name="ricker"&gt;Ricker, John F., ''Yuraq Janka: Cordilleras Blanca and Rosko'', Alpine Club of Canada, 1977, {{ISBN|0-920330-04-5}}, after Wilson, Reyes, and Garayar, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huascarán gives its name to [[Huascarán National Park]] which surrounds it, and is a popular location for trekking and [[mountaineering]]. The Huascarán summit is one of the points on the Earth's surface farthest from the Earth's center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1086384.htm|title=Tall Tales about Highest Peaks|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely behind the farthest point, [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

The summit of Huascarán is the place on Earth with the smallest gravitational force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravity Variations Over Earth Much Bigger Than Previously Thought|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130904105345.htm|date=September 4, 2013|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climbing ==
Huascarán is normally climbed from the village of Musho to the west via a high camp in the col that separates the two summits, known as La Garganta. The ascent normally takes five to seven days, the main difficulties being the large crevasses that often block the route.&lt;ref&gt;Biggar, John&lt;/ref&gt; The normal route is of moderate difficulty and rated between PD and AD (depending on the conditions of the mountain) according to the [[Climbing grade|International French Adjectival System]]. 

On July 20, 2016, nine climbers were caught in an avalanche on Huascarán's normal route at approximately {{Convert|5800|m||abbr=on}}, four of whom died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amountainjourney.com/mountain-climbers-avalanche-huascaran-andes-peru/|title=Avalanche On Huascaran In Andes Of Peru Kills 4, 5 Rescued - A Mountain Journey|date=21 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
The summit of Huascarán Sur was first reached on 20 July 1932 by a joint [[Germany|German]]&amp;ndash;[[Austria]]n expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huascaranperu.net/Ascenciones.htm |title=1932 ascent |publisher=huascaranperu.net |accessdate=2014-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215143016/http://www.huascaranperu.net/Ascenciones.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team followed what would become later the normal route (named today Garganta route). The north peak (Huascarán Norte) had previously been climbed on 2 September 1908 by a [[United States|U.S.]] expedition that included [[Annie Smith Peck]],&lt;ref name=rice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/smithpeck.html|title=Annie Smith Peck|publisher=Dr. Russell A. Potter|accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit this first ascent is somewhat disputed.

In 1989, a group of eight [[amateur]] mountaineers, the "Social Climbers", held what was recognised by the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' (1990 edition) to be "the world's highest dinner party" on top of the mountain, as documented by [[Chris Darwin]] and [[John Amy]] in their book ''The Social Climbers'', and raised [[British pound|£]]10,000 for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=ABC de la evolución | first=Julián | last=Monge-Nájera | publisher=EUNED | year=1995 | isbn=9977-64-822-0 | page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/1705342.mouthwatering_challenge/ | journal=Epping Forest Guardian | title=Mouth-watering challenge | date=21 September 2007 | accessdate=2011-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Huascarán Norte ===
Apart from the normal route, climbed in 1908 and rated PD+/AD-, all the other routes are committing and serious.
# Northwest ridge ('Italian' route), rated ED1/ED2 climbed on 25 July 1974 by E. Detomasi, C. Piazzo, D. Saettone and T. Vidone. 
# Northwest face ('Polish-Czech' variant), rated ED1/ED2, climbed on 14 July 1985 by B. Danihelkova, Z. Hoffmanova, A. Kaploniak, E. Parnejko and E. Szezesniak.
# North face ('Paragot' route), rated ED1, climbed on 10 July 1966 by R. Paragot, R. Jacob, C. Jacoux and D. Leprince-Ringuet.
# North face ('Swiss' route), rated ED2+, climbed on 23 May 1986 by D. Anker and K. Saurer. This route requires at least four days on the face.
# North face ('Spanish' route), rated ED2+, climbed on 20 July 1983 by J. Moreno, C. Valles and J. Tomas.

=== Huascarán Sur ===
As for the North summit, apart the normal route all the others are difficult.
# West ridge ('Shield' route), rated D+, climbed on 15 June 1969 by W. Broda, S. Merler and B. Segger. Approach as for the Garganta route but after the route develops over the knife-edge West ridge before getting to the summit icefield.
# West ridge direct ('Lomo fino' route), rated TD-, was climbed on 7 July 2007 by M. Ybarra and S. Sparano. Approach as for the Garganta route but after the route develops straight over the West face.
# Northeast ridge ('Spanish' route), rated TD+, was climbed on 18 July 1961 by F. Mautino, P. Acuna, A. Perez and S. Rivas. The route starts from Chopicalqui col, takes across the upper part of the Matara glacier and reaches the northeast ridge developing across cornices and snow mushrooms.

== 1970 earthquake ==

On 31 May 1970, the [[1970 Ancash earthquake|Ancash earthquake]] caused a substantial part of the north side of the mountain to collapse. The avalanche mass, an estimated {{Convert|80|e6m3||abbr=off}} of ice, mud and rock, was about half a mile wide and a mile long ({{Convert|0.5x1|mi||1|disp=out}}). It advanced about {{convert|11|mi|km}} at an average speed of {{Convert|280|to|335|km/h|abbr=on|round=5}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iris.edu/seismo/quakes/1970peru/Plafker1971.pdf|title=Geological Aspects of the May 31, 1970 Peru Earthquake|work=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|date=June 1971|volume=61|issue=2|pages=543–578|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; burying the towns of [[Yungay, Peru|Yungay]] and [[Ranrahirca]] under ice and rock, killing more than 20,000 people.&lt;ref name="basusdi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Dept. of the Interior|date=October 1970|title=The Peru Earthquake: a Special Study|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|volume=26|issue=8|pages=17–19|&lt;!--accessdate=30 May 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jayfrogel.com/Peru98/Peru98_Yungay/0Peru98_Yungay_home.html |title=The Village of Yungay and the Surrounding Countryside |publisher=Jay A.

===Greek name===
The word ''Iberia'' is a noun adapted from the [[Latin]] word "Hiberia" originated by the [[Ancient Greek]] word Ἰβηρία (''{{transl|el|Ibēríā}}'') by Greek geographers under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]] to refer to what is known today in English as the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="LyonsPapadopoulos2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claire L.

With the fall of the Roman Empire and the establishment of the new Castillian language in Spain, the word "Iberia" appeared for the first time in use as a direct 'descendant' of the Greek word "Ἰβηρία" and the Roman word "Hiberia". 

The ancient Greeks reached the Iberian Peninsula, of which they had heard from the [[Phoenicians]], by voyaging westward on the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="WaldmanMason2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carl Waldman|author2=Catherine Mason|title=Encyclopedia of European Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC&amp;pg=PA404|year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2918-1|page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] was the first known to use the term ''Iberia'', which he wrote about circa 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strabo|authorlink=Strabo|others=Horace Leonard Jones (trans.) |title=The Geography|volume=II|date=1988|publisher=Bill Thayer|location=Cambridge|language=ancient Greek, English|page=118, Note 1 on 3.4.19|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3D*.html#note124}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] of Halicarnassus says of the [[Phocaea]]ns that "it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with...

[[Polybius]] respects that limit,&lt;ref&gt;III.37.&lt;/ref&gt; but identifies Iberia as the Mediterranean side as far south as [[Gibraltar]], with the Atlantic side having no name. Elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;III.17.&lt;/ref&gt; he says that [[Sagunto|Saguntum]] is "on the seaward foot of the range of hills connecting Iberia and Celtiberia."

Strabo&lt;ref&gt;III.4.11.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the Carretanians as people "of the Iberian stock" living in the [[Pyrenees]], who are distinct from either [[Celts]] or [[Celtiberians]].

===Roman names===
{{main article|Hispania}}
According to [[Charles Ebel]], the ancient sources in both Latin and Greek use Hispania and Hiberia (Greek: Iberia) as synonyms. The confusion of the words was because of an overlapping in political and geographic perspectives. The Latin word ''Hiberia'', similar to the Greek ''Iberia'', literally translates to "land of the Hiberians". This word was derived from the river Ebro, which the Romans called ''Hiberus''. ''Hiber'' (Iberian) was thus used as a term for peoples living near the river Ebro.&lt;ref name="Ebel1976" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaffiot1934"&gt;{{cite book|author=Félix Gaffiot|title=Dictionnaire illustré latin-français|url=https://archive.org/stream/FelixGaffiotDictionnaireIllustr.LatinFrancais/DictionnaireIllustr-Latin-Franais#page/n773/mode/2up|year=1934|publisher=Hachette|page=764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention in Roman literature was by the annalist poet [[Ennius]] in 200 BC.&lt;ref name="Woolf2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Greg Woolf]]|title=Rome: An Empire's Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wb13HpLmecgC&amp;pg=PA18|date=8 June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-997217-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Berkshire Review|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WJ4xAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Quintus%20Ennius%22|year=1965|publisher=Williams College|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vega2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carlos B.

As they became politically interested in the former Carthaginian territories, the Romans began to use the names ''Hispania Citerior'' and ''Hispania Ulterior'' for 'near' and 'far' Hispania. At the time Hispania was made up of three [[Roman province]]s: [[Hispania Baetica]], [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], and [[Hispania Lusitania]]. Strabo says&lt;ref name="III.4.19"/&gt; that the Romans use ''Hispania'' and ''Iberia'' synonymously, distinguishing between the ''near'' northern and the ''far'' southern provinces. (The name "Iberia" was ambiguous, being also the name of the [[Kingdom of Iberia]] in the Caucasus.)

Whatever language may generally have been spoken on the peninsula soon gave way to Latin, except for that of the [[Vascones]], which was preserved as a [[language isolate]] by the barrier of the Pyrenees.

==Etymology==
[[File:Sesars.svg|thumb|Northeast Iberian script from [[Huesca (province)|Huesca]].]]

The Iberian Peninsula has always been associated with the [[Ebro]], Ibēros in [[ancient Greek]] and Ibērus or Hibērus in [[Latin]]. The association was so well known it was hardly necessary to state; for example, Ibēria was the country "this side of the Ibērus" in Strabo. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] goes so far as to assert that the Greeks had called "the whole of Spain" Hiberia because of the Hiberus River.&lt;ref&gt;III.3.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The river appears in the [[Ebro Treaty]] of 226 BC between Rome and Carthage, setting the limit of Carthaginian interest at the Ebro. The fullest description of the treaty, stated in [[Appian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Horace| last=White|author2=Jona Lendering|title=Appian's History of Rome: The Spanish Wars (§§6–10)|url= http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_spain_02.html#%A77|publisher=livius.org|accessdate= 1 December 2008|pages=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses Ibērus. With reference to this border, [[Polybius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polybius: The Histories: III.6.2|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/3*.html|publisher=Bill Thayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the "native name" is ''Ibēr'', apparently the original word, stripped of its Greek or Latin ''-os'' or ''-us'' termination.

The early range of these natives, which geographers and historians place from today's southern Spain to today's southern France along the Mediterranean coast, is marked by instances of a readable script expressing a yet unknown language, dubbed "[[Iberian language|Iberian]]." Whether this was the native name or was given to them by the Greeks for their residence on the Ebro remains unknown. Credence in Polybius imposes certain limitations on etymologizing: if the language remains unknown, the meanings of the words, including Iber, must also remain unknown. In modern [[basque language|Basque]], the word ''ibar''&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;[http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/dictionary.htm Morris Student Plus], Basque-English dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; means "valley" or "watered meadow", while ''ibai''&lt;ref name="Morris"/&gt; means "river", but there is no proof relating the etymology of the Ebro River with these Basque names. In [[Serbian language|Serbia]], there is river [[Ibar (river)|Ibar]], but there is no proof relating the etymology of the Ebro River with this Serbian river name.

===Palaeolithic===
The Iberian Peninsula has been inhabited for at least 1.2 million years as remains found in the sites in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]] demonstrate. Among these sites is the cave of [[Gran Dolina]], where six [[hominini|hominin]] skeletons, dated between 780,000 and one million years ago, were found in 1994. Experts have debated whether these skeletons belong to the species ''[[Homo erectus]]'', ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', or a new species called ''[[Homo antecessor]]''.

Around 200,000 [[Before Present|BP]], during the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period, Neanderthals first entered the Iberian Peninsula. Around 70,000 BP, during the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period, the last glacial event began and the Neanderthal [[Mousterian]] culture was established. Around 37,000 BP, during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], the Neanderthal [[Châtelperronian]] cultural period began. Emanating from [[Southern France]], this culture extended into the north of the peninsula. It continued to exist until around 30,000 BP, when Neanderthal man faced extinction.

About 40,000 years ago, [[anatomically modern humans]] entered the Iberian Peninsula from [[Southern France]].&lt;ref name="Adams2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Adams|title=Species Richness: Patterns in the Diversity of Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&amp;pg=PA208|date=26 February 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-74278-4|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, this [[Population genetics|genetically homogeneous population]] (characterized by the [[Haplogroup R1#Paragroup R-M173|M173 mutation]] in the [[Y chromosome]]), developed the M343 mutation, giving rise to [[Haplogroup R1b]], still the most common in modern [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA) |url=http://www.northamericanpharmacal.com/wiki/wiki.pl/Haplogroup_R1b_%28Y-DNA%29 |work=NAP Professional |publisher=North American Pharmacal |author=Persistent Entity |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312025815/http://www.northamericanpharmacal.com/wiki/wiki.pl/Haplogroup_R1b_%28Y-DNA%29 |archivedate=12 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the Iberian Peninsula, modern humans developed a series of different cultures, such as the [[Aurignacian]], [[Gravettian]], [[Solutrean]] and [[Magdalenian]] cultures, some of them characterized by the complex forms of the [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]].

===Neolithic===
During the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic expansion]], various [[megalithic]] cultures developed in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.raco.cat/index.php/Rubricatum/article/viewFile/270071/357640 |title=Redes y expansión del Neolítico en la Península Ibérica |first=Bernat |last=Martí Oliver |year=2012 |access-date=1 September 2018 |journal=Rubricatum.

These people may have had some relation to the subsequent development of the [[Iberians|Iberian civilization]].

===Chalcolithic===
In the [[Chalcolithic]] (c. 3000 BC), a series of complex cultures developed that would give rise to the peninsula's [[first civilization]]s and to extensive exchange networks reaching to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. Around 2800 – 2700 BC, the [[Beaker culture]], which produced the ''Maritime Bell Beaker'', probably originated in the vibrant copper-using communities of the [[Tagus]] estuary in Portugal and spread from there to many parts of western Europe.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite book|last=Case|first=H|title='Beakers and Beaker Culture' Beyond Stonehenge: Essays on the Bronze Age in honour of Colin Burgess|year=2007|publisher=Oxbow|location=Oxford|pages=237–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Late Bronze Age, the urban civilisation of [[Tartessos]] developed in the area of modern western [[Andalusia]], characterized by [[Phoenicia]]n influence and using the [[Southwest Paleohispanic script]] for its [[Tartessian language]], not related to the [[Iberian language]].

Early in the first millennium BC, several waves of Pre-Celts and [[Celts]] migrated from [[Central Europe]], thus partially changing the peninsula's ethnic landscape to [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] in its northern and western regions.  In Northwestern Iberia (modern Northern Portugal, Asturias and Galicia), a Celtic culture developed, the [[Castro culture]], with a large number of hill forts and some fortified cities.

==Proto-history==
{{Main article|Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula}}

By the [[Iron Age]], starting in the 7th century BC, the Iberian Peninsula consisted of complex agrarian and urban civilizations, either [[Pre-Celtic]] or Celtic (such as the [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtiberians]], [[Gallaeci]], [[Astures]], [[Celtici]] and others), the cultures of the Iberians in the eastern and southern zones and the cultures of the [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] in the western portion of the Pyrenees.

The seafaring Phoenicians, [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] successively settled along the Mediterranean coast and founded trading colonies there over a period of several centuries. Around 1100 BC, Phoenician merchants founded the trading colony of Gadir or Gades (modern day [[Cádiz]]) near [[Tartessos]]. In the 8th century BC, the first [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|Greek colonies]], such as Emporion (modern [[Empúries]]), were founded along the Mediterranean coast on the east, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians. The Greeks coined the name Iberia, after the river Iber (Ebro). In the sixth century BC, the Carthaginians arrived in the peninsula while struggling with the Greeks for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was Carthago Nova (modern-day [[Cartagena, Spain]]).

==History==

===Roman rule===
{{Main article|Lusitania|Hispania}}
[[File:Conquista Hispania.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Roman conquest: 220 BC - 19 BC]]

In 218 BC, during the [[Second Punic War]] against the Carthaginians, the first [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] troops invaded the Iberian Peninsula; however, it was not until the reign of [[Augustus]] that it was annexed after 200 years of war with the [[Celts]] and [[Iberians]]. The result was the creation of the province of [[Hispania]]. It was divided into [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]] during the late [[Roman Republic]], and during the [[Roman Empire]], it was divided into [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] in the northeast, [[Hispania Baetica]] in the south and [[Lusitania]] in the southwest.

Hispania supplied the Roman Empire with silver, food, olive oil, wine, and metal. The emperors [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], and [[Theodosius I]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger]], and the poets [[Martial]] and [[Lucan]] were born from families living on the Iberian Peninsula.

===Germanic kingdoms===
{{Main article|Visigothic Kingdom|Spania}}
[[File:Hispania 560 AD.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Germanic and Byzantine rule c.560]]

In the early fifth century, [[Germanic peoples]] invaded the peninsula, namely the [[Suebi]], the [[Vandals]] ([[Silingi]] and [[Hasdingi]]) and their allies, the [[Alans]]. Only the kingdom of the Suebi ([[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]]) would endure after the arrival of another wave of Germanic invaders, the [[Visigoths]], who conquered all of the Iberian Peninsula and expelled or partially integrated the Vandals and the Alans. The Visigoths eventually conquered the Suebi kingdom and its capital city, Bracara (modern day [[Braga]]), in 584–585. They would also conquer the [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (552–624) of [[Spania]] in the south of the peninsula and the [[Balearic Islands]].

===Islamic Caliphate===
{{Main article|Al-Andalus|Islam in Spain|Islam in Portugal}}
[[File:Al Andalus &amp; Christian Kingdoms.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Islamic rule: [[al-Andalus]] c.1000]]

In 711, a Muslim army invaded the [[Visigoths|Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania]]. Under [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the Islamic army landed at Gibraltar and, in an eight-year campaign, occupied all except the northern kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula in the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]]. [[Al-Andalus]] ({{lang-ar|الإندلس}},  tr.

From the 8th–15th centuries, only the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula was part of the Islamic world.

===Reconquest===
{{Main article|Reconquista}}
Many of the ousted [[Goths|Gothic]] nobles took refuge in the unconquered north [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. From there, they aimed to reconquer their lands from the Moors; this war of reconquest is known as the [[Reconquista]]. Christian and Muslim kingdoms fought and allied among themselves. The fighting was characterised by raids into Islamic territory with the intent of destroying crops, orchards, and villages, and of killing and enslaving any Muslims they came across. Christian forces were usually better armoured than their Muslim counterparts, with noble and non-noble ''milites'' and ''cavallers'' wearing [[Chain mail|mail]] [[hauberk]]s, separate [[mail coif]]s and metal helmets, and armed with [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], cavalry axes, sword and lances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Warfare in the Medieval World |date=2006 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=9781848846326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, the peninsula housed many small states including the [[Kingdom of Castile]], [[Crown of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre]], [[Kingdom of León]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. The Muslims were driven out of Portugal by 1249. By the end of the thirteenth century, the Spanish Reconquista was largely completed. The last Muslim stronghold was [[Granada]], which was conquered by a combined Castilian and Aragonese force in 1492. Muslims and Jews throughout the period were variously tolerated or shown intolerance in different Christian kingdoms. After the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of Granada]], all Muslims and Jews were ordered to convert to Christianity or face expulsion. Many Jews and Muslims fled to [[North Africa]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while others publicly converted to Christianity and became known respectively as [[Marrano]]s and [[Morisco]]s. However, many of these continued to practice their religion in secret. The Moriscos revolted several times and were ultimately [[expulsion of the Moriscos|forcibly expelled]] from Spain in the early 17th century.

===Post-reconquest===
{{Main article|History of Andorra|History of Gibraltar|History of Portugal|History of Spain}}

The small states gradually amalgamated over time. Portugal was the exception, except for a brief period (1580–1640) during which the whole peninsula was united politically under the [[Iberian Union]]. After that point, the modern position was reached and the peninsula now consists of the countries of Spain and Portugal (excluding their islands—the Portuguese [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]] and the Spanish [[Canary Islands]] and [[Balearic Islands]]; and the Spanish [[exclave]]s of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]), [[Andorra]], [[French Cerdagne]] and Gibraltar.

==Geography and geology==
{{Main article|Geography of Portugal|Geography of Spain}}
The Iberian Peninsula is the westernmost of the three major southern European peninsulas—the Iberian, [[Italian Peninsula|Italian]], and [[Balkans|Balkan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Las redes de Transporte entre la Península Ibérica y el resto de Europa |first=Víctor |last=Sánchez Blanco |journal=Cuadernos de Estrategia |issn=1697-6924 |issue=7 |year=1988 |pages=21-32 |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2772019 |language=es |via=[[Dialnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered on the southeast and east by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and on the north, west, and southwest by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The [[Pyrenees]] mountains are situated along the northeast edge of the peninsula, where it adjoins the rest of Europe. Its southern tip is very close to the northwest coast of Africa, separated from it by the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The Iberian Peninsula extends from the southernmost extremity at [[Punta de Tarifa]] ({{Coord|36|00|15|N|5|36|37|W|display=inline}}) to the northernmost extremity at [[Punta de Estaca de Bares]] ({{Coord|43|47|38|N|7|41|17|W|display=inline}}) over a distance between lines of latitude of about {{convert|865|km|mi|abbr=on}} based on a [[Latitude#Degree length|degree length]] of {{convert|111|km|mi|abbr=on}} per degree, and from the westernmost extremity at [[Cabo da Roca]] ({{Coord|38|46|51|N|9|29|54|W|display=inline}}) to the easternmost extremity at [[Cap de Creus]] ({{Coord|42|19|09|N|3|19|19|E|display=inline}}) over a distance between lines of longitude at [[40th parallel north|40° N latitude]] of about {{convert|1155|km|mi|abbr=on}} based on an estimated degree length of about {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} for that latitude. The irregular, roughly octagonal shape of the peninsula contained within this spherical [[Quadrangle (geography)|quadrangle]] was compared to an ox-hide by the geographer [[Strabo]].&lt;ref&gt;III.1.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

About three quarters of that rough octagon is the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]], a vast plateau ranging from 610 to 760 m in altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fischer|first=T|year=1920|contribution=The Iberian Peninsula: Spain|editor-last=Mill|editor-first=Hugh Robert|title=The International Geography|publication-place=New York and London|publisher=D.

It is ringed by mountains and contains the sources of most of the rivers, which find their way through gaps in the mountain barriers on all sides.

===Coastline===
The coastline of the Iberian Peninsula is {{convert|3313|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1660|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the Mediterranean side and {{convert|1653|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the Atlantic side.&lt;ref&gt;These figures sum the figures given in the Wikipedia articles on the geography of Spain and Portugal. Most figures from Internet sources on Spain and Portugal include the coastlines of the islands owned by each country and thus are not a reliable guide to the coastline of the peninsula. Moreover, the length of a coastline may vary significantly depending on where and how it is measured.&lt;/ref&gt; The coast has been inundated over time, with sea levels having risen from a minimum of {{convert|115|-|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} lower than today at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) to its current level at 4,000 years [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=305|contribution=Evolution of groundwater systems at the European coastline|first=WM|last=Edmunds|author2=K Hinsby |author3=C Marlin |author4=MT Condesso de Melo |author5=M Manyano |author6=R Vaikmae |author7= Y Travi |title=Palaeowaters in Coastal Europe: Evolution of Groundwater Since the Late Pleistocene|editor1-first=W.

An estimated {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} length of Atlantic shelf is only {{convert|10|-|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide.

The submarine topography of the coastal waters of the Iberian Peninsula has been studied extensively in the process of drilling for oil. Ultimately, the shelf drops into the [[Bay of Biscay]] on the north (an abyss), the Iberian abyssal plain at {{convert|4800|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the west, and Tagus abyssal plain to the south. In the north, between the continental shelf and the abyss, is an extension called the Galicia Bank, a plateau that also contains the Porto, Vigo, and Vasco da Gama [[seamount]]s, which form the Galicia interior basin. The southern border of these features is marked by [[Nazaré Canyon]], which splits the continental shelf and leads directly into the abyss.

===Rivers===
{{Main article|List of rivers of Portugal|List of rivers of Spain}}
[[File:Rios peninsula Iberica-es.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Major rivers of the Iberian Peninsula: [[Minho River|Miño / Minho]], [[Douro|Duero / Douro]], [[Tagus|Tajo / Tejo]], [[Guadiana]], [[Guadalquivir]], [[Segura]], [[Júcar|Júcar / Xúquer]] and [[Ebro|Ebro / Ebre]].]]

The Tagus is the longest river on the peninsula and, like the Douro, flows westwards with its lower course in Portugal. The Guadiana river bends southwards and forms the border between Spain and Portugal in the last stretch of its course.

===Mountains===

The terrain of the Iberian Peninsula is largely [[mountainous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/centros-tic/04005041/helvia/sitio/upload/tema_8.pdf |title=TEMA 8.- EL RELIEVE DE ESPAÑA |first=José Antonio |last=Manzano Cara |work=CEIP Madre de la Luz |language=es |publisher=[[Junta de Andalucía]] |access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major mountain systems are:
* The [[Pyrenees]] and their foothills, the [[Pre-Pyrenees]], crossing the isthmus of the peninsula so completely as to allow no passage except by mountain road, trail, coastal road or tunnel. [[Aneto]] in the [[Maladeta]] massif, at 3,404 m, is the highest point
* The [[Cantabrian Mountains]] along the northern coast with the massive [[Picos de Europa]]. [[Torre de Cerredo]], at 2,648 m, is the highest point

* The [[Sistema Central]], dividing the [[Iberian Plateau]] into a northern and a southern half and stretching into Portugal (where the highest point of [[Continental Portugal]] (1,993 m) is located in the [[Serra da Estrela]]). [[Pico Almanzor]] in the [[Sierra de Gredos]] is the highest point, at 2,592 m
* The [[Montes de Toledo]], which also stretches into Portugal from the [[La Mancha]] natural region at the eastern end. Its highest point, at 1,603 m, is [[La Villuerca]] in the [[Sierra de Villuercas]], [[Extremadura]]
* The [[Sierra Morena]], which divides the watershed of the Guadiana and Guadalquivir rivers. At 1,332 m, [[Bañuela]] is the highest point
* The [[Baetic System]], which stretches between [[Cádiz]] and Gibraltar and northeast towards [[Alicante Province]]. It is divided into three subsystems:
** [[Prebaetic System]], which begins west of the [[Sierra Sur de Jaén]], reaching the [[Mediterranean Sea]] shores in [[Alicante Province]]. [[La Sagra (peak)|La Sagra]] is the highest point at 2,382 m.

===Geology===
{{Main article|Geology of the Iberian Peninsula}}
[[File:Geological units of the Iberian Peninsula EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Major Geologic Units of the Iberian Peninsula]]
The Iberian Peninsula contains rocks of every geological period from the [[Ediacaran]] to the [[Holocene|Recent]], and almost every kind of rock is represented. World-class [[mineral deposit]]s can also be found there. The core of the Iberian Peninsula consists of a [[Hercynian]] [[craton]]ic block known as the [[Iberian Massif]]. On the northeast, this is bounded by the Pyrenean fold belt, and on the southeast it is bounded by the [[Baetic System]]. These twofold chains are part of the [[Geology of the Alps|Alpine belt]]. To the west, the peninsula is delimited by the continental boundary formed by the [[magma]]-poor opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Hercynian Foldbelt is mostly buried by Mesozoic and Tertiary cover rocks to the east, but nevertheless outcrops through the [[Sistema Ibérico]] and the [[Catalan Mediterranean System]].

===Climate===
{{Main article|Climate of Portugal|Climate of Spain}}
The Iberian peninsula has two dominant climate types. One of these is the [[oceanic climate]] seen in the Atlantic coastal region resulting in evenly temperatures with relatively cool summers. However, most of Portugal and Spain have a [[mediterranean climate]] with various precipitation and temperatures depending on latitude and position versus the sea. There are also more localized [[semi-arid climate]]s in central Spain, with temperatures resembling a more continental mediterranean climate. In other extreme cases highland alpine climates such as in [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and areas with extremely low precitipation and [[desert climate]]s or [[semi-arid climate]]s such as the [[Almería]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=6325O&amp;k=and|title=Standard climate values for Almería|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; area, [[Murcia]] area and southern [[Alicante]] area. In the Spanish interior the hottest temperatures in Europe are found, with [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] averaging around {{convert|37|C|F}} in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=5402&amp;k=and|title=Standard climate values for Córdoba|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish mediterranean coast usually averages around {{convert|30|C|F}} in summer. In sharp contrast [[A Coruña]] at the northern tip of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] has a summer daytime high average at just below {{convert|23|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1387&amp;k=gal|title=Standard climate values for A Coruña|publisher=Aemet.es|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cool and wet summer climate is replicated throughout most of the northern coastline. Winter temperatures are more consistent throughout the peninsula, although frosts are common in the Spanish interior, even though daytime highs are usually above the freezing point. In Portugal, the warmest winters of the country are found in the area of [[Algarve]], very similar to the ones from [[Huelva]] in Spain, while most of the Portuguese Atlantic coast has fresh and humid winters, similar to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

Various other notable cities (populations given are for the cities proper not the metro areas or municipalities) are also present on the peninsula, such as: [[Elche]] (228,647) (part of the [[List of metropolitan areas in Spain|Alicante-Elche-Elda metro area]]), [[Oviedo]] (225,973), [[Badalona]] (220,977) and [[Terrassa]] (215 678) in Spain; and [[Braga]] (192,494), [[Amadora]] (175,558), [[Almada]] (174,030), [[Odivelas]] (144,549) and [[Coimbra]] (143,397) in Portugal.

==Ecology==

===Forests===
{{Main article|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula}}

The woodlands of the Iberian Peninsula are distinct [[ecosystem]]s. Although the various regions are each characterized by distinct vegetation, there are some similarities across the peninsula.

While the borders between these regions are not clearly defined, there is a mutual influence that makes it very hard to establish boundaries and some species find their optimal habitat in the intermediate areas.

===East Atlantic flyway===
The Iberian Peninsula in an important stopover on the East Atlantic [[flyway]] for birds migrating from northern Europe to Africa. For example, [[curlew sandpiper]]s rest in the region of  the [[Bay of Cádiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Migration pattern of Curlew Sandpipers Calidris ferruginea on the south-western coastline of the Iberian Peninsula|first=Francisco|last=Hortas|author2=Jordi Figuerols|format=pdf|url=http://www.ebd.csic.es/jordi/Hortas06.pdf|accessdate= 7 December 2008|year=2006|journal=International Wader Studies|volume=19|pages=144–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the birds migrating through, some seven million wading birds from the north spend the winter in the estuaries and wetlands of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly at locations on the Atlantic coast. In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] are [[Ría de Arousa]] (a home of [[grey plover]]), Ria de [[Ortigueira]], Ria de Corme and Ria de Laxe. In Portugal, the [[Aveiro Lagoon]] hosts [[Avocet|''Recurvirostra avosetta'']], the [[common ringed plover]], [[grey plover]] and [[little stint]]. [[Ribatejo Province]] on the [[Tagus]] supports [[Avocet|''Recurvirostra arosetta'']], grey plover, [[dunlin]], [[bar-tailed godwit]] and [[common redshank]]. In the [[Sado River|Sado Estuary]] are [[dunlin]], [[Eurasian curlew]], grey plover and [[common redshank]]. The [[Algarve]] hosts [[red knot]], [[common greenshank]] and [[turnstone]]. The [[Guadalquivir Marshes]] region of [[Andalusia]] and the Salinas de [[Cádiz]] are especially rich in wintering wading birds: [[Kentish plover]], common ringed plover, [[sanderling]], and [[black-tailed godwit]] in addition to the others. And finally, the Ebro delta is home to all the species mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jesus|last=Dominguez|title=Distribution of estuarine waders wintering in the Iberian Peninsula in 1978–1982|journal=Wader Study Group Bulletin|year=1990|

Basque is the only [[Pre-Indo-European languages|non-Indo-European surviving language]] in Iberia and Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cervantes.es/imagenes/file/biblioteca/situacion_espanol/lengua_%20vasca_vs_espanola.pdf |title=Lengua española y lengua vasca: Una trayectoria histórica sin fronteras |first=M.ª Teresa |last=Echenique Elizondo |journal=Revista de Filología |issue=34 |date=March 2016 |access-date=1 September 2018 |pages=235-252 |issn=0212-4130 |language=es |publisher=[[Instituto Cervantes]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, Spanish (cf. 30 to 40 million speakers), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (cf. around 10 million speakers), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (cf. around 9 million speakers), [[Galician language|Galician]] (cf. around 3 million speakers) and [[Basque language|Basque]] (cf. around 1 million speakers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.eus/r59-738/es/contenidos/noticia/inkesta_soziol_2012/es_berria/berria.html |title=El Gobierno Vasco ha presentado los resultados más destacados de la V.

Spanish and Portuguese have expanded beyond Iberia to the rest of world, becoming [[world language|global languages]].

== Economy ==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
Major industries include mining, tourism, small farms, and fishing. Because the coast is so long, fishing is popular, especially sardines, tuna and anchovies. Most of the mining occurs in the Pyrenees mountains. Commodities mined include: iron, gold, coal, lead, silver, zinc, and salt.

'''Kneiff''' is a [[hill]] in the [[Ardennes]], in the [[Communes of Luxembourg|commune]] of [[Troisvierges]], in northern [[Luxembourg]], near the [[tripoint]] shared with [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]].  At 560 metres, it is the highest point in the country; it is 1 m taller than [[Buurgplaatz]],&lt;ref&gt;ACT (Administration du Cadastre et de la Topographie) Regional Map R1 Clervaux - Huldange 1:20000 (2003) shows 'Kneiff' at 560m and 'Buergplaz' at 559m.&lt;/ref&gt; which is often erroneously considered Luxembourg's highest point.  It lies close to the town of [[Wilwerdange]].

The film industries of the 54 countries that make up [[Africa]] produced over two hundred feature films in [[2014 in film|2014]]. This article fully lists all non-pornographic films, including short films, that had a release date in that year and which were at least partly made by an [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African country]]. It does not include films first released in previous years that had release dates in 2014. Nor does it include films made in countries such as [[France]], [[Spain]] or the [[United Kingdom]], which though they have territories in Africa are primarily non-African states, unless they are co-productions with African countries. &lt;br&gt; Also included is an overview of the major events in African film, including film festivals and awards ceremonies, as well as lists of those films that have been particularly well received, both critically and financially. The year was particularly notable for the release of ''[[Timbuktu (2014 film)|Timbuktu]]'', the first Mauritanian film ever nominated for the Academy Award for best foreign language film.

This is a '''list of Chinese teas'''. [[Chinese tea]] is a beverage made from the leaves of [[tea]] plants  (''[[Camellia sinensis]]'') and – depending on the type of tea – typically 60–100&amp;nbsp;°C hot water. Tea leaves are processed using traditional Chinese methods. Chinese tea is drunk throughout the day, including during meals, as a substitute for plain water, for health, or for simple pleasure.

This article lists the '''Imerina monarchs''', from the earliest origins of the [[Merina people|Merina]] monarchy until the [[French Third Republic|French]] conquest of the [[Merina Kingdom]] during the [[Second Madagascar expedition]].

==Early monarchs in the Merina line==
Below is a list of the line of Merina monarchs that ruled in the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] of [[Madagascar]] and from whom were issued the first true monarchs of a united Madagascar in the 19th century. Before the uniting of Madagascar, succession was based on the current monarch's designation of an heir, typically from among his or her own children. As such, the list below represents a direct genealogical line from the last 19th-century queen of Madagascar to some of the earliest known rulers identified in the 15th century or before. Prior to the 16th century, detailed information about the names and dates of Merina rulers becomes less consistent.  Genealogy in this early period are derived primarily from oral history, while later names and dates are verifiable from primary sources.  These combined sources provide the following list of Merina rulers preceding Andrianampoinimerina's unification of Imerina in the Central Highlands and his son [[Radama I]]'s successful conquest of the majority of Madagascar, bringing the island under his rule.

Asterisks denote names drawn from oral history without substantive evidence to verify the ruler's life or reign, viz., legendary or semi-legendary monarchs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12941">This is a list of countries (and some territories) by the annual prevalence of [[opiate]]s [[Recreational drug use|use]] as percentage of the population aged 15–64 (unless otherwise indicated). 

The primary source of information are the ''World Drug Report 2011'' (WDR 2011) and the ''World Drug Report 2006'' (WDR 2006),&lt;ref name="wdr_2011"&gt;{{cite web| title=World Drug Report 2011 | url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/WDR2011/StatAnnex-consumption.pdf | year = 2011 | publisher = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wdr_2006"&gt;{{cite web| title=World Drug Report 2006 | url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2006.html | year = 2006 | publisher = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC). The indicator is the "annual prevalence" rate which is shown as the percentage of the youth and adult population who have consumed the drugs at least once in the past year. [[Opium production in Afghanistan|The largest producer of opiates]] in the world is Afghanistan to a total of 93% of the world's market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_eng_web.pdf|title=World Drug Report 2009|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list does not include [[opioids]], which is classified as a different drug under the ''World Drug Report 2011'' list, which is considered "opiates and prescription opioids."

'''Luíz Cruls''' or '''Luís Cruls''' or '''Louis Ferdinand Cruls''' (21 January 1848 – 21 June 1908) was a [[Belgian]]-[[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[astronomer]] and [[Geodesy|geodesist]].&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes | journal = Nature | volume = 78 | pages = 240–242 | date = May 1908 | url = https://archive.org/details/nature781908lock}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Director of the Brazilian [[National Observatory (Brazil)|National Observatory]] from 1881 to 1908, led the commission charged with the survey and selection of a future site for the capital of [[Brazil]] in the [[Brazilian Highlands|Central Plateau]],&lt;ref name=Observ1&gt;{{cite web | title =  Biografia Luis Ferdinando Cruls | author =  Observatório Nacional | url =  http://www.on.br/conteudo/institucional/estrutura_int_on/bib_dir/luiz_cruls.html | deadurl =  yes | archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20150222072813/http://www.on.br/conteudo/institucional/estrutura_int_on/bib_dir/luiz_cruls.html | archivedate =  22 February 2015 | df =  dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was co-discoverer of the [[Great Comet of 1882]].&lt;ref name=Hockey&gt;{{cite web | title = Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers: Cruls, Luiz | author = Thomas Hockey | publisher = Springer | date = 2014 | pages = 484 | ISBN = 9781441999160 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t-BF1CHkc50C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruls was also an active proponent of efforts to accurately measure [[Parallax#Solar parallax|solar parallax]]&lt;ref name=Observ1/&gt; and towards that end led a Brazilian team in their observations of [[Transit of Venus, 1882|1882 Transit of Venus]] in [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]].&lt;ref name=Duerbeck&gt;{{cite web | title =  The 1882 Transit of Venus as Seen from Chile; The Brazilian Group | author = Hilmar W.

==Early life==

Cruls was born in 1848 in [[Diest]], Belgium, the son of Philippe Augustin Guillaume Cruls (a civil engineer) and Anne Elizabeth Jordens.&lt;ref name=Mourao&gt;{{cite web | title = Biografia: Cruls, Luis | author = Ronaldo Rogério de Freitas Mourão | publisher = Brasiliana Eletrônica | url = http://www.brasiliana.com.br/pop/pop_bio/5/afba619da1406881d3dfd6e5b11ca4c8 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194310/http://www.brasiliana.com.br/pop/pop_bio/5/afba619da1406881d3dfd6e5b11ca4c8 | archivedate = 23 September 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1863 to 1868, Cruls studied [[civil engineering]] at the [[University of Ghent]]. In 1869 he undertook training as a [[Military engineering|military engineer]] and officer, graduating as a 2nd Lieutenant. Cruls served in the Belgian army, attaining the rank of 1st Lieutenant, until 1873&lt;ref name=Videira&gt;{{cite web | title = Arquivo Luiz Cruls Inventário; Biografia de Luiz Cruls: 1848-1908 | author = Antonio Augusto Passos Videira | publisher = Museu de Astronomia e Ciências Afins | date = 2007 | pages = 7–10 | url = http://www.mast.br/inventarios/inventarios_luiz_cruls.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150223111027/http://www.mast.br/inventarios/inventarios_luiz_cruls.pdf | archivedate = 23 February 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1874&lt;ref name=Mourao/&gt;&lt;ref name=Santos&gt;{{cite book | last = Santos | first = Marco Aurélio Martins | title = Louis Cruls: o Homem Que Seguiu as Estrelas Até a Futura Capital do Brasil | publisher = Instituto Brasileiro de Geografi a e Estatística - IBGE | date = 2010 | location = Rio de Janeiro | pages = 48–50 | url = http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/livros/liv44769.pdf | isbn = 978-85-240-4115-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sources disagree).

Likely inspired by Brazilian friends at University (including Caetano de Almeida Furquim, a fellow engineer), Cruls resigned his commission and set out for Brazil on 5 September 1874.&lt;ref name=Mourao/&gt; During the trans-Atlantic crossing on the steamer ''Orénoque'', Cruls met and became friends with [[Joaquim Nabuco]], a journalist and abolitionist, and also the son of Jose Thomas Nabuco, an influential Brazilian politician. Nabuco's connections were to provide Cruls with access to the highest levels of Brazilian society.&lt;ref name=Lambrechts&gt;{{cite web | title = Louis Cruls: Het leven van een Belgo-Braziliaanse astronoom, ingenieur en avonturier | author = Maarten Lambrechts | url = http://www.maartenlambrechts.be/cruls/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil, Belgium, and back again==

Within weeks after Cruls' arrival in Brazil, Joaquim Nabuco and his father arranged for him to be presented to [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]], Emperor of Brazil, and more importantly, to meet Buarque de Macedo, the Director General of the Ministry of Public Works.&lt;ref name=Mourao/&gt; This latter meeting led to Cruls being hired as an engineer by the Commission of the Empire General Charter ''(Comissão da Carta Geral do Império)''&lt;ref name=Videira/&gt; in the Geodesy section.&lt;ref name=Capile-Vergara&gt;{{cite web | title = Circunstâncias da Cartografia no Brasil oitocentista e a necessidade de uma Carta Geral do Império | author = Bruno Capilé &amp; Moema de Rezende Vergara | journal = Revista Brasileira de História da Ciência | volume = 5 | pages = 37–49 | date = January 2012 | url = http://www.mast.br/informast_mensal/agosto_2013/artigos/artigos_agosto_01.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150225094548/http://www.mast.br/informast_mensal/agosto_2013/artigos/artigos_agosto_01.pdf | archivedate = 25 February 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1875 Cruls was forced to return to Belgium for family reasons. The Commission took Cruls' unexpected return as an opportunity, and assigned him the duty of assisting the Brazilian ambassador in coordinating the receipt and transportation of geodesic instruments that the Commission had previously purchased.&lt;ref name=Mourao/&gt; While in Europe, published his first major paper, ''Discussion of the Methods of Repetition and Reiteration Employed in Geodesy for the Angles''.&lt;ref name=Debehogne-Mourao&gt;{{cite web | title = Un Belge peu connu, Directeur de l'Observatorio Nacional de Rio de Janeiro, est à la Base du Choix de Brasilia | author = H.

This work won Cruls the respect of [[Emmanuel Liais]], director of the Imperial Observatory in [[Rio de Janeiro]], who would later hire him in 1877.&lt;ref name=Barboza&gt;{{cite book | last = Barboza | first = Christina Helena da Motta | editor-last1 = Stols | editor-first1 =  Eddy | editor-last2 = Mascaro | editor-first2 = Luciana Pelaes | editor-last3 = Bueno | editor-first3 = Clodoaldo | title = Brasil e Bélgica: Cinco Séculos de Conexões e Interações | date = 2014 | pages = 109–111 | chapter = Louis Cruls e o Observatório Astronômico no Rio de Janeiro | location = São Paulo | publisher = Narrativa Um | isbn = 978-85-88065-34-5 | url = http://www.brasil-belgica.com/arquivos/Brasil_Belgica_Parte_4_Colaboracao_Cientifica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruls returned to Brazil in June 1875&lt;ref name=Mourao/&gt; and continued his work with the Commission until its dissolution.&lt;ref name=Santos/&gt;

Cruls married Maria Margarida de Oliveira on 26 May 1877. Luiz and Maria would remain married until his death.&lt;ref name=Barboza/&gt; The Cruls made their home in the Rio neighborhood of [[Laranjeiras]]&lt;ref name=Santos/&gt; and had six children: Edmée, Stella, Sylvie, Maria Luísa, Henri (who died as a child), and Gastão.&lt;ref name=Barboza/&gt; {{Interlanguage link multi|Gastão Cruls|pt}} would not only grow up to follow in his father's footsteps and an astronomer and geographer, but also would go on to have a successful career as writer, publishing both novels and non-fiction.&lt;ref name=Fernandes&gt;{{cite web | title = Gastão Luís Cruls | author = Carlos Fernandes | url = http://www.dec.ufcg.edu.br/biografias/GastCrul.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial Observatory==

In December 1877, Emmanuel Liais appointed Cruls to the Commission on Longitude, a position at the Imperial Observatory.&lt;ref name=Mourao/&gt; (After Brazil [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|became a republic]] in 1889, the Observatory's name was changed to Observatory of Rio de Janeiro, and in 1909, to the National Observatory of Brazil, the name by which it is known today.) Over the next two years, under the tutelage of Liais,&lt;ref name=Videira/&gt; Cruls produced several works that helped to build his international reputation as an astronomer:

[[File:Imperial Observatory of Brazil, 1882.png|thumb|[[National Observatory (Brazil)|Imperial Observatory of Brazil]]]]

Cruls would go on to publish a total thirty-five papers, monographs, and books on astronomy in his lifetime;&lt;ref name=Videira/&gt; the majority would be published in ''Comptes Rendus''&lt;ref name=Stroobant&gt;{{cite web | title = Necrologie | author = P.

On 12 February 1881, Cruls was naturalized as a Brazilian citizen by Emperor Dom Pedro II.&lt;ref name=Lambrechts/&gt;&lt;ref name="Araújo"&gt;{{cite web | title = Arquivo Luiz Cruls Inventário; Galeria de Imagens | editor = Vânia Hermes de Araújo | publisher = Museu de Astronomia e Ciências Afins | date = 2007 | pages = 81 | url = http://www.mast.br/inventarios/inventarios_luiz_cruls.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150223111027/http://www.mast.br/inventarios/inventarios_luiz_cruls.pdf | archivedate = 23 February 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cruls took this opportunity to formally change his first name to "Luíz", the Brazilian form of "Louis" or "Luís".&lt;ref name=Santos/&gt; A few months later, Cruls's mentor Emmanuel Liais resigned, and Cruls was appointed as interim director of the Imperial Observatory.&lt;ref name=Videira/&gt; Liais had become worn down by public accusations of scientific incompetence and dishonesty from Manoel Pereira Reis (an astronomer he had dismissed as head of the Commission of the Empire General Charter in 1878) and  returned to [[Cherbourg]], [[France]]. However, Pereira Reis was to transfer his animosity to Cruls, and would remain a persistent critic of Cruls and the Observatory for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Oliveira-Vine&gt;{{cite web | title =  As Polêmicas Entre Manoel Pereira Reis, Emmanuel Liais E Luiz Cruls na Passagem do Século XIX Para o Século XX | author = Januária Teive de Oliveira &amp; Antonio Augusto Steps Vine | journal = Revista da SBHC | pages = 42–52 | date = 2003 | url = http://www.sbhc.org.br/arquivo/download?ID_ARQUIVO=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1882: Cruls' ''annus mirabilis''==

[[File:Great Comet of 1882.jpg|thumb|The Great Comet of 1882]]In his ''[[Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers]]'', Thomas Hockey cites 1882 as Cruls' [[annus mirabilis]].&lt;ref name=Hockey/&gt; In that single year, Cruls co-discovered the Great Comet of 1882,&lt;ref name=Santos/&gt; led a Brazilian expedition in observations of the 1882 Transit of Venus,&lt;ref name=Duerbeck/&gt; and received the [[Valz Prize]] from the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Videira2&gt;{{cite web | title = Luiz Cruls e o Premio Valz de Astronomia | author = Antonio Augusto Passos Videira | journal = Cronos | volume = 7 | number = 1 | pages = 85–104 | date = July 2004 | url = http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/101736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In its obituary for Cruls, [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] cited Cruls' observations of the 1882 Transit of Venus at Punta Arenas as one of his most important achievements in astronomy.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; In 1883, Cruls shared the Valz prize with English astronomer [[William Huggins]] for his work on [[Spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] of the Great Comet of 1882.&lt;ref name=Mourao/&gt;

'''Mahalle''' ({{lang-ar|محلة}} ''maḥallä'', {{lang-fa|محله}} ''maḥallä'') (abbreviated mh. or mah.) is an [[Arabic]] word, adopted into [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (''mahalle''), [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (''mahallë'', or ''mëhallë'' or ''mëhalla''), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (''махала''), [[Greek language|Greek]] (''μαχαλάς'', ''mahalás''), and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (''mahala''), which is variously translated as [[district]], [[Quarter (country subdivision)|quarter]], [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]], or "[[neighborhood]]." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iyimi.net/bilgi-deposu/270795-mahallenin-anlami.html#post297052 Mahallenin Anlamı] {{tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an official administrative unit in many [[Middle Eastern]] countries. In the [[Ottoman Empire]], the mahalle was the smallest administrative entity. The mahalle is generally perceived to play an important role in [[identity formation]], with the local mosque and the local coffee house as the main social institutions. It lies at the intersection of private family life and the public sphere. Important community-level management functions are performed through mahalle solidarity, such as religious ceremonies, life-cycle rituals, resource management and conflict resolution.&lt;ref name=vbulletin&gt;[http://www.uludagsozluk.com/k/mahalle/  uludağ sözlük (vbulletin dictionary){{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mahalle is represented in the municipality and government by its [[mukhtar|muhtar]]. The muhtarlık (the office of muhtar) has been designed as the smallest administrative office, with representative and enforcement powers at the local level. However, in some cases, the muhtar acts as not only the representative of the government towards the community but also the head of the community towards the government and subverts official government policies through intricate face-to-face mahalle-level relationships.&lt;ref name=vbulletin/&gt;

It is also the smallest urban administrative division in [[Iran]]. Each city is divided into a few ''Mantaqe''s, ({{lang-fa|منطقه}}), which is then divided into ''Nahiye''s ({{lang-fa|ناحیه}}), further subdivided to ''Mahalle'' ({{lang-fa|محله}}), usually having a ''Mahalle council'' ({{lang-fa|شورای محله}}), a quarter mosque, and a small parkette.

In September 2017 a Turkish based association refers to the historical '''Mahalle''' by organizing a festival with the title '''Mahalla''' in the frame of parallel events of the 15th [[Istanbul Biennial]]. This festival in Istanbul features cultural initiatives of the [[civil society]] and artists from the Middle East and Europe, the Balkan and Turkey. Against the background of the ongoing migration crisis all participants of the festival are concerned in their work in various ways with themes of hospitality, identity formation, homelessness, migration and fluctuation, the changing of an existing order and the dissolution of borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mahalla.inenart.eu/about-us/|title=Mahalla Festival|publisher=InEnArt|accessdate=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marc Augé''' (born September 2, 1935 in [[Poitiers]]) is a [[France|French]] [[anthropologist]].

In an essay and book of the same title, ''Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity'' (1995), Marc Augé coined the phrase "[[Non place|non-place]]" to refer to spaces where concerns of relations, history, and identity are erased. Examples of a non-place would be a [[motorway]], a [[hotel]] room, an [[airport]] or a [[supermarket]].&lt;ref&gt;"Place, A Short Introduction", Tim Cresswell&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Marc Augé’s career can be divided into three stages, reflecting shifts in both his geographical focus and theoretical development: early (African), middle (European) and late (Global). These successive  stages do not involve a broadening of interest or focus as such, but rather the development of a theoretical apparatus able to meet the demands of the growing conviction that the local can no longer be understood except as a part of the complicated global whole.

===First stage===
Augé’s career began with a series of extended field trips to West Africa, where he researched the Alladian peoples situated on the edge of a large lagoon, west of Abidjan on the Ivory Coast. The culmination of this endeavour is the masterly ''Le Rivage alladian: Organisation et évolution des villages alladian'' (1969) [The Alladian Riparian Peoples: Organisation and Evolution of Alladian Villages]. The sequel, ''Théorie des pouvoirs et Idéologie: Études de cas en Côte d’Ivoire'' (1975) [Theory of Powers and Ideology: Case Study of the Ivory Coast], followed a series of three further field excursions to the Ivory Coast between 1968 and 1971. Augé coined the term ideo-logic to describe his research object, which he defined as the inner logic of the representations a society makes of itself to itself. A third and final instalment in this series of studies of the Alladian peoples was added in 1977, ''Pouvoirs de vie, Pouvoirs de mort'' [Powers of Life, Powers of Death].

===Second stage===
The second or European stage, consists of a sequence of three interrelated books: L''a Traversée du Luxembourg'' (1985) [Traversing Luxembourg Gardens]; ''Un ethnologue dans le métro'' (1986); trs. as ''In the Metro'' (2002); and ''Domaines et Châteaux'' (1989) [Homes and Palaces]. In this period of his career, Augé took the novel approach of applying methods developed in the course of fieldwork in Africa to his local Parisian context. Augé focused on four key aspects of contemporary Parisian society: (i) the paradoxical increase in the intensity of solitude brought about by the expansion of communications technologies; (ii) the strange recognition that the other is also an ‘I’; (iii) the [[Non place|non-place]], the ambivalent space that has none of the familiar attributes of place - for instance, it incites no sense of belonging; (iv) the oblivion and aberration of memory. The work in this period emphasises the anthropologist’s own experience in a way that neither the earlier or later work does. Augé does this by comparing his own impressions of these places with those produced by some of French literature’s greatest writers. What this comparison illustrates is the apparent insuperability of the gap between language and experience. Yet it is that very gap, he argues, that his anthropology must be able to close if it is to be of continuing relevance in contemporary society.

===Third stage===
[[File:Copenhagen Metro escalators.jpg|thumb|Copenhagen metro escalators - example of a non-place.]]
The third or global stage has so far yielded four books: Non-Lieux, ''Introduction à une anthropologie de la surmodernité'' (1992); trs. as ''Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity'' (1995); ''Le Sens des autres: Actualité de l’anthropologie'' (1994); trs. as ''A Sense for the Other: The Timeliness and Relevance of Anthropology'' (1998); ''Pour une anthropologie des mondes contemporains'' (1994); trs. as ''An Anthropology for Contemporaneous Worlds'' (1998); and ''La Guerre des rêves: exercises d’ethno-fiction'' (1997); trs. as ''The War of Dreams: Exercises in Ethno-Fiction'' (1999). Taken together these works comprise an extended meditation on the disparity between observations made in the course of anthropological fieldwork in the first and the second stages of his career. It is at least partially the result of Augé’s travels—for instance, his concept of the non-place refers to those spaces one typically encounters when travelling such as airports, bus terminals, hotels and so on, which one often only remembers in very generic terms. Ultimately, his aim is to theorise *globalisation as it is lived in properly global terms; it is also an attempt to reinvigorate the discipline of anthropology as a whole. To that end he deploys a number of novel writing techniques, describing the synthetic results as ‘ethno-novels’.

==Reception==
Many of the studies of Marc Augé were applied to mobilities and the exploration of [[globalization]]. His contributions considered the philosophical potential of an anthropology of "non-places" like airports and motorways that are characterized by constant transition and temporality. Augé’s contribution to the understanding of global modernism has pivoted in many applied investigation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Adey, P. (2006). If mobility is everything then it is nothing: towards a relational politics of (im) mobilities. Mobilities, 1(1), 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augé, S., Schmit, P. O., Crutchfield, C. A., Islam, M. T., Harris, D. J., Durand, E., ... &amp; Taulelle, F. (2009). NMR measure of translational diffusion and fractal dimension. Application to molecular mass measurement.

[[File:Magische Figur.JPG|thumb|Fetish with mirror from Mayombe]]
'''Mayombe''' (or Mayumbe) is a geographic area on the western coast of Africa occupied by low mountains extending from the mouth of the [[Congo River]] in the south to the [[Kouilou-Niari River]] to the north. The area includes parts of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Angola]] ([[Cabinda Province]]), the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Gabon]].
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mayombe is part of the north-western province of [[Kongo Central]] on the right bank of the River Congo, and contains the  cities and towns of [[Lukula]], [[Seke Banza]], [[Kangu]] and [[Tshela]].

==Physical geography==
[[File:Mayombe-parasolier.JPG|thumb|Umbrella tree ([[Musanga cecropioides]]) in the Mayombe forest]]
Mayumbe is located in the west of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It lies on the right bank of the Congo River (the world's second largest) just before it empties into the Atlantic Ocean at [[Banana, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Banana]]. It extends north from [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] into the Angolan enclave of Cabinda to the west and extends north to the Republic of Congo and Gabon.

Mayumbe is watered by many rivers with swift currents in its hilly and mountainous regions. The three largest are the [[Shiloango River]] and two of its main tributaries, the [[Lukula River]] and the [[Lubuzi River]].

The main peaks are:
*[[Mount Foungouti]], 930 m
*[[Mount Bamba]], 810 m
*[[Kinoumbou Mountains]], 784 m
*[[Ngouedi Mountains]], 780 m
*[[Kanga Mountains]], 764 m
*[[Mount Bombo]], 751 m
*[[Pic Kiama]], 747 m

==Climate and ecology==

Mayumbe is south of the equator in the equatorial zone with oceanic influence and has two main seasons. 
The long dry season from June to September in the Mayumbe is not as intense as in the rest of the Lower Congo because of the altitude and the influence of the forest. Temperatures range from 17 to 22, but can drop to 8 ° at night. 
Nights can be quite cool. The long rainy season lasts from October to May, with temperatures of 28-33°. 
The climate is hot and humid, especially during the rainy season when the humidity is near to 100%. 
This feeling of constant humidity is further increased by the condensation of the vapors of the trade winds that cool the cliffs of the Coastal Range.

Flora vary from dense forest to savannah dotted with forest trees. 
The forests of Mayumbe are old. 
Some of the trees are valuable, especially the [[Terminalia superba|Limba]]. 
Palm trees are plentiful in the Elais Mayumbe and are found in forests and in the savanna. 
They form one of the great resources of this region for its inhabitants.
The area's forests were estimated in 1950 to cover {{convert|500000|ha}}. More recently they have declined to {{convert|80000|ha}}, of which Limba account for over 40%.

==People==
Among the ethnic groups that inhabit this region the Yombe, a subset of the [[Kongo people]], are the most numerous.

==Railway==
[[File:Mayumbe-Tranchée-1930.jpg|thumb|The Mayumbe railway, August 1930]]

The Mayombe Railway linked Boma to Tshela, with a planned extension to the Republic of Congo. It was dismantled under President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and the tracks were reused near [[Gbadolite]].
The Mayombe in Congo is covered by the Congo-Ocean Railway.

==People from Mayombe==

Mayombe is famous in Senegal because it is an important stage in the exile of the founder of [[mouridism]], [[Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba]], during the French colonial administration. He remained there five years.

The '''monsoon of South Asia''' is among several geographically distributed [[monsoon|global monsoon]]s. It affects the [[Indian subcontinent]], where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated [[weather]] phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from June through September, but it is only partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin, process, strength, variability, distribution, and general vagaries of the monsoon, but understanding and predictability are still evolving.

The unique [[Geography of India|geographical features of the Indian subcontinent]], along with associated [[atmospheric]], [[ocean]]ic, and [[geophysical]] factors, influence the behavior of the monsoon. Because of its effect on [[agriculture]], on [[flora and fauna]], and on the climates of nations such as [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Sri Lanka]] — among other [[economic]], [[social]], and [[Natural environment|environmental]] effects — the monsoon is one of the most anticipated, tracked,&lt;ref name="Frater2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Frater|title=Chasing the Monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5I7AAme3yfUC|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Picador|isbn=978-0-330-43313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied weather phenomena in the region.

==Definition==
The word ''monsoon'' (derived from the Arabic "mausam," meaning "season"), although generally defined as a system of [[winds]] characterized by a seasonal reversal of direction,&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt; lacks a consistent, detailed definition. Some examples are:

* The [[American Meteorological Society]] calls it a name for seasonal winds, first applied to the winds blowing over the [[Arabian Sea]] from the northeast for six months and from the southwest for six months.&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=monsoon&amp;submit=Search|title=Monsoon|accessdate=2008-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322122025/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=monsoon&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=22 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been extended to similar winds in other parts of the world.
* The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) describes a monsoon as a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both surface winds and associated [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], caused by differential heating between a continental-scale land mass and the adjacent ocean.&lt;ref name=IPCCdef&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007, Glossary|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/annex1sglossary-e-o.html|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Indian Meteorological Department]] defines it as the seasonal reversal of the direction of winds along the shores of the [[Indian Ocean]], especially in the Arabian Sea, which blow from the southwest for half of the year and from the northeast for the other half.&lt;ref name=IMDdef&gt;{{cite web|title=IMD terminologies &amp; glossary|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Colin Stokes Ramage, in ''Monsoon Meteorology'', defines the monsoon as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation.&lt;ref name="Ramage1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin S. Ramage|title=Monsoon meteorology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YA1ezydaPecC|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1971|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-576650-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Observed initially by sailors in the Arabian Sea&lt;ref name="Selin1997"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA766|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9|pages=766–}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveling between [[Africa]], [[India]], and [[Southeast Asia]], the monsoon can be categorized into two ''branches'' based on their spread over the subcontinent:
* Arabian Sea branch
* [[Bay of Bengal]] branch
[[File:Monsoon season beach Tamil Nadu India.jpg|thumb|200px|Southwest monsoon clouds over [[Tamil Nadu]].]]
Alternatively, it can be categorized into two ''segments'' based on the direction of rain-bearing winds:
* Southwest (SW) monsoon 
* Northeast (NE) monsoon&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The name of the wind is based on the direction that it blows ''from''. Southwest winds blow onto the land from the southwest. Northeast winds flow from the northeast toward the southwest, onto the land.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the time of year that these winds bring rain to India, the monsoon can also be categorized into two ''periods'':
* Summer monsoon (May to September)
* Winter monsoon (October to November)

The complexity of the monsoon of South Asia is not completely understood, making it difficult to accurately predict the quantity, timing, and geographic distribution of the accompanying precipitation. These are the most monitored components of the monsoon, and they determine the water availability in India for any given year.&lt;ref name=IMD1/&gt;

==Changes of the Monsoon==

{{Main article|Monsoon#South Asian Monsoon}}

[[File:Aug2011monsoon.JPG|Monsoon over India|thumb|350px]]
Monsoons typically occur in tropical areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Class 9 CBSE Geography Climate The Mechanism of Monsoons - Wiki|url = http://www.learnnext.com/nextgurukul/wiki/concept/CBSE/IX/Geography/The-Mechanism-of-Monsoons.htm|website = www.learnnext.com|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area that monsoons impact greatly is India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In India monsoons create an entire season in which the winds reverse completely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various atmospheric conditions influence the monsoon winds. The first condition is the differential heating and cooling of land and water. This creates low pressure on the landmass, while high pressure is created over the seas during daytime, but is reversed during the night time.

The second condition is the shift in the position of [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ). In summer, the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°N of the equator moves over the Ganga plain creating a monsoon trough during the monsoon season.

The third condition is the presence of the high-pressure area that develops east of Madagascar. It is approximately at 20°S over the Indian Ocean. The intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the Indian Monsoon.

The fourth condition develops during the summer. The Tibetan Plateau gets intensely heated resulting in strong vertical air currents and high pressure over the plateau about 9&amp;nbsp;km above sea level. The fifth condition develops during the summer due to the movement of the westerly jet streams to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian Peninsula.

Changes in pressure over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons. In certain years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions. This periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the Southern Oscillation, or SO.

The Southern Oscillation is connected to la nina, which is a warm ocean current that flows past the Peruvian Coast. It flows every two to five years in place of the cold Peruvian current. The phenomenon is, referred to as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations). In India, the monsoon lasts for 100 to 120 days from early June and to mid-September. The monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature, and not steady.

The monsoon arrives with a sudden downpour of rainfall that continues for several days. This is known as the ‘burst’ of the monsoon.

The rainfall is a result of the convergence of wind flow from the [[Bay of Bengal]] and reverse winds from the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/onset onset] of the monsoon occurs over the [[Bay of Bengal]] in May,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Characteristics, evolution and mechanisms of the summer monsoon onset over Southeast Asia|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1082/abstract|journal = International Journal of Climatology|date = 2004-10-01|issn = 1097-0088|pages = 1461–1482|volume = 24|issue = 12|doi = 10.1002/joc.1082|language = en|first = Zuqiang|last = Zhang|first2 = Johnny C.

By mid-October, it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula. The withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of December to the first week of January. This is the start of the winter season.

The retreating monsoon winds move over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and collect moisture on the way. These monsoon winds reach the southern states of India by October, and are responsible for a second round of rainfall. These are called the winter monsoons. The winter monsoon is experienced in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in the first week of January.

===Effect of geographical relief features===
Although the southwest and northeast monsoon winds are seasonally reversible, they do not cause precipitation on their own.
{{Main article|Rain#Formation}}
Two factors are essential for [[Rain#Formation|rain formation]]:
# [[Rain#Water-saturated air|Moisture-laden winds]]
# [[Rain#Coalescence|Droplet formation]]

Additionally, one of the [[Rain#Causes|causes of rain]] must happen. In the case of the monsoon, the cause is primarily [[Rain#Orographic effects|orographic]], due to the presence of highlands in the path of the winds. Orographic barriers force wind to rise. Precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic cooling]] and condensation of the moist rising air.
{{Main article|Orographic lift}}

The unique [[Geography of India|geographic relief]] features of the Indian subcontinent come into play in allowing all of the above factors to occur simultaneously. The relevant features in explaining the monsoon mechanism are as follows:
# The presence of abundant water bodies around the subcontinent: the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], and [[Indian Ocean]]. These help moisture accumulate in the winds during the hot season.
# The presence of abundant highlands like the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Himalayas]] right across the path of the southwest monsoon winds. These are the main cause of the substantial [[Orographic lift#Precipitation|orographic precipitation]] throughout the subcontinent.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]] Mountains also lie in the path of the southwest monsoon but do not result in much precipitation because they are in the direction of the path of the southwest winds and not ''across'' them, causing no [[orographic lift]] of the winds.&lt;/ref&gt;
## The Western Ghats are the first highlands of India that the southwest monsoon winds encounter.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Other major highlands, like the [[Cardamom Hills]], [[Anaimalai Hills]], and [[Nilgiri Mountains]], that play active roles in the monsoon are considered major extensions of the Western Ghats and are thus not discussed separately.&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Ghats rise abruptly from the [[Western Coastal Plains]] of the subcontinent, making effective orographic barriers for the monsoon winds.
## The Himalayas play more than the role of orographic barriers for the monsoon. They also help confine it to the subcontinent. Without them, the southwest monsoon winds would blow right over the Indian subcontinent into [[Tibet]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Russia]] without causing any rain.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;First, the Himalayas serve as orographic barriers to the southwest monsoon winds. Second, they help confine the winds to the subcontinent, hampering their northward progress. Third, they contribute to the convergence of the Bay of Bengal branch and Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon winds, increasing the intensity of precipitation over the northern part of the subcontinent. Fourth, they are a major factor in the ''bursting'' of the monsoon under the jet stream theory. Fifth, they help determine the direction of the Bay of Bengal branch of the northeast monsoon. Their role is still a matter of active study, and understanding of them is evolving regularly.&lt;/ref&gt;
## For the northeast monsoon, the highlands of the [[Eastern Ghats]] play the role of orographic barrier.

==Features of monsoon rains==
There are some unique features of the rains that the monsoon brings to the Indian subcontinent.

===''"Bursting"''===
[[File:Mumbai india monsoon clouds.jpg|thumb|220px|"Monsoon burst" over [[Mumbai]].]]
''Bursting of monsoon'' refers to the sudden change in weather conditions in India (typically from hot and dry weather to wet and humid weather during the southwest monsoon), characterized by an abrupt rise in the mean daily rainfall.&lt;ref name="Allaby2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Allaby|title=Encyclopedia of weather and climate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1wq-9OSCscC&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4801-4|pages=373–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanif2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

===Rain variability (''"vagaries"'')===
One of the most commonly used words to describe the erratic nature of the monsoon is "vagaries," used in newspapers,&lt;ref name=IEvag&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasabe|first=Nanda Dabhole|title=Vagaries apart, monsoon is normal|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970723/20450243.html|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=the Indian Express|date=23 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazines,&lt;ref name="Darpan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Pratiyogita Darpan]]|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT93|accessdate=5 March 2011|date=October 2007|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; books,&lt;ref name="Krishnamacharyulu2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krishnamacharyulu|title=Cases In Rural Marketing: An Integrated Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4_mXbVC4bwC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=5 March 2011|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-0188-1|pages=106–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[web portal]]s&lt;ref name=IWP&gt;{{cite web|title=Agronomic Measures in Dryland Agriculture: An Overview|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/node/6979|publisher=India Water Portal|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[insurance]] plans,&lt;ref name=FT1&gt;{{cite news|title=Weather Insurance To Protect A Few|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/printer/news/110251/|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=Financial Express|date=16 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India's budget discussions.&lt;ref name=MI1&gt;{{cite news|title=Budget must focus on Growth, Food Inflation, FDI, Govt B/s: G Chokkalingam|url=http://www.myiris.com/newsCentre/storyShow.php?fileR=20110222154315043&amp;dir=2011/02/22&amp;secID=livenews|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=myIris.com|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some years, it rains too much, causing floods in parts of India; in others, it rains too little or not at all, causing droughts. In some years, the rain quantity is sufficient but its timing arbitrary. Sometimes, despite average annual rainfall, the daily distribution or geographic distribution of the rain is substantially skewed. In the recent past, rainfall variability in short time periods (about a week) were attributed to desert dust over the Arabian Sea and [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n4/full/ngeo2107.html|title=Short-term modulation of Indian summer monsoon rainfall by West Asian dust|first1=V.|last1=Vinoj|first2=Philip J.|last2=Rasch|first3=Hailong|last3=Wang|first4=Jin-Ho|last4=Yoon|first5=Po-Lun|last5=Ma|first6=Kiranmayi|last6=Landu|first7=Balwinder|last7=Singh|date=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=7|issue=4|pages=308–313|accessdate=20 April 2018|doi=10.1038/ngeo2107|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..308V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal and normal monsoon rains==
[[File:India annual rainfall map en.svg|thumb|200px|Annual average rainfall in India.]]

Normally, the southwest monsoon can be expected to "burst" onto the western coast of India (near [[Thiruvananthapuram]]) at the beginning of June and to cover the entire country by mid-July.&lt;ref name=IMD1&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Meteorological Department|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|publisher=imd.gov.in|accessdate=3 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224191959/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|archivedate=24 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDMOK&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Onset Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/MOK.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon Onset dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/newnormalonset.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its withdrawal from India typically starts at the beginning of September and finishes by the beginning of October.&lt;ref name=IMDwith&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Withdrawal Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_criteria.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDwithjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon withdrawal dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_normal.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northeast monsoon usually "bursts" around 20 October and lasts for about 50 days before withdrawing.&lt;ref name="Wang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bin Wang|title=The Asian monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRT57TENzT8C&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-40610-5|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a rainy monsoon is not necessarily a normal monsoon — that is, one that performs close to [[statistical average]]s calculated over a long period. A normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the ''average quantity'' of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence (''mean spatial distribution'') and over the entire expected time period (''mean temporal distribution''). Additionally, the ''arrival date'' and the ''departure date'' of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates. The exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the [[Indian Meteorological Department]] with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables.&lt;ref name=IMDavgMonsoon&gt;{{cite web|title=Met. Terminologies and Glossary - Monsoon|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=[[Indian Meteorological Department]]|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A monsoon with excess rain can cause floods, and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought, [[famine]], and economic losses. Therefore, a normal monsoon with mean performance is the most desirable monsoon.

==Theories for mechanism of monsoon==
Theories of the mechanism of the monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timing of their reversal.

===Traditional theory===
{{Main article|Sea breeze}}
Because of differences in the [[specific heat capacity]] of land and water, [[continents]] heat up faster than [[sea]]s. Consequently, the [[air]] above [[coast]]al lands heats up faster than the air above seas. These create areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as [[sea breeze]].

====Process of monsoon creation====
{{Main article|Monsoon#Process}}
[[File:Diagrama de formacion de la brisa-breeze.svg|thumb|200px|A: sea breeze; B: land breeze.]]
Also known as the ''thermal theory'' or the ''differential heating of sea and land theory'', the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale [[sea breeze]]. It states that during the hot subtropical summers, the massive [[landmass]] of the [[Indian Peninsula]] heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas, resulting in a [[pressure gradient]] from south to north. This causes the flow of moisture-laden winds from sea to land. On reaching land, these winds rise because of the geographical relief, cooling [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatically]] and leading to orographic rains. This is the ''southwest monsoon''.
The reverse happens during the winter, when the land is colder than the sea, establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea. This causes the winds to blow over the Indian subcontinent toward the [[Indian Ocean]] in a northeasterly direction, causing the ''northeast monsoon''. Because the southwest monsoon flows from sea to land, it carries more moisture, and therefore causes more rain, than the northeast monsoon. Only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the Bay of Bengal picks up moisture, causing rain in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] during the winter months.

However, many meteorologists argue that the monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory, but a general weather phenomenon along the entire [[Tropics|tropical zone]] of [[Earth]]. This criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds, but casts it as one of several factors rather than the only one.

===Dynamic theory===
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.svg|thumb|300px|The atmospheric circulation system with associated pressure belts and latitudes.]]
{{Main article|Prevailing winds}}
{{Main article|Atmospheric circulation}}
The [[prevailing winds]] of the [[atmospheric circulation]] arise because of the difference in pressure at various [[latitudes]] and act as means for distribution of [[thermal energy]] on the planet. This pressure difference is because of the differences in [[solar insolation]] received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the [[planet]]. Alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the [[equator]], the two [[tropics]], the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] circles, and the two [[polar region]]s, giving rise to the [[trade wind]]s, the [[westerlies]], and the [[polar easterlies]]. However, geophysical factors like [[Earth's orbit]], its rotation, and its [[axial tilt]] cause these belts to shift gradually north and south, following the [[Sun]]'s seasonal shifts.

====Process of monsoon creation====
The ''dynamic theory'' explains the monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds. According to this theory, the monsoon is a result of the shift of the [[Inter Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) under the influence of the [[Solar equator|vertical sun]]. Though the mean position of the ITCZ is taken as the equator, it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the Tropics of [[Tropic of Cancer|Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]] during the [[summer]] of the respective hemispheres ([[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]). As such, during the northern summer (May and June), the ITCZ moves north, along with the vertical sun, toward the Tropic of Cancer. The ITCZ, as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region, is the target destination for the [[trade wind]]s of both hemispheres. Consequently, with the ITCZ at the Tropic of Cancer, the southeast trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;When the southeast trade winds cross the equator, they are perceived in the Northern Hemisphere as equatorial westerlies because they seem to blow from the equator toward the Tropic Of Cancer. Similarly, when the ITCZ is at the Tropic of Cancer, the northeast trade winds are confined to the area north of the Tropic of Cancer.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the [[Coriolis effect]] (which causes winds in the Northern Hemisphere to turn right, whereas winds in the Southern Hemisphere turn left), these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], transforming into southwest trades.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Change of direction or origin of winds alters their nomenclature as noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; These pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the Indian Peninsula. This results in the southwest monsoon.

The dynamic theory explains the monsoon as a global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one. And when coupled with the traditional theory (based on the heating of sea and land), it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with orographic barriers.

===Jet stream theory===
{{Main article|Jet stream}}
[[File:Jetcrosssection.jpg|thumb|300px|Jet streams of Earth]]
This theory tries to explain the establishment of the northeast and southwest monsoons, as well as unique features like "bursting" and variability.

The jet streams are systems of upper-air westerlies. They give rise to slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250-[[knots|knot]] winds in some air streams. First observed by [[World War II]] pilots, they develop just below the [[tropopause]] over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the ''polar jets'', the ''subtropical westerly jets'', and the less common ''tropical easterly jets''. They follow the principle of [[geostrophic wind]]s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Geostrophic winds blow parallel to the [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobars]] and keep low-pressure zones to their left in the Northern Hemisphere and to their right in the Southern Hemisphere. The reversal is a result of the [[Coriolis effect]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process of monsoon creation====
[[File:Tibet Karte Topograpisch.png|thumb|250px|The [[Tibetan Plateau]] lies north of the [[Himalayas]].]]
Over India, a subtropical westerly jet develops in the winter season and is replaced by the tropical easterly jet in the summer season. The high temperature during the summer over the [[Tibetan Plateau]], as well as over [[Central Asia]] in general, is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the tropical easterly jet over India.

The mechanism affecting the monsoon is that the westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter. This results in the north-to-south flow of the winds in the form of the northeast monsoon. With the northward shift of the vertical sun, this jet shifts north, too. The intense heat over the Tibetan Plateau, coupled with associated [[terrain]] features like the high altitude of the plateau, generate the tropical easterly jet over central India. This jet creates a low-pressure zone over the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|northern Indian plains]], influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}.

==Theories for "bursting"==
The "bursting"&lt;ref name=Allaby2002/&gt; of the monsoon is primarily explained by the jet stream theory and the dynamic theory.

===Dynamic theory===
According to this theory, during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ shifts north, pulling the southwest monsoon winds onto the land from the sea. However, the huge landmass of the Himalayas restricts the low-pressure zone onto the Himalayas themselves. It is only when the Tibetan Plateau heats up significantly more than the Himalayas that the ITCZ abruptly and swiftly shifts north, leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the Indian subcontinent.
The reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds, leading to a second, minor burst of rainfall over the eastern Indian Peninsula during the Northern Hemisphere winter months.

===Jet stream theory===
According to this theory, the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of India toward the Tibetan Plateau. This shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months. The northward shift is not a slow and gradual process, as expected for most changes in weather pattern. The primary cause is believed to be the height of the Himalayas. As the Tibetan Plateau heats up, the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north. Because of the lofty Himalayas, the westerly jet's movement is inhibited. But with continuous dropping pressure, sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the Himalayas after a significant period. As such, the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt, causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the Indian plains. The reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon.

==Theories for monsoon variability==

===The jet stream effect===
The jet stream theory also explains the variability in timing and strength of the monsoon.

'''Timing:''' A timely northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet at the beginning of summer is critical to the onset of the southwest monsoon over India. If the shift is delayed, so is the southwest monsoon. An early shift results in an early monsoon.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Strength:''' The strength of the southwest monsoon is determined by the strength of the easterly tropical jet over central India. A strong easterly tropical jet results in a strong southwest monsoon over central India, and a weak jet results in a weak monsoon.

===El Niño-Southern Oscillation effect===
{{Main article|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}
[[File:El Nino regional impacts.png|thumb|righ|300px|Effects of [[El Niño]] on the weather of the subcontinent.]]
[[El nino|''El Niño'']] is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of [[Peru]] that replaces the usual cold [[Humboldt Current]]. The warm surface water moving toward the coast of Peru with El Niño is pushed west by the trade winds, thereby raising the temperature of the southern Pacific Ocean. The reverse condition is known as [[La Niña]].

''Southern oscillation'', a phenomenon first observed by [[Gilbert Walker|Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker]], director general of observatories in India, refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between [[Tahiti]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia.&lt;ref name=IODhindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopal Raj|first=N|title=El Nino &amp; the Indian Ocean Dipole|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2004050401861000.htm&amp;date=2004/05/04/&amp;prd=th&amp;|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that when pressure was high in Tahiti, it was low in Darwin, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]].&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;  A ''Southern Oscillation Index'' (SOI), based on the pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, has been formulated by the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] to measure the strength of the oscillation.&lt;ref name="Aus"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|title=Climate glossary - Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/glossary/soi.shtml|date=3 April 2007|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the Indian subcontinent was often negligible in years of high pressure over Darwin (and low pressure over Tahiti). Conversely, low pressure over Darwin bodes well for precipitation quantity in India. Thus, Walker established the relationship between southern oscillation and quantities of monsoon rains in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

Ultimately, the southern oscillation was found to be simply an atmospheric component of the El Niño/La Niña effect, which happens in the ocean.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Therefore, in the context of the monsoon, the two together came to be known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect. The effect is known to have a pronounced influence on the strength of the southwest monsoon over India, with the monsoon being weak (causing droughts) during El Niño years, while La Niña years bring particularly strong monsoons.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

===Indian Ocean dipole effect===
{{Main article|Indian Ocean Dipole}}
Although the ENSO effect was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in India, in recent decades, its relationship with the Indian monsoon seemed to weaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=K. K.|author2=Balaji Rajagopalan |author3=Mark A. Cane |title=On the Weakening Relationship Between the Indian Monsoon and ENSO|journal=Science|date=25 June 1999|volume=284|issue=5423|pages=2156–2159|doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2156|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5423/2156.abstract|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the strong ENSO of 1997 did not cause drought in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; However, it was later discovered that, just like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean, a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere system in the [[Indian Ocean]] was also in play. This system was discovered in 1999 and named the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD). An index to calculate it was also formulated. IOD develops in the equatorial region of the Indian Ocean from April to May and peaks in October.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; With a positive IOD, winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west. This makes the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near the African coast) much warmer and the eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia colder and drier.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; In negative dipole years, the reverse happens, making Indonesia much warmer and rainier.

A positive IOD index often negates the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983, 1994, and 1997.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Further, the two poles of the IOD — the eastern pole (around Indonesia) and the western pole (off the African coast) — independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon rains.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

====Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation====
As with ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD was later discovered and the cumulative phenomenon named ''Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation'' (EQUINOO).&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; When EQUINOO effects are factored in, certain failed forecasts, like the acute drought of 2002, can be further accounted for.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; The relationship between extremes of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, along with ENSO and EQUINOO,&lt;ref name=EQgadgil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|author2=P.

Since the strength of the monsoon is partially dependent on the temperature difference between the ocean and the land, higher ocean temperatures in the Indian Ocean have weakened the moisture bearing winds from the ocean to the land. The reduction in the summer monsoon rainfall have grave consequences over central India because at least 60% of the agriculture in this region is still largely [[Rainfed agriculture|rain-fed]]. 

A recent assessment of the monsoonal changes indicate that the land warming has increased during 2002-2014, possibly reviving the strength of the monsoon circulation and rainfall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=Mathew Koll|date=|title=Land warming revives monsoon|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nclimate3356|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=7|issue=8|pages=549–550|doi=10.1038/nclimate3356|via=|bibcode=2017NatCC...7..549R}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Future changes in the monsoon will depend on a competition between land and ocean—on which is warming faster than the other.

Meanwhile, there has been a three-fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events during the years 1950 to 2015, over the entire central belt of India, leading to a steady rise in the number of flash floods with significant socioeconomic losses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=M.

Widespread extreme rainfall events are those rainfall events which are larger than 150 mm/day and spread over a region large enough to cause floods.

==Monsoon rain prediction models==
Since the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]] in India, various attempts have been made to predict monsoon rainfall.&lt;ref name=MOL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.tropmet.res.in/~kolli/mol/Introduction/frameindex.html|publisher=Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, India|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least five prediction models exist.&lt;ref name="CSgadgil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|date=10 February 2011|year=|title=Seasonal prediction of the Indian monsoon|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/100/03/0343.pdf|journal=Current Science|series=3|volume=100|pages=343–353|via=|author2=J. Srinivasan|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon (SPIM)===
The [[Centre for Development of Advanced Computing]] (CDAC) at [[Bengaluru]] facilitated the Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon (SPIM) experiment on the [[PARAM]] Padma supercomputing system.&lt;ref name=CDADspim&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon(SPIM)|url=http://www.cdacb.in/html/spim.aspx|publisher=Centre for Development of Advanced Computing|accessdate=5 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302113845/http://www.cdacb.in/html/spim.aspx|archivedate=2 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This project involved simulated runs of historical data from 1985 to 2004 to try to establish the relationship of five ''atmospheric general circulation models'' with monsoon rainfall distribution.&lt;ref name=CSgadgil/&gt;

===Indian Meteorological Department model===
The department has tried to forecast the monsoon for India since 1884,&lt;ref name=MOL1/&gt; and is the only official agency entrusted with making public forecasts about the quantity, distribution, and timing of the monsoon rains. Its position as the sole authority on the monsoon was cemented in 2005&lt;ref name=CSgadgil/&gt; by the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology (DST)]], [[New Delhi]]. In 2003, IMD substantially changed its forecast methodology, model,&lt;ref name=Rajeevan1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajeevapn|first=M. |author2=D. S. Pai |author3=S. K. Dikshit |author4=R. R.

==Significance==
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 May in dry season]]
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 August in rainy season]]

The monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for [[fresh water]] in the Indian subcontinent. As such, it affects the [[Natural environment|environment]] (and associated flora, fauna, and [[ecosystem]]s), agriculture, society, hydro-power production, and geography of the subcontinent (like the availability of fresh water in water bodies and the underground water table), with all of these factors cumulatively contributing to the health of the economy of affected countries.

The monsoon turns large parts of India from semi-deserts into green grasslands. See photos taken only three months apart in the Western Ghats.

===Geographical (wettest spots on Earth)===
[[Mawsynram]] and [[Cherrapunji]], both in the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]], alternate as the wettest places on Earth given the quantity of their rainfall,&lt;ref name=Wettest&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip|first=A J|title=Cherrapunji no longer wettest Challenge comes from nearby village|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030824/main8.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011|newspaper=The Tribune|date=24 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there are other cities with similar claims. They receive more than 11,000 millimeters of rain each from the monsoon.

===Agricultural===
In India, which has historically had a primarily agrarian economy, the [[services sector]] recently overtook the [[farm sector]] in terms of [[GDP]] contribution. However, the [[agriculture]] sector still contributes 17-20% of GDP&lt;ref name=Rediff1&gt;{{cite web|title=How monsoon impacts the Indian economy|url=http://business.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/jun/02/slide-show-1-how-monsoon-impacts-indian-economy.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest employer in the country, with about 60% of Indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; About 49% of India's land is agricultural; that number rises to 55% if associated [[wetlands]], [[dryland farming]] areas, etc., are included. Because more than half of these farmlands are rain-fed, the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life.

Despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation, agricultural dependence on the monsoon remains far from insignificant. Therefore, the agricultural calendar of India is governed by the monsoon. Any fluctuations in the time distribution, spatial distribution, or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts, causing the agricultural sector to suffer. This has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors, the overall economy, food inflation, and therefore the general population's quality and cost of living.

===Economic===
The economic significance of the monsoon is aptly described by [[Pranab Mukherjee]]'s remark that the monsoon is the "real finance minister of India".&lt;ref name="HT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNlive1/&gt;
A good monsoon results in better agricultural yields, which brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces imports, thus reducing [[food inflation]] overall.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; Better rains also result in increased hydroelectric production.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;
All of these factors have positive ripple effects throughout the economy of India.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;

The down side however is that when monsoon rains are weak, crop production is low leading to higher food prices with limited supply.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monsoon affects economy, health in India|url = http://monsoon.yale.edu/monsoon-affects-economy-health-in-india/|website = WORLD MONSOONS|access-date = 2016-02-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Indian government is actively working with farmers and the nation's meteorological department to produce more drought resistant crops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Social===
[[D. Subbarao]], [[List of Governors of the Reserve Bank of India|former governor of the Reserve Bank of India]], emphasized during a quarterly review of India's [[monetary policy]] that the lives of Indians depend on the performance of the monsoon.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{cite news|last=IANS|title=All Indians ‘chasing the monsoon’|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/all-indians-chasing-the-monsoon_100402650.html|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=Thaindia.com|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own career prospects, his emotional well-being, and the performance of his monetary policy are all "a hostage" to the monsoon, he said, as is the case for most Indians.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; Additionally, farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities. This crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city life.&lt;ref name=IEtme&gt;{{cite news|last=MITRA|first=SUBHANKAR|title=The monsoon effect|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-monsoon-effect/508510/0|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=IndianExpress|date=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
In the past, Indians usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons. But with the advent of globalization, such travel is gaining popularity. Places like [[Kerala]] and the Western Ghats get a large number of tourists, both local and foreigners, during the monsoon season. Kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] treatments and massage therapy. One major drawback of traveling during the monsoon is that most wildlife sanctuaries are closed. Also, some mountainous areas, especially in Himalayan regions, get cut off when roads are damaged by landslides and floods during heavy rains.&lt;ref name=ift&gt;{{cite web|title=Traveling in India during monsoons|url=http://indiafoodtour.com/traveling-in-india-during-monsoons|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
The monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to the area. The [[Geography of South India#Water bodies|peninsular/Deccan rivers of India]] are mostly rain-fed and non-perennial in nature, depending primarily on the monsoon for water supply.&lt;ref name=IG&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers-Profile-Know India|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php|publisher=India.gov.in|accessdate=6 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204154938/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php |archivedate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the [[List of rivers of India#Rivers flowing into Arabian Sea|coastal rivers of Western India]] are also rain-fed and monsoon-dependent.&lt;ref name=IG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Geography|url=http://www.indiabook.com/india-information/indian-geography.html|publisher=IndiaBook.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the flora, fauna, and entire [[ecosystem]]s of these areas rely heavily on the monsoon. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The region is mostly mountainous and forested.

Nagorno-Karabakh is a [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territory]], internationally recognized as part of [[Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10693.doc.htm|title=General Assembly adopts resolution reaffirming territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, demanding withdrawal of all Armenian forces|publisher=United Nations| date=14 March 2008| accessdate =30 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the region is governed by the [[Republic of Artsakh]] (formerly named Nagorno-Karabakh Republic), a ''[[de facto]]'' independent state with Armenian ethnic majority established on the basis of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Azerbaijan has not exercised political authority over the region since the advent of the [[Karabakh movement]] in 1988. Since the end of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] in 1994, representatives of the governments of [[Armenia]] and Azerbaijan have been holding peace talks mediated by the [[OSCE Minsk Group]] on the region's disputed status.

The region is usually equated with the administrative borders of the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] comprising an area of {{convert|4,400|km2}}. The historical area of the region, however, encompasses approximately {{convert|8,223|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Hewsen. "The Meliks of Eastern Armenia: A Preliminary Study".

==Etymology==
[[File:Kaukasus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The snow-covered Lesser Caucasus seen south of the Greater Caucasus. Around the year 1800 the Karabagh Khanate was based in the southeast corner of the Lesser Caucasus. It extended east into the lowlands, hence the name ''Nagorno-'' or "Highland-" Karabagh for the western part.]]{{For|the etymology of Karabakh|Karabakh#Etymology}}
The prefix ''Nagorno-'' derives from the Russian [[adjective#Form|attributive adjective]] {{lang|ru-Latn|nagorny}} ({{wikt-lang|ru|нагорный}}), which means "highland." The [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] names of the region include the similar adjectives {{lang|az|dağlıq}} (mountainous) or {{lang|az|yuxarı}} (upper). Such words are not used in the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] name, but they have appeared in the official name of the region during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era as [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]]. Other languages apply their own wording for ''mountainous'', ''upper'', or ''highland''; for example, the official name used by the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] in French is {{lang|fr|Haut-Karabakh}}, meaning "Upper Karabakh."

The names for the region in the various local languages all translate to "mountainous Karabakh", or "mountainous black garden":

* {{lang-hy|[[wikt:Լեռնային Ղարաբաղ|Լեռնային Ղարաբաղ]]}}, [[romanization of Armenian|transliterated]] {{lang|hy-Latn|Leṙnayin Ġarabaġ}} ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/lɛrnɑˈjin ʁɑɾɑˈbɑʁ/}})
* {{lang-az|[[wikt:Dağlıq Qarabağ|Dağlıq Qarabağ]]}}, {{lang|az-Cyrl|Дағлыг Гарабағ}} (mountainous Karabakh; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/dɑɣˈlɯɣ ɡɑˈɾɑbɑɣ/}}) or {{lang|az|Yuxarı Qarabağ}}, {{lang|az-Cyrl|Јухары Гарабағ}} (upper Karabakh; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/juxɑˈɾɯ ɡɑˈɾɑbɑɣ/}})
* {{lang-ru|[[wikt:Нагорный Карабах|Нагорный Карабах]]}}, [[romanization of Russian|transliterated]] {{lang|ru-Latn|Nagornyy Karabakh}} or {{lang|ru-Latn|Nagornyi Karabah}} ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/nɐˈɡornɨj kərɐˈbax/}})

The [[Armenians]] living in the area often refer to Nagorno-Karabakh as ''Artsakh'' ({{lang-hy|Արցախ}}), using the name of the 10th province of the ancient [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. [[Urartian]] inscriptions (9th–7th centuries BC) use the name {{lang|xur|Urtekhini}} for the region. [[Ancient Greek]] sources called the area {{Lang|grc-Latn|Orkhistene}}.&lt;ref&gt;

Nagorno-Karabakh falls within the lands occupied by peoples known to modern archaeologists as the [[Kura-Araxes culture]], who lived between the two rivers [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]] and [[Araxes River|Araxes]].

The present-day conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has its roots in the decisions made by [[Joseph Stalin]] and the Caucasian Bureau (''{{lang|ru-Latn|Kavburo}}'') during the [[Sovietization]] of [[Transcaucasia]]. Stalin was the acting [[People's Commissariat of Nationalities|Commissar of Nationalities]] for the Soviet Union during the early 1920s, the branch of the government under which the Kavburo was created. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Karabakh became part of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]], but this soon dissolved into separate Armenian, Azerbaijani, and [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] states. Over the next two years (1918–1920), there were a series of short [[Armenian-Azerbaijani War|wars]] between Armenia and Azerbaijan over several regions, including Karabakh. In July 1918, the First Armenian Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh declared the region self-governing and created a National Council and government.&lt;ref name="nesl.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nesl.edu/center/pubs/nagorno.pdf |title=''The Nagorno-Karabagh Crisis: A Blueprint for Resolution'' }}, New England Center for International Law &amp; Policy&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Ottoman troops entered Karabakh, meeting armed resistance by Armenians.

After the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in World War I, British troops occupied Karabakh. The British command provisionally affirmed [[Khosrov bey Sultanov]] (appointed by the Azerbaijani government) as the governor-general of Karabakh and [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]], pending final decision by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/fr/nk/nk_file/article/3.html Circular by colonel D. I. Shuttleworth of the British Command]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was opposed by Karabakh Armenians. In February 1920, the Karabakh National Council preliminarily agreed to Azerbaijani jurisdiction, while Armenians elsewhere in Karabakh continued guerrilla fighting, never accepting the agreement.&lt;ref name="nesl.edu"/&gt; The agreement itself was soon annulled by the Ninth Karabagh Assembly, which declared union with Armenia in April.&lt;ref name="nesl.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia: A Legal Appraisal'' by Tim Potier. {{ISBN|90-411-1477-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1920, while the Azerbaijani army was locked in Karabakh fighting local Armenian forces, Azerbaijan was taken over by [[Bolshevik]]s. On 10 August 1920, Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks, agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached.&lt;ref&gt;Walker. ''The Survival of a Nation''. pp. 285–90&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the [[Bolsheviks]] who, in order to attract public support, promised they would allot Karabakh to Armenia, along with [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Nakhchivan]] and Zangezur (the strip of land separating Nakhchivan from Karabakh). However, the Soviet Union also had far-reaching plans concerning [[Turkey]], hoping that it would, with a little help from them, develop along [[Communist]] lines. Needing to placate Turkey, the Soviet Union agreed to a division under which Zangezur would fall under the control of Armenia, while Karabakh and Nakhchivan would be under the control of Azerbaijan. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would likely have left Karabakh under Armenian control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Service (historian)|Service, Robert]]. ''Stalin: A Biography''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2006 p. 204 {{ISBN|0-674-02258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] was established within the Azerbaijan SSR on 7 July 1923.

With the Soviet Union firmly in control of the region, the conflict over the region died down for several decades. With the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the question of Nagorno-Karabakh re-emerged. Accusing the Azerbaijani SSR government of conducting forced Azerification of the region, the majority Armenian population, with ideological and material support from the [[Armenian SSR]], started a movement to have the autonomous oblast transferred to the Armenian SSR. The oblast's borders were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani villages. The resulting district ensured an Armenian majority.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey L.

Hoover Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0817991824}}, 9780817991821&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1987, Karabakh Armenians sent a petition for union with Armenia with tens of thousands of signatures to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Black Garden, Thomas de Waal, page 292&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and secession===

[[File:Askeran_T-72.jpg|thumb|right|A restored Armenian [[T-72]], knocked out of commission while attacking Azeri positions in [[Askeran District (NKAO)|Askeran District]], serves as a war memorial on the outskirts of Stepanakert.]]
On 13 February 1988, Karabakh Armenians began demonstrating in their capital, [[Stepanakert]], in favour of unification with the Armenian republic. Six days later they were joined by mass marches in Yerevan. On 20 February, the Soviet of People's Deputies in Karabakh voted 110 to 17 to request the transfer of the region to Armenia. This unprecedented action by a regional soviet brought out tens of thousands of demonstrations both in Stepanakert and Yerevan, but Moscow rejected the Armenians' demands. On 22 February 1988, the first direct confrontation of the conflict occurred as a large group of Azeris marched from [[Agdam (rayon)|Agdam]] against the Armenian populated town of Askeran, "wreaking destruction en route". The confrontation between the Azeris and the police near Askeran degenerated into the [[Askeran clash]], which left two Azeris dead, one of them reportedly killed by an Azeri police officer, as well as 50 Armenian villagers, and an unknown number of Azeris and police injured.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Fuller, ''Nagorno-Karabakh: The Death and Casualty Toll to Date'', RL 531/88, 14 December 1988, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dewaal"&gt;{{cite book| last =de Waal | first = Thomas | authorlink = Thomas de Waal| title = Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War| publisher = [[New York University Press]]| year = 2003 | location = New York| isbn = 0-8147-1945-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of refugees left Armenia and Azerbaijan as violence began against the minority populations of the respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Lieberman |first = Benjamin |title = Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe |publisher = Ivan R.

The struggle over Nagorno-Karabakh escalated after both Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In the post-Soviet [[power vacuum]], military action between Azerbaijan and Armenia was heavily influenced by the [[Military of Russia|Russian military]]. Furthermore, both the Armenian and Azerbaijani military employed a large number of mercenaries from [[Ukraine]] and Russia.&lt;ref name="ratios"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]].

By the end of 1993, the conflict had caused thousands of casualties and created hundreds of thousands of refugees on both sides.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} By May 1994, the Armenians were in control of 14% of the territory of Azerbaijan. At that stage, for the first time during the conflict, the Azerbaijani government recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as a third party in the war, and started direct negotiations with the Karabakh authorities. As a result, a cease-fire was reached on 12 May 1994 through Russian negotiation.

During rule of the Soviet Union, the [[Yevlax]]–[[Ağdam]]–[[Stepanakert]] line connected the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region with the main part of Azerbaijan. After the Nagorno-Karabakh war and the abandonment of Ağdam, the line’s service was cut back to service only between Yevlax and [[Kətəlparaq]], without any present section at the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The former railway line between Kətəlparaq and Stepanakert has been almost completely destroyed.

The ([[Tbilisi]]–[[Gyumri]]–)[[Yerevan]]–[[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]]–[[Horadiz]]–[[Şirvan]](–[[Baku]]) main railway was also dismantled  from the NKR between [[Ordubad]] and [[Horadiz]], and  a by-line from [[Mincivan, Zangilan|Mincivan]] to the Armenian city of [[Kapan]]. Currently, the Azerbaijani trains only travel to Horadiz. The Ordubad–Horadiz section has been demolished, leaving the NKR with no intact, active railway line in their territory. The railway at the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic still operates, but it is separated from the main Azerbaijani lines, and only has connection to [[Iran]].

'''Outer Mongolia''' ([[Mongolian script]]: {{MongolUnicode|ᠭᠠᠳᠠᠭᠠᠳᠤ&lt;br /&gt;ᠮᠣᠩᠭ᠋ᠣᠯ}} or {{MongolUnicode|ᠠᠷᠤ&lt;br /&gt;ᠮᠣᠩᠭ᠋ᠣᠯ}} ， [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Mongolian Cyrillic]]: {{linktext|Гадаад}} {{linktext|Монгол}} or {{linktext|Ар}} {{linktext|Монгол}}, [[romanization]]: ''Gadaad Mongol'' or  ''Alr Mongol''; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡨᡠᠯᡝᡵᡤᡳ&lt;br&gt;ᠮᠣᠩᡤᠣ}} ''Tülergi Monggo''; {{zh|s=[[wikt:外蒙古|外蒙古]]|p=Wài Měnggǔ}})&lt;ref name="Borjigin"&gt;Huhbator Borjigin. 2004. The history and political character of the name of 'Nei Menggu' (South Mongolia). Inner Asia 6: 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt; was a territory of the Manchu-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1691–1911). Its area was roughly equivalent to that of the modern state of [[Mongolia]], which is sometimes called "North Mongolia" in China today, plus the Russian republic of [[Tuva]]. While the administrative North Mongolia only consisted of the four [[Khalkha]] aimags (Setsen Khan Aimag, [[Tüsheet Khan]] Aimag, Sain Noyon Khan Aimag and Zasagt Khan Aimag), in the late Qing period "North Mongolia" was also used to refer to Khalkha plus Oirat areas [[Khovd Province|Khovd]] and the directly-ruled [[Tannu Uriankhai]] ({{zh|s=唐努乌梁海}}).

The name "North Mongolia" is contrasted with [[South Mongolia]],&lt;ref name="Borjigin"/&gt; which corresponds to the autonomous region of [[Inner Mongolia]] in [[China]]. South Mongolia was given its name because it was more directly administered by the Qing court; North Mongolia (which is further from the capital [[Beijing]]) had a greater degree of autonomy within the Qing domain.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of China, volume 10, pg 49&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ar mongol'' (or {{zh|s=漠北蒙古|p=Mòběi Měnggǔ|l=North of the [[Gobi Desert|Desert]] Mongolia}}) is sometimes used in Mongolian (or Chinese) language to refer to North Mongolia&lt;ref&gt;cf. Norcin, C. (1999): ''Monggol kelen-ü toli''. Ömnud monggol-un arad-un keblel-ün qoriya. Page 170.&lt;/ref&gt; when making a distinction with South Mongolia, so as to elide the history of [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Qing rule]] and rather imply a geographic unity or distinction of regions inhabited by Mongols in the [[Mongolian Plateau]]. There also exists an English term ''Northern Mongolia'', but possibly with political connotations.&lt;ref name="Bulag"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Nationalism and Hybridity in Mongolia |first=Uradyn|last=Bulag|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1998|pages=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to refer to [[Mongolia]] synchronically.&lt;ref&gt;Bawden, Charles (1997): Mongolian-English dictionary. London: Kegan Paul. Page 23&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mongolian language]], the word ''ar'' refers to the back side of something, which has been extended to mean the northern side of any spatial entity, e.g. a mountain or a yurt. The word ''öbür'' refers to the south (and thus protected) side of a mountain.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Norcin, C. (1999): ''Monggol kelen-ü toli''. Ömnud monggol-un arad-un keblel-ün qoriya. Page 169, 580. ''ömnud: agula dabagan-u engger tal-a-yin gajar''.&lt;/ref&gt; So the difference between South Mongolia and the Mongolian state is conceived of in the metaphor as at the backward northern side vs. the south side of a mountain. In contrast to {{zh|s=漠北蒙古}}, there is also {{zh|s=漠南蒙古|p=Mònán Měnggǔ|l=South of the [[Gobi Desert|Desert]] Mongolia}}, roughly referring to the region now known as South Mongolia.

Today, "North Mongolia" is sometimes still informally used to refer to [[Mongolia]]. "Outer Mongolia" is also used quite commonly in [[Taiwan]]. To avoid confusion between the sovereign nation of Mongolia and China's Inner Mongolia, but to recognize the sovereignty of Mongolia, media in China generally refer to the former as "State of Mongolia" ({{zh|s=蒙古国|p=Ménggǔ Guó}}, that is the translation of the official name in Mongolian, {{lang|mn-Cyrl|Монгол Улс}}/{{lang|mn-Latn|Mongol Uls}}) instead of just "Mongolia" ({{zh|s=蒙古|p=Ménggǔ}}), that could refer to the whole Mongolia area.

The '''Republic of Saugeais''' ({{lang-fr |La République du Saugeais}}, {{IPA-fr|so.ʒɛ|pron}}) is a long-lived self-proclaimed [[micronation]] located in eastern France, in the [[département of Doubs]]. The republic comprises the 11 municipalities of [[Les Alliés]], [[Arçon]], [[Bugny]], [[La Chaux, Doubs|La Chaux-de-Gilley]], [[Gilley, Doubs|Gilley]], [[Hauterive-la-Fresse]], [[La Longeville]], [[Montflovin]], [[Maisons-du-Bois-Lièvremont]], [[Ville-du-Pont]], and its capital [[Montbenoît]].

==History==
In 1947, the [[prefect]] of the département of Doubs came to Montbenoît to attend an official event. The prefect had lunch in the Hôtel de l'Abbaye in Montbenoît, which was owned by Georges Pourchet. As a joke, Pourchet asked the prefect "Do you have a permit allowing you to enter the Republic of Saugeais?" The prefect asked for details on the mysterious republic, which Pourchet made up on the spot. The prefect responded by appointing Pourchet president of the Free Republic of Saugeais.

Georges Pourchet died in 1968 and his wife Gabrielle initially succeeded as president. She retired in 1970 but remained active in Montbenoît, helping the parish priest to preserve the abbey. To raise funds, a festival was organised in 1972, during which Gabrielle Pourchet was elected President for life by [[acclamation]].

President Gabrielle Pourchet appointed a prime minister, a general secretary, twelve ambassadors and more than 300 honorary citizens. A song written in the ''Langue Saugette'', a [[Franco-Provençal]] dialect, by Joseph Botillon in 1910 was adopted as the republic's national anthem. A banknote was released in 1997, and the [[La Poste (France)|French Postal Service]] issued a [[postal stamp]] commemorating the republic in 1987.&lt;ref name=OT-Montbenoît&gt;{{cite web | title= La république du Saugeais | url= http://www.tourisme-loue-saugeais.fr/office-de-tourisme-montbenoit-the-republic-of-the-saugeais_en.php | trans-title= The Saugeais republic | publisher= Office du tourisme du canton de Montbenoît | accessdate= 18 August 2015 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150727100738/http://www.tourisme-loue-saugeais.fr/office-de-tourisme-montbenoit-the-republic-of-the-saugeais_en.php | archivedate= 27 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabrielle Pourchet died on 31 August 2005, at the age of 99, and her daughter Georgette Bertin-Pourchet succeeded as president.

'''Sailing ship tactics''' were the [[naval tactics]] employed by [[sailing ship]]s in contrast to [[galley tactics]] employed by oared vessels. This article focuses on the period from c. 1500 to the mid-19th century, when sailing warships were replaced with steam-powered [[ironclad warship|ironclads]].

==Overview==

===Early history===
Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought much like on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. The first guns on ships were small wrought-iron pieces mounted on the open decks and in the [[fighting top]]s, often requiring only one or two men to handle them. They were designed to injure, kill or simply stun, shock and frighten the enemy prior to boarding.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (1997), pp. 205–6 .&lt;/ref&gt; As guns were made more durable to withstand stronger gunpowder charges, they increased their potential to inflict critical damage to the vessel rather than just its crew. Since these guns were much heavier than the earlier anti-personnel weapons, they had to be placed lower in the ships, and fire from [[gunport]]s, to avoid ships becoming unstable. In Northern Europe the technique of building ships with [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]] planking made it difficult to cut ports in the hull; clinker-built (or clench-built) ships had much of their structural strength in the outer hull. The solution was the gradual adoption of [[Carvel (boat building)|carvel]]-built ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden (2003), pp. 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of propulsion during the 15th century from single-masted, square-rigged [[cog (ship)|cogs]] to three-masted [[carrack]]s with a mix of square and [[lateen]] sails made ships nimbler and easier to manoeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (1997), pp. 71–72 .&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501. According to tradition the inventor was a Breton shipwright called Descharges, but it is just as likely to have been a gradual adaptation of loading ports in the stern of merchant vessels that had already been in use for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (1997), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the gunports were used to mount heavy so-called stern chasers pointing aft, but soon gun ports migrated to the sides of ships. This made possible coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, [[broadside]]s, for the first time in history, at least in theory. Guns in the 16th century were considered to be in fixed positions and were intended to be fired independently rather than in concerted volleys. It was not until the 1590s that the word "broadside" in English was commonly used to refer to gunfire from the side of a ship rather than the ship's side itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (1996), pp. 312, 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century, however, was focused on countering the oar-powered [[galley]]s that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Though far less seaworthy than sailing vessels and highly vulnerable to boarding by ships that rode higher in the water, the galleys were a serious threat due to their ability to aim accurate heavy gunfire low in the hulls of larger sailing ships and to escape solely sail-powered opponents by rowing into the wind.

===Initial tactics===
The [[line of battle]] tactic that allowed efficient use of broadside fire was not put into general use until the mid 17th century, as was described by English General at Sea [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] in his Laws of War and Ordinances of the sea. The previous solution was to make sailing ships fire backwards from the stern, as a defensive measure, or forward from the bow, as an offensive measure. The latter was only partially achieved either by canting (angling) the side guns towards the bow or stern as far as the ship's structure would allow, or to place guns on the [[sterncastle]] and fire them in an arc on either side of the forecastle. Both solutions were problematic since they created a blind spot dead ahead and made it especially difficult to hit low-lying targets, like galleys. The method that was deemed most effective by contemporaries was to simply counter the threat of galleys with other galleys.

Despite the technical innovations, naval [[cannon]] fire also remained grossly inaccurate except at very close ranges. Difficulties in achieving standardization in [[metallurgy]] meant that all guns allowed for considerable "windage", meaning that bore diameters were about 10 percent larger than their ammunition. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms meant that naval tactics for sailing ships throughout the 16th century remained focused on boarding as a means of decisive victory.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (1996); Rodger (1997), pp. 206–8, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval tactics in the [[Age of Sail]] were primarily determined by the [[Sailing ship|sailing]] and fighting qualities of the sailing [[warship]]s of the time. Three factors, in particular, constrained what a sailing [[admiral]] could order his fleet to do. 
* The first constraint was that, like all sailing vessels, sailing warships could not sail directly into the [[wind]]. Most could sail not much closer than 70 degrees off the wind. This limited the maneuverability of a fleet during battles at close quarters. Holding the [[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail#Importance of the weather gage|weather gage]], i.e. being upwind of one's opponent, conferred considerable tactical advantages.
* The second constraint was that the ships of the time carried their guns in two large batteries, one on each broadside, with only a few mounted to fire directly ahead or [[astern]]. The sailing warship was immensely powerful on its sides, but very weak on its [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and [[stern]]. The sides of the ship were built with strong [[timber]]s, but the stern, in particular, was fragile with a flimsy structure around the large windows of the officers' cabins. The bow and, particularly, the stern of the ship were vulnerable to [[raking fire]]. Raking another ship by firing the length of a ship from either the bow or stern caused tremendous damage, because a single shot would fly down the length of the [[Deck (ship)|decks]], while the ship being raked could not return fire with its broadsides. Moreover, the externally-mounted rudder was at the stern, and any hit there would render the ship essentially unsteerable and without the ability to maneuver, even with masts and sails intact.
* The third constraint was the difficulty of communicating at sea. Written communication was almost impossible in a moving fleet, while hailing was extremely difficult above the noise of wind and weather. So admirals were forced to rely on a pre-arranged set of [[International maritime signal flags|signal flags]] hoisted aboard the admiral's [[flagship]]. In the smoke of battle, these were often hard or impossible to see.

The 16th century saw the development of the [[man-of-war]], a truly ocean-going warship, carrying [[square-rigged]] sails that permitted tacking into the wind, and heavily armed with [[cannon]]s. The adoption of heavy guns necessitated their being mounted lower down than on top of the fore and after castles as previously where anti-personnel weapons had been positioned through the later Middle Ages, due to the possibility of [[capsize|capsizing]]. This meant that what had earlier been the hold of a ship that could be used either as a merchant ship or warship was now full with cannon and ammunition. Hence ships became specialised as warships, which would lead to a standing fleet instead of one based on placing temporary contracts.

The man-of-war eventually rendered the galley obsolete except for operations close to shore in calm weather. With the development of the sailing man-of-war, and the beginning of the great sailing fleets capable of keeping at sea for long periods together, came the need for a new adaptation of old principles of [[naval tactics]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Navy |volume=19 |pages=299–317|first=David |last=Hannay |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ship that depended on the wind for its motive power could not hope to ram. A sailing vessel could not ram unless it was running before a good breeze. In a light wind, the charge would be ineffective, and it could not be made at all from [[leeward]]. It could still board, and the Spanish did for long make it their main object to run their bow over an enemy's sides, and invade the deck. In order to carry out this kind of attack they would naturally try to get to [[windward]] and then bear down before the wind in line abreast ship upon ship. But an opponent to leeward could always baffle this attack by edging away, and in the meantime fire with his broadside to cripple his opponent's [[spar (sailing)|spar]]s.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

An important organizational innovation was made by [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. Prior to his leadership, a warship was typically run by a committee of the [[sailing master]], navigator, master-gunner and captain of marines presided over by an aristocrat. Drake saw no purpose in having a member of the aristocracy without specialist knowledge and established the principle that the captain of the ship would be in sole command, based upon his skill and experience rather than social position. This transformation was never quite made in the [[Spanish Navy]] where the "gentlemen" continued to obstruct operations throughout the Age of Sail.

The Revolutionary French Navy made an opposite mistake in promoting seamen without sufficient experience or training, which worked well in the army, but not at sea. The Royal Navy by contrast was well served by many distinguished commanders of middle-class origin, such as [[Horatio Nelson]] (son of a parson), [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] (son of a solicitor) or [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Collingwood]] (son of a butcher) as well as by aristocrats who proved themselves at sea such as [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] and even members of the working-class, such as [[John Benbow]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (2004), p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Line of battle==
{{Main|Line of battle}}
[[File:Abraham Willaerts, Galley and men of war.jpeg|thumb|''A French [[galley]] and Dutch man-of-war off a port'' by [[Abraham Willaerts]], painted 17th century.]]

The first recorded mention of the use of a ''line of battle'' tactic is attested from 1500. The ''Instructions'' provided in 1500 by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, ''The Art of War at Sea'', Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, [[Fernão de Oliveira]], recognized that at sea, the Portuguese "fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pt/books?id=yqNj5BlEMtcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=galleons+portuguese+armada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_Y4EvmGkAB&amp;sig=lpdYoeNfaTJA69Jf1vKyX6QKRM8&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iIEtVZylGOKR7Aa22IHACQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=galleons%20portuguese%20armada&amp;f=false] ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of Warfare: The Triumph of the West'' - Geoffrey Parker, pp. 125–130, Cambridge University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

An early line of battle tactic had been used by the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|Fourth Portuguese India Armada]] in the [[Battle of Calicut (1502)|battle of Calicut]], under [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1502, near [[Zamorin|Malabar]], against a Muslim fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, ''The Military Revolution'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest recorded deliberate use is also documented in the [[First Battle of Cannanore]] between the [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|Third Portuguese India Armada]] under [[João da Nova]] and the naval forces of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], earlier in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Marinha.pt, 2009, ''[http://www.marinha.pt/pt/amarinha/historia/combatesnavais/pages/cananor31dedezembrode1501a2dejaneirode1502.aspx site Cananor - 31 de Dezembro de 1501 a 2 de Janeiro de 1502]''&lt;/ref&gt; This early use of this strategy also consisted in its implementation, in both battles, on only one side of the contenders.

The evolution of naval [[cannon]]s during the first half of the 17th century soon led to the conclusion that the fleet had to fight in a single line to make the maximum use of its firepower without one ship getting in the way of another.

The [[line of battle]] was traditionally attributed to the [[navy]] of the [[Commonwealth of England]] and especially to General at Sea [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] who wrote the ''Sailing and Fighting Instructions'' of 1653. One of the first documented deliberate use seems to be somewhat earlier in the [[Action of 18 September 1639]] by Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] against the Spanish. The tactic was used by both sides in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], and was codified in written 'fighting instructions'. These formed the basis of the whole tactical system of the 17th and 18th centuries in naval warfare.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

One consequence of the line of battle was that a ship had to be strong enough to stand in it. In the old type of mêlée battle a small ship could seek out an opponent of her own size, or combine with others to attack a larger one. As the [[line of battle]] was adopted, navies began to distinguish between vessels that were fit to form parts of the line in action, and the smaller ships that were not. By the time the line of battle was firmly established as the standard tactical formation during the 1660s, [[merchant ship]]s and lightly armed warships became less able to sustain their place in a pitched battle. In the line of battle, each ship had to stand and fight the opposing ship in the enemy line, however powerful she might be. The purpose-built ships powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be known as a [[ship of the line]].

==Importance of the weather gage==
Holding the weather, or windward, gage conferred several important tactical advantages. The admiral holding the [[weather gage]] held the tactical initiative, able to accept battle by bearing down on his opponent or to refuse it, by remaining upwind. The fleet with the lee gage could avoid battle by withdrawing to leeward, but could not force action. Even retreating downwind could be difficult once two fleets were at close quarters because the ships risked being raked as they turned downwind. A second disadvantage of the leeward gage was that in anything more than a light wind, a sailing ship that is sailing close hauled (or beating) will heel to leeward under the pressure of the wind on its sails. The ships of a fleet on the leeward gage heel away from their opponents, exposing part of their bottoms to shot. If a ship is penetrated in an area of the hull that is normally under water, she is then in danger of taking on water or even sinking when on the other tack. This is known as "hulled between wind and water". Finally, smoke from the gunfire of the ships to windward would blow down on the fleet on the leeward gage. So it was common for battles to involve days of manoeuvring as one admiral strove to take the weather gage from his opponent in order to force him to action, as at the battles of [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Ushant]] (1778), St Lucia Channel (1780) and the [[Glorious First of June|First of June]] (1794).

Only in heavy weather could the windward gage become a disadvantage, because the lower gun ports on the leeward side of a ship would be awash, preventing her from opening her lower-deck ports to use the guns – or risking being swamped if she did. So, in strong winds, a ship attacking from windward would not be able to bring her heavy lower-deck guns into action, while the enemy ship to leeward would have no such problem as the guns on her windward side would be raised by the heel. For this reason, Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rodney]] ordered his ships to attack the Spanish from leeward in the stormy weather at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] in 1780.

==Development of tactics in the French Navy==
In the [[French Navy]], sailing tactics were developed by the treatises of the French tacticians Paul Hoste, [[Bigot de Morogues]] and Bourde de Villehuet, which developed the traditional code of practice and were all translated into other languages.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; 
During the 18th century, French governments developed the strategic doctrine of focusing on the mission, rather than fighting for command of the sea. The French government was often reluctant to take tactical risks to achieve its strategic objectives. The navy was hampered by the timidity of its orders. French fleets and squadrons typically sought to avoid battle rather than risk a contest with a British force, as De Ternay did in June 1780 on meeting a smaller British squadron under [[William Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] off [[Bermuda]].
This strategy had important tactical ramifications. French ships tended to fire at the rigging of their opponents to disable them and allow the French ships to escape and continue with their mission. French ships typically fired their broadsides on the upward roll of the ship, disabling their opponents but doing little damage to the enemy ships or their crews. This was compounded by the French tendency to fight from the leeward gage, causing the guns to point high as the ships heeled with the wind. British and Dutch ships, by contrast, tended to use the opposite tactic of firing on the downward roll into the enemy hulls, causing a storm of flying splinters that killed and maimed the enemy gun crews. This difference in tactics goes some way to explaining the difference in casualty figures between British and French crews, with French fleets tending to suffer not only more casualties but also a higher proportion of killed than wounded.

==Tactical stagnation in the mid-18th century==
When the conflict came to be between the British and the French in the 18th century, battles between equal or approximately equal forces became largely inconclusive. The French, who had fewer ships than the British throughout the century, were anxious to fight at the least possible cost, lest their fleet should be worn out by severe action, leaving Britain with an unreachable numerical superiority. Therefore, they preferred to engage to leeward, a position which left them free to retreat before the wind. They allowed the British fleet to get to windward, and, when it was parallel with them and bore up before the wind to attack, they moved onwards. The attacking fleet had then to advance, not directly before the wind with its ships moving along lines perpendicular to the line attacked, but in slanting or curving lines. The assailants would be thrown into "a bow and quarter line" – with the bow of the second level with the after part of the first and so on from end to end. In the case of a number of ships of various powers of sailing, it was a difficult formation to maintain.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The result was often that the ships of the attacking line which were steering to attack the enemy's centre came into action first and were liable to be crippled in the rigging. If the same formation was to be maintained, the others were now limited to the speed of the injured vessels, and the enemy to leeward slipped away. At all times a fleet advancing from windward was liable to injury in spars, even if the leeward fleet did not deliberately aim at them. The leeward ships would be leaning away from the wind, and their shot would always have a tendency to fly high. So long as the assailant remained to windward, the ships to leeward could always slip off.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The wars of the 18th century produced a series of tactically indecisive naval battles between evenly matched fleets in line ahead, such as [[Battle of Málaga (1704)|Málaga]] (1704), [[Battle of Rügen Island|Rügen Island]] (1715), [[Battle of Toulon (1744)|Toulon]] (1744), [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Minorca]] (1756), [[Battle of Negapatam (1758)|Negapatam]] (1758), [[Battle of Cuddalore (1758)|Cuddalore]] (1758), [[Battle of Pondicherry|Pondicherry]] (1759), [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Ushant]] (1778), [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|Dogger Bank]] (1781), [[Battle of the Chesapeake|the Chesapeake]] (1781), [[Battle of Hogland|Hogland]] (1788) and [[Battle of Öland (1789)|Öland]] (1789). Although a few of these battles had important ''strategic'' consequences, like [[Battle of the Chesapeake|the Chesapeake]] which the British needed to win, all were ''tactically'' indecisive. Many admirals began to believe that a contest between two equally matched fleets could not produce a decisive result. The tactically decisive actions of the 18th century were all chase actions,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} where one fleet was clearly superior to the other, such as the two battles of Finisterre (1747), and those at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] (1759), [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]] (1759) and [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Cape St. Vincent]] (1780).

British naval innovation was retarded by an unseemly dispute between two Admirals in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Toulon (1744)|Battle of Toulon]]. The British fleet under Admiral [[Thomas Mathews]] had been unable to draw level with the French fleet but Mathews nevertheless ordered an attack, intending all the British ships to attack the French rear. He had no signals by which he could communicate his intentions, and the rear squadron under Vice Admiral [[Richard Lestock]], his rival and second-in-command, obtusely remained at the prescribed intervals in line ahead, far to the rear of the action. A subsequent series of [[courts-martial]], in which political influence was brought to bear by Lestock's friends in Parliament, punished Mathews and those captains who had supported him in the battle, and vindicated Lestock. In several future actions, Admirals who were tempted to deviate from the Admiralty's fighting instructions were reminded of Mathews's fate.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (2004), pp.243-245&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments during the American War of Independence==
The unsatisfactory character of the accepted method of fighting battles at sea had begun to be obvious to naval officers, both French and British,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; by the later 18th century and began to be addressed during the numerous battles of the [[American War of Independence]]. It was clear that the only way to produce decisive results was to concentrate the attack on part of the enemy's line, preferably the rear since the centre would have to turn to its support.

The great French admiral [[Pierre Andre de Suffren Saint Tropez|Suffren]] condemned naval tactics as being little better than so many excuses for avoiding a real fight. He endeavoured to find a better method, by concentrating superior forces on parts of his opponent's line in some of his actions with the British fleet in the East Indies in 1782 and 1783, such as the [[Battle of Sadras]] where Suffren tried to double the rear of the British line. But his orders were ill obeyed, his opponent [[Edward Hughes (admiral)|Sir Edward Hughes]] was competent, and the quality of his fleet was not superior to the British.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Similarly, the British admiral [[George Rodney|Rodney]], in the [[Battle of Martinique (1780)|Battle of Martinique]] in the West Indies in 1780, tried to concentrate a superior force on part of his enemy's line by throwing a greater number of British ships on the rear of the French line. But his directions were misunderstood and not properly executed. Moreover, he did not then go beyond trying to place a larger number of ships in action to windward against a smaller number to leeward by arranging them at a less distance than two-cables length. An enemy who took the simple and obvious course of closing his line could baffle the attack, and while the retreat to leeward remained open could still slip away.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Like Suffren, Rodney was a great tactician, but a difficult man to work with who failed to explain his intentions to his subordinates.

[[File:Whitcombe, Battle of the Saints.jpg|thumb|Rodney's success in breaking the French line brought on a decisive engagement at the [[Battle of the Saintes]]]]

At the [[Battle of the Saintes]] on 12 April 1782, [[George Rodney|Rodney]] was induced, by a change in the wind and the resulting disorder in the French line, to break his own line and pass through the enemy line. The effect was decisive. The guns of the British ships were concentrated on a handful of French ships as the British broke through the French line in three places, and the tactical cohesion of the French fleet was destroyed. By the end of the battle, Rodney had taken the French [[flagship]] and four other ships. The successful result of this departure from the old practice of keeping the line intact throughout the battle ruined the [[moral authority]] of the orthodox system of tactics.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Sir John Clerk of Eldin===
The inconclusive results of so many battles at sea interested [[John Clerk of Eldin|Sir John Clerk of Eldin]] (1728–1812), a gentleman of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], illustrator of geologist [[James Hutton]]'s ''Theory of the Earth''&lt;!---, e.g. [[File:Hutton_Unconformity_,_Jedburgh.jpg]]---&gt;, and great-uncle of [[James Clerk Maxwell]].  He began developing a series of speculations and calculations which he initially published in pamphlets, distributing them among naval officers, and published in book form as ''An Essay on Naval Tactics'' in 1790, 1797 and 1804.

The hypothesis which governed all of Clerk's demonstrations was that as the British navy was superior in gunnery and seamanship to their enemy, it was in their interest to produce a mêlée. He advanced various ingenious suggestions for concentrating superior forces on parts of the enemy's line – by preference on the rear, since the centre must lose time in turning to its support.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Technical innovations in the late 18th century==
By the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1793, a series of technical innovations first introduced during the [[American War of Independence]] had combined to give the British fleet a distinct superiority over the ships of the French and Spanish navies. These innovations were:
* '''The [[carronade]]''': the carronade was a short-barrelled gun which threw a heavy ball developed by the [[Carron Company]], a Scottish ironworks, in 1778. Because of irregularities in the size of cannonballs and the difficulty of boring out gun barrels there was usually a considerable gap between the ball and the bore - often as much as a quarter of an inch - with a consequent loss of efficiency. This gap was known as the "windage". The manufacturing practices introduced by the Carron Company reduced the windage considerably, enabling the ball to be fired with less powder and hence a smaller and lighter gun. The carronade was half the weight of an equivalent long gun, but could throw a heavy ball over a limited distance. The light weight of the carronade meant that the guns could be added to the forecastle and quarterdeck of frigates and ships of the line, increasing firepower without affecting the ship's sailing qualities. It became known as the “smasher” and gave ships armed with carronades a great advantage at short range. 
* '''The [[flintlock]]''': flintlock firing mechanisms for cannon were suggested by Captain Sir [[Charles Douglas (admiral)|Charles Douglas]] and introduced during the American War of Independence in place of the traditional matches. Flintlocks enabled a higher rate of fire and greater accuracy as the gun captain could choose the exact moment of firing. Prior to this the Royal Navy introduced the use of goose quills filled with powder during the [[Seven Years' War]] giving an almost instantaneous burn time compared with earlier methods of detonation.
* '''A wider field of fire''': by the simple expedient of attaching the gun ropes at a greater distance from the gunports, the British gunnery innovator Captain Sir [[Charles Douglas (admiral)|Charles Douglas]] increased the range through which each cannon could be traversed, increasing the ship's field of fire. The new system was first tested at the Battle of the Saintes, in 1782, where the ''Duke'', ''Formidable'' and ''Arrogant'', and perhaps other British ships, had adopted Douglas's new system.
* '''Copper sheathing''': after many trials, [[copper]] was found to be a practicable means of protecting the hulls of ships from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]]. Copper sheathing delayed the growth of weeds on the hull, improving the sailing performance of ships that had been long out of dock. This had significant strategic as well as tactical implications. Up to 1780, the British, who kept their ships at sea for longer periods, had almost always found that the clean French ships were faster and could therefore avoid battle if they wished. The introduction of copper sheathing meant that ships that had spent months on blockade were not necessarily at an immediate speed disadvantage to enemy ships coming freshly out of port.

==Developments during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars==
By the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1793, technical innovations and the disorganization of the French Navy wrought by the revolution had combined to give British ships a distinct superiority over the ships of the French and Spanish navies. Britain had a far larger ocean [[trade]] than any of her principal enemies, and a much bigger reserve of professional seamen from which to man her warships. Throughout the 18th century the French and, particularly, the Spanish navy suffered from serious manning difficulties and were often forced to complete the ships' crews with soldiers or landsmen.

British ships not only had a higher proportion of seamen in the first place, but the long months at sea on [[blockade]] or [[convoy]] escort gave British captains plenty of opportunities to train their crews. British gun crews seem to have achieved a much higher rate of fire than French or Spanish gun crews, contributing to the much higher casualties suffered by ships from those fleets. The better seamanship, faster gunnery and higher morale of British crews was a decisive advantage that could not be compensated for by any amount of bravery on the part of their opponents.

The leading British admirals like [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Howe]] devoted their thoughts to how to break the enemy's line in order to bring on the kind of pell mell battle that would bring decisive results. At the [[Glorious First of June|Battle of the First of June]] in 1794, [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] ordered his fleet to steer through the enemy, and then to engage the French ships from the ''leeward'', so as to cut off their usual retreat. This had the effect of bringing his fleet into a melee in which the individual superiority of his ships would have free play. 
[[File:Trafalgar1.jpg|thumb|Nelson's unorthodox head-on attack at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] produced a mêlée that destroyed the Franco-Spanish fleet]]

Throughout the wars, which lasted, with a brief interval of peace, from 1793 to 1815, British admirals like [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]], [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan of Camperdown|Duncan]] and particularly [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] grew constantly bolder in the method they adopted for producing the desired mêlée or pell-mell action at the battles of [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)|Cape St. Vincent]], [[Battle of Camperdown|Camperdown]] and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The most radical tactic was the head-on approach in column used by Nelson at Trafalgar, which invited a [[raking fire]] to which his own ships could not reply as they approached, but then produced a devastating [[raking fire]] as the British ships passed through the Franco-Spanish line.

It has sometimes been argued that the tactics of these British admirals were rash and would have proved disastrous if tried against more skilful opponents. But this is one of those criticisms which are of value only against those who think that there can be a magic efficacy in any particular attack, which makes its success infallible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} That the tactics of British admirals of the great wars of 1793–1815 had in themselves no such virtue was amply demonstrated at the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] in 1811. They were justified because the reliance of admirals on the quality of their fleets was well founded. It should be borne in mind that a vessel, while bearing down on an enemy's line, could not be exposed to the fire of three enemies at once when at a distance less than 950 yards, because the guns could not be trained to converge on a nearer point. The whole range of effective fire was only a thousand yards or a very little over. The chance that a ship would be dismasted and stopped before reaching the enemy's line was small.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Fighting at anchor==
Towards the end of the period of sailing navies, a number of fights took place between defending fleets or squadron anchored close to the shore or in harbours, and attacking fleets forced to sail to within range while under fire.

Such battles tended to be decisive, as a wind which was fair to allow the attackers to enter a harbour or anchorage would let neither side out again. As it would normally be more profitable for the attackers to blockade the enemy until they were forced to sortie to accept battle in open water, such attacks were usually forced by lack of time, e.g. by shortage of supplies, the threatened onset of bad weather or the need to coordinate operations with an army on land.

The defenders could expect to enjoy several advantages. As they would not need to manoeuvre under sail, most of the ships' crews could man the guns. If properly prepared, the ships would have "springs"; extra cables bound to the anchor cables, which they could haul in or let out to veer the ship to bring its guns to bear over a wide arc. If close to a naval establishment (such as at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]]), they could rely on boats from the shore to bring extra ammunition or replacements for casualties and if in range the defending ships could be aided by coastal gun batteries.  The worst British naval reverse of the Napoleonic wars occurred during an attack on a protected anchorage at the [[Battle of Grand Port]].

'''Shadow matching''' (a.k.a. Shadow mapping) is a new positioning method that improves positioning accuracy of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) in urban environments. The shadow matching positioning principle was first proposed and the name 'shadow matching' was first introduced by Paul D Groves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groves|first1=Paul D|title=Shadow Matching: A New GNSS Positioning Technique for Urban Canyons|journal=Journal of Navigation|date=2011|volume=64|issue=03|pages=417–430|doi=10.1017/S0373463311000087|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8292643}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of shadow matching combines two commonly known principles together: GNSS signal availability determination using 3D building models and the fingerprinting-like positioning techniques.

The principle of shadow matching is simple. Due to obstruction by buildings in urban canyons, from many GNSS satellites will be receivable in some parts of a street, but not others. Where each direct signal is receivable can be predicted using a 3D city model. Consequently, by determining whether a direct signal is being received from a given satellite, the user can localize their position to within one of two areas of the street. By considering other satellites, the position solution may be refined further. At each epoch, a set of candidate user positions is generated close to the user’s low-accuracy conventional GNSS positioning solution. At each candidate user position, the predicted satellite visibility is matched with the real observations. The candidate position that has the best match between the prediction and the real observations can be deemed the shadow matching positioning solution. This process can be conducted epoch by epoch, so the GNSS user can be either static or dynamic.

The '''Spectacled Bear Conservation Society - Peru''' ('''SBC''') is a team of researchers and [[conservationists]] working to study and protect the [[endangered]] [[spectacled bear]] (''Tremarctos ornatus''), also known as the [[Andean]] bear. Spectacled bears are the only surviving species of bear native to South America, and the only surviving member of the subfamily [[Tremarctinae]], the short-faced bears. Their range is the Andean Mountains from Venezuela to Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.bearplanet.org/spectacledbear.shtml
 |title = Spectacled Bears
 |publisher = Bear Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The organization began in 2006 when Canadian conservation biologist Robyn Appleton recognized that little research had been done on the spectacled bear. She connected with former hunter turned conservationist Javier Vallejos to go into the field and conduct the first observational study on wild spectacled bears. They discovered the first active maternal den site, and fitted the first wild Peruvian spectacled bear with a GPS collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://wildnet.org/expospeakers2015
 |title = Wildlife Conservation Expo Guest Speakers 2015
 |publisher = [[Wildlife Conservation Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was formally established as a Canadian non-profit in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://threadsofperu.com/the-spectacled-bear-conservation-society
 |title = Spotlight on: The Spectacled Bear Conservation Society
 |publisher = Threads of Peru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Research===
SBC conducts research to better understand the behaviors, range, foraging, mating, dispersal, and reproductive ecology of the spectacled bear. This is done using [[camera trap]]s, [[GPS]]-[[satellite]] collars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://blogs.sandiegozoo.org/2010/11/29/training-andean-bear-field-crew/
 |title = Training Andean Bear Field Crew
 |publisher = [[San Diego Zoo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; remote video surveillance and collection of genetic samples such as hair.

===Conservation outreach===
SBC staff spends time training local people in research methods and in 2010 the El Centro de Conservación de Batán Grande (Conservation Centre of Batán Grande) was established as a place for local educators and conservationists to conduct workshops and presentations for local villagers. SBC also formed a cooperative of women who live in Batan Grande that produce hand-felted animals to financially assist the local community as well as connect it with the conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://threadsofperu.com/the-spectacled-bear-conservation-society
 |title = Spotlight on: The Spectacled Bear Conservation Society
 |publisher = Threads of Peru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 Robyn Appleton representing the Spectacled Bear Conservation Society - Peru, was a featured guest speaker at the annual [[Wildlife Conservation Network]] Expo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://wildnet.org/expospeakers2015
 |title = Wildlife Conservation Expo Guest Speakers 2015
 |publisher = [[Wildlife Conservation Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection of habitat===
In part due to SBC's discoveries and outreach efforts, the [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] government established a wildlife refuge, El Parque Arqueológico y Ecológico de Batán Grande which joins another protected park in hopes of extending a [[conservation corridor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Transboundary rivers of Bangladesh==

[[Bangladesh]] has at least 58 major rivers that enter the nation from  [[India]] or [[Myanmar]]. The hydrologic and political effects of rivers that cross significant boundaries are enormous. Rivers have positive effects in that they carry a significant amount of sediment, which aids in building land in [[Estuary|estuarine]] regions.  However this sediment raises the height of riverbeds, thereby causing flooding. [[International convention]]s governing water sharing have led to complex political disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2193796 |author=Maxwell, Daniel M |date=28 October 2012 |title=Exchanging Power: Prospects of Nepal-India Cooperation for Hydropower Development |journal=Keck Journal of Foreign Affairs, Forthcoming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India and Bangladesh share 54 common rivers, of which agreement has been reached only on sharing of waters of the river [[Ganges]]. The ''India-Bangladesh Treaty on the Sharing of the Ganges Waters'' was signed on December 12, 1996 and is based on a sharing formula of the flows measured at Farakka, during the lean season each year, from 1 January to 31 May. The 30-year treaty is renewable by mutual consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mea.gov.in/foreignrelation/bangladesh.pdf  |format=PDF| title =India-Bangladesh Political Relations | accessdate = 2007-12-18 | last = | first =   | work = Sharing of River Waters | publisher = Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925125012/http://www.mea.gov.in/foreignrelation/bangladesh.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
