'''Anthropomancy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''anthropos'' (''ἄνθρωπος'', man) and ''manteia'' (''μαντεία'', divination)) is a method of [[divination]] by the entrails of dead or dying men or women, often virgin female children, through sacrifice.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} This practice was sometimes also called '''splanchomancy'''. In ancient [[Etruria]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the usual variety of divination from entrails was haruspicy (performed by an [[haruspex]]), in which the sacrifice was an animal.

Bahá’u’lláh formally abolished the practice of slavery among Baha’is in the [[Kitab-i-Aqdas]] (ca. 1873). The English translation of the relevant section is as follows:

::''It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is not for him who is himself a servant to buy another of God's servants, and this hath been prohibited in His Holy Tablet. Thus, by His mercy, hath the commandment been recorded by the Pen of justice. Let no man exalt himself above another; all are but bondslaves before the Lord, and all exemplify the truth that there is none other God but Him. He, verily, is the All-Wise, Whose wisdom encompasseth all things.''

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letter to Queen Victoria, written to her between 1868 and 1872, Bahá’u’lláh had singled out the action of the British government in using its power to stamp out the world trade in slaves for particular commendation.

::''We have been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous Revelation. God hath, truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this.

In 1844, when the Báb declared his mission, slavery was still [[Slavery in Iran|very widespread]]. When the Báb went on the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage in 1844, he was accompanied by [[Quddús]] and an Ethiopian slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/19760926_001/19760926_001.pdf |title= Message to the International Teaching Conference, Nairobi, Kenya |last= Universal House of Justice | authorlink=  Universal House of Justice  |first= |date= September 26, 1976 |website= Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice |publisher= |access-date= February 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family the Báb was born into possessed several slaves: one was his first tutor, and the subject of a eulogy penned by his young pupil/master in later years, crediting him as having raised him and praises him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Slavery was not finally abolished in Iran until 1929.&lt;ref group=note&gt;On February 7, 1929 the Iranian National Parliament ratified an anti-slavery bill that outlawed slave trade or any other claim of ownership over human beings. The bill also empowered the government to take immediate action for emancipation of all slaves.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison though slavery had been abolished in the British Empire as late as 1833,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]] passed in 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834 (with the exception of [[St. Helena]], Ceylon and the territories administered by the East India Company, though these exclusions were later repealed). Under the Act, slaves were granted full [[emancipation]] after a period of 4 to 6 years of "apprenticeship".&lt;/ref&gt; it remained legal in the United States until 1863.&lt;ref group=note&gt;On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary proclamation warning that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state in rebellion against the Union this took effect on January 1, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nor was slavery immediately abolished among followers of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh.

The household in which Bahá’u’lláh was raised also included a number of slaves. He became the owner of these on the death of his father, whereupon he gave each of them the choice of remaining in his service as free servants, or leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1956, after members of various tribes in South Africa became Bahá'ís, a [[Bahá'í administration|regional Bahá'í Assembly]] which included South Africa was elected. Later each of the constituent countries successively formed their own independent Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]]. Then in 1995, after a prolonged period of growth and oppression during [[Apartheid]] and the [[Bantustan|homelands]] reuniting with South Africa, the Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of South Africa was formed. In 2005 Bahá'ís were estimated at about 240,100 adherents.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

1911 marks the beginning of a presence of the Bahá'í Faith in South Africa at the home of Agnes Cook in Sea Point, [[Cape Town]]. Mr. and Mrs. William Fraetas from [[Muizenberg]] who had met [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Bahá'u'lláh]], in New York, in 1912 came back to South Africa.

=== `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan ===

`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned [[Africa]] and were written on 19 April 1916 and 15 February 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on 4 April 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on 12 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá mentions Bahá'ís traveling "…especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe"&lt;ref name="ToDP8"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, IL |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-8.html.iso8859-1 | pages = 47–59 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and " …the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, IL |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-12.html.iso8859-1 | pages = 82–89 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá Bahá'ís began to move to South Africa. By 1929 there were 6 small groups of Bahá'ís mainly due to [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] and travelling Bahá'ís, notably [[Martha Root]], in the Western Cape and near [[Johannesburg]]. The very first [[Local Spiritual Assembly|local Bahá'í Assembly]] formed in [[Pretoria]] in 1925 but was dissolved in 1931, and by about 1937 only one Bahá'í remained from that period, Mrs. Agnes Carey. Carey was a social worker for women prisoners who had been released from the Pretoria prison, and because of her staunchness in the religion she was later honoured with the title of "The Mother of the Bahá'ís of South Africa" by [[Shoghi Effendi]], who was appointed the leader of the religion after `Abdu'l-Bahá's death. Shoghi Effendi had travelled through South Africa in 1929 and 1940.&lt;ref name="generations"&gt;{{cite news

Turvey was unaware of the existence of other Bahá'ís in South Africa including Agnes Carey. As a result, Turvey spent thirteen years believing he was the sole Bahá'í in South Africa. For his patience, devotion and subsequent services to the African Bahá'ís in his latter years, he was given the title of "The Father of the Bahá'ís of South Africa".&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Ten-Year Crusade ==

In 1953 Shoghi Effendi planned an international teaching plan termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; During the plan 65 pioneers from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[New Zealand]] and [[England]] settled in South Africa. Many of the pioneers settled permanently in the country; [[William Sears (Bahá'í)|William Sears]] and his family, Harry and Margaret Ford, and Robert Miller and his family settled in Johannesburg; Ruth and Bishop Brown, who were Margaret Ford's mother and stepfather, settled in [[Durban]]. Lowell and Edith Johnson settled in Cape Town while Eleanor and Lyall Hadden settled in Pretoria.

In 1954 in Pretoria, Klaas Mtsweni, a [[Zulu people|Zulu]], became the first indigenous South African to become a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="generations"/&gt; In the succeeding years members of other South African ethnic groups including the [[Tswana people|Tswana]], the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], the southern and Northern [[Sotho people]]s, the [[Coloured]] ethnic group, the [[Cape Coloureds]], the [[Cape Malays]], and [[White people|White]], [[Afrikaner]]s became Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1959, after years of political involvement in [[African National Congress|ANC]] related organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Igama Lamakhosikazi| first = Malibongwe| title = ANC Women's League - 50 Years of struggle| work = Official Webpage| publisher = The ANC Women's League| year = 2008| url = http://www.anc.org.za/wl/docs/50years.html| accessdate = 2008-03-19 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080220030006/http://www.anc.org.za/wl/docs/50years.html| archivedate = 20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1950s, [[Bertha Mkize]] became a Bahá'í and withdrew from political involvements and instead [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneered]] to [[KwaZulu]] where she helped found 28 Bahá'í communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Universal House of Justice | title = Bertha Mkhize - 1889-1981| journal = The Bahá'í World| volume = XVIII| publisher = Bahá'í World Centre| page = 773| year = 1986| url = http://bahai-library.org/books/bw18/773-800.html| isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1956 the Bahá'í Faith was present in small numbers across 15 countries of Southern Africa including islands off Southern Africa. To administer these Bahá'í communities a regional governing body was elected in South Africa to cover them. Following the death of Shoghi Effendi and the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], the islands of the Indian Ocean and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland each formed their own [[National Spiritual Assembly]] in 1964. Starting in 1967 the number of Bahá'ís in the region was growing and it was necessary for new independent National Assemblies to be formed in those countries: 1967 - [[Zambia]]; 1970 - [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]], [[Zimbabwe]]; 1971 - [[Lesotho]]; 1972 - [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Reunion Island]]; 1977 - [[Swaziland]]; 1981 - [[Namibia]]; 1985 - [[Mozambique]]; 1991 - [[Angola]]; and in 1995 a re-united South Africa which included [[Bophuthatswana]], [[Ciskei]] and [[Transkei]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

== Apartheid ==
The 1959 [[Come Back, Africa]] film about Apartheid mentions the Bahá'í Faith as part of the discussion on the philosophical underpinnings of how the Africans were to respond to the challenge of Apartheid.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite web

It is not known if the cause of the mention of the religion was scripted or improvised, and if by the choice of [[Lionel Rogosin]], the filmmaker (who may have encountered the religion in Israel or the USA) or the Africans themselves because of their exposure to the religion in the country.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

As another context for responding to the challenges of the period, it is known that the [[Sophiatown Renaissance]] was inspired by the [[Harlem Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt; The role of [[Alain Locke]] is key in that renaissance and Locke was a Bahá'í very involved in advocacy of Africans, African ideas, and internationalist thinking in line with the world-view of the religion.&lt;ref name=Buck64&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Buck|title=Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR_DF2MRlsIC&amp;pg=PA64|year=2005|publisher=Kalimat Press|isbn=978-1-890688-38-7|pages=64, 198| series =Studies in Bábí and Bahá'í Religions | volume =18  | editor-last = Series Lee | editor-first =Anthony A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Faced with the segregated social pattern and laws of [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] in South Africa, the integrated population of Bahá'ís had to decide how to be composed in their administrative structures &amp;ndash; whether the National Spiritual Assembly would be all black or all white. The Bahá'í community decided that instead of dividing the South African Bahá'í community into two population groups, one black and one white, they instead limited membership in the [[Bahá'í administration]] to black adherents, and placed the entire Bahá'í community under the leadership of its black population.&lt;ref name="conference"&gt;{{cite book | author = Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Abhorring all forms of [[prejudice]] and rejecting any system of [[Racial segregation|segregation]], the Bahá'í Faith was introduced on a one-to-one basis and the community quietly grew during the apartheid years, without publicity. Despite the nature of the politics of that time, we presented our [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]] on unity and the oneness of humankind to prominent individuals in politics, commerce and academia and leaders of thought including State Presidents.... [b]oth individual Bahá'ís and our administrative institutions were continually watched by the security police.... Our activities did not include opposition to the previous Government for involvement in partisan politics and opposition to government are explicitly prohibited by the sacred Texts of our Faith.... During the time when the previous [[Industrial Conciliation Act, 1956|Government prohibited integration within our communities]], rather than divide into separate administrative structures for each population group, we opted to limit membership of the Bahá'í Administration to the black adherents who were and remain in the majority of our membership and thereby placed the entire Bahá'í community under the stewardship of its black membership.... The pursuit of our objectives of unity and equality has not been without costs. The "white" Bahá'ís were often ostracized by their white neighbours for their association with "non-whites". The Black Bahá'ís were subjected to scorn by their black compatriots for their lack of political action and their complete integration with their white Bahá'í brethren. The most tragic loss to our community was the brutal execution of four of our adherents, at our places of worship, three in [[Mdantsane]] and one in [[Umtata]].&lt;ref name="conference" /&gt;&lt;ref name="strc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trcsa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shooting"&gt;{{cite news| last = Reber| first = Pat| title = Baha'i Church Shooting Verdicts in| publisher = South Africa Associated Press| date = 1999-05-02| url = http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/1999/031599-1.html| accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== South African regional conference ===

Regional conferences were called for by the [[Universal House of Justice]] 20 October 2008 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas. Just two weeks later twin conferences were held - one in South Africa and the other in [[Bahá'í Faith in Kenya|Kenya]]. One regional conference was hosted by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South Africa in Johannesburg in November 2008 and attracted over 1000 Bahá'ís from Angola, Botswana, La Reunion, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, and Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author = Bahá'í International Community | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Big turnout for regional Baha’i conferences | newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service | date = 2008-11-11 | url = http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story/668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bairat Temple''' is a freestanding Buddhist temple, a [[Chaityagriha]], located about a mile southwest of the city [[Bairat]], [[Rajasthan]], [[India]], on a hill locally called "Bijak-ki-Pahari" ("Hill of the Inscription").&lt;ref name=Asijaipur/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASI/&gt; The temple is of a circular type, formed of a central [[stupa]] surrounded by a circular colonnade and an enclosing wall.&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt; It was built during the time of [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BCE, and near it were found two of Ashoka's [[Minor Rock Edicts]], the Bairat and the Calcutta-Bairat Minor Rock Edicts.&lt;ref name=BA233&gt;Le Huu Phuoc, 2010, p.233-237&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is an important marker of the [[architecture of India]].

==A rare circular stand-alone temple==
Early Chaitya halls are known from the 3rd century BCE. They generally followed a circular or [[apsidal]] plan, and were either rock-cut or freestanding.&lt;ref name=AH&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chakrabarty |first1=Dilip K. |title=India: An Archaeological History: Palaeolithic Beginnings to Early Historic Foundations |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199088140 |page=421 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPQtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT421 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temples —built on elliptical, circular, quadrilateral, or apsidal plans— were initially constructed using brick and timber.&lt;ref name=Chandra&gt;Chandra (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Some temples of timber with  [[wattle-and-daub]] may have preceded them, but none remain to this day.&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt;

Today, only the foundation of the temple remains.&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt; The circular temple was located inside a rectangular enclosure wall, and had an outer diameter of 5.6 meters.&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt; It was built around a small stupa at the centre, with a diameter of 1.6 meters.&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt; There was also an internal circle of 26 wooden octagonal columns surrounding the stupa.&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt;&lt;ref name=Asijaipur&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asijaipurcircle.nic.in/Bairat%20-%20Excavated%20site.html|title=ASI Notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout created two ''[[pradaksina]]'' circular paths for devotional deambulation. The global shape of the temple has been inferred from more or less contemporary reliefs of such buildings from [[Bharhut]], or from rock-cut temples at [[Kondivite]], [[Tulja caves]] or [[Guntupalli caves]].&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt;

Its has been suggested that this circular design with columns was derived from the similar design of the Greek [[Tholos (architecture)|Tholos]].&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt; However local circular hut designs are a more probable source of inspiration.&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt;

===Minor Rock Edict of Ashoka===
A [[Minor Rock Edict]] of [[Ashoka]] (the unique Minor Rock Edict No.3) was found in close proximity to the Temple: the Bairat-Calcutta Edict, also called the Bhabru Edict, from the name of a nearby village.&lt;ref name=ASI&gt;{{cite book |title=Archaeological Survey Of India Four Reports Made During The Years 1862 - 63 - 64 - 65 Volume Ii |date=1871 |pages=242–248 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Four_Reports_Made_During_the_Years_1862.html?id=3s4OAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating to circa 250 BCE, the edict was found just in front of the remains of the Bairat Temple, on the lower platform located between the temple and the cannon-shaped large rock ({{coord|27.417124|76.162569|display=inline}}).&lt;ref name=ASI/&gt; The presence of this inscription, its date and its Buddhist content, help date the temple with a high level of certainty, as well as confirm its Buddhist affiliation.&lt;ref name=ASI/&gt;

The Edict, relocated since the 19th century to the [[Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society of Bengal]] in [[Calcutta]] (hence the name "Calcutta-Bairat Edict)", is the only one of its kind, describing Buddhist scriptures recommended by Ashoka for study. It reads:

The [[Magadha]] king Priyadarsin, having saluted the [[Samgha]] hopes they are both well and comfortable.

It is known to you, Sirs, how great is my reverence and faith in the [[Buddha]], the [[Dharma]] (and) the [[Samgha]].

Whatsoever, Sirs, has been spoken by the blessed Buddha, all that is quite well spoken.

But, Sirs, what would indeed appear to me (to be referred to by the words of the scripture): "thus the true Dharma will be of long duration", that I feel bound to declare:

The following expositions of the Dharma, Sirs, (viz.) the ''Vinaya-Samukasa'' ("The Exaltation of Discipline"), the ''Aliya-vasas'' ("The Ideal Mode of Life"), the ''Anagata-bhayas'' ("Fears to Come"), the ''Muni-gathas'' ("The Songs of the Hermit"), the ''Moneya-Suta'' ("Discourse on the Hermit Life"), the ''Upatisa-pasina'' ("The Questions of Upatishya"), and the ''Laghulovada'' ("The Sermon to [[Rahula]]") which was spoken by the blessed Buddha concerning falsehood, — I desire, Sirs, that many groups of monks and (many) nuns may repeatedly listen to these expositions of the Dharma and may reflect (on them).

In the same way both laymen and laywomen (should act).

For the following (purpose), Sirs, am I causing this to be written, (viz.) in order that they may know my intention.

==Other circular temples==
Some of the earliest free-standing temples may have been of a circular type. [[Ashoka]] also built the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]] circa 250 BCE, also a circular structure, in order to protect the [[Bodhi tree]] under which the [[Buddha]] had found enlightenment. Representations of this early temple structure are found [[:File:Adoration_of_the_Diamond_Throne_and_the_Bodhi_Tree_Bharhut_relief.jpg|on a 100 BCE relief]] sculpted on the railing of the stupa at [[Bharhut|Bhārhut]], as well as in [[Sanchi]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sowing the Seeds of the Lotus: A Journey to the Great Pilgrimage Sites of Buddhism, Part I" by John C. Huntington. ''Orientations'', November 1985 pg 61&lt;/ref&gt; From that period the [[Diamond throne]] remains, an almost intact slab of [[sandstone]] decorated with reliefs, which Ashoka had established at the foot of the [[Bodhi tree]].&lt;ref name="Huu Phuoc"&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA240 p.240]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ching"&gt;A Global History of Architecture, Francis D.

==Apsidal temples==
Another early free-standing temple in India, this time [[apsidal]] in shape, appears to be [[:Commons:category:Sanchi Temple 40|Temple 40]] at [[Sanchi]], which is also dated to the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref name="BA147"&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2010, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[apsidal]] temple built of timber on top of a high rectangular stone platform, 26.52x14x3.35 metres, with two flights of stairs to the east and the west. The temple was burnt down sometime in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abram |first1=David |last2=(Firm) |first2=Rough Guides |title=The Rough Guide to India |date=2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=9781843530893 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAMik_6LbwUC&amp;pg=PA393 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=John |title=Guide to Sanchi |date=1955 |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.gov.ignca.4365/4365#page/n153/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of apsidal structure was also adopted for most of the cave temple ([[Chaitya-griha]]s), as in the 3rd century BCE [[Barabar Caves]] and most caves thereafter, with side, and then frontal, entrances.&lt;ref name=BA233/&gt; A freestanding apsidal temple remains to this day, although in a modified form, in the [[Trivikrama Temple]] in [[Ter, Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name=BA&gt;{{cite book |last1=Le |first1=Huu Phuoc |title=Buddhist Architecture |date=2010 |publisher=Grafikol |isbn=9780984404308 |page=237 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA237 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barashnûm''', or '''Barashnûm nû shaba'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt;, is a [[Zoroastrian]] [[Ritual purification|purification]] [[ritual]] which lasts nine nights. Because the ritual lasts nine nights, it is known as '''Barashnûm nû shaba''' or "Barashnûm of the nine nights".&lt;ref name="vendidadp119"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 119&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

Barashnûm is a [[Zend]] word meaning "top of the head".&lt;ref name="vendidadp133"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 133&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole ritual is named "Barashnûm" because purification starts from the head of the person, which is the first part in his body which is purified.&lt;ref name="vendidadp133" /&gt;

== Purpose  ==

In pre-Islamic times, Barashnûm was used to purify men and women who had been defiled by contact with dead matter.&lt;ref name="vendidadp119" /&gt; But the [[Parsis]] of [[India]] used Barashnûm not only to purify people defiled by the dead but also to purify adolescents during the ''Nû zûdî '' or [[Navjote]] when they reach the age of fifteen.&lt;ref name="vendidadp119" /&gt; The ritual is undertaken in order to cleanse the subject of the impurities that are believed to have befallen him or her during the time he or she had spent as a foetus in the maternal womb and accompanies the tying of the [[kushti]] which marks the entry of a child into adulthood.&lt;ref name="vendidadp119" /&gt;

== The ritual ==

Fargard 9 of the [[Vendidad]] prescribes the requirements for the Barashnûm ritual. It prescribes that a series of six holes two feet deep if it was summer season and four feet deep if it was winter season be dug at a distance of three feet from each other and a series of three holes at a distance of nine feet from the other six.&lt;ref name="vendidadp121"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 121&lt;/ref&gt; The hole at the most extreme corner should be situated at a distance of at least thirty paces from the [[holy fire]] or consecrated [[barsom]] and three paces from "clean" Zoroastrians.&lt;ref name="vendidadp120"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 120&lt;/ref&gt; The holes should lie in a north-south direction and the first six are to be filled with ''[[gōmēz]]'' while the other three are to be filled with water.

Holes 4-6 should be separated from holes 7-9 through a ring of 3 [[furrows]] arranged concentrically which act as a protective barrier.&lt;ref name="vendidadp122"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 122&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, holes 4-9 were to be separated from holes 1-3 by a barrier of 3 furrows. This arrangement is called the Barashnûm-gâh and is to be separated from cleaner pastures by an outer enclosure comprising a series of three furrows.&lt;ref name="vendidadp122" /&gt;

The impure person should walk to each of the holes containing ''gomez'' in turn while reciting [[Yasna]] 49 of the Avesta while the Zoroastrian priest recites the same from outside the furrow surrounding the hole&lt;ref name="vendidadp122" /&gt; and sprinkles gomez upon the impure person on completion of each recitation.&lt;ref name="vendidadp123-5"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 123 - 125&lt;/ref&gt; The priest purifies the brows, the back of the skull, jaws,  ears,  the shoulders, arm-pits, chest, back, nipples, ribs, hips, genitals,  thighs, knees, legs, ankles, feet and toes of the subject by sprinkling a few drops of gomez upon them.&lt;ref name="vendidadp123-5" /&gt; Once the purification is complete, the subject recites the [[Ahunwar]], Kem-na-Mazda, Kem verethrem ja and other principal prayers of the Zoroastrians.&lt;ref name="vendidadp126"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The defiled person, then sits inside the outer enclosure but outside the ones enclosing holes 4-9 and rubs dust all over his body for it to dry.&lt;ref name="vendidadp127"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 127&lt;/ref&gt; He, then enters the inner furrows and steps in the holes 4-9 cleansing himself with the water contained in them.&lt;ref name="vendidadp127" /&gt; Once the ritual is complete, he may come out of the Barashnûm-gâh and is permitted to return to his house.&lt;ref name="vendidadp128"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 128&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is confined to a corner of the house called Armêsht-gah&lt;ref name="vendidadp133" /&gt; for nine nights.&lt;ref name="vendidadp128" /&gt; During this period, he is prohibited from contacting water, fire, earth, cow, trees and other Zoroastrians as he is considered to be impure and his contact is believed to defile the objects around him.&lt;ref name="vendidadp128" /&gt; Once every three days, he is enjoined to bathe himself and wash his clothes in ''gomez'' and water as a part of the purification ritual.&lt;ref name="vendidadp128" /&gt; On the completion of his third bath, he is considered to be "completely purified" and is permitted to lead a normal life.&lt;ref name="vendidadp128" /&gt;

== Fee for the cleanser ==
The fee to be paid to the priest who cleanses an impure person is also specified in the Fargard 9 of the Vendidad.&lt;ref name="vendidadp129"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 129&lt;/ref&gt; The Fargard decrees that a fellow defiled priest should be cleansed in return for blessings, the lord of  province for the payment of a camel, the lord of a town for the payment of a horse, the lord of a [[borough]] for the payment of a bull, and a householder in return for a three-year-old cow.&lt;ref name="vendidadp129" /&gt;

The Vendidad also specifies the punishment to be handed to a priest who has erred in the rituals.

{{quotation|The cleanser who has not performed the cleansing according to the rites, shall be taken to a desert place; there they shall nail him with four nails, they shall take off the skin from his body, and cut off his head. If he has performed Patet for his sin, he shall be holy (that is, he shall go to paradise); if he has not performed Patet, he shall stay in hell till the day of resurrection&lt;ref name="vendidadp27"&gt;[[#Darmesteter|Darmesteter]], Pg 27&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Vendidad|The Vendidad]], Fargard III}}

The '''Battle of the Little Bighorn''', known to the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and other [[Plains Indians]] as the '''Battle of the Greasy Grass'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Battle of the Greasy Grass|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/videos/category/history/the-battle-of-the-greasy-grass/?no-ist|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also commonly referred to as '''Custer's Last Stand''', was an armed engagement between combined forces of the Lakota, [[Northern Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]] tribes and the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]] of the [[United States Army]]. The battle, which resulted in the defeat of US forces, was the most significant action of the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]]. It took place on June 25–26, 1876, along the [[Little Bighorn River]] in the [[Crow Indian Reservation]] in southeastern [[Montana Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Kappler, Charles J (1904): ''Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties''. Vol. 2. Washington, pp. 1008-1011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fight was an overwhelming victory for the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho, who were led by several major war leaders, including [[Crazy Horse]] and [[Gall (Native American leader)|Chief Gall]], and had been inspired by the visions of [[Sitting Bull]] (''Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake''). The US 7th Cavalry, including the Custer Battalion, a force of 700 men led by Lt. Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]], suffered a major defeat. Five of the 7th Cavalry's 12 companies were annihilated and Custer was killed, as were two of his brothers, a nephew and a brother-in-law. The total US casualty count included 268 dead and 55 severely wounded (six died later from their wounds),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Douglas D |date=2013 |title=Archaeological Perspectives on the Battle of the Little Bighorn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSUA23jOi1sC&amp;pg=PA244 |location=Norman, OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=244 |isbn=0806132922 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117172702/https://books.google.com/books?id=iSUA23jOi1sC&amp;pg=PA244 |archivedate=January 17, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; including four [[Crow Nation|Crow]] Indian scouts and at least two Arikara Indian scouts.

Public response to the [[Great Sioux War of 1876|Great Sioux War]] varied in the immediate aftermath of the battle. Custer's widow soon worked to burnish her husband's memory, and during the following decades Custer and his troops came to be considered iconic, even heroic, figures in American history, a status that lasted into the 1960s. The battle, and Custer's actions in particular, have been studied extensively by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kershaw|first=Robert|title=Red Sabbath: The Battle of Little Bighorn|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|year=2005|pages=vi–5|isbn=978-0-7110-3325-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Battlefield and surrounding areas===
In 1805, fur trader Francois Antoine Larocque reported joining a [[Crow Nation|Crow]] camp in the Yellowstone area. On the way he noted that the Crow hunted buffalo on the "[[Little Bighorn River|Small Horn River]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Raymond W. and Thomas D. Thiessen (1987): ''Early Fur Trade on the Northern Plains. Canadian Traders among the Mandan and Hidatsa Indians, 1738-1818''. Norman and London, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; The US built [[Fort Raymond]] in 1807 for trade with the Crow. It was located near the confluence of the Yellowstone and the Bighorn River, about {{convert|40|miles|0}} north of the future battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E. (1995): ''Parading Through History. The Making of the Crow Nation in America, 1805-1935''. Cambridge, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The area is first noted in the 1851 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]].&lt;ref&gt;Kappler, Charles J. (1904): ''Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties.'' Vol. 2. Washington, p. 594-596.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 19th century, tensions increased between the Native inhabitants of the [[Great Plains]] of the US and encroaching settlers. This resulted in a series of conflicts known as the [[Sioux Wars]], which took place from 1854-90. While some of the indigenous people eventually agreed to relocate to ever-shrinking [[Indian Reservations|reservations]], a number of them resisted, at times fiercely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jetson.unl.edu/cocoon/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.044 |title=Sioux Wars |author= Carole A. Barrett |work= Encyclopedia of the Great Plains |accessdate= May 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130626183913/http://jetson.unl.edu/cocoon/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.044 |archivedate= June 26, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 1868, the valley of the Little Bighorn became a tract in the eastern part of the new Crow Indian Reservation in the center of the old Crow country.&lt;ref&gt;Kappler, Charles J. (1904): ''Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties.'' Vol. 2. Washington, p. 1008-1011.&lt;/ref&gt; The battlefield is known as "Greasy Grass" to the Lakota, Dakota, Cheyenne, and most other [[Plains Indians]]; however, in contemporary accounts by participants, it was referred to as the "Valley of Chieftains".&lt;ref&gt;Medicine Crow, Joseph (1992): ''From the Heart of the Crow Country. The Crow Indians' Own Stories''. New York. P. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1876 Sun Dance Gathering===
Among the [[Plains Indians|Plains Tribes]], the long-standing ceremonial tradition known as the [[Sun Dance]] was the most important religious event of the year. It is a time for prayer and personal sacrifice on behalf of the community, as well as making personal vows. Towards the end of spring in 1876, the Lakota and the Cheyenne held a Sun Dance that was also attended by a number of "Agency Indians" who had slipped away from their reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Paul Andrew, ''The Custer Reader'', 1992, University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt; During a Sun Dance around June 5, 1876, on [[Rosebud Creek]] in [[Montana]], [[Sitting Bull]], the spiritual leader of the [[Hunkpapa Lakota]], reportedly had a vision of "soldiers falling into his camp like grasshoppers from the sky."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/546854/Sitting-Bull "Sitting Bull"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327021927/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/546854/Sitting-Bull |date=March 27, 2010 }}, ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time US military officials were conducting a summer campaign to force the Lakota and the Cheyenne back to their [[Indian reservation|reservations]], using [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]] in a so-called "three-pronged approach".{{}}

===1876 U.S. military campaign===
[[File:Custermovements.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|1876 Army Campaign against the Sioux]]

Col. [[John Gibbon]]'s column of six companies (A, B, E, H, I, and K) of the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry]] and four companies (F, G, H, and L) of the [[2nd ACR|2nd Cavalry]] marched east from [[Fort Ellis]] in western Montana on March 30 to patrol the [[Yellowstone River]]. Brig. Gen. [[George Crook]]'s column of ten companies (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, L, and M) of the [[3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Cavalry]], five companies (A, B, D, E, and I) of the [[2nd U.S. Cavalry|2nd Cavalry]], two companies (D and F) of the [[4th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th Infantry]], and three companies (C, G, and H) of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry]] moved north from [[Fort Fetterman]] in the [[Wyoming Territory]] on May 29, marching toward the [[Powder River (Montana)|Powder River]] area. Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Terry]]'s column, including twelve companies (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, and M) of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s immediate command,&lt;ref name="John Gray"&gt;Gray, John S., Centennial Campaign The Sioux War of 1876, 1988, University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt; Companies C and G of the 17th U.S. Infantry, and the [[Gatling gun]] detachment of the 20th Infantry departed westward from [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[Dakota Territory]] on May 17. They were accompanied by teamsters and packers with 150 wagons and a large contingent of pack mules that reinforced Custer. Companies C, D, and I of the [[6th U.S. Infantry]] moved along the Yellowstone River from [[Fort Buford]] on the [[Missouri River]] to set up a supply depot and joined Terry on May 29 at the mouth of the Powder River. They were later joined there by the steamboat ''[[Far West (Steamboat)|Far West]]'', which was loaded with 200 tons of supplies from Fort Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://steamboats.com/museum/lossingmodels.html |title= Virtual Online Steamboat Museum at |publisher= Steamboats.com |date=1914-01-30 |accessdate= 2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111212015204/http://steamboats.com/museum/lossingmodels.html |archivedate= December 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====7th Cavalry organization====
The 7th Cavalry had been created just after the American Civil War. Many men were veterans of the war, including most of the leading officers. A significant portion of the regiment had previously served 4-1/2 years at [[Fort Riley]], Kansas, during which time it fought one major engagement and numerous skirmishes, experiencing casualties of 36 killed and 27 wounded. Six other troopers had died of drowning and 51 in [[cholera]] epidemics. In November 1868, while stationed in Kansas, the 7th Cavalry under Custer had successfully routed [[Black Kettle]]'s Southern Cheyenne camp on the [[Washita River]] in the [[Battle of Washita River]], an attack which was at the time labeled a "massacre of innocent Indians" by the [[Indian Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218456/pdf Washita Memories: Eyewitness Views of Custer's Attack on Black Kettle's Village (review)], ''[[Project Muse]]'', James T. Carroll, July 2007. Retrieved March 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Cav 35.svg|thumb|left|U.S. 7th Cavalry [[Guidon (United States)|guidon]]]]

By the time of the Little Bighorn, half of the 7th Cavalry's companies had just returned from 18 months of constabulary duty in the Deep South, having been recalled to [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] to reassemble the regiment for the campaign. About 20% of the troopers had been enlisted in the prior seven months (139 of an enlisted roll of 718), were only marginally trained and had no combat or frontier experience. A sizable number of these recruits were immigrants from Ireland, England and Germany, just as many of the veteran troopers had been before their enlistments. Archaeological evidence suggests that many of these troopers were malnourished and in poor physical condition, despite being the best-equipped and supplied regiment in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Of the 45 officers and 718 troopers then assigned to the 7th Cavalry (including a second lieutenant detached from the 20th Infantry and serving in Company L), 14 officers (including the regimental commander, Col. [[Samuel D. Sturgis]]) and 152 troopers did not accompany the 7th during the campaign. The ratio of troops detached for other duty (approximately 22%) was not unusual for an expedition of this size,&lt;ref name="dtch"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west/3035376.html |title= The 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment Fought in Battle of the Little Bighorn |publisher= HistoryNet.com |accessdate = January 18, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080121092726/http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west/3035376.html |archivedate= January 21, 2008 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the officer shortage was chronic, due to the Army's rigid seniority system: three of the regiment's 12 captains were permanently detached, and two had never served a day with the 7th since their appointment in July 1866.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Capt. Sheridan (Company L), the brother of Lt. Gen. [[Philip H. Sheridan]], served only seven months in 1866–67 before becoming permanent aide to his brother but remained on the rolls until 1882. Capt. Ilsley (Company E) was aide to Maj. Gen [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] from 1866 to 1879, when he finally joined his command. Capt. Tourtelotte (Company G) never joined the 7th. A fourth captain, Owen Hale (Company K), was the regiment's recruiting officer in St. Louis and rejoined his company immediately.&lt;/ref&gt; Three second lieutenant vacancies (in E, H, and L Companies) were also unfilled.

====Battle of the Rosebud====
The Army's coordination and planning began to go awry on June 17, 1876, when Crook's column retreated after the [[Battle of the Rosebud]], just {{convert|30|miles}} to the southeast of the eventual Little Bighorn battlefield. Surprised and according to some accounts astonished by the unusually large numbers of Native Americans, Crook held the field at the end of the battle but felt compelled by his losses to pull back, regroup, and wait for reinforcements. Unaware of Crook's battle, Gibbon and Terry proceeded, joining forces in early June near the mouth of [[Rosebud Creek]]. They reviewed Terry's plan calling for Custer's regiment to proceed south along the Rosebud while Terry and Gibbon's united forces would move in a westerly direction toward the [[Bighorn River|Bighorn]] and [[Little Bighorn River|Little Bighorn]] rivers. As this was the likely location of native encampments, all army elements had been instructed to converge there around June 26 or 27 in an attempt to engulf the Native Americans. On June 22, Terry ordered the 7th Cavalry, composed of 31 officers and 566 enlisted men under Custer, to begin a reconnaissance in force and pursuit along the Rosebud, with the prerogative to "depart" from orders if Custer saw "sufficient reason". Custer had been offered the use of [[Gatling gun]]s but declined, believing they would slow his command.&lt;ref name="John Gray"/&gt;

While the Terry–Gibbon column was marching toward the mouth of the Little Bighorn, on the evening of June 24, Custer's Indian scouts arrived at an overlook known as the Crow's Nest, {{convert|14|mi}} east of the Little Bighorn River. At sunrise on June 25, Custer's scouts reported they could see a massive pony herd and signs of the Native American village{{refn|group="note"|[[Plains Indians]] were semi-nomadic peoples and had no permanent settlements off the [[Indian reservation|reservation]]s (aka "Agencies).  A "village" was a collection of [[tipis]], housing a group of Indians under the leadership of a chief, including those of tribes other than the chief's. A village would be created wherever a group stopped by simply erecting the tipis and could last from a single night to several weeks. Young warriors without a tipi would generally create [[lean-tos]] or sleep in the open. When the chief decided that it was time to move on the villagers simply struck their tipis, tied the tipi poles to their horses so as to form a [[travois]] for their goods and children, and followed the chief.  The term "village", therefore, refers to the group while moving OR encamped.&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, Nathaniel, ''The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn'', Viking, 2010, pgs 102, 106, eISBN: 978-1-101-19011-1&lt;/ref&gt;}} roughly {{convert|15|mi|km}} in the distance. After a night's march, the tired officer who was sent with the scouts could see neither, and when Custer joined them, he was also unable to make the sighting. Custer's scouts also spotted the regimental cooking fires that could be seen from {{cvt|10|mi|km}} away, disclosing the regiment's position.{{Citation needed|date = January 2013}}

Custer contemplated a surprise attack against the encampment the following morning of June 26, but he then received a report informing him several hostiles had discovered the trail left by his troops.&lt;ref&gt;Andrist, Ralph K., "The Long Death: The Last Days of the Plains Indian". ''Editorial Galaxia''. 2001, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming his presence had been exposed, Custer decided to attack the village without further delay. On the morning of June 25, Custer divided his 12 companies into three battalions in anticipation of the forthcoming engagement. Three companies were placed under the command of Major [[Marcus Reno]] (A, G, and M) and three were placed under the command of Captain [[Frederick Benteen]] (H, D, and K). Five companies (C, E, F, I, and L) remained under Custer's immediate command. The 12th, Company B under Captain [[Thomas Mower McDougall|Thomas McDougall]], had been assigned to escort the slower pack train carrying provisions and additional ammunition.&lt;ref name="John Gray"/&gt;

Unknown to Custer, the group of Native Americans seen on his trail was actually leaving the encampment and did not alert the rest of the village. Custer's scouts warned him about the size of the village, with [[Mitch Bouyer]] reportedly saying, "General, I have been with these Indians for 30 years, and this is the largest village I have ever heard of."{{refn|group="note"|Villages were usually arrayed in U-shaped semi-circles open to the east; in multi-tribal villages, each tribe would erect their tipis in this manner separately from the other tribes but close to the other tribes. Sitting Bull's village was multi-tribal, consisted of "a thousand tipis [that] were assembled in six horseshoe-shaped semicircles", had a population of approx. 8000 people, and stretched over two miles end-to-end.&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, Nathaniel, ''The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn'', Viking, 2010, Ch 3, eISBN: 978-1-101-19011-1 &lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Macnab, David B., ''A Day to Remember: Introducing the Drama, Irony, and Controversies of the Battle of the Little Bighorn'', iUniverse, 2003, p. 45, based on Abstract of the Official Record of Proceedings of the Reno Court of Inquiry, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Custer's overriding concern was that the Native American group would break up and scatter.

==Prelude==
===Military assumptions prior to the battle===

====Number of Indian warriors====
[[File:Little Big Horn.jpg |thumb|left|A Cheyenne artist's depiction of the Battle of the Little Bighorn]]

As the Army moved into the field on its expedition, it was operating with incorrect assumptions as to the number of Indians it would encounter. These assumptions were based on inaccurate information provided by the Indian Agents that no more than 800 hostiles were in the area. The Indian Agents based this estimate on the number of Lakota that Sitting Bull and other leaders had reportedly led off the reservation in protest of U.S. government policies. It was in fact a correct estimate until several weeks before the battle, when the "reservation Indians" joined Sitting Bull's ranks for the summer buffalo hunt. The agents did not take into account the many thousands of these "reservation Indians" who had unofficially left the reservation to join their "uncooperative non-reservation cousins led by Sitting Bull". Thus, Custer unknowingly faced thousands of Indians, including the 800 non-reservation "hostiles". All Army plans were based on the incorrect numbers. Although Custer was severely criticized after the battle for not having accepted reinforcements and for dividing his forces, it must be understood that he had accepted the same official government estimates of hostiles in the area which Terry and Gibbon had also accepted. Historian James Donovan states that when Custer asked interpreter Fred Gerard for his opinion on the size of the opposition, he estimated the force at between 1,500 to 2,500 warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, loc 3576&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Custer was more concerned with preventing the escape of the Lakota and Cheyenne than with fighting them. From his own observation, as reported by his [[bugle]]r John Martin (Martini),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Charles Windolph, Frazier Hunt, Robert Hunt, Neil Mangum, ''I Fought with Custer: The Story of Sergeant Windolph, Last Survivor of the Battle of the Little Big Horn: with Explanatory Material and Contemporary Sidelights on the Custer Fight'', University of Nebraska Press, 1987, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Custer assumed the warriors had been sleeping in on the morning of the battle, to which virtually every native account attested later, giving Custer a false estimate of what he was up against. When he and his scouts first looked down on the village from the Crow's Nest across the Little Bighorn River, they could only see the herd of ponies. Looking from a hill {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} away after parting with Reno's command, Custer could observe only women preparing for the day, and young boys taking thousands of horses out to graze south of the village. Custer's [[Crow scouts]] told him it was the largest native village they had ever seen. When the scouts began changing back into their native dress right before the battle, Custer released them from his command. While the village was enormous in size, Custer thought there were far fewer warriors to defend the village. He assumed most of the warriors were still asleep in their [[tipi]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Finally, Custer may have assumed that in the event of his encountering Native Americans, that his subordinate Benteen with the pack train would quickly come to his aid. Rifle volleys were a standard way of telling supporting units to come to another unit's aid. In a subsequent official 1879 Army investigation requested by Major Reno, the Reno Board of Inquiry (RCOI), Benteen and Reno's men testified that they heard distinct rifle volleys as late as 4:30&amp;nbsp;pm during the battle.&lt;ref name="court of inquiry"&gt;{{cite web |first=Marcus A. |last=Reno |title=The official record of a court of inquiry convened at Chicago, Illinois, January 13, 1879, by the President of the United States upon the request of Major Marcus A.

Custer had initially wanted to take a day and scout the village before attacking; however, when men went back after supplies dropped by the pack train, they discovered they were being back-trailed by Indians. Reports from his scouts also revealed fresh pony tracks from ridges overlooking his formation. It became apparent that the warriors in the village were either aware of or would soon be aware of his approach.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, loc 3684&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing that the village would break up into small bands that he would have to chase, Custer began to prepare for an immediate attack.&lt;ref name="Donovan, loc 3699"&gt;Donovan, loc 3699&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role of Indian noncombatants in Custer's strategy====
Custer's field strategy was designed to engage noncombatants at the encampments on the Little Bighorn so as to capture women, children, and the elderly or disabled&lt;ref name="Fox1993"&gt;Fox, Richard A. (1993) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dpaWb9WmbPUC Archaeology, History and Custer's Last Battle] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160624003916/https://books.google.com/books?id=dpaWb9WmbPUC |date= June 24, 2016 }}''. University of Oklahoma Press, {{ISBN|0-8061-2998-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|297}} to serve as hostages to convince the warriors to surrender and comply with federal orders to relocate. Custer's battalions were poised to "ride into the camp and secure noncombatant hostages"&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, James. ''A Terrible Glory''. Little, Brown and Company (2008). P. 253&lt;/ref&gt; and "forc[e] the warriors to surrender".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Charles M., ''A Good Year to Die''. Random House Publishing (1995). p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Evan S. Connell observed that if Custer could occupy the village before widespread resistance developed, the Sioux and Cheyenne warriors "would be obliged to surrender, because if they started to fight, they would be shooting their own families."&lt;ref name="Fox1993" /&gt;{{rp|312}}&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Evan S. ''Son of the Morning Star''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux (1997). p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Custer's book ''My Life on the Plains'', published just two years before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, he asserted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Indians contemplating a battle, either offensive or defensive, are always anxious to have their women and children removed from all danger…For this reason I decided to locate our [military] camp as close as convenient to [Chief Black Kettle's Cheyenne] village, knowing that the close proximity of their women and children, and their necessary exposure in case of conflict, would operate as a powerful argument in favor of peace, when the question of peace or war came to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Custer |first= George Armstrong |title=My Life on the Plains: Or, Personal Experiences with Indians |location=New York |publisher= Sheldon and Company |year=1874 |p=220 |url= http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ACP4940.0001.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On Custer's decision to advance up the bluffs and descend on the village from the east, Lt. [[Edward Settle Godfrey|Edward Godfrey]] of Company K surmised:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Custer] expected to find the squaws and children fleeing to the bluffs on the north, for in no other way do I account for his wide detour. He must have counted upon Reno's success, and fully expected the "scatteration" of the non-combatants with the pony herds. The probable attack upon the families and capture of the herds were in that event counted upon to strike consternation in the hearts of the warriors, and were elements for success upon which General Custer fully counted.&lt;ref name="godfrey" /&gt;{{rp|379}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Sioux and Cheyenne fighters were acutely aware of the danger posed by the military engagement of noncombatants and that "even a semblance of an attack on the women and children" would draw the warriors back to the village, according to historian John S. Gray.&lt;ref name="Gray, John S 1991 p. 360"&gt;Gray, John S. ''Custer's Last Campaign''. University of Nebraska Press (1991) p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was their concern that a "feint" by Capt. Yates' E and F Companies at the mouth of Medicine Tail Coulee (Minneconjou [[Ford (crossing)|Ford]]) caused hundreds of warriors to disengage from the Reno valley fight and return to deal with the threat to the village.&lt;ref name="Gray, John S 1991 p. 360"/&gt;

Some authors and historians, based on archaeological evidence and reviews of native testimony, speculate that Custer attempted to cross the river at a point they refer to as Ford D. According to Richard A. Fox, James Donovan, and others, Custer proceeded with a wing of his battalion (Yates' Troops E and F) north and opposite the Cheyenne circle at that crossing,&lt;ref name="Fox1993" /&gt;{{rp|176–77}} which provided "access to the [women and children] fugitives."&lt;ref name="Fox1993" /&gt;{{rp|306}} Yates's force "posed an immediate threat to fugitive Indian families…" gathering at the north end of the huge encampment;&lt;ref name="Fox1993" /&gt;{{rp|299}} he then persisted in his efforts to "seize women and children" even as hundreds of warriors were massing around Keogh's wing on the bluffs.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, James, A'' Terrible Glory'', Little, Brown and Company (2008). p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Yates' wing, descending to the Little Bighorn River at Ford D, encountered "light resistance",&lt;ref name="Fox1993" /&gt;{{rp|297}} undetected by the Indian forces ascending the bluffs east of the village.&lt;ref name="Fox1993" /&gt;{{rp|298}} Custer was almost within "striking distance of the refugees" before being repulsed by Indian defenders and forced back to Custer Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Kingsley M. ''Crazy Horse – A Lakota Life''. University of Oklahoma Press (2006). p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lone Teepee===
The ''Lone Teepee'' (or ''Tipi'') was a landmark along the 7th Cavalry's march. It was where the Indian encampment had been a week earlier, during the [[Battle of the Rosebud]] on June 17, 1876. The Indians had left a single [[teepee]] standing (some reports mention a second that had been partially dismantled), and in it was the body of a [[Sans Arc]] warrior, Old She-Bear, who had been wounded in the battle. He had died a couple of days after the Rosebud battle, and it was the custom of the Indians to move camp when a warrior died and leave the body with its possessions. The Lone Teepee was an important location during the Battle of the Little Bighorn for several reasons, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pie.midco.net/treasuredude/Peter_Thompson_Narrative.pdf |title= Custer's Last Fight |last=Thompson |first=Peter |publisher= Belle Fource Bee |date=1914 |access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-vetscor/1643759/posts |title= George Armstrong Custer and THE BATTLE OF THE LITTLE BIG HORN (A South African View) |last=Murchison |first=R. |work= S.A.

===Reno's attack===
[[File:Custer.gif |thumb|Movements of the 7th Cavalry&lt;br /&gt;A: Custer B: Reno C: Benteen D: Yates E: Weir]]
[[File:Www-cgsc.army.mil MAP20 Renos Attack.GIF |thumb|Movement of Major Reno's three companies]]

The first group to attack was Major Reno's second detachment (Companies A, G and M) after receiving orders from Custer written out by Lt. [[William W. Cooke]], as Custer's Crow scouts reported Sioux tribe members were alerting the village. Ordered to charge, Reno began that phase of the battle. The orders, made without accurate knowledge of the village's size, location, or the warriors' propensity to stand and fight, had been to pursue the Native Americans and "bring them to battle." Reno's force crossed the Little Bighorn at the mouth of what is today Reno Creek around 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm on June 25. They immediately realized that the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne were present "in force and not running away."

Reno advanced rapidly across the open field towards the northwest, his movements masked by the thick bramble of trees that ran along the southern banks of the Little Bighorn River. The same trees on his front right shielded his movements across the wide field over which his men rapidly rode, first with two approximately forty-man companies abreast and eventually with all three charging abreast. The trees also obscured Reno's view of the Native American village until his force had passed that bend on his right front and was suddenly within arrow-shot of the village. The tepees in that area were occupied by the Hunkpapa Sioux. Neither Custer nor Reno had much idea of the length, depth and size of the encampment they were attacking, as the village was hidden by the trees.{{citation needed |date=January 2013}} When Reno came into the open in front of the south end of the village, he sent his Arikara/Ree and Crow Indian scouts forward on his exposed left flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Running Dog |url= http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |title=Confirmed by one of his surviving Arikara scouts, Little Sioux |publisher=Astonisher.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120118221826/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |archivedate= January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing the full extent of the village's width, Reno quickly suspected what he would later call "a trap" and stopped a few hundred yards short of the encampment.

He ordered his troopers to dismount and deploy in a [[skirmish line]], according to standard army doctrine. In this formation, every fourth trooper held the horses for the troopers in firing position, with five to ten yards separating each trooper, officers to their rear and troopers with horses behind the officers. This formation reduced Reno's firepower by 25 percent. As Reno's men fired into the village and killed, by some accounts, several wives and children of the Sioux leader, [[Gall (Native American leader)|Chief Gall]] (in Lakota, ''Phizí''), the mounted warriors began streaming out to meet the attack. With Reno's men anchored on their right by the impassable tree line and bend in the river, the Indians rode hard against the exposed left end of Reno's line. After about 20 minutes of long-distance firing, Reno had taken only one casualty, but the odds against him had risen (Reno estimated five to one), and Custer had not reinforced him. Trooper Billy Jackson reported that by then, the Indians had begun massing in the open area shielded by a small hill to the left of Reno's line and to the right of the Indian village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Running Dog |url= http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |title=Little Sioux's Story of the Battle of the Little Bighorn |publisher= Astonisher.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120118221826/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this position the Indians mounted an attack of more than 500 warriors against the left and rear of Reno's line,&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Thomas. ''Scalp Dance: Indian Warfare on the High Plains, 1865–1879.'' Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1997. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; turning Reno's exposed left flank. They forced a hasty withdrawal into the timber along the bend in the river.&lt;ref&gt;Perrett, Bryan. ''Last Stand: Famous Battles Against the Odds.'' London: Arms &amp; Armour, 1993; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the Indians pinned Reno and his men down and set fire to the brush to try to drive the soldiers out of their position.

After giving orders to mount, dismount and mount again, Reno told his men, "All those who wish to make their escape follow me," and led a disorderly rout across the river toward the bluffs on the other side. The retreat was immediately disrupted by Cheyenne attacks at close quarters. Later, Reno reported that three officers and 29 troopers had been killed during the retreat and subsequent fording of the river. Another officer and 13–18 men were missing. Most of these missing men were left behind in the timber, although many eventually rejoined the detachment. Reno's hasty retreat may have been precipitated by the death of Reno's Arikara scout [[Bloody Knife]], who had been shot in the head as he sat on his horse next to Reno, his blood and brains splattering the side of Reno's face.

====Reno and Benteen on Reno Hill====
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
[[File:Bloody Knife, Custer's scout, on Yellowstone Expedition, 1873 - NARA - 524373.jpg|thumb|[[Bloody Knife]]]]

Atop the bluffs, known today as Reno Hill, Reno's shaken troops were joined by Captain Benteen's column (Companies D, H and K), arriving from the south. This force had been on a lateral scouting mission when it had been summoned by Custer's messenger, Italian bugler John Martin (Giovanni Martini) with the handwritten message "Benteen. Come on, Big Village, Be quick, Bring packs. P.S. Bring Packs.".&lt;ref name="court of inquiry"/&gt; Benteen's coincidental arrival on the bluffs was just in time to save Reno's men from possible annihilation. Their detachments were reinforced by McDougall's Company B and the pack train. The 14 officers and 340 troopers on the bluffs organized an all-around defense and dug rifle pits using whatever implements they had among them, including knives. This practice had become standard during the last year of the American Civil War, with both Union and Confederate troops utilizing knives, eating utensils, mess plates and pans to dig effective battlefield fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, The American Civil War.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Www-cgsc.army.mil MAP21 Defense of Reno-Benteen Hill.GIF |thumb|left|Reno–Benteen defensive position]]

Despite hearing heavy gunfire from the north, including distinct volleys at 4:20&amp;nbsp;pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer's position. Benteen's apparent reluctance to reach Custer prompted later criticism that he had failed to follow orders. Around 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm, Capt. [[Thomas Weir (American soldier)|Thomas Weir]] and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer.&lt;ref name="court of inquiry"/&gt; They advanced a mile, to what is today Weir Ridge or Weir Point, and could see in the distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25&amp;nbsp;pm, Custer's battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the "Last Stand Hill" at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill. The destruction of Keogh's battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by [[Crazy Horse]], [[White Bull (Native American)|White Bull]], Hump, [[Gall (Native American leader)|Chief Gall]] and others.&lt;ref name="michno1997"&gt;Michno, Gregory F., ''Lakota Noon, the Indian narrative of Custer's defeat'', Mountain Press, 1997, p 284-285. {{ISBN|0-87842-349-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|240}} Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the time element remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing native attacks around Weir Ridge forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position.

Benteen was hit in the heel of his boot by an Indian bullet. At one point, he personally led a counterattack to push back Indians who had continued to crawl through the grass closer to the soldier's positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Robert Patterson |url= http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wfbentee.htm |title= Frederick William Benteen, Brigadier General, United States Army |publisher= Arlingtoncemetery.net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120112231108/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wfbentee.htm |archivedate= January 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Custer's fight===
[[File:Custer's last charge.jpg|thumb|Fanciful 1876 illustration of Lieutenant Colonel Custer on horseback and his U.S. Army troops making their last charge at the Battle of the Little Bighorn]]

Yellow area 517 is 1851 Crow treaty land ceded to the U.S. It was in the red area 635 that the battle stood. The Lakotas were here without consent from the local Crow tribe, which had treaty on the area. Already in 1873, Crow chief Blackfoot had called for U.S. military actions against the Indian intrudes.&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E. (1995): ''Parading Through History. The making of the Crow Nation in America, 1805-1935''. Cambridge, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1873. Washington 1874, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The precise details of Custer's fight are largely conjectural since none of his men (the five companies under his immediate command) survived the battle. Later accounts from surviving Indians are conflicting and unclear.

While the gunfire heard on the bluffs by Reno and Benteen's men was probably from Custer's fight, the soldiers on Reno Hill were unaware of what had happened to Custer until General Terry's arrival on June 27. They were reportedly stunned by the news. When the army examined the Custer battle site, soldiers could not determine fully what had transpired. Custer's force of roughly 210 men had been engaged by the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} to the north of Reno and Benteen's defensive position. Evidence of organized resistance included apparent breastworks made of dead horses on Custer Hill.&lt;ref name="michno1997" /&gt; By the time troops came to recover the bodies, the Lakota and Cheyenne had already removed most of their dead from the field. The troops found most of Custer's dead stripped of their clothing, ritually mutilated, and in an advanced state of decomposition, making identification of many impossible.&lt;ref name="Brininstool, 60–62"&gt;Brininstool, 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers identified the 7th Cavalry's dead as best as possible and hastily buried them where they fell.

Custer was found with shots to the left chest and left temple. Either wound would have been fatal, though he appeared to have bled from only the chest wound, meaning his head wound may have been delivered postmortem. He also suffered a wound to the arm. Some Lakota oral histories assert that Custer committed suicide to avoid capture and subsequent torture, though this is usually discounted since the wounds were inconsistent with his known right-handedness.

Several days after the battle, [[Curly (scout)|Curley]], Custer's Crow scout who had left Custer near Medicine Tail Coulee (a drainage which led to the river), recounted the battle, reporting that Custer had attacked the village after attempting to cross the river.

Having isolated Reno's force and driven them away from the encampment, the bulk of the native warriors were free to pursue Custer. The route taken by Custer to his "Last Stand" remains a subject of debate. One possibility is that after ordering Reno to charge, Custer continued down Reno Creek to within about a half-mile (800 m) of the Little Bighorn, but then turned north and climbed up the bluffs, reaching the same spot to which Reno would soon retreat. From this point on the other side of the river, he could see Reno charging the village. Riding north along the bluffs, Custer could have descended into Medicine Tail Coulee. Some historians believe that part of Custer's force descended the coulee, going west to the river and attempting unsuccessfully to cross into the village. According to some accounts, a small contingent of Indian sharpshooters effectively opposed this crossing.

[[File:Battle of the Little Big Horn.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Colonel Custer and his U.S. Army troops are defeated in battle with Native American Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne on the Little Bighorn Battlefield, June 25, 1876 at Little Bighorn River, Montana]]

White Cow Bull claimed to have shot a leader wearing a buckskin jacket off his horse in the river. While no other Indian account supports this claim, if White Bull did shoot a buckskin-clad leader off his horse, some historians have argued that Custer may have been seriously wounded by him. Some Indian accounts claim that besides wounding one of the leaders of this advance, a soldier carrying a company [[Guidon (United States)|guidon]] was also hit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/white_cow_bull_little_big_horn.html "White Cow Bull's Story of the Battle of the Little Bighorn #1"] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511210009/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/white_cow_bull_little_big_horn.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Troopers had to dismount to help the wounded men back onto their horses.&lt;ref name="michno1997" /&gt;{{rp|117–19}} The fact that either of the non-mutilation wounds to Custer's body (a bullet wound below the heart and a shot to the left temple) would have been instantly fatal casts doubt on his being wounded and remounted.&lt;ref&gt;Wert, 1996, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of an attempted fording of the river at Medicine Tail Coulee might explain Custer's purpose for Reno's attack, that is, a coordinated "hammer-and-anvil" maneuver, with Reno's holding the Indians at bay at the southern end of the camp, while Custer drove them against Reno's line from the north. Other historians have noted that if Custer did attempt to cross the river near Medicine Tail Coulee, he may have believed it was the north end of the Indian camp, although it was only the middle. Some Indian accounts, however, place the Northern Cheyenne encampment and the north end of the overall village to the left (and south) of the opposite side of the crossing.&lt;ref name="michno1997" /&gt;{{rp|10–20}} The precise location of the north end of the village remains in dispute, however.

[[File:Custer's route over Little Bighorn battlefield.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Custer's route over battlefield, as theorized by [[Edward S. Curtis|Curtis]]. (Credit: [[Northwestern University Library]] [http://digital.library.northwestern.edu/curtis/ ''Edward S. Curtis's The North American Indian,'' 2003]). ]]

[[Edward S. Curtis|Edward Curtis]], the famed ethnologist and photographer of the Native American Indians, made a detailed personal study of the battle, interviewing many of those who had fought or taken part in it. First he went over the ground covered by the troops with the three Crow scouts [[White Man Runs Him]], [[Goes Ahead]], and [[Hairy Moccasin]], and then again with [[Two Moons]] and a party of Cheyenne warriors. He also visited the Lakota country and interviewed [[Red Hawk (chief)|Red Hawk]], "whose recollection of the fight seemed to be particularly clear".&lt;ref name="curtis"/&gt;{{rp|44}} Then, he went over the battlefield once more with the three Crow scouts, but also accompanied by General [[Charles Woodruff (general)|Charles Woodruff]] "as I particularly desired that the testimony of these men might be considered by an experienced army officer". Finally, Curtis visited the country of the [[Arikara people|Arikara]] and interviewed the scouts of that tribe who had been with Custer's command.&lt;ref name="curtis" /&gt;{{rp|44}} Based on all the information he gathered, Curtis concluded that Custer had indeed ridden down the Medicine Tail Coulee and then towards the river where he probably planned to ford it. However, "the Indians had now discovered him and were gathered closely on the opposite side".&lt;ref name="curtis" /&gt;{{rp|48}} They were soon joined by a large force of Sioux who (no longer engaging Reno) rushed down the valley. This was the beginning of their attack on Custer who was forced to turn and head for the hill where he would make his famous "last stand". Thus, wrote Curtis, "Custer made no attack, the whole movement being a retreat".&lt;ref name="curtis" /&gt;{{rp|49}}

====Other views of Custer's actions at Minneconjou Ford====
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
Other historians claim that Custer never approached the river, but rather continued north across the coulee and up the other side, where he gradually came under attack. According to this theory, by the time Custer realized he was badly outnumbered, it was too late to break back to the south where Reno and Benteen could have provided assistance. Two men from the 7th Cavalry, the young Crow scout ''Ashishishe'' (known in English as Curley) and the trooper [[Peter Thompson (soldier)|Peter Thompson]], claimed to have seen Custer engage the Indians. The accuracy of their recollections remains controversial; accounts by battle participants and assessments by historians almost universally discredit Thompson's claim.

[[File:Custer's last stand painting .jpg|thumb|"Custer's Last Stand." Lieutenant Colonel Custer standing center, wearing buckskin, with few of his soldiers of the 7th Cavalry still standing.]]

Archaeological evidence and reassessment of Indian testimony has led to a new interpretation of the battle. In the 1920s, battlefield investigators discovered hundreds of .45–55 shell cases along the ridge line known today as Nye-Cartwright Ridge, between South Medicine Tail Coulee and the next drainage at North Medicine Tail (also known as Deep Coulee). Some historians believe Custer divided his detachment into two (and possibly three) battalions, retaining personal command of one while presumably delegating Captain George W. Yates to command the second.

Evidence from the 1920s supports the theory that at least one of the companies made a feint attack southeast from Nye-Cartwright Ridge straight down the center of the "V" formed by the intersection at the crossing of Medicine Tail Coulee on the right and Calhoun Coulee on the left. The intent may have been to relieve pressure on Reno's detachment (according to the Crow scout Curley, possibly viewed by both Mitch Bouyer and Custer) by withdrawing the skirmish line into the timber on the edge of the Little Bighorn River. Had the U.S. troops come straight down Medicine Tail Coulee, their approach to the Minneconjou Crossing and the northern area of the village would have been masked by the high ridges running on the northwest side of the Little Bighorn River.

That they might have come southeast, from the center of Nye-Cartwright Ridge, seems to be supported by Northern Cheyenne accounts of seeing the approach of the distinctly white-colored horses of Company E, known as the Grey Horse Company. Its approach was seen by Indians at that end of the village. Behind them, a second company, further up on the heights, would have provided long-range cover fire. Warriors could have been drawn to the feint attack, forcing the battalion back towards the heights, up the north fork drainage, away from the troops providing cover fire above. The covering company would have moved towards a reunion, delivering heavy [[volley fire]] and leaving the trail of expended cartridges discovered 50 years later.

===Last stand===
[[File:Edgar Samuel Paxson - Custer's Last Stand.jpg|thumb|''Custer's Last Stand'' by [[Edgar Samuel Paxson]]]]
In the end, the hilltop to which Custer had moved was probably too small to accommodate all of the survivors and wounded. Fire from the southeast made it impossible for Custer's men to secure a defensive position all around Last Stand Hill where the soldiers put up their most dogged defense. According to Lakota accounts, far more of their casualties occurred in the attack on Last Stand Hill than anywhere else. The extent of the soldiers' resistance indicated they had few doubts about their prospects for survival. According to Cheyenne and Sioux testimony, the command structure rapidly broke down, although smaller "last stands" were apparently made by several groups. Custer's remaining companies (E, F, and half of C) were soon killed.

By almost all accounts, the Lakota annihilated Custer's force within an hour of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David Humphreys, ''Custer's Fall'', Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1985, pg 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Benteen letter to Capt. R.E. Thompson, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''Gall's Narrative'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Humphreys Miller]], who between 1935 and 1955 interviewed the last Lakota survivors of the battle, wrote that the Custer fight lasted less than one-half hour.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David Humphreys, ''Custer's Fall, the Indian Side of the Story''. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1985 (reprint of 1957 edition), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Other native accounts said the fighting lasted only "as long as it takes a hungry man to eat a meal." The Lakota asserted that Crazy Horse personally led one of the large groups of warriors who overwhelmed the cavalrymen in a surprise charge from the northeast, causing a breakdown in the command structure and panic among the troops. Many of these men threw down their weapons while Cheyenne and Sioux warriors rode them down, "[[counting coup]]" with lances, coup sticks, and [[quirt]]s. Some Native accounts recalled this segment of the fight as a "buffalo run."&lt;ref&gt;Graham, pp. 45–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[Frederick William Benteen|Frederick Benteen]], battalion leader of Companies D, H and K, recalled his observations on the Custer battlefield on June 27, 1876

{{quote|I went over the battlefield carefully with a view to determine how the battle was fought. I arrived at the conclusion I [hold] now – that it was a rout, a panic, until the last man was killed…

There was no line formed on the battlefield. You can take a handful of corn and scatter [the kernels] over the floor, and make just such lines. There were none...The only approach to a line was where 5 or 6 [dead] horses found at equal distances, like skirmishers [part of Lt. Calhoun's Company L]. That was the only approach to a line on the field. There were more than 20 [troopers] killed [in one group]; there were [more often] four or five at one place, all within a space of 20 to 30 yards [of each other]…I counted 70 dead [cavalry] horses and 2 Indian ponies.

I think, in all probability, that the men turned their horses loose without any orders to do so. Many orders might have been given, but few obeyed. I think that they were panic stricken; it was a rout, as I said before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|year=1998|title=Benteen testimony at Reno Court of Inquiry, January 13 – February 11, 1879|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Reno_court_inquiry.html|work=The Library of Congress|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007141134/http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Reno_court_inquiry.html|archivedate=October 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A Brulé Sioux warrior stated: "In fact, Hollow Horn Bear believed that the troops were in good order at the start of the fight, and kept their organization even while moving from point to point."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Michno, Lakota Noon, Mountain Press, 1997, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Red Horse, an Oglala Sioux warrior, commented: "Here [Last Stand Hill] the soldiers made a desperate fight."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Michno, Lakota Noon, Mountain Press, 1997, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; One Hunkpapa Sioux warrior, Moving Robe, noted that "It was a hotly contested battle",&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Michno, Lakota Noon, Mountain Press, 1997, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; while another, Iron Hawk, stated: "The Indians pressed and crowded right in around Custer Hill. But the soldiers weren't ready to die. We stood there a long time."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Michno, Lakota Noon, Mountain Press, 1997, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter from February 21, 1910, Private William Taylor, Company M, 7th Cavalry, wrote: "Reno proved incompetent and Benteen showed his indifference – I will not use the uglier words that have often been in my mind. Both failed Custer and he had to fight it out alone."&lt;ref&gt;GSklenar, Larry, To Hell with Honor, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

====Custer's final resistance====
Recent archaeological work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Allen|title=Archaeology, History, and Custer's Last Battle: The Little Big Horn Reexamined|date=1993|publisher=Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press pp. 255–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the battlefield indicates that officers on Custer Hill restored some tactical control. E Company rushed off Custer Hill toward the Little Bighorn River but failed to reach it, which resulted in the total destruction of that company. This left about 50-60 men, mostly from F Company and the staff, on Last Stand Hill. The remainder of the battle took on the nature of a running fight. Modern archaeology and historical Indian accounts indicate that Custer's force may have been divided into three groups, with the Indians' attempting to prevent them from effectively reuniting. Indian accounts describe warriors (including women) running up from the village to wave blankets in order to scare off the soldiers' horses. One 7th Cavalry trooper claimed finding a number of stone ''mallets'' consisting of a round cobble weighing 8–10 pounds (about 4&amp;nbsp;kg) with a rawhide handle, which he believed had been used by the Indian women to finish off the wounded.&lt;ref&gt;They Died With Custer: Soldiers' Bones from the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Douglas D. Scott, P. Willey, Melissa A. Connor, p. 314, University of Oklahoma Press, 09/09/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting dismounted, the soldiers' skirmish lines were overwhelmed. Army doctrine would have called for one man in four to be a horseholder behind the skirmish lines and, in extreme cases, one man in eight. Later, the troops would have bunched together in defensive positions and are alleged to have shot their remaining horses as cover. As individual troopers were wounded or killed, initial defensive positions would have been abandoned as untenable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Gray, John, C. "Custer's Last Campaign"&lt;/ref&gt;

Under threat of attack, the first U.S. soldiers on the battlefield three days later hurriedly buried the troopers in shallow graves, more or less where they had fallen. A couple of years after the battle, markers were placed where men were believed to have fallen, so the placement of troops has been roughly construed. The troops evidently died in several groups, including on Custer Hill, around Captain [[Myles Keogh]], and strung out towards the Little Bighorn River.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Last break-out attempt====
[[File:2008 0909Battlefield0026.JPG|thumb|[[Mitch Bouyer]] marker on Deep Ravine trail. Deep Ravine is to the right of this picture (south/southwest) and about 65 yards distant.]]

Modern documentaries suggest that there may not have been a "Last Stand" as traditionally portrayed in popular culture. Instead, archaeologists suggest that, in the end, Custer's troops were not surrounded but rather overwhelmed by a single charge. This scenario corresponds to several Indian accounts stating Crazy Horse's charge swarmed the resistance, with the surviving soldiers fleeing in panic.&lt;ref name="michno1997" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Testimony of Yellow Nose.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these troopers may have ended up in a deep ravine 300–400 yards away from what is known today as Custer Hill. At least 28 bodies (the most common number associated with burial witness testimony), including that of scout [[Mitch Bouyer]], were discovered in or near that gulch, their deaths possibly the battle's final actions. Although the marker for Mitch Bouyer has been accounted for as being accurate through archaeological and forensic testing,&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Perspectives on the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Scott/Fox/Connor/Harmon, University of Oklahoma Press, 1989 p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; it is some 65 yards away from Deep Ravine. Other archaeological explorations done in Deep Ravine&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Perspectives on the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Scott/Fox/Connor/Harmon, University of Oklahoma Press, 1989, pp. 39–48.&lt;/ref&gt; have found no human remains associated with the battle. According to Indian accounts, about 40 men made a desperate stand around Custer on Custer Hill, delivering [[volley fire]].&lt;ref name="michno1997" /&gt; The great majority of the Indian casualties were probably suffered during this closing segment of the battle, as the soldiers and Indians on Calhoun Ridge were more widely separated and traded fire at greater distances for most of their portion of the battle than did the soldiers and Indians on Custer Hill.&lt;ref name="michno1997" /&gt;{{rp|282}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Crow Scouts 1913.jpg|thumb|Former U.S. Army [[Crow Scouts]] visiting the Little Bighorn battlefield, circa 1913]]

After the Custer force was soundly defeated, the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne regrouped to attack Reno and Benteen. The fight continued until dark (approximately 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm) and for much of the next day, with the outcome in doubt. Reno credited Benteen's luck with repulsing a severe attack on the portion of the perimeter held by Companies H and M.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Reno Court of Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, the column under General Terry approached from the north, and the natives drew off in the opposite direction. The Crow scout [[White Man Runs Him]] was the first to tell General Terry's officers that Custer's force had "been wiped out." Reno and Benteen's wounded troops were given what treatment was available at that time; five later died of their wounds. One of the regiment's three surgeons had been with Custer's column, while another, Dr. DeWolf, had been killed during Reno's retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Brust, J.S., Pohanka, B.C. and Barnard, S. (2005) ''Where Custer Fell: Photographs of the Little Bighorn Battlefield Then and Now''. University of Oklahoma Press, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The only remaining doctor was Assistant Surgeon Henry R.

[[File:Plenty Coups Edward Curtis Portrait (c1908).jpg|thumb|left|Plenty Coups Edward Curtis Portrait (c1908). When the Crows got news from the battlefield, they went into grief.

Medicine Woman of the Crows''. Lincoln and London. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; With the defeat of Custer, it was still a real threat that the Lakotas would take-over the eastern part of the Crow reservation and keep up the invasion. In the end, the army won the Sioux war. Crow chief Plenty Coups recalled with amazement, how his tribe now finally could sleep without fear for Lakota attacks. " ... this was the first time I had ever known such a condition."&lt;ref&gt;Linderman, Frank B. (1962): ''Plenty Coups. Chief of the Crows.'' Lincoln/London. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Battle of the Little Bighorn had far-reaching consequences for the Natives. It was the beginning of the end of the 'Indian' Wars and has even been referred to as "the Indians" last stand"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1991/09/29/the-custer-syndrome.html The Custer Syndrome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817010350/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1991/09/29/the-custer-syndrome.html |date=August 17, 2012 }}", ''Newsweek'', Sep. 29, 1991; accessed 2012.08.30.&lt;/ref&gt; in the area. Within 48 hours of the battle, the large encampment on the Little Bighorn broke up into smaller groups because there was not enough game and grass to sustain a large congregation of people and horses.&lt;ref name="sonofthesouth.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/union-generals/custer/custers-last-stand.htm|title=Custer's Last Stand|work=sonofthesouth.net|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oglala Sioux]] [[Black Elk]] recounted the exodus this way: "We fled all night, following the Greasy Grass. My two younger brothers and I rode in a pony-drag, and my mother put some young pups in with us. They were always trying to crawl out and I was always putting them back in, so I didn't sleep much."&lt;ref&gt;Welch, James A &amp; Steckler, Paul (1994), ''Killing Custer – The Battle of the Little Bighorn and the Fate of the Plains Indians'', New York: Penguin Books: p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TwoLeggings2.0.jpg|thumb|Crow warrior [[Two Leggings]] joined the U.S. army for a short time after the defeat of Custer. Two Belly had given him and nearly 30 other Crows a lecture and explained how the Sioux had taken the hunting grounds of the Crow.

Lincoln and London. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The scattered Sioux and Cheyenne feasted and celebrated during July with no threat from soldiers. After their celebrations, many of the Natives returned to the reservation. Soon the number of warriors amounted to only about 600.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Stephen E. ''Crazy Horse and Custer'' New York: Anchor Books, 1996, pp. 451–52&lt;/ref&gt; Both Crook and Terry remained immobile for seven weeks after the battle, awaiting reinforcements and unwilling to venture out against the Sioux and Cheyenne until they had at least 2,000 men. Crook and Terry finally took the field against the Natives forces in August. General [[Nelson A. Miles]] took command of the effort in October 1876. In May 1877, Sitting Bull escaped to Canada. Within days, Crazy Horse surrendered at [[Fort Robinson]], Nebraska. The Great Sioux War ended on May 7 with Miles' defeat of a remaining band of [[Miniconjou]] Sioux.&lt;ref name="sonofthesouth.net"/&gt;

Ownership of the [[Black Hills]], which had been a focal point of the 1876 conflict, was determined by an ultimatum issued by the [[Manypenny Agreement|Manypenny Commission]], according to which the Sioux were required to cede the land to the United States if they wanted the government to continue supplying rations to the reservations. Threatened with forced starvation, the Natives ceded ''[[Paha Sapa]]'' to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Welch, James A &amp; Steckler, Paul (1994), ''Killing Custer – The Battle of the Little Bighorn and the Fate of the Plains Indians'', New York: Penguin Books: pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Sioux never accepted the legitimacy of the transaction. They lobbied Congress to create a forum to decide their claim and subsequently litigated for 40 years; the United States Supreme Court in the 1980 decision [[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]] acknowledged&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to ''United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians'', 448 U.S. 371 (1980), the US government had to pay just compensation and interest to the Sioux for taking the Black Hills. This case confirmed the court's view that the government can treat Indian reservations like private property and take them by [[eminent domain]] if just compensation is paid.&lt;/ref&gt; that the United States had taken the Black Hills without just compensation. The Sioux [[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians#Legal Analysis|refused the money subsequently offered]] and continue to insist on their right to occupy the land.

===Arapaho participation===
Modern-day accounts include [[Arapaho]] warriors in the battle, but the five Arapaho men who were at the encampments were there only by accident. While on a hunting trip they came close to the village by the river and were captured and almost killed by the Lakota who believed the hunters were scouts for the U.S. Army. Two Moon, a Northern Cheyenne leader, interceded to save their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''The Custer Myth,'' p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==

===Native American warriors===
Estimates of Native American casualties have differed widely, from as few as 36 dead (from Native American listings of the dead by name) to as many as 300.&lt;ref&gt;Hardorff, ''Hokayhey!,'' page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Lakota chief [[Red Horse (Lakota chief)|Red Horse]] told Col. W. H. Wood in 1877 that the Native Americans suffered 136 dead and 160 wounded during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Col. W. A. ''The Custer Myth''. NY, Bonanza Books, 1953, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, Red Horse told Dr. C. E. McChesney the same numbers but in a series of drawings done by Red Horse to illustrate the battle, he drew only sixty figures representing Lakota and Cheyenne casualties. Of those sixty figures only thirty some are portrayed with a conventional Plains Indian method of indicating death. In the last 140 years, historians have been able to identify multiple Indian names pertaining to the same individual, which has greatly reduced previously inflated numbers. Today a list of positively known casualties exists that lists 99 names, attributed and consolidated to 31 identified warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Rodney G.|title=Indian Casualties of the Little Big Horn Battle|url=http://www.littlebighorn.info/Articles/IndianCasualties.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403040007/http://www.littlebighorn.info/Articles/IndianCasualties.pdf|archivedate=April 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American noncombatants===
Six unnamed Native American women and four unnamed children are known to have been killed at the beginning of the battle during Reno's charge. Among them were two wives and three children of the Hunkpapa Leader Pizi (Gall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Rodney G.|title=Indian Casualties of the Little Big Horn Battle|url=http://www.littlebighorn.info/Articles/IndianCasualties.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403040007/http://www.littlebighorn.info/Articles/IndianCasualties.pdf|archivedate=April 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===7th Cavalry===
The 7th Cavalry suffered 52 percent casualties: 16 officers and 242 troopers killed or died of wounds, 1 officer and 51 troopers wounded. Every soldier of the five companies with Custer was killed (except for some [[Crow scouts]] and several troopers that had left that column before the battle or as the battle was starting). Among the dead were Custer's brothers Boston and Thomas, his brother-in-law James Calhoun, and his nephew Henry Reed.

In 1878, the army awarded 24 [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] to participants in the fight on the bluffs for bravery, most for risking their lives to carry water from the river up the hill to the wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few on the non-Indian side questioned the conduct of the enlisted men, but many questioned the tactics, strategy and conduct of the officers. Indian accounts spoke of soldiers' panic-driven flight and suicide by those unwilling to fall captive to the Indians. While such stories were gathered by [[Thomas Bailey Marquis]] in a book in the 1930s, it was not published until 1976 because of the unpopularity of such assertions.&lt;ref name="cheyenne"&gt;{{cite web |last =Liberty |first =Dr. Margot |url = http://www.friendslittlebighorn.com/cheyenneprimacy.htm |title = Cheyenne Primacy: The Tribes' Perspective As Opposed To That Of The United States Army; A Possible Alternative To "The Great Sioux War Of 1876 |publisher = Friends of the Little Bighorn|accessdate =January 13, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080124135151/http://www.friendslittlebighorn.com/cheyenneprimacy.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although soldiers may have believed captives would be tortured, Indians usually killed men outright and took as captive for adoption only young women and children.&lt;ref name="cheyenne"/&gt; Indian accounts also noted the bravery of soldiers who fought to the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Running Dog |url=http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/he_dog2_little_big_horn.html |title=He Dog's Story of the Battle of the Little Bighorn #2 |publisher=Astonisher.com |date=1920-08-19 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118221821/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/he_dog2_little_big_horn.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Reconstitution of the 7th Cavalry===
[[File:Custer's Last Stand, 1877.png|thumb|Scene of Custer's Last Stand, looking in the direction of the Indian village and the deep ravine. Photo by Stanley J. Morrow, spring 1877.]]
Beginning in July, the 7th Cavalry was assigned new officers&lt;ref name="hils"&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=w-VCAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=record+of+living+officers+of+the+united+states+army&amp;printsec=frontcover| title = Records of Living Officers of the United States Army (1884)| publisher = eBay.com| accessdate =January 17, 2008| year = 1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Major Elmer I. Otis of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry]] was promoted to replace Custer effective June 25, 1876, but did not report until February 1877. Two 1876 West Point graduates designated for the 7th Cavalry were advanced to 1st lieutenant effective 10 days after their graduation. Four others appointed to other regiments, along with eight experienced 2nd lieutenants, were transferred and designated one to each company of the 7th. However, five declined the appointment, replaced by 2nd lieutenants of infantry and unappointed new officers in July and August 1876. Only three replacements were able to report while the 7th was still in the field.&lt;/ref&gt; and recruiting efforts began to fill the depleted ranks. The regiment, reorganized into eight companies, remained in the field as part of the Terry Expedition, now based on the Yellowstone River at the mouth of the Bighorn and reinforced by Gibbon's column. On August 8, 1876, after Terry was further reinforced with the 5th Infantry, the expedition moved up Rosebud Creek in pursuit of the Lakota. It met with Crook's command, similarly reinforced, and the combined force, almost 4,000 strong, followed the Lakota trail northeast toward the [[Little Missouri River (North Dakota)|Little Missouri River]]. Persistent rain and lack of supplies forced the column to dissolve and return to its varying starting points. The 7th Cavalry returned to Fort Abraham Lincoln to reconstitute.

===Expansion of the U.S. Army===
The U.S. Congress authorized appropriations to expand the Army by 2,500 men to meet the emergency after the defeat of the 7th Cavalry. For a session, the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives abandoned its campaign to reduce the size of the Army. Word of Custer's fate reached the 44th United States Congress as a conference committee was attempting to reconcile opposing appropriations bills approved by the House and the Republican Senate. They approved a measure to increase the size of cavalry companies to 100 enlisted men on July 24. The committee temporarily lifted the ceiling on the size of the Army by 2,500 on August 15.&lt;ref&gt;Utley, Robert M. (1973) ''Frontier Regulars: The United States Army and the Indian 1866–1890'', pp. 64 and 69 note 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Sell or Starve"===
{{main|Black Hills Land Claim}}
As a result of the defeat in June 1876, Congress responded by attaching what the Sioux call the "sell or starve" rider ({{USStat|19|192}}) to the Indian Appropriations Act of 1876 (enacted August 15, 1876), which cut off all rations for the Sioux until they terminated hostilities and ceded the Black Hills to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;House Report 95-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'' (Ct. Cl. 1979), 601 F.2d 1157, 1161&lt;/ref&gt; The Agreement of 1877 ({{USStat|19|254}}, enacted February 28, 1877) officially took away Sioux land and permanently established Indian reservations.

==Controversies==
===Reno's conduct===
The Battle of the Little Bighorn was the subject of an 1879 U.S. Army Court of Inquiry in Chicago, held at Reno's request, during which his conduct was scrutinized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=goto&amp;id=History.Reno&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=1 |title=A Complete scanned transcript of the Reno Court of Inquiry (RCOI) |publisher=Digicoll.library.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406080132/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=goto&amp;id=History.Reno&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=1 |archivedate=April 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some testimony by non-Army officers suggested that he was drunk and a coward. The court found Reno's conduct to be without fault. After the battle, Thomas Rosser, James O'Kelly, and others continued to question the conduct of Reno due to his hastily ordered retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, James (2008). ''A Terrible Glory: Custer and the Little Bighorn – the Last Great Battle of the American West'' (Kindle Location 5870). Little, Brown and Company. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of Reno at the trial noted that, while the retreat was disorganized, Reno did not withdraw from his position until it became apparent that he was outnumbered and outflanked by the Indians. Contemporary accounts also point to the fact that Reno's scout, Bloody Knife, was shot in the head, spraying him with blood, possibly increasing his own panic and distress.&lt;ref name="Fox1993" /&gt;

===Custer's errors===
General Terry and others claimed that Custer made strategic errors from the start of the campaign. For instance, he refused to use a battery of Gatling guns, and turned down General Terry's offer of an additional battalion of the 2nd Cavalry. Custer believed that the Gatling guns would impede his march up the Rosebud and hamper his mobility. His rapid march en route to the Little Bighorn averaged nearly {{convert|30|mi|km}} a day, so his assessment appears to have been accurate. Custer planned "to live and travel like Indians; in this manner the command will be able to go wherever the Indians can", he wrote in his ''Herald'' dispatch.&lt;ref name="Donovan 2008"&gt;Donovan (2008). ''A Terrible Glory'', (Kindle Locations 3080–3086)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pawnee bill wild west show c1905.jpg|thumb|''Death of Custer'', scene by Pawnee Bill's Wild West Show performers c. 1905 of Sitting Bull's stabbing Custer, with dead Native Americans lying on ground]]

By contrast, each Gatling gun had to be hauled by four horses, and soldiers often had to drag the heavy guns by hand over obstacles. Each of the heavy, hand-cranked weapons could fire up to 350 rounds a minute, an impressive rate, but they were known to jam frequently. During the [[Black Hills Expedition]] two years earlier, a Gatling gun had turned over, rolled down a mountain, and shattered to pieces. Lieutenant William Low, commander of the artillery detachment, was said to have almost wept when he learned he had been excluded from the strike force.&lt;ref name="Donovan 2008"/&gt;

Custer believed that the 7th Cavalry could handle any Indian force and that the addition of the four companies of the 2nd would not alter the outcome. When offered the 2nd Cavalry, he reportedly replied that the 7th "could handle anything."&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Evan S. (1997). ''Son of the Morning Star''. New York: HarperPerennial, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that Custer suspected that he would be outnumbered by the Indians, although he did not know by how much. By dividing his forces, Custer could have caused the defeat of the entire column, had it not been for Benteen's and Reno's linking up to make a desperate yet successful stand on the bluff above the southern end of the camp.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan (2008).

The historian James Donovan believed that Custer's dividing his force into four smaller detachments (including the pack train) can be attributed to his inadequate reconnaissance; he also ignored the warnings of his Crow scouts and Charley Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan (2008). ''A Terrible Glory''(Kindle Location 3697)&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the battle began, Custer had already divided his forces into three battalions of differing sizes, of which he kept the largest. His men were widely scattered and unable to support each other.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Thomas (1984). ''Scalp Dance: Indian Warfare on the High Plains, 1865–1879''. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wert, Jeffry D. (1964/1996) ''Custer: The Controversial Life of George Armstrong Custer''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to prevent any escape by the combined tribes to the south, where they could disperse into different groups,&lt;ref name="Donovan, loc 3699"/&gt; Custer believed that an immediate attack on the south end of the camp was the best course of action.

===Admiration for Custer===
Criticism of Custer was not universal. While investigating the battlefield, Lieutenant General [[Nelson A. Miles]] wrote in 1877, "The more I study the moves here [on the Little Big Horn], the more I have admiration for Custer."&lt;ref&gt;Sklenar, page 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing major budget cutbacks, the U.S. Army wanted to avoid bad press and found ways to exculpate Custer. They blamed the defeat on the Indians' alleged possession of numerous repeating rifles and the overwhelming numerical superiority of the warriors.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Twenty-three men were called to testify at the inquiry, which met in session daily except Sundays. For the army, far more was at stake than individual reputations, as the future of the service could be affected. On January 2, General Sheridan had quoted Lee's report of agent malfeasance in a supplement to his annual report, which continued the General's running battle with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the [[Department of the Interior]]. At the same time, a House committee was busy debating a new appropriations bill that required a major reorganization of the army. "Reduction of expenses" was emphasized. One proposal would lop off entire regiments, including two cavalry regiments. Another would set the line officers (those in the field) from Major down back a few years in the promotion schedule. The total reduction in officers was proposed to be 406, almost 25 percent of the total. The military strongly wanted to avoid confirmation of incompetency or cowardice – rumors of which were circulating around the impending court of inquiry in Chicago. Donovan (2008).

The widowed Elizabeth Bacon Custer, who never remarried, wrote three popular books in which she fiercely protected her husband's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Smith|first1= Gene|year= 1993|journal= American Heritage|volume= 44|issue= 8|url= http://www.americanheritage.com/content/libbie-custer|title= Libbie Custer|accessdate= 10 September 2012|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131220201035/http://www.americanheritage.com/content/libbie-custer|archivedate= December 20, 2013|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Libbie Custer "spent almost sixty years commemorating her marriage—and her memories of it quite literally kept her alive....she was quintessentially the professional widow, forcing it to become a very touchy matter for any military writer or officer to criticize Custer for having insanely launched an attack without taking the most elementary precautions or making even an attempt at reconnaissance.

Custer'' (1876), noted in Donovan (2008). ''A Terrible Glory'' (Kindle Locations 6222–6223)&lt;/ref&gt; Custer as a heroic officer fighting valiantly against savage forces was an image popularized in ''Wild West'' extravaganzas hosted by showman [[Buffalo Bill|"Buffalo Bill" Cody]], [[Pawnee Bill]], and others. It was not until over half a century later that historians took another look at the battle and Custer's decisions that led to his death and loss of half his command and found much to criticize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historynet.com/buffalo-bills-skirmish-at-warbonnet-creek.htm|title= Buffalo Bill's Skirmish At Warbonnet Creek|author= Robert B.Smith|date= June 12, 2006|work= American History Magazine|accessdate= August 25, 2012|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121001171445/http://www.historynet.com/buffalo-bills-skirmish-at-warbonnet-creek.htm|archivedate= October 1, 2012|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gatling gun controversy===
General Alfred Terry's Dakota column included a single battery of artillery, comprising two [[Rodman gun]]s ([[Field artillery in the American Civil War#3-inch rifle|3-inch Ordnance rifle]]) and two [[Gatling Gun|Gatling guns]].&lt;ref&gt;Sklenar, 2000, p. 68: Terry's column out of Fort Abraham Lincoln included "…artillery (two Rodman and two Gatling guns)…"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2007, p. 48: "[Three] rapid-fire artillery pieces known as Gatling guns" were part of Terry's firepower included in the Dakota column.&lt;/ref&gt; (According to historian Evan S. Connell, the precise number of Gatlings has not been established, ranging from two to three.)&lt;ref&gt;Connell, 1984, p. 101: "How many Gatling guns lurched across the prairie is uncertain. Probably three."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mitrailleuse-gatling-p1000591.jpg|left|thumb|The Gatling gun, invented in 1861 by [[Richard Jordan Gatling|Richard Gatling]]. Custer declined an offer of a battery of these weapons, explaining to Terry that they would "hamper our movements". Said Custer: "The 7th can handle anything it meets."&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2007, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Custer's decision to reject Terry's offer of the rapid-fire Gatlings has raised questions among historians as to why he refused them and what advantage their availability might have conferred on his forces at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 175: "Custer refused Terry's offer of the Gatling gun battery."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2008, p. 50: "Military historians have speculated whether this decision was a mistake. If Gatling guns had made it to the battlefield, they might have allowed Custer enough firepower to allow Custer's companies to survive on Last Stand Hill."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, 2010, p. 73: "Since its invention during the Civil War, the Gatling gun had been used sparingly in actual battle, but there was no denying, potentially at least, an awesome weapon."&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor concerned Major Marcus Reno's recent 8-day reconnaissance-in-force of the Powder-Tongue-Rosebud Rivers, June 10 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;Sklenar, 2000, p. 71, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, pp. 162–63: Reno's wing "left…on June 10…accompanied by a Gatling gun and its crew…"&lt;/ref&gt; This deployment had demonstrated that artillery pieces mounted on gun carriages and hauled by horses no longer fit for cavalry mounts (so-called condemned horses) were cumbersome over mixed terrain and vulnerable to breakdowns.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 163: "The [Gatling gun] and its ammunition…was mostly pulled by two 'condemned' cavalry mounts [p. 176: "…drawn by four condemned horses…"] judged not fit to carry troopers, but it needed the occasional hauling by hand through some of the rougher ravines. (The gun would eventually upset and injure three men.)" and p. 175: "…Reno had taken [a Gatling gun] on his [June reconnaissance mission], and it had been nothing but trouble."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sklenar, 2000, p. 72: On Reno's [June 10 to June 18] reconnaissance "the Gatling guns proved to be an annoying burden…they either fell apart or had to be disassembled and carried in pieces over rough terrain." And p. 79: "During the Reno scout [reconnoitering], the two guns were actually abandoned (and retrieved later) because soldiers got tired of dragging them over rough spots…[I]f Custer did not already have a fully formed negative opinion of the Gatlings on such an expedition, the experience of the Reno [reconnaissance of early June] surely convinced him."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, 2010, p. 73: "The biggest problem with the [Gatling] gun was transporting it to where it might be of some use… [in the week preceding the Battle of the Little Bighorn], the Gatling, not the mules, proved to be the biggest hindrance to the expedition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 175: "…Reno had taken one [Gatling gun] along [on his June reconnaissance], and it had been nothing but trouble." And p. 195: Custer, in comments to his officer staff before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, said that "…if hostiles could whip the Seventh [Cavalry]…they could defeat a much larger force."&lt;/ref&gt; Custer, valuing the mobility of the 7th Cavalry and recognizing Terry's acknowledgement of the regiment as "the primary strike force" preferred to remain unencumbered by the Gatling guns.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, pp. 80–81: The Gatling guns "were cumbersome and would cause delays over the traveled route. The guns were drawn by four condemned horses [and] obstacles in the terrain [would] require their unhitching and assistance of soldier to continue…Terry's own battery [of Gatling guns] – the one he had offered to Custer – [would have] a difficult time keeping up with the march of Colonel John Gibbon's infantry."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2007, p. 50: "[Custer] turned down General Terry's offer to bring the three Gatling guns, because they would slow down his movement."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, 2010, p. 99: "Custer knew he had to move quickly to accomplish his objective. That was why he ultimately declined the offer of the Gatling guns that had proven such a bother to Reno."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sklenar, 2000, p. 79: After the 7th Cavalry's departure up Rosebud Creek, "even Brisbin would acknowledge that everyone in Gibbon's command understood [that]…the Seventh was the primary strike force."&lt;/ref&gt; Custer insisted that the artillery was superfluous to his success, in that the 7th Cavalry alone was sufficient to cope with any force they should encounter, informing Terry: "The 7th can handle anything it meets".&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, 2010, p. 99: "Thinking his regiment powerful enough to handle anything it might encounter, [Custer, in addition to declining the Gatling guns] declined the offer of four additional cavalry companies from [Gibbon's] Montana column." And p. 114: Custer told his officer staff days before the battle that he "opted against the Gatling guns…so as not to 'hamper our movements'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sklenar, 2000, p. 92: Custer "on the evening of 22 June…[informed his officer staff]…why he had not accepted the offers…of Gatling guns (he thought they might hamper his movements at a critical moment)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2007 p. 50: "Custer…refused Major James Brisbin's offer to include his Second Cavalry Regiment [200 troopers], told Terry "the 7th can handle anything it meets."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. "Explaining his refusal of the Gatling gun detachment and the Second Cavalry battalion, he convolutedly reaffirmed his confidence in the Seventh's ability to defeat any number of Indians they could find."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these practical concerns, a strained relationship with Major James Brisbin induced Custer's polite refusal to integrate Brisbin's Second Cavalry unit – and the Gatling guns – into his strike force, as it would disrupt any hierarchical arrangements that Custer presided over.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 24: "Brisbin argued with Terry that Custer was undermanned, and requested that his troops [which had the] Gatling guns – with Terry in command because Brisbin did not want to serve under Custer – be permitted to accompany [Custer's] column. Custer refused the assistance, and Terry abided by that."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sklenar, 2000, pp. 78–79: "Apparently, Terry offered [Major James] Brisbin's battalion and Gatling gun battery to accompany the Seventh, but Custer refused these additions for several reasons. First of all, Custer and Brisbin did not get along and Custer thus would not have wanted to place Brisbin in a senior command position. Custer was on the verge of abolishing the wings led by Reno and Benteen, and the inclusion of Brisbin would have complicated the arrangement he had in mind. Also, Custer retained the conviction that the Seventh could handle any force of Indians it might encounter, and he may have reasoned that taking the Second Cavalry would leave [Colonel John] Gibbon's column susceptible to attack and defeat…"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 80: "The offer of 3 Gatling Guns…was made to Custer by General Alfred Terry [at the] urging of Major James Brisbin, who also desired his Second Cavalry to become part of Custer's detachment. Custer respectfully declined both offers, state that the Gatlings would impede his march.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have acknowledged the firepower inherent in the Gatling gun: they were capable of firing 350 .45-70 caliber rounds per minute. Jamming caused by black powder residue could lower that rate,&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 80: "The Gatling Guns would have brought formidable firepower into play; this rapid fire artillery could fire up to 350 rounds in 1 minute."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 175: "Each of these heavy, hand-cranked weapons could fire up to 350 rounds a minute, an impressive rate, but they were known to jam frequently.&lt;/ref&gt; raising questions as to their reliability under combat conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, pp. 80–81: "The Gatlings had major drawbacks, such as frequent jamming due to residue from black powder…"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, 2010, p. 73: "Military traditionalists like to claim the gun was unreliable, but in actuality the Gatling functioned surprisingly well."&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have further questioned the effectiveness of the guns under the tactics that Custer was likely to face with the Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. The Gatlings, mounted high on carriages, required the battery crew to stand upright during its operation, making them easy targets for Lakota and Cheyenne sharpshooters.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 81: "…The [Gatling] guns were mounted on large [diameter] wheels, which meant that in order to operate them the gun crews would [necessarily] be standing upright, making them [extremely vulnerable] to Indian snipers."&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Robert M. Utley]], in a section entitled "Would Gatling Guns Have Saved Custer?" presents two judgments from Custer's contemporaries: General [[Henry J. Hunt]], expert in the tactical use of artillery in Civil War, stated that Gatlings "would probably have saved the command", whereas General [[Nelson A. Miles]], participant in the Great Sioux War declared "[Gatlings] were useless for Indian fighting." &lt;ref&gt;Utley, 1987, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons==
===Lakota and Cheyenne===
[[File:SAA 5773 oN.JPG|thumb|Colt Single Action Army, serial No 5773 7th Cavalry issued]]
[[File:Springfield Trapdoor breech open.JPG|thumb|Springfield Trapdoor Rifle with breech open. Custer's troops were equipped with these breech-loading, single-shot rifles.]]
[[File:Henry Winchester Musket.JPG|thumb|A Henry Rifle and a Winchester Mod 1866 Rifle. These [[Repeating rifle|repeater]] rifles were capable of higher rates of fire than the Springfield Trapdoor.]]

The Lakota and Cheyenne warriors that opposed Custer's forces possessed a wide array of weaponry, from [[Stone Age]] war clubs and lances to the most advanced firearms of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "The Indians were well equipped with hand-to-hand weapons and these included lances, tomahawks, war clubs, knives and war shields were carried for defense. Such weapons were little different from the shock and hand-to-hand weapons, used by the cavalry of the European armies, such as the sabre and lance…[in addition] the Indians were clearly armed with a number of sophisticated firearms…"&lt;br&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 184: "Sioux and Cheyenne weapons included…clubs, bows and arrows, lances, and hatchets [as well as] an array of new and old [model] firearms: muzzleloaders, Spenser, Sharps, Henry and Winchester repeating rifles, and…Springfield carbines taken from Reno's dead cavalrymen."&lt;br&gt;Robinson, 1995, p. xxix: "…Indians carried at least forty-one different kinds of firearms in the fight."&lt;/ref&gt; The typical firearms carried by the Lakota and Cheyenne combatants were [[muzzleloader]]s, more often a [[Caplock mechanism|cap-lock]] smoothbore, the so-called Indian trade musket or Leman guns&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, 1993, p. 208: "By 1873, Indians "used the traditional bow and arrows and war club along with firearms such as the muzzle-loading Leman rifle, issued as part of treaty agreements, and rapid-fire Henry and Winchester rifles, obtained through civilian traders."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "Trade guns were made up until the 1880s by such gunsmiths as Henry Leman, J.P. Lower and J. Henry &amp; Son."&lt;/ref&gt; distributed to Indians by the US government at treaty conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "These guns were crudely made for Indian trade and were given out as a sweetener for treaties."&lt;/ref&gt; Less common were surplus .58 caliber rifled muskets of American Civil War vintage such as the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfield]] and [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "Civil War type muzzleloader rifles would have had an effective range of about 500 yards, but with [[volley fire]] were effective to 1000 yards."&lt;/ref&gt; Metal cartridge weapons were prized by native combatants, such as the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] and the [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer]] lever-action rifles, as well as [[Sharps rifle|Sharps]] breechloaders.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 188: "Though most of the men in the village carried the bow and arrow in battle...over the past decade [1866–1876] the sale and trade of arms to the Indians had increased significantly...[t]he latest Winchester magazine rifles were available for the right price...Many men carried older guns – muzzleloaders, for which some molded their own bullets; Henry and Spencer repeaters; Springfield, Enfield [rifled muskets], Sharps breechloaders and many different pistols. All told, between one-third and one-half of the gathering warriors had a gun."&lt;/ref&gt; Bows and arrows were utilized by younger braves in lieu of the more potent firearms; effective up to 30 yards (27 meters), the arrows could readily maim or disable an opponent.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "The bows effective range was about 30 yards and was unlikely to kill a man instantly or even knock him off his horse. However, it would incapacitate and few troopers would fight on after an arrow hit them."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sitting Bull's forces had no assured means to supply themselves with firearms and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "There is also evidence that some Indians were short of ammunition and it is unclear how good a shot they were. They certainly did not have the ammunition to practice, except whilst hunting buffalo, and this would suggest that the Indians generally followed the same technique of holding their fire until they were at very close range,"&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, they could usually procure these through post-traders, licensed or unlicensed, and from gunrunners who operated in the Dakota Territory: "…a horse or a mule for a repeater…buffalo hides for ammunition."&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 188 (fragment of quote)&lt;br&gt;Utley, 1993, p. 39: The Indians had grown to depend on the goods [white traders] supplied, especially firearms and ammunition…they could be obtained only though white men, directly, of through Indian intermediaries."&lt;br&gt;Gallear, 2001: "Indian trade muskets…could be legitimately obtained from traders at Indian agencies…The Sioux [however] were keen to obtain metal cartridge weapons [available].from half-breed Indian traders out of Canada or unsupervised traders at Missouri River posts in Montana…By 1876 almost all [Model 1860 Henry rifles] in civilian use would have disappeared so Indian use must have come from ex-Civil War stocks sold off cheaply and bought by Indian traders, such as the Métis.&lt;br&gt;Flaherty, 1993, p. 208: By 1873, Indians "used the traditional bow and arrows and war club along with firearms such as the muzzle-loading Leman rifle, issued as part of treaty agreements, and rapid-fire Henry and Winchester rifles, obtained through civilian traders."&lt;br&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 188: "…there were many…ways a warrior could acquire a rifle. Post-traders on some reservations supplied illegal arms to non-treat[y] [Indians]; so did unlicensed traders – primarily the half-breed Canadian Métis gunrunners to the north in the desolate area known as Burning Ground below the Black Hills.&lt;br&gt;Robinson, 1995, p. xxix: "Studies of the cartridge cases recovered in archaeological investigations of the Little Big Horn show the Indians carried at least forty-one different kinds [models] if firearms in that fight, and it estimated that at least 25 to 30 percent [of Lakota and Cheyenne combatants] were armed with modern sixteen-shot Winchester and Henry repeating rifles.…they also armed themselves with captured Springfield carbines…[and] carried traditional weapons…bows and arrows, hatchets…and war clubs."&lt;/ref&gt; Custer's highly regarded guide, "Lonesome" [[Charley Reynolds]], informed his superior in early 1876 that Sitting Bull's forces were amassing weapons, including numerous Winchester repeating rifles and abundant ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 118: Reynolds "...best white scout in Dakota Territory...had earned Custer's respect for his excellent work...report[ed] to Custer that Lakotas under Sitting Bull were 'gathering in force'. They had been preparing for war by collecting Winchester repeating rifles and plenty ammunition."&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the guns owned by Lakota and Cheyenne fighters at the Little Bighorn, approximately 200 were repeating rifles&lt;ref name="Hatch 1997, p. 184"&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 184: "It has been estimated that perhaps 200 repeating rifles were possessed by the Indians, nearly one for each [man in Custer's battalion]."&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to about 1 of 10 of the encampment's two thousand able-bodied fighters who participated in the battle&lt;ref&gt;Sklenar, 2000, p. 163: "…the village contained possibly 1,200 lodges, plus several hundred wikiups housing individual warriors. The total population of men, woman and children probably reached 6,000 to 7,000 at its peak, with 2,000 of these being able-bodied warriors…"&lt;/ref&gt;

===7th Cavalry===
The troops under Custer's command carried two regulation firearms authorized and issued by the U.S. Army in early 1876: the breech-loading, single-shot [[Springfield Model 1873]] carbine, and the 1873 [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt]] single-action revolver.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2007, pp. 52–53: "The troops of the 7th Cavalry were each armed with two standard weapons, a rifle and a pistol. The rifle was a .45/55-caliber Springfield carbine and the pistol was a .45-caliber Colt revolver...both weapons were models [introduced in] 1873 [though] they did not represent the latest in firearm technology."&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation [[Model 1860 Light Cavalry Saber|M1860 saber]] or "long knives" were not carried by troopers upon Custer's order.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2007, p. 53: "Although each soldier was also issued a sword or saber, Custer ordered these weapons boxed before the strike force departed [up Rosebud Creek]…the lack of swords would prove to be a disadvantage during some of the close fighting that lay ahead. Gunpowder of the day is now known as black powder. It causes substantial fouling within the firearm. After about 25 rounds are fired from the M1873 revolver using black powder, the cylinder binds on the cylinder pin. The cavalry trooper would then have used his saber. However, their inclusion would not have changed the ultimate outcome."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "No bayonet or hand to hand weapon was issued apart from the saber, which under Custer's orders was left behind."&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a number of officers and scouts who opted for personally owned and more expensive rifles and handguns, the 7th Cavalry was uniformly armed.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2008, p. 53: "Many of the officers and most of the civilians brought along their own weapons."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 191: "...each enlisted man carried the regulation single-action breech-loading, M1873 Springfield carbine...the standard issue sidearm was the reliable [single-action] M1873 Colt .45 cal. pistol."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "Officers purchased their own carbines or rifles for hunting purposes…[however] these guns may have been left with the baggage and is unclear how many officers actually used these weapons in the battle. However, there is evidence that Reno's men did make use of long-range hunting rifles. White Scouts would have been better armed and seemed to favor long-range buffalo hunting type rifles over fast-shooting lever actions… Henrys, Spencers and Winchester M1866s would also have been popular choices… Some Scouts would have been armed with both types of weapons plus a variety of side arms."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammunition allotments provided 100 carbine rounds per trooper, carried on a [[Bandolier|cartridge belt]] and in saddlebags on their mounts. An additional 50 carbine rounds per man were reserved on the pack train that accompanied the regiment to the battlefield. Each trooper had 24 rounds for his Colt handgun.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 191: "[Each] trooper carried 100 rounds of carbine ammunition and 24 pistol cartridges with him – as many as 50 on a belt or in a pouch, and the remainder in his saddlebag (the pack train mules carried 26,000 more carbine rounds [approximately 50 extra per trooper])."&lt;/ref&gt;
The opposing forces, though not equally matched in the number and type of arms, were comparably outfitted, and neither side held a overwhelming advantage in weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 184: "...not a wide disparity..." in arms of the opposing forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lever-action Repeaters vs. Single-shot Breechloaders===
Two hundred or more Lakota and Cheyenne combatants are known to have been armed with Henry, Winchester, or similar lever-action repeating rifles at the battle.&lt;ref name="Hatch 1997, p. 184"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "the .44 rim-fire round fired from the Henry rifle is the most numerous Indian gun fired with almost as many individual guns identified as the Cavalry Springfield Model 1873 carbine."&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually every trooper in the 7th Cavalry fought with the single-shot, breech-loading Springfield carbine and the Colt revolver.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "…by the time of the Little Bighorn the U.S. Army was standardizing on the Springfield rifle and carbine [and] saw breech-loading rifles and carbines as the way forward."&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have asked whether the repeating rifles conferred a distinct advantage on Sitting Bull's villagers that contributed to their victory over Custer's carbine-armed soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2008, p. 93: "The rapid fire power of the Henry repeaters was intimidating, especially to inexperience soldiers. Their use was probably a significant cause of the confusion and panic among the soldiers so widely reported by Native American eyewitnesses."&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Michael L. Lawson offers a scenario based on archaeological collections at the "Henryville" site, which yielded plentiful Henry rifle cartridge casings from approximately 20 individual guns. Lawson speculates that, though less powerful than the Springfield carbines, the Henry repeaters provided a barrage of fire at a critical point, driving Lieutenant James Calhoun's L Company from Calhoun Hill and Finley Ridge, forcing them to flee in disarray back to Captain Myles Keogh's I Company, and leading to the disintegration of that wing of Custer's Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, 2007, pp. 91–93: "[Henryville] was named in the mid-1980s by archaeologists after they discovered a large artifact collection there, which included numerous .44-caliber Henry cartridges. The number of cartridges indicated that about 20 warriors at this position were using Henry repeating rifles. These weapons were less powerful than the cavalry's Springfield rifles, especially at long range; however, they had the advantage of providing rapid fire...The rapid fire power...was intimidating, especially to inexperienced soldiers. Their use was probably a significant a confusion and panic among the soldiers so widely reported by Native American eyewitnesses...Survivors of the assaults...fled north to seek safety with Keogh's Company I...they could react quickly enough to prevent the disintegration of their own unit."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Model 1873 Springfield carbine and the U.S. Army====
After exhaustive testing – including comparisons to domestic and foreign single-shot and repeating rifles – the Army Ordnance Board (whose members included officers Marcus Reno and Alfred Terry) authorized the Springfield as the official firearm for the United States Army.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 191: "The Springfield had won out over many other American and foreign rifles, some of them repeaters, after extensive testing supervised by an army board that had included Marcus Reno and Alfred Terry."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "In 1872 the Army tested a number of foreign and domestic single-shot breechloaders…"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Springfield, manufactured in a .45-70 long rifle version for the infantry and a .45-55 light carbine version for the cavalry, was judged a solid firearm that met the long-term and geostrategic requirements of the United States fighting forces.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1995, p. xxviii: "…the Model 1873 Springfield rifle, in caliber .45-70 for the infantry, and .45-55 light carbine for cavalry."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tomahawk and sabre; or even odds.jpg|thumb|''Tomahawk and sabre; or even odds'', painting by [[Charles Schreyvogel]] (1861–1912). This kind of combat never occurred at the Battle of the Little Bighorn: none of the 7th Cavalry carried sabers on Custer's orders.]]

British historian Mark Gallear maintains that US government experts rejected the lever-action repeater designs, deeming them ineffective in the event of a clash with fully equipped European armies, or in case of an outbreak of another American civil conflict. Gallear's analysis minimizes the allegation that rapid depletion of ammunition in lever-action models influenced the decision in favor of the single-shot Springfield. The [[American Indian Wars|Indian War]], in this context, appears as a minor theatre of conflict, whose contingencies were unlikely to govern the selection of standard weaponry for an emerging industrialized nation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "The established wisdom is that the U.S. Army did not adopt lever-action multiple shot weapons during the Civil War because of the problems they would create regarding the supply of ammunition. However, I believe that by the time of the Indian Wars the Army viewed the lever-actions weapons as under-powered novelty weapons and that they were equipping their men to fight wars against European equipped enemies or to re-fight the Civil War. The Indian Wars were seen as a minor sideshow in which troops armed to fight on European battlefields would be more than a match for fighting any number of Indians.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Springfield carbine is praised for its "superior range and stopping power" by historian James Donovan, and author Charles M. Robinson reports that the rifle could be "loaded and fired much more rapidly than its muzzle loading predecessors, and had twice the range of repeating rifles such as the Winchester, Henry and Spencer."&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 191: "…a solid weapon with superior range and stopping power…"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1995, p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "The Army saw breech-loading rifles and carbines as the way forward. They could fire a much more powerful round at longer ranges than lever-actions."&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallear points out that lever-action rifles, after a burst of rapid discharge, still required a reloading interlude that lowered their overall rate of fire; Springfield breechloaders "in the long run, had a higher rate of fire, which was sustainable throughout a battle."&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The breechloader design patent for the Springfield's Erskine S. Allin [[Single-shot#Trapdoor actions|trapdoor system]] was owned by the US government and the firearm could be easily adapted for production with existing machinery at the [[Springfield Armory]] in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "The Allin System had been developed at the Government Armories to reduce the cost, but the U.S. Treasury had already been forced to pay $124,000 to inventors whose patents it infringed. The adoption of the Allin breech gave the advantages of being already familiar throughout the Army, involved no more royalties, and existing machinery at the Springfield Armory could easily be adapted to its manufacture.&lt;/ref&gt; At time when funding for the post-war Army had been slashed, the prospect for economical production influenced the Ordnance Board member selection of the Springfield option.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 191: "Army appropriations were at an all-time low, and a key factor in the Springfield's favor was its low production cost."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malfunction of the Springfield carbine extractor mechanism====
The question as to whether the reported malfunction of the Model 1873 Springfield carbine issued to the 7th Cavalry contributed to their defeat has been debated for years.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "…some authorities have blamed the gun's reliability and tendency for rounds to jam in the breech for the defeat at the Little Bighorn.."&lt;/ref&gt;

That the weapon experienced jamming of the extractor is not contested, but its contribution to Custer's defeat is considered negligible. This conclusion is supported by evidence from archaeological studies performed at the battlefield, where the recovery of Springfield cartridge casing, bearing tell-tale scratch marks indicating manual extraction, were rare.
The flaw in the ejector mechanism was known to the Army Ordnance Board at the time of the selection of the Model 1873 rifle and carbine, and was not considered a significant shortcoming in the overall worthiness of the shoulder arm.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 124: "This defect was noted by the board of officers (which included Major Reno) that selected the weapon in 1872, but was not considered particularly serious at the time."&lt;/ref&gt; With the ejector failure in US Army tests as low as 1:300, the Springfield carbine was vastly more reliable than the muzzle-loading Springfields used in the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Gallear, 2001: "A study of .45-55 cases found at the battle concludes that extractor failure amounted to less than 0.35% of some 1,751 cases tested…the carbine was in fact more reliable than anything that had preceded it in U.S. Army service. These weapons were vastly more reliable than the muzzle-loading weapons of the Civil War, which would frequently misfire and cause the soldier to uselessly load multiple rounds on top of each other in the heat of battle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 124: 'Scholars have for years debated the issue of whether or not the Model 1873 Springfield carbine carried by cavalrymen, malfunctioned during the battle and [whether this] was one reason for the defeat" and "No definitive conclusion can be drawn [as to] the possible malfunction…as being a significant cause of Custer's defeat. Writers of both pro- and anti-Custer material over the years…have incorporated the theory into their works…"&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallear addresses the post-battle testimony concerning the copper .45-55 cartridges supplied to the troops in which an officer is said to have cleared the chambers of spent cartridges for a number of Springfield carbines.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, 2008, p. 440: footnote, "the carbine extractor problem did exist, though it probably had little impact on the outcome of the battle. DeRudio testified that 'the men had to take their knives to extract cartridges after firing 6 to 10 rounds.'…but 'the men' seems to have been an exaggeration. Private Daniel Newall mentioned the problem…"&lt;/ref&gt; This testimony of widespread fusing of the casings offered to the Chief of Ordnance at the Reno Court of Inquiry in 1879 conflicts with the archaeological evidence collected at the battlefield. Field data showed that possible extractor failures occurred at a rate of approximately 1:30 firings at the Custer Battlefield and at a rate of 1:37 at the Reno-Benteen Battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 124: "The controversy results from the known failure of the carbine to [eject] the spent .45-55 caliber cartridge [casings]. The cartridge cases were made of copper, which expands when hot. That – coupled with a faulty extractor mechanism and dirt – could cause the head of the cartridge to be torn away when the block was opened, and the cartridge cylinder would then be left inside the chamber…The casings would have to be removed manually with a pocketknife before [reloading and] firing again. This defect was noted by the board of officers (which included Major Reno) that selected the weapon in 1872, but was not considered particularly serious at the time."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 124: "How often did this defect [ejector failure] occur and cause the [Springfield carbines] to malfunction on June 25, 1876? According to Dr. Richard Fox in ''Archeology, History and Custer's Last Battle'' (1993), there were very few .45-55 caliber cartridge casings found during the digs on the battlefield that showed any evidence to pry or scratch marks [indicating manual extraction]. Only 3 of 88 [3.4%] found on the Custer [battalion] portion of the battlefield could possibly have been removed in an extraction jam. On the Reno-Benteen defense site [Reno Hill], 7 of 257 fit this category [2.7%]. If this was a representative number it would appear that malfunction from that source was minimal."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 124: "Both sides [troopers and Indians] apparently believed that some weapons malfunctioned. Indian testimony…reported that some soldiers threw down their long guns and fought with their short guns. Could this indicate a malfunctioning [carbine] that was discarded and therefore could not have left its marked [pry scratched] casings on the field? [...] No definitive conclusion can be drawn about the possible malfunction…as being a significant cause of Custer's defeat. Writers of both pro- and anti-Custer material over the years…have incorporated the theory into their works…"&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Thom Hatch observes that the Model 1873 Springfield, despite the known ejector flaw, remained the standard issue shoulder arm for US troops until the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, 1997, p. 124: "On a final note: the Springfield carbine remained the official cavalry firearm until the early 1890s"&lt;/ref&gt; when the copper-cased, inside-primed cartridges were replaced with brass.

==Survivor claims==
[[File:Giovanni Martini (militare).jpg|thumb|John Martin wearing the US Army uniform, ca. 1904]]

Soldiers under Custer's direct command were annihilated on the first day of the battle (except for three [[Crow scouts]] and several troopers (including [[Giovanni Martino|John Martin (Giovanni Martino)]]) that had left that column before the battle; one Crow scout, [[Curly (scout)|Curly]], was the only survivor to leave after the battle had begun), although for years rumors persisted of other survivors.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Graham, 146. Lt. Edward Godfrey reported finding a dead 7th Cavalry horse (shot in the head), a grain sack, and a carbine at the mouth of the Rosebud River. He conjectured that a soldier had escaped Custer's fight and rafted across the river, abandoning his played-out horse.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 120 men and women would come forward over the course of the next 70 years claiming they were "the lone survivor" of Custer's Last Stand.&lt;ref name="Custer Survivors 101"&gt;{{cite book| last=Harris| first=Ethan E.| title=Custer Survivors 101: The Impostor Roster| year=2012| publisher=Warrior's Quill |type=E-book| at=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon became so widespread that one historian remarked, "Had Custer had all of those who claimed to be 'the lone survivor' of his two battalions he would have had at least a brigade behind him when he crossed the Wolf Mountains and rode to the attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stewart| first=Edgar I.| title=Custer's Luck| year=1980| publisher=University of Oklahoma Press| location=Norman, OK| isbn=9780806116327| page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Finkel]], from [[Dayton, Washington]], had such a convincing story that historian Charles Kuhlman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lib.montana.edu/collect/spcoll/findaid/1043.html| title=Charles Kuhlman Papers, 1896–1959| publisher=University of Montana Library| accessdate=June 10, 2013| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221005946/http://www.lib.montana.edu/collect/spcoll/findaid/1043.html| archivedate=December 21, 2013| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed the alleged survivor, going so far as to write a lengthy defense of Finkel's participation in the battle.&lt;ref name="Kuhlman Finkel"&gt;{{cite book| last=Kuhlman| first=Charles| title=The Frank Finkel Story| year=1968| publisher=Citizen Printing Co.| location=Omaha, NE| page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Ellison—mayor of [[Medora, North Dakota]], and an amateur historian—also wrote a book in support of the veracity of Finkel's claim,&lt;ref name="Ellison Finkel"&gt;{{cite book| last=Ellison| first=Douglas W.| title=Sole Survivor: An Examination of the Frank Finkel Narrative| year=1983| publisher=North Plains Press| page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most scholars reject it.&lt;ref name=Boyes&gt;{{cite book| last=Boyes| first=William| title=No Custer Survivors: Or, The Unveiling of Frank Finkel| year=1977| publisher=WJBM Associates| page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunnally Hoax"&gt;{{cite book| last=Nunnally| first=Michael L.| title=The Frank Finkel Hoax: No Survivor of Custer's Last Stand| year=2008| publisher=Old Scout Books| page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost as soon as men came forward implying or directly pronouncing their unique role in the battle, there were others who were equally opposed to any such claims. [[Theodore Goldin]], a battle participant who later became a controversial historian on the event, wrote (in regards to Charles Hayward's claim to have been with Custer and taken prisoner):

&lt;blockquote&gt; The Indians always insisted that they took no prisoners. If they did—a thing I firmly believe—they were tortured and killed the night of the 25th. As an evidence of this I recall the three charred and burned heads we picked up in the village near the scene of the big war dance, when we visited the village with Capt. Benteen and Lieut. Wallace on the morning of the 27th... I'm sorely afraid, Tony, that we will have to class Hayward's story, like that of so many others, as pure, unadulterated B. S. As a clerk at headquarters I had occasion to look over the morning reports of at least the six troops at Lincoln almost daily, and never saw his name there, or among the list of scouts employed from time to time...I am hoping that some day all of these damned fakirs will die and it will be safe for actual participants in the battle to admit and insist that they were there, without being branded and looked upon as a lot of damned liars. Actually, there have been times when I have been tempted to deny that I ever heard of the 7th Cavalry, much less participated with it in that engagement...My Medal of Honor and its inscription have served me as proof positive that I was at least in the vicinity at the time in question, otherwise I should be tempted to deny all knowledge of the event.&lt;ref name="A Pretended Custer Survivor"&gt;{{cite web| title=A Pretended Custer Survivor: Another Attempt to Pose As a Survivor Punctured by the Regiment's Clerk| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=mdGv78FIKkEC&amp;dat=19260505&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en| publisher=The Big Horn Searchlight| accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The only documented and verified survivor of Custer's command (having been actually involved in Custer's part of the battle) was Captain Keogh's horse, [[Comanche (horse)|Comanche]]. The wounded horse was discovered on the battlefield by General Terry's troops, and although other cavalry mounts survived they had been taken by the Indians. Comanche eventually was returned to the fort and became the regimental mascot.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Badly wounded, the horse had been overlooked or left behind by the victors, who had taken the other surviving horses. Comanche was taken back to the steamer ''Far West'' and returned to Fort Abraham Lincoln to be nursed back to health.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other badly wounded horses were found and killed at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newwest.net/topic/article/comanche_the_horse_that_survived_the_battle_of_the_little_bighorn_part_2/C39/L39 |title=Comanche: The Horse that Survived the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Part 2 |last=Shanks |first=Jenny |date=June 26, 2007 |website=NewWest |access-date=15 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025010617/http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/comanche_the_horse_that_survived_the_battle_of_the_little_bighorn_part_2/C39/L39/ |archivedate=October 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Evan S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Comanche was reputed to be the only survivor of the Little Bighorn, but quite a few Seventh Cavalry mounts survived, probably more than one hundred, and there was even a yellow bulldog. Comanche lived on another fifteen years, and when he died, he was stuffed and to this day remains in a glass case at the University of Kansas. So, protected from moths and souvenir hunters by his humidity-controlled glass case, Comanche stands patiently, enduring generation after generation of undergraduate jokes. The other horses are gone, and the mysterious yellow bulldog is gone, which means that in a sense the legend is true. Comanche alone survived.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The site of the battle was first preserved as a United States [[U.S. National Cemetery|national cemetery]] in 1879 to protect the graves of the 7th Cavalry troopers. In 1946, it was re-designated as the ''Custer Battlefield [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]]'', reflecting its association with Custer. In 1967, Major Marcus Reno was re-interred in the cemetery with honors, including an eleven-gun salute. Beginning in the early 1970s, there was concern within the [[National Park Service]] over the name Custer Battlefield National Monument failing to adequately reflect the larger history of the battle between two cultures. Hearings on the name change were held in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] on June 10, 1991, and during the following months Congress renamed the site the ''Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument''.

United States memorialization of the battlefield began in 1879 with a temporary monument to the U.S. dead. In 1881, the current marble obelisk was erected in their honor. In 1890, marble blocks were added to mark the places where the U.S. cavalry soldiers fell.

Nearly 100 years later, ideas about the meaning of the battle have become more inclusive. The United States government acknowledged that Native American sacrifices also deserved recognition at the site. The 1991 bill changing the name of the national monument also authorized an Indian Memorial to be built near Last Stand Hill in honor of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. The commissioned work by native artist [[Colleen Cutschall]] is shown in the photograph at right. On Memorial Day 1999, in consultation with tribal representatives, the U.S. added two red granite markers to the battlefield to note where Native American warriors fell. As of December 2006, a total of ten warrior markers have been added (three at the Reno–Benteen Defense Site and seven on the Little Bighorn Battlefield).&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service website for the Little Bighorn Battlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Memorial, themed "Peace Through Unity" l is an open circular structure that stands {{convert|75|yd|abbr=off}} from the 7th Cavalry obelisk. Its walls have some of the names of Indians who died at the site, as well as native accounts of the battle. The open circle of the structure is symbolic, as for many tribes, the circle is sacred. The "spirit gate" window facing the Cavalry monument is symbolic as well, welcoming the dead cavalrymen into the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Indian Memorial Peace Through Unity – Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument (U.S. National Park Service)|url = http://www.nps.gov/libi/the-indian-memorial-peace-through-unity.htm|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-07|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150413060331/http://www.nps.gov/libi/the-indian-memorial-peace-through-unity.htm|archivedate = April 13, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benei Sión''', also known as '''Sabatarios''' and '''Cabañistas''' in [[Chile]], are an [[ethno-religious]] group that believe in the '''Iglesia del Nuevo Pacto''' (Church of the New Pact). The group originated in Chile where it had by 1994 around 6000 members but is present since the early 1950s in [[Argentina]] via [[chain migration]] where it had by 1994 3000 members. It has been proposed that the group derives from [[cryptojew]]s active in [[colonial Chile]]. While originating in the [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía Region]] of Chile the group deny to be [[Mapuche]] (Araucanian). One leader has been quoted saying "We are Jews and that's how we feel, because we have the same aspirations as the Jewish people".

Вып. № 1, 1997; Вып. № 2, 1997; Вып. № 2, Ташкент, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they returned to Bactria and built temples in honor of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Г.Пугаченкова Вклад «УзИскЭ» в познание художественного наследия Узбекистана. // Сб.

Ташкент, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Buddhism has been linked to his understanding, as an ideology of the urban population. [[Kanishka the Great]] confirmed as [[Mahayana Buddhism]] significantly simplified "way of salvation", which contributed to its mass.&lt;ref&gt;Ртвеладзе Э. Великий шелковый путь.

After the invasion [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], as well as during the Islamic expansion, Buddhism is losing the role of widespread and popular on the territory of Uzbekistan, religion, and by the 13th century disappeared almost completely as a result of the persecution of infidels during the reign of [[Khorezm]].&lt;ref&gt;Материалы Тохаристанской экспедиции.

'''{{PH wikidata|name}}''', officially the '''{{PH wikidata|official_name}}''', ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng {{PH wikidata|name}}}}),  is a {{PH wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}

It is one of the oldest municipalities in Luzon (founded on August 15, 1571), and has a land area of {{convert|4299|ha}}.{{PSGC detail|area}}

Cainta serves as the secondary gateway to the rest of Rizal province from [[Metro Manila]]. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, Cainta is now part of Manila's [[conurbation]], which reaches [[Cardona, Rizal|Cardona]] in its easternmost part, and is therefore one of the most urbanized towns.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} making it the second most populous municipality in the Philippines (after [[Rodriguez, Rizal]]), although there are efforts underway to convert it into a city. Its total assets amounting to Php 3,988,392,142.17 (as per 2017 [[Commission on Audit of the Philippines|Commission on Audit]] summary) makes it the richest municipality in the country.

Cainta faces different challenges especially with its boundary disputes with [[Pasig]] (Greenpark Village, Karangalan Village, St. Joseph Subdivision, Villarica Subdivision, Riverside, and Midtown Village), [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] (Greenland and eastern part of Cainta), and [[Antipolo]] (Valley Golf and Country Club, Valley View, and Palmera Heights)

==Geography==

Cainta is bounded on the north by [[Marikina City]] and [[Antipolo City]] but not bounded [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], on the west by [[Pasig City]], and on the east and south by [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]]. It lies in the Marikina Valley, is 10% rolling hills and 90% residential-industrial. It has the province's highest number of rivers and streams. Historians claim that Cainta's old geographical boundaries encompassed the mountain slopes of [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]].

===Barangays===
Cainta is politically subdivided into seven [[barangay]]s. In the mid 1990s, Cainta submitted a petition to the Rizal provincial government to consider a proposal for 18 additional barangays, to make a total of 25 barangays.  The proposal is still pending.

==Legend==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
{{see also|Hinduism in the Philippines|Religion in pre-colonial Philippines|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation|List of India-related topics in the Philippines}}

Legend has it that there was an old woman called "Jacinta" who was well known not only in her own native town but also in the neighboring towns. In her youth, she was  very popular because of her great beauty, kindness, and wealth. Although she was a member of a very rich clan, she showed generosity of heart to the poor. Hence, she became very much loved and respected.
Jacinta grew to be an old maid because after her sweetheart got sick and died, she never fell in love with anyone else. When her parents died and she was left alone in the house, she continued her charity work. She gave alms to the long line of beggars who came to her, and housed and took care of the orphans and children in the streets.

In her old age, she was still very popular and was fondly called "''Ka Inta''" ("''Ka''" referring to a term of respect for the elderly, as well as a term for the feeling of comradery or "kapwa" feeling for someone).

One Christmas Day, however, when the old and the young called on her to give their greetings, she was not by the window to welcome them. People wondered at her absence and shouted her name to call her attention but no one came to answer. Concerned, they went up the house and discovered the dead body of "Ka Inta" lying on the floor. Beside her were the piles of Christmas gifts she was preparing to give to her well-wishers that day. People far and wide grieved over her death. In memory of her goodness and her generosity, her native town was named after her and  was called "Cainta".

The Municipality's name may also have come from the Sanskrit word '''“kāṇṭha”''' [Kah-Uhn-Thaa] (कांथा), which means a narrow place or constriction. It also means ‘stem’ or ‘branch’ in [[Sanskrit literature]], describing the deeply forested tropical [[Wilderness]] which used to surround the area. During the period 1762-1764, during the various [[Anglo-Spanish War (1762–63)|Anglo-Spanish Wars]], 600 Sepoy (or native Indian) troops arrived in the Philippines as part of the military expedition of the [[East India Company]]. When the British troops withdrew, many of the Sepoys mutinied and refused to leave. Virtually all had taken Filipina brides (or soon did so). The region in and around the town still has many Sepoy descendants. During the 18th century, there was robust trade between Manila and the [[Coromandel Coast]] of [[Bengal]], involving Philippine exports of tobacco, silk, cotton, indigo, sugarcane and coffee. Sepoy troops from [[Madras]] (now [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]), [[British India]] also arrived with the British expedition and occupation between 1762 and 1764 during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The Indians left a culinary legacy in the spicy and highly seasoned dishes that are now part of mainstream Cainta cuisine. Cainta became part of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] (starting 1763), but separated in 1883 and incorporated with the district of [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]]. Cainta became an independent town in 1760.

==History==

===Spanish rule===
Founded on November 30, 1571, Cainta was a fiercely independent village that fought valiantly against the Spaniards but was later defeated and became a ''visita'' (annex) of Taytay in 1571 under the [[Jesuits]]. Changes in ecclesiastical administration made Cainta a part of Pasig under the Augustinians but it was deeded back to the Jesuits by the King of Spain in 1696. Cainta became a separate township in 1760.

After the death of [[Rajah Matanda]], Adelantado Miguel de Legaspi received word that two ships, San Juan and Espiritu Santo, had just arrived in [[Panay]] Island in the central Philippines from Mexico. One ship was under the command of Don Diego de Legaspi, his nephew, and the other of Juan Chacon. The two ships were in such disrepair when they arrived in Panay that one of them was not allowed to return to Mexico. Legaspi ordered that it be docked on the river of Manila. The Maestro de Campo was sent to Panay to oversee its transfer to Manila, with Juan de la Torre as captain.

To help spread the faith, several Augustinian friars were commissioned by Spain and were among the ship's passengers. One of them was Father Alonso de Alvarado, who had been in the [[Naval fleet|''armada'']] of Villalobos. Another was Father Agustin de Albuquerque, who became the first parish priest of Taal town, south of Manila. Some of the missionaries were sent to Cebu province in the central Philippines to accompany Father Martin de Rada the Prior. Four stayed to work in Pampanga province and the environs north and south of Manila, which included the then-village of Cainta.

===Conversion to Catholicism===

The chief religion is Roman Catholicism. When the Spaniards came they celebrated the feast of [[St. Andrew]] the Apostle and a mass was held in a chapel made of nipa palm branches and wood. Many people came to attend and consequently were baptized into the faith.

The Church of Cainta was completed in 1715. It was gutted during World War II. Only the outer walls and the facade remained which was repaired with a coat of Portland cement. In 1727, an image depicting Our Lady of Light was brought to Cainta from Sicily, Italy, and was among the structures destroyed by Japanese and the joint American and Filipino bombs. Except for the outer walls, now greatly renovated, hardly anything remains of the old church. Extensive damage was also caused by recurrent earthquakes and typhoons that plagued the Philippines. The natives helped in its restoration and the new building was completed on February 25, 1968 and blessed by Manila Cardinal Archbishop [[Rufino Jiao Santos]].

===The Battle of Cainta===

Meanwhile, Legaspi was determined to subjugate the people of Cainta and Taytay, a neighboring town. He sent his nephew Juan de Salcedo with a galleon (a small ship propelled by oars and sails) and 16 small boats accompanied by a hundred Spanish soldiers and many Visayas natives allied with them. Salcedo sailed on August 15, 1571, arriving in Cainta on the 20th. He sought peace from the villagers but the village chief, Gat-Maitan, responded arrogantly, told him the people of Cainta, unlike those of Manila, were not cowards, and would defend their village to the death. Confident in the defenses offered by their fort and the security of the site, they were joined by people from Taytay.

These two villages are on a plain on the shores of a river that flows from La Laguna and before arriving there divides in two large arms, both with abundant water. On its banks are found the two villages, half a league from each other, with the river passing through both before finally becoming one in a part of the terrain encircled by thick bamboo groves. These bamboos were tied together with ''liana'', turning them into a thick wall where the people had constructed two ramparts with their moats full of water. By the river, they had built strong bulwarks with wooden towers and good artillery, guarded by a large number of warriors armed with arrows, swords and other projectile-type arms.

Deciding to attack, Salcedo first sent Second Lieutenant Antonio de Carvajal with some escorts to reconnoiter the town and determine the weakest point where they could enter. Carvajal, wounded by an arrow in his arm, returned with the information that the weakest spot, the least fortified and with the easiest access was the other part of an arroyo on the side of La Laguna where many boats could be seen entering the river.

Salcedo ordered installed in the prow of the galley a stone-throwing mortar. He and his men then spent the night on shore, while 20 soldiers and numerous allies from Manila remained with Carvajal on the galley with orders that when they heard firing, they should proceed with the attack on the bulwarks and the houses in the town, while Salcedo and his men tried to enter through the wall by the arroyo. When they heard the sound of the bugle, the signal that they had taken the town, they were to stop firing.

After giving these instructions, Salcedo began his march and turned toward the river where the attack was to take place. He arrived in the arroyo and found it defended by a fistful of valiant Cainta men who started to fire arrows and hurl lances.

Taken by surprise, the soldiers without waiting for Salcedo's order attacked the rampart and were overwhelmed by a rain of arrows. Finding such tenacious resistance, they began to retreat and flee in disarray.

Salcedo berated his men harshly for having attacked without his orders. Observing that in the other part of the arroyo the rampart was lower, he ordered a skiff brought there and after beaching it, he ordered some of his soldiers to use it as passage to the other side and take a more elevated point from where they could fire at the defenders of the town.

With the defenders retreating, Salcedo and his men were able to approach the wall and breach it. The intrepid Gat-Maitan with his Cainta men came to close the breach, forcing Saavedra to back off.

In the meantime, the cannons of the galley destroyed the bulwarks and the houses in the town in a manner the people had not seen before. And the shouts of the 600 Visayans allied with the Spanish made the natives believe that the Spaniards were already inside the ''poblacion'' [town proper]. Because of this, the valiant defenders of the breach abandoned it and retreated to the center of the town.

Salcedo observed this from a distance and ordered the breach attacked again. This time, the Spaniards encountered little resistance. Led by Salcedo and with Saavedra carrying the Spanish banner, they succeeded in entering the town. Together with their soldiers, they advanced rapidly and shortly scaled the wall where a bloody battle was fought.

The Cainta men, encouraged by their chief Gat-Maitan, preferred to die rather than surrender. Having taken over the walls, the Spaniards climbed the towers and hoisted the Spanish banner. At the blare of the bugle, the cannons stopped firing from the galley.

Cainta became an independent town in 1760. During the brief British occupation of Luzon (1762–1763), part of its [[British Raj|British India]] troops known as [[Sepoy]]s lived and intermarried with the natives in one of the town's barrios. The Indian left a culinary legacy in the spicy and highly seasoned dishes that are now part of mainstream Cainta cuisine. Cainta became part of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] (starting 1763) but separated in 1883 and incorporated with the district of [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]].

===March 16, 1899===

Exequiel Ampil was assigned by Emilio Aguinaldo to liberate Cainta.

Maj. William P. Rogers, CO of the 3rd Battalion, 20th US Infantry Regiment, came upon the Filipinos in Cainta, about 1,000 strong, and forced them to retreat. He burned the town. Two Americans were killed and 14 wounded, while the Filipinos suffered about 100 killed and wounded.

Upon the approach of the Americans, [[Exequiel Ampil y Dela Cruz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1358578890850&amp;set=a.1351167705575.2046618.1422856792&amp;type=3|title=
General Infos... - James Frank Ampil Olaño - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Presidente Municipal of Cainta and a former Agente Especial of the Katipunan who had become a pronounced Americanista, strongly advised the Filipino soldiers to surrender. Instead, they shot him. Although wounded, Ampil managed to escape.

On March 3, 1902, major American newspapers, including the New York Times reported: “…Felizardo, at the head of  twenty-five men armed with rifles, entered the town of Cainta…and captured the Presidente of Cainta, Señor Ampil, and a majority of the police of the town. Señor Ampil has long been known as an enthusiastic American sympathizer, and it is feared that he may be killed by the enraged ladrones (thieves &amp; land grabbers). A strong force of constabulary has been sent to try to effect his release.” [Timoteo Pasay was the actual leader of the guerilla band that kidnapped Ampil on Feb. 28, 1902].

On March 4, 1902, near the hills of Morong town, Ampil found an opportunity to escape. A detachment of constabulary  was taken from the garrison at Pasig and stationed at Cainta for his protection, he survived the war. And upon retiring from his military and political career, Don Exequiel Ampil together with his wife Doña Priscila Monzon, applied and managed their vast estate from Tramo (Rosario, Pasig) to Cainta River (San Jose, Cainta) up to the Valley Golf Club (Mayamot, Antipolo) down to Ortigas Extension (San Isidro, Taytay). The lots were the old and the new Municipal Halls stands, were also part of his estate.

Their son Dr. Jesus Ampil also became a Mayor (grandfather of the Ampil Brothers);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampilbros.weebly.com/|title=Ampil Brothers Gamefarm|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose siblings where Lumen, Atty. Vicente (of Pasay City), Rosario &amp; Jose.


===Post-Spanish era===

In 1913, under the American rule, Cainta and [[Angono]] were consolidated with Taytay as one government entity. On January 1, 1914, it once again became an independent municipality and remained so to this day. Cainta is one of fourteen (14) municipalities of [[Rizal]] Province after the inclusion of other towns of what are now referred to as [[Antipolo]], [[Angono]], [[Binangonan]] and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]]. In 1942, Japanese Occupation troops entered Cainta. In 1942 to 1944, local guerrilla groups of the Hunters ROTC was the four-year main invasions in Cainta against the Japanese, when the guerrillas were retreating by the Japanese before the liberation. In 1945, local Filipino troops of the 4th, 42nd, 45th, 46th, 47th and 53rd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army and 4th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary started the liberation and captured Cainta and helped the guerrilla resistance fighters of the Hunters ROTC Guerrillas to fight against the Japanese and ended World War II.

===Liberation of Cainta===

===Conversion to Cityhood===

In late 2003, former Cainta mayor Nicanor Felix, with the rest of its Sangguniang Bayan members, unanimously approved a resolution for Cainta's cityhood bid. On that same year, on its annual fiesta, the Municipality had its theme "Cainta: Lungsod 2004", promoting its bid for cityhood.

But, on the contrary, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan ng Rizal denied the resolutiuon stating that "it must resolve first its boundary disputes with [[Pasig City]], [[Antipolo City]] and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]]".

However, in January 2010, current Rizal Governor Jun Ynares III now pushes the cityhood of Cainta and Taytay, due to the overabundance of jobs, amenities, and its people.

In turn, incumbent Congressman Joel Duavit of the 1st District filed and passed a Bill effectively creating a district composed of Cainta and Taytay. The Bill is now up at the committee level in the Senate.

The idea of converting Cainta into a highly urbanized city was again proposed for the second time in 2018 after failure in 2004.

===Seal===
The logo of Cainta – the emblem inside the double circle represents the flag of the Philippines in red, white and blue color. The three stars represent Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. The eight sun rays represent the eight provinces that started the revolt against the Spaniards. The buildings represent the different business establishments operating in the municipality. The ''suman sa ibus'', ''suman sa lihiya'' and ''suman antala'' represent the livelihood of its people; the same with bottled sweets made out of coconut milk called ''[[matamis na bao]]'', ''[[nata de coco]]'', ''caong'', beans and many others. The piglets represent the backyard hog raising, a small-scale industry.

==Transportation==

The main road of Cainta is Ortigas Avenue Extension, a heavily congested corridor that passes through the business district of [[Ortigas Center]] and leads to [[Mandaluyong City]] and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] in the west and the town of [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] and [[Antipolo City]] in the east. Another major road is '''Francisco P. Felix Avenue''' (formerly known as '''Imelda Avenue''') which runs across Ortigas Avenue Extension and connects the town to Marikina City to the north and Taytay to the south.  The point of intersection between these two main arterials is known simply as ''Junction''. A. Bonifacio Avenue, located in the town proper, is the town's most frequently traversed street. Traffic enforcers make their best to weaken the traffic situation in the areas of Junction, Karangalan, Parola and Brookside but the presence of these provided only minimal solution.

==Economy==
[[File:Rizaljf4181 05.JPG|thumb|Puregold Cainta]]

Cainta has a robust economy as evidenced by several commercial and industrial establishments that have sprouted. Cainta is the richest municipality in the country  with respect to Income Revenue growth.(based on 2010 COA Report). The town continues to attract businesses because of its proximity to [[Manila]] and the town's burgeoning population which mostly consists of hard-working and hospitable people. Cainta is the "richest municipality in the Philippines as evidence of numerous manufacturing firms here like [[Mitsubishi]] Motors Philippines, the largest car manufacturer in the country, the Monde M.Y. San Corporation, one of the nation's leading biscuit manufacturers, BF Construction Philippines, Ford Philippines, [[Motortrade]], Fortune Tobacco Corporation, Honda Cars Philippines, Hyundai Cainta, Rockbuilt Manufacturing Corporation, Cathay Pacific Steel Corporation, South Pacific Chemical Industry, The House Printers Corporation, and more.

===Native delicacies===

The most common livelihood in Cainta is the making of native delicacies, a tradition inherited from Antipolo, which is largely a cottage industry. Its native desserts are among the nation's best. Dating back to the 15th century, it became the town's principal source of income for more than four centuries. ''Suman'' (rice cake wrapped in banana leaf), ''latik'' (boiled down coconut milk used for glazing), [[coconut jam]] and the famous ''bibingka'', are but a few of the sweet delights that lure many visitors to this town.

During the 20th century, Cainta dazzled the whole country when it baked the biggest rice cake ever and the town became known as the "Bibingka Capital of the Philippines". ''Bibingka'' is believed to have been adapted from the Indian cuisine, an influence from its Sepoy population. It comes from the Indian word [[bebinca]] also known as ''bibik'', a dessert made of flour, coconut milk,  and egg. The Philippine version is made of rice flour, coconut milk and salted duck eggs. Butter and sugar are used for glazing after cooking and before serving.

==Culture==

During Cainta's modernization period, traditions became more glamorous, most especially during the Lenten season. The most noteworthy rituals are the  ''Cenakulo'' (a stage play of the passion and death of Christ) and the ''Ang Pagpapapako'' or ''Penetencia'' (a re-enactment of the crucifixion of Christ).

===The Cenakulo===

The ''Senakulo'' in Cainta dates back to 1904. It originated from Barrio Dayap (the entire area now includes Barangays Sta. Rosa, Sto Niño and Sto. Domingo). At that time the population consisted of a small group of residents who were mostly related to each other. Since most of the people believed that calamities were brought in by evil spirits, they decided to put up cross on a vacant lot to counter them. The barrio people paid homage to the cross by lighting it every night. One memorable incident happened during the Lenten season when a strange fragrance supposedly emanated from the cross. The news spread out not only in the barrio but also in the entire town of Cainta.

Believing in the mystery of the cross, many people in Barrio Dayap and the whole town of Cainta have since then vowed to read the ''Pasyon'' (Seven Last Words of Christ) every Lenten season. This has been enriched by an actual portrayal of the Passion of Christ on the streets which was formerly called "Officio". Many problems have been allegedly solved and illnesses cured through the cross as many people continuously believed.

Over the years the followers of the cross have multiplied rapidly. To give deeper meaning to their devotion and showcase their religiosity, they broached the idea of staging the ''Pasyon''. The first stage play was held a few years later, although initially it was limited in scope. It became so popular that the presentation was expanded to include stories from the Old Testament and other stages in the life of Christ and has become known as the ''Cenakulo''. The venue was transferred to an open field in 1966 to accommodate a larger audience.

Krus Sa Nayon, Inc. (KSNI) was established as early as 1900 during and after Spanish era. The group was also known for its extravagant preparation and passion play every night of the Holy Week period. The KSNI cenakulo play was previously held at the Jaika Compound beside the municipal building and Francisco P. Felix Memorial National High School. To date, the play is held at the stage beside the municipal ground, alongside the One Cainta Police Headquarters and One Cainta Fire Department.

Samahang Nazareno Inc. was organized in 1960, developed and enhanced the various aspects of ''cenakulo''. The local Roman Catholic parishioner gave the association its moral and financial support for it believed that it was an effective means of imparting its Christian message to the public.

The '''Cherokee calendar''' is defined by the seasonal round of ceremonies practiced by the [[Cherokee people]].  Although a modern calendar year comprises 12 months, there are actually 13 cycles or phases of the moon in the Cherokee calendar.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  The seasonal round of ceremonies is considered a necessary spiritual element for social cohesion and encourage gatherings among the [[Cherokee clans]] and [[Cherokee]] society.

[[File:QED 20150425 0398.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Matt Dillahunty]], a well known counter-apologist]]
Within [[criticism of religion]], '''counter-apologetics''' is a field of thought that criticizes religious [[apologetics]]. Every religious apologist criticizes the defense of other religions, though the term counter-apologetics is frequently applied to criticism of religion in general by [[freethought|freethinkers]] and atheists. Luke Muehlhauser, the former executive director of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], defines counter-apologetics as "a response to [[Christian apologetics]]...examining the claims and tactics of Christian apologists and then equipping [a thinker] with [[skepticism|skeptical]] responses to them".&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2010/&gt;

In 2006, the [[New Atheism|New Atheist]] television host and blogger [[Matt Dillahunty]] founded ''Iron Chariots'', a counter-apologetics encyclopedia (the name is derived from {{Bibleverse|Judges|1:19|KJV}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Adam Lee|publisher=[[Patheos]]|title=Little-Known Bible Verses VII: Iron Chariots|date= November 4, 2007 |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2007/11/iron-chariots/}}&lt;/ref&gt;), using [[MediaWiki]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=User:Sans Deity|publisher=Iron Chariots - the counter-apologetics wiki.|author=Matt Dillahunty (username Sans Deity)|authorlink=Matt Dillahunty|url=http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Matt_Dillahunty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian apologist and blogger J.W. Wartick has responded to Iron Chariots with posts he termed "counter-counter apologetics".&lt;ref name=Wartick/&gt;

On his blog, as part of his "why they don't believe" series ("why they reject Christianity and/or theism"), Christian apologist and theologian [[Randal Rauser]] invited an anonymous blogger who calls himself Counter Apologist to explain his counter-apologetics, and Rauser provided his own counter-arguments.&lt;ref name=Rauser/&gt;

The [[New Testament]] is well understood to contain apologetics,{{sfn|Dulles|2005|p=1}} but counter-apologetics also appears in Christian theology. Theologian [[John Milbank]] has written in a 2012 work that Christianity "makes room for" counter-apologetics by not being a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] system of thought,{{sfn|Milbank|2012|ps=&amp;nbsp;"[T]he apophatic Christian ''apologia'', out of its own internal structure, always makes room for the counter-apologetics for the quotidian ... since Christianity is not Gnosticism or Marcionism, its qualified world refusal will, even at the ''eschaton'', allow the world a place..."|p=19}} and notes the "authentic Christian fusion of apologetic and counter-apologetic" as it stands in opposition to the anti-materialist nihilism of Browning's [[Caliban upon Setebos|Caliban]].{{sfn|Milbank|2012|p=24}} Likewise, Biblical scholar and theologian  Loveday Alexander has written that analysis of the Bible's books Luke and Acts by two other authors shows they contain counter-apologetic features perhaps to convey a pro-Roman perspective to the reader.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|ps=&amp;nbsp;"...Luke-Acts contains too many counter-apologetic features to impress a Roman reader ... and therefore proposes a reverse reading of the narrative as an ''apologia pro imperio'': it embodies a pro-Roman perspective to a church harboring anti-Roman sentiment..."|p=24}}

The '''''Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus''''' is a lost early Christian text in Greek describing the dialogue of a converted Jew, Jason, and an Alexandrian Jew, Papiscus. The text is first mentioned, critically, in the ''True Account'' of the anti-Christian writer [[Celsus]] (c. 178 CE), and therefore would have been contemporary with the surviving, and much more famous, Dialogue between the convert from paganism [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Dialogue with Trypho|Trypho the Jew]].

==Sources==
The main source is Origen in his ''Against Celsus'' where he criticises Celsus' selective use of the text.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Thomas Cruttwell]], ''A Literary History of Early Christianity: The apostolic fathers''  1893 "Celsus, who read it, dismisses it with the contemptuous remark "that it is worthy not so much of laughter as of pity and indignation." 3 Origen does not offer a very warm defence of the writer, but he deprecates Celsus' criticism..."&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|he has chosen one that is worthless, which although it could be of some help to the simple-minded multitude in respect of their faith, certainly could not impress the more intelligent, saying: "I know a work of this sort a Controversy between one Papiscus and Jason..." ... Nevertheless, I could wish that everyone who hears Celsus' clever rhetoric asserting that the book entitled 'A Controversy between Jason and Papiscus about Christ' deserves not laughter but hatred, were to take the little book into his hands and have the patience and endurance to give attention to its contents. .... In it a Christian is described as disputing with a Jew from the Jewish scriptures and as showing that the prophecies about the Messiah fit Jesus; and the reply with which the other man opposes the argument is at least neither vulgar nor unsuitable to the character of a Jew. (''Contra Celsum'' 4:52)&lt;ref&gt;Translation: Contra Celsum [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] 1965 2nd ed. 1980 {{ISBN|0-521-29576-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Origen's lukewarm defence of the text, his mention of the vigorous reply of Papiscus, and the Dialogue's use by Celsus, may explain the subsequent non-survival of the text. The loss of the document removes a potentially significant record of a 2nd-century Jewish Christian's arguments before later theological developments in the Christian church.

[[Jerome]] mentions the Dialogue twice. In Commentary on Galatians, in connection with he who is hanged on a tree is accursed of God (Commentary on Galatians, 2.3.13) and the Dialogue mis-citing Genesis 1:1 as "In the Son," (instead of "In the Beginning"), "God created the heaven and the earth." (Questions in Genesis, 2.507).
{{quotation|
* "I Remember in the Dispute between Jason and Papiscus, which is composed in Greek, to have found it written: `The execration of God is he that is hanged.'" (Commentary on Galatians 3:13)
* "In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth. The majority believe, as it is affirmed also in the Dispute between Jason and Papiscus, and as Tertullian in his book Against Praxeas contends, and as Hilarius too, in his exposition of one of the Psalms, declares, that in the Hebrew it is: `In the Son, God made the heaven and the earth.' But that this is false, the nature of the case itself proves." (Questions in Genesis)&lt;ref&gt;Translation: Sir [[James Donaldson (classical scholar)|James Donaldson]] ''Ante-Nicene Christian Library - The Works of Lactantius (Vol.2) with the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs'' 1871 Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The third source is a letter (mistakenly included in the works of [[Cyprian]]) to a certain "Bishop Vigilius" (not [[Vigilius of Thapsus]]{{sup|[[:de:Vigilius von Thapsus|(de)]]}}) describing a translation from Greek to Latin by an otherwise unknown Celsus, (given the sobriquet Celsus Africanus by scholars), which also describes the Dialogue, including the information that Jason himself was a convert from Judaism, and the ending - that Papiscus is convinced and asks for baptism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Lukyn Williams]], ''Adversus Judaeos. A Bird's-Eye View of Christian Apologiae until the Renaissance,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1935 p428 "so called to distinguish him from his earlier namesake, translated the Dialogue into Latin, and tells us that Jason was a Hebrew Christian and Papiscus an Alexandrian Jew, and that Papiscus was won over by Jason and was baptised."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Allen Giles]] ''The writings of the early Christians of the second century'' 1857 Page 211 "That noble, memorable and glorious result of the discussion between Jason, a Hebrew Christian, and Papiscus, an Alexandrian Jew, comes into my mind; how the obstinate hardness of the Jewish heart was softened by Hebrew admonition and gentle chiding; and the teaching of Jason, on the giving of the Holy Ghost, was victorious in the heart of Papiscus. Papiscus, thereby brought to a knowledge of the truth, and fashioned to the fear of the Lord through the mercy of the Lord Himself, both believed in Jesus Christ the Son of God, and entreated Jason that he might receive the sign."&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent discovery in St. Catherine's monastery at Mount Sinai provides more text quoted from the Dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;François Bovon and John M. Duffy, "A New Greek Fragment of Ariston of Pella's ''Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus'', Harvard Theological Review 105.4 October 2012, pp 457-465.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and authorship==
Lahey (2007) dates the Dialogue to c. 140 and considers a date of c. 160 unlikely since the Dialogue is believed to be a source or model for the Dialogue with Trypho, which is itself dated c. 160.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lahey. ''Evidence for Jewish Believers in Christian-Jewish Dialogues through the Sixth Century''. in ''Jewish Believers in Jesus: The Early Centuries'' (9780801047688):  eds. Oskar Skarsaune and Reidar Hvalvik 2007 pp. 585-591.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (7th century, or possibly 6th century if mainly the work of [[John of Scythopolis]] as suggested by [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] Das Scholienwerk des Johannes von Scythopolis, in Scholastik 15 (1940): 16-38, revised in Kosmische Liturgie 1961, translated 2003. Per Brian E. Daley Cambridge Companion to Hans Urs von Balthasar p206.&lt;/ref&gt;), notes that [[Clement of Alexandria]], in the (now lost) sixth book of his ''Hypotyposes'' ascribes the Dialogue to [[Luke the Evangelist]], though Maximus himself ascribes the authorship to Ariston of Pella, in Latin [[Aristo Pellaeus]], an author whom [[Eusebius]] mentions in connection with [[emperor Hadrian]] and [[Simon bar Kokhba]].&lt;ref&gt;Maximus, Scholia on The Mystical Theology, ascribed to Dionysius the Areopagite, Chapter 1 "I have found this expression Seven heavens also in the Dispute between Papiscus and Jason, written by Aristo of Pella, which Clement of Alexandria, in the sixth book of the Outlines,3 says was composed by Saint Luke."&lt;/ref&gt; No further trace of an attribution to Luke or Ariston is extant. Since the Dialogue was known to [[Celsus]], [[Origen]], [[Jerome]] and the later Latin translator "Celsus Africanus," none of whom names an author, the testimony of Maximus is now disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], [[Emil Schürer]], [[Geza Vermes]],  ''The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ''  1973 p38 "Since the Dialogue was known to Celsus, Origen, Jerome and the Latin translator as being anonymous (for none of them names the author), it is very questionable whether the testimony of Maximus Confessor describing Ariston as the author deserves any credit"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
[[F. C. Conybeare]] proposed the hypothesis (1898&lt;ref&gt;F. C. Conybeare ''The Dialogues of Athanasius and Zacchaeus and of Timothy and Aquila,'' Oxford. 1898. 45. Ibid.. p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;) that two later traditions, the [[Dialogue of Athanasius and Zacchaeus]] (Greek, 4th century) and the [[Dialogue of Timothy and Aquila]] (Greek, 6th century), were based on an earlier text, and identified that text as the Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus.&lt;ref&gt;Sébastien Morlet ''La "démonstration évangélique" d'Eusèbe de Césarée'' 2009 "Dans le même temps, FC Conybeare se fit lui aussi le défenseur de l'hypothèse «Jason et Papiscus ». En 1898, il suggéra que le Dialogue de Timothée et Aquila et le Dialogue d'Athanase et Zacchée étaient deux recensions différentes d'un "&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis was not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;William Varner ''Ancient Jewish-Christian dialogues: Athanasius and Zacchaeus, Simon and Theophilus, Timothy and Aquila: introductions, texts, and translations'' E. Mellen Press, 2004 "This work provides the texts and translations of three ancient Jewish-Christian dialogues: The Dialogue of Athanasius and Zacchaeus (Greek, 4th c.); The [[Dialogue of Simon and Theophilus]] (Latin, 5th c.); and The Dialogue of Timothy and Aquila (Greek, 6th c.). This is the first published translation of each of these texts. An introduction discusses the context of these dialogues in the "Contra Judaeos" literature of the early church and also explores the question of whether or not they"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Divinapastora2014md.jpg|Divina Pastora (2014)|thumb]]
'''Divina Pastora''' (English title: ''Divine Shepherdess'') is a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus, with a lamb at her side. It is considered to be one of the most important religious icons of Venezuela. Divina Pastora is the patron saint of the city of [[Barquisimeto]] and of the Venezuelan National Militia. The image dates from 1735. Divina Pastora is celebrated in a procession on January 14 of each year,&lt;ref name="Domínguez1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Domínguez|first=Roberto|title=Pioneros de Pentecostés en el mundo de habla hispana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8NsD31PhVhcC&amp;pg=PA64|year=1990|publisher=Editorial Clie|language=Spanish|isbn=978-84-7645-393-3|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a massive [[Marian devotions|Marian]] procession occurs, considered to be one of the largest in the world, attracting thousands of pilgrims.&lt;ref name="Anselmi2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anselmi|first=Manuel|title=Chavez's Children: Ideology, Education, and Society in Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIG8mEh_NJQC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7391-6525-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is removed from its shrine and is carried on the main streets of Barquisimeto in a procession which starts at the [[Iglesia de la Divina Pastora (Santa Rosa)|Iglesia de la Divina Pastora]] in [[Santa Rosa, Venezuela|Santa Rosa]] until it reaches the [[Barquisimeto Cathedral]]. This procession is unlike other mass Marian celebrations in the world, where the image does not leave its temple. This procession occurs due to the devotion the people of Barquisimeto have towards it as gratitude towards saving the city from a cholera outbreak that occurred in the city in the 19th century. In 2013, 3,000,000 faithful honored the Divina Pastora.&lt;ref name=zenit2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela: Tres millones de fieles honraron a la Divina Pastora|url=http://www.zenit.org/es/articles/venezuela-tres-millones-de-fieles-honraron-a-la-divina-pastora|accessdate=10 January 2015|publisher=Zenit|date=17 January 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Divina Pastora statue is enshrined in the Iglesia de la Divina Pastora in the village of Santa Rosa, which is on the outskirts of Barquisimeto. During the annual procession, it travels approximately {{convert|5|miles}} to the Barquisimeto Cathedral.

==Background==
According to the history books,{{Which|date=August 2009}} this tradition comes from [[Seville]], [[Spain]]. A [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[friar]], Isidore of Seville, had a dream in which he saw an image of the Divina Pastora. Days later, he gave to the artist [[Alonso Miguel de Tovar]], a detailed description of his vision, so that he could paint it. The painting of the virgin with pastoral hat, covered by a blue mantle, holding a boy in her left hand and a lamb in her right one, was called "Divina Pastora de Almas". Later, the sculptor [[Francisco Ruiz Gijón|Francisco Antonio Ruiz Gijón]], made a life-sized [[sculpture]] of the ''Divina Pastora'', which was carried in its first procession in 1705.

==History==
The devotion to the ''Divina Pastora'' in Venezuela, dates from 1736, when the parish priest of the town of Santa Rosa commissioned a sculptor to make a statue of the [[Immaculate Conception]]. Unexpectedly, the figure that was delivered was of the Divina Pastora. The priest wanted to return it, but the packing crate could not be lifted. The whole town took this as a sign that the statue wanted to remain in Santa Rosa. In 1855, the status of the ''Divina Pastora'' as the patron saint of the Venezuelan state of [[Lara (state)|Lara]] was further established, when a [[cholera]] epidemic occurred, striking a great number of families in Barquisimeto. Desperate, they implored the Divina Pastora for help. It is said that Father Jose Macario Yépez, parish priest of the ''La Concepción'' church of Barquisimeto, offered himself before the Virgin, to be the last victim of the disease. Some accounts say that the priest died six months later and that the epidemic then left the city; others indicate that his supplications stopped the epidemic immediately. The January 14th procession commemorates this event. In 2011, a group of vandals destroyed part of the Divina Pastora monument. The heads of sheep were decapitated and the face of the Virgin was hit by a bullet. Other images in the town were also vandalized with paint or destroyed.&lt;ref name=eltiempo2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Pintan de rojo otro mural de la Divina Pastora en el estado Lara|url=http://eltiempo.com.ve/venezuela/religion/pintan-de-rojo-otro-mural-de-la-divina-pastora-en-el-estado-lara/23124|accessdate=10 January 2015|publisher=El Tiempo|date=2 June 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procession==
[[File:Procesionpastora.jpg|thumbnail|left|Procession]]
Each January 14, the statue is carried by 6 to 10 men and women, accompanied by a procession of more than 2 million people, some barefoot and carrying crosses, from the Church of Santa Rosa, in the village of Santa Rosa near the city, to the Metropolitan Cathedral of Barquisimeto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.venezuelatuya.com/occidente/catedral_barquisimeto.htm | title=Catedral Metropolitana de Barquisimeto | language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a festive occasion, with countless street vendors selling anything from food to liquor and small religious figurines along the route that snakes through the city. Every year the Virgin is dressed differently by a local fashion designer and Her gown is donated by devotees paying penance. During the next couple of months, on her return trip, she stops at other churches in Barquisimeto, arriving back to Santa Rosa in time for [[Palm Sunday]].

On January 14 of each year, there is in Lara state a procession in honor of the Divine Shepherdess, in which people move the image from the church in the village of Santa Rosa to the Metropolitan Cathedral of Barquisimeto, this route is a little more than 7.5&amp;nbsp;km. kicking off with the last Mass in the outskirts of the temple of Santa Rosa at 10:00 am. The Virgin pilgrimage begins at approximately 11:30 am; the procession lasts nearly 7 hours, taking the traditional stop at the square Macario Yepez. Culminating in the arrival Mass celebrated far and wide Avenida Venezuela, having different cultural and musical acts ending a day full of fervor and faith. Then the "Shepherdess" visits the 52 parishes of the city, 3 and 2 Churches Vicarías Subsidiaries, and then is taken back to their sanctuary, where it remains until the next January 14. This is the first major religious procession in Latin America.

This celebration is one of the most important religious icons of Venezuela, is one of the most followed in the country. It is a festive occasion, with countless street vendors selling anything from food to liquor and small religious figurines along the route that snakes through the city. Every year the virgin is dressed differently by a local designer.

==Veneration==
The [[1812 Caracas earthquake|earthquake of March 26, 1812]] (which devastated the cities of [[Caracas]], Barquisimeto, [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]], [[El Tocuyo]] and [[San Felipe, Yaracuy|San Felipe]]), destroyed the temple of the Divina Pastora, but the sculpture remained intact, reinforcing the belief of the faithful that the Virgin wanted to stay to protect them.

The faith of devotees was also strengthened in 1855 after the break out in Venezuela of a terrible cholera epidemic that decimated many families from Barquisimeto. The disease lingered, in spite of medicine, laments and prayers, and the desperate people decided as a last resort to walk in procession through the streets of Barquisimeto to the Divina Pastora, to implore her mercy, which was supposedly granted, as the epidemic ceased thereafter.

'''Eleanor "Ray" Bone''' (15 December 1911 - 21 September 2001) who also went under the [[craft name]] '''Artemis''', was an influential figure in the [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. She claimed to have been initiated in 1941 by a couple of hereditary witches in [[Cumbria]]. She later met and became friends with [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], and was initiated into [[Wicca]], becoming the High Priestess in one of his covens. She was a friend of several important figures in Wicca during the modern Witchcraft revival, including "[[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]]", [[Jack Bracelin]], [[Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)|Patricia Crowther]], [[Doreen Valiente]] and [[Idries Shah]]. Bone was a close confidant of Gardner's initiator Dafo, and she reported that the [[New Forest coven]] was a hereditary coven that followed the old ways of the [[Hampshire]] region, and that they traced their origins to the time of the death of King [[William Rufus]] in the [[Normans|Norman]] era.&lt;ref name="HexObit"&gt;[http://www.hexarchive.com/obituary/eleanor.htm Eleanor Bone obituary] from hexArchive.com. Retrieved 2007-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HexInterview"&gt;[http://www.hexarchive.com/wicca/eleanorbone.htm Fragment of an interview with Eleanor Bone] from hexArchive.com. Retrieved 2007-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone was regarded by some as the "Matriarch of British Witchcraft".&lt;ref name="HexObit"/&gt; She founded many covens, among them there were two which were particularly successful: the one in south London in the early 1960s and the one in [[Brighton]].&lt;ref name="eleanorbone.org"&gt;http://eleanorbone.org/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; Among her initiatory down-line in London are Madge and Arthur Worthington, who went on to found the well-known Whitecroft line of [[Gardnerian Wicca]].&lt;ref name="eleanorbone.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewica.co.uk/Elders.htm Elders of the Wica]. Retrieved 2007-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1966 Bone and Patricia Crowther combined to denounce [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], whom they accused of having an invalid initiation. According to [[Ronald Hutton]], his response was to claim an entirely independent, traditional line of descent, leading ultimately to the appearance of [[Alexandrian Wicca]] as an entity separate from [[Gardnerian Wicca]].

There is some confusion over the spelling of Ray Bone's preferred first name: many modern authors and websites give it as 'Rae', possibly in confusion with [[Rae Beth]]. A 1964 article and photograph from the UK magazine 'Tit-Bits' gives the authoritative spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Banks [http://www.thewica.co.uk/Ray%20Bone1.htm ''As a Matron and as a Witch''], interview with Ray Bone, Tit-Bits, week ending 6 June 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom}}
The [[Constitution of Bulgaria|constitution]] provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributed to the generally free practice of religion. However, the constitution designates [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] as the "traditional" religion, exempting it from having to register in court as required for all other religious groups.

The government generally respected the religious freedom of registered religious groups. There were some concerns that the government did not proactively intervene to prevent [[societal abuses]]. There also were continuing reports of intolerance from police and local authorities during the reporting period.

There were continued reports of societal abuses or [[religious discrimination|discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice]]. Discrimination, [[harassment]], and general public intolerance of some religious groups remained an intermittent problem. There was an increasing number of anti-Semitic incidents and vandalism against mosques.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Bulgaria}}

The country has an area of {{convert|42855|sqmi|km2}} square miles and a population of 7.6 million. Eighty-five percent of the population identifies itself as [[Orthodox Christian]]. Orthodox Christianity, Hanafi Sunni Islam, Judaism, and Catholicism are generally understood as holding a historical place in the country's culture. Muslims comprise the largest minority, estimated at 13 percent. Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include Catholics, Armenian Christians, Jews, evangelical Protestants, and others. There are 107 registered religious groups in addition to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (BOC).

Some religious minorities are concentrated geographically. The [[Rhodope Mountains]] (along the country's southern border with Greece) are home to many Muslims, including ethnic Turks, [[Romani people|Roma]], and "[[Pomaks]]" (descendants of Slavic Bulgarians who converted to Islam under Ottoman rule). Ethnic Turkish and Roma Muslims also live in large numbers in the northeast of the country and along the Black Sea coast. More than half of the country's Roman Catholics are located in the region around Plovdiv. The majority of the country's small Jewish community lives in [[Sofia]], [[Rousse]], and along the Black Sea coast. Protestants are more widely dispersed throughout the country. Areas with large Roma populations tend to have some of the highest percentages of Protestants.

According to a 2005 report of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], only 50 percent of the six million citizens who identify themselves as Orthodox Christians participate in formal religious services. The same survey found that 90 percent of the country's estimated 70,000 Catholics regularly engage in public worship. Approximately 30 percent of Catholics belong to the Eastern Rite Uniate Church. The majority of Muslims, estimated to number 750,000, are Sunni; 50,000 are classified as Shi'a. The Jewish community is estimated at 3,500 and evangelical Protestants at 50,000. The report also noted that more than 100,000 citizens practice "nontraditional" beliefs. (Orthodox Christianity, Hanafi Sunni Islam, Judaism, and Catholicism are generally understood to be "traditional" faiths.) Forty percent of these "nontraditional" practitioners are estimated to be Roma.

Statistics reported by the Council of Ministers Religious Confessions Directorate reported slightly different figures, listing nearly 1 million Muslims and 150,000 evangelical Protestants, as well as 20,000 to 30,000 Armenian Christians and approximately 3,000 Jews.

==Status of religious freedom==
===Legal and policy framework===
The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributed to the generally free practice of religion. The government generally enforces these provisions, and citizens have the right to sue the government for violations of religious freedom.

The 2002 Denominations Act allows private religious exercise if members of the religious community are the only persons present, and public religious exercise if the exercise is also open to persons not belonging to the respective religious community.

The constitution stipulates that Eastern Orthodox Christianity, represented by the BOC, is the traditional religion. The 2002 Denominations Act designates the Metropolitan of Sofia as the BOC's patriarch and establishes the BOC as a legal entity, exempting it from court registration mandatory for all other religious groups that wish to acquire national legal recognition. The state budget allocated $1.8 million (three million leva) for registered religious groups. Of the total amount, $1.4 million (2.3 million leva) was allocated for the BOC, $113,000 (180,000 leva) for the Muslim community, $25,000 (40,000 leva) for the Armenian Apostolic Church, $18,000 (30,000 leva) for the Jewish community, and $25,000 (40,000 leva) for other registered denominations.

To receive national legal recognition, denominations applied for official court registration, which was generally granted. The Council of Ministers' Religious Confessions Directorate, formerly responsible for the registration of religious groups, provides "expert opinions" on registration matters upon request of the court. All applicants have the right to appeal negative registration decisions to the court of appeals. The 2002 Denominations Act does not require local formal registration of denominations, although in the past some local authorities insisted that branches register locally. Some concerns remained that the act does not adequately specify the consequences of failure to register.

The government observes the following religious holidays as national holidays: Orthodox Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter. In addition, the government respects the holidays of non-Orthodox religious groups, such as Muslim, Catholic, Jewish, evangelicals, and Baha'i, and grants their members nonworking days.

The constitution prohibits the formation of political parties along religious lines, but there were concerns that some parties exploited religious problems for political purposes.

The law allows the publication of religious media and the distribution of religious literature. However, some municipal ordinances require local permits for literature distribution in public places.

Public schools offer an optional religious education course that covers Christianity and Islam. The course examines the historical, philosophical, and cultural aspects of religion and introduces students to the moral values of different religious groups. All officially registered religious groups can request that their religious beliefs be included in the course's curriculum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The government does not permit religious headdresses on official photos for national identity documents.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
The government generally respected religious freedom in practice; however, it did not apply existing laws on religious issues consistently.

A longstanding dispute over the leadership of the Muslim community continued during the reporting period. A 2008 Muslim conference elected Mustafa Alish Hadji as chief mufti. Rival Islamic leader Nedim Gendzhev appealed the 2008 conference alleging that Hadji had forged the denominations' bylaws to convene it. In August 2009 the Sofia appellate court ruled in Gendzhev's favor and annulled the results of the 2008 conference. On May 12, 2010, the Supreme Court of Cassation rejected an appeal filed by Hadji, thus confirming the 2009 decision that annulled his registration as chief mufti. The May Supreme Court decision reinstated Gendzhev, who holds the latest valid legal registration dating back to 1996. The court previously annulled the Muslim conferences held in 1997, 2000, and 2005. In October 2009 another Muslim conference reelected Hadji as chief mufti. The court decision on Hadji 's request to register the 2009 conference was suspended, awaiting the Supreme Court decision, and was pending at the end of the reporting period. Hadji and his supporters staged protests against Gendzhev, who they claim stole $500,000 (800,000 leva) when the court temporarily reinstated him to the Chief Mufti 's Office in 2006.

During the reporting period, the Jewish Center Chabad Lubavitch filed a new application for court registration, which was pending. The court rejected its earlier request in January 2009 holding that the group had violated article 27 of the Denominations Act by operating a synagogue and a kindergarten without the consent of the registered Jewish religious organization and thus in violation of the law. Article 27 requires all nonprofit legal entities seeking to promote an already registered denomination to receive the consent of that denomination.

Some "nontraditional" groups continued to face discrimination and prejudice from local authorities in certain localities, despite obtaining a national registration with the Sofia City Court. Article 19 of the 2002 Denominations Act states that nationally registered religious groups may have local branches. The law requires notification, although some municipalities claimed that it requires formal local registration. On November 3, 2009, police officers disrupted a gathering of Jehovah's Witnesses in Sandanski and requested proof of local registration by the municipality.

Some municipal regulations restricted certain forms of proselytizing and prohibited the distribution of religious literature by groups that were not locally registered. There were continuing reports of enforcement of these rules in Burgas, Gabrovo, Dobrich, Haskovo, Varna, Plovdiv, and Pleven. Jehovah's Witnesses voiced concerns over an increasing number of instances in which police officers or municipal guards stopped and fined missionaries for engaging persons in religious conversations. On April 24, 2010, police fined a member of Jehovah's Witnesses in Dobrich for organizing a public religious meeting without a permit. On March 30, 2010, police officers issued a warning to three Jehovah's Witnesses in Plovdiv prohibiting them from preaching from house to house. On March 16, 2010, police fined a member of Jehovah's Witnesses in Varna for distributing propaganda materials without a municipal permit.

Both Jehovah's Witnesses and the Muslim community continued to report problems with obtaining construction permits for new prayer houses and mosques. The construction of a mosque in Burgas was still suspended at the end of the reporting period from March 2009, when the local authorities required a separate permit for the mosque's minaret. On December 4, 2009, the administrative court in Varna annulled a 2001 change in the zoning plan, which allowed the construction of a religious building, thus invalidating the Jehovah's Witnesses' 2005 construction permit. The Jehovah's Witnesses' appeal of the decision before the Supreme Administrative Court was pending at the end of the reporting period. Also pending was their request for the reissuing of a construction permit for a prayer house in Gabrovo. Local authorities halted the construction of the prayer house in February 2009, claiming that the Jehovah's Witnesses had illegally erected a concrete fence at the site. Jehovah's Witnesses demolished the fence in March 2009 and paid the fine, but their request to resume construction remained unanswered at the end of the reporting period.

There were no indications that the government discriminated against members of any religious group in restitution of nationalized properties from the communist period. However, the BOC, the Catholic Church, the Muslim and Jewish communities, and several Protestant denominations complained that some of their confiscated properties had not been returned.

Despite a decade-old court decision in its favor, the Jewish community was unable to regain possession of a state-run hospital in central Sofia until May 2009, when the Ministry of Health made the premises available and the hospital was relocated to another building. Prior to the relocation, the hospital's management contested in court the Jewish community's ownership over the building. On March 5, 2009, the court terminated the case based on a letter from the Health Ministry confirming the relocation, but the hospital management's appeal of the court decision was pending at the end of the reporting period. This paved the way for the Jewish community to take physical possession of the building, although its ownership remained contested. The pending court case made it difficult for them to profitably use this property.

===Abuses of religious freedom===
The resolution of a case concerning the [[Bulgarian Alternative Synod|Alternative Orthodox Synod]] and the 2004 forceful expulsion of its members from their parishes remained pending at the end of the reporting period. In January 2009 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the government had violated the religious rights of the Alternative Synod members and advised the parties to negotiate a mutually agreeable compensation for damages. The government appealed the ruling, since the BOC leadership refused to negotiate with the claimants who were called to apologize for what the BOC viewed as illegal occupation of church property and false representation of the denomination. On June 5, 2009, the ECHR Grand Chamber rejected the government's appeal and left the compensation issue at the decision of the court, which was pending at the end of the reporting period.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

There were no reports of forced religious conversion.

===Anti-semitism===
Dimitar Stoyanov, a member of the extremist political party Ataka and a new Member of the European Parliament as of January 1, 2007, stated that he opposed the "Jewish establishment" and was quoted saying, "There are a lot of powerful Jews, with a lot of money, who are paying the media to form the social awareness of the people. They are also playing with economic crises in countries like Bulgaria and getting rich."

==Societal abuses and discrimination==

There were increasing reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice.

Relations between religious groups generally remained civil and tolerant; however, discrimination, harassment, and public intolerance of some religious groups remained an intermittent problem. There were continuing reports of societal discrimination against "nontraditional" religious groups as well as negative and derogatory media stories about such groups. Jehovah's Witnesses continued to report numerous print and broadcast media stories with negative, derogatory, and sometimes slanderous information about their activities and beliefs. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints voiced concerns over the media's reluctance to cover their charity work and positive contributions to the society. Although less common than in previous years, some Protestant groups continued to report hostility and verbal attacks from the local population in heavily Muslim areas.

The Jewish community reported an increased number of anti-Semitic incidents. In one incident, a memorial to Russian soldiers was painted with swastikas both on the eve of May 9, 2010, and on the 65th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust.
Other incidents include the desecration of the walls of Jewish schools in Sofia on March 21, 2010, as well as two instances of vandalism in Burgas on July 13, 2009, where vandals threw several molotov cocktails at the synagogue and the local Jewish community center.

The Muslim community continued to report numerous cases of mosque desecration. On April 21, 2010, the walls of the mosque in Blagoevgrad were painted with swastikas after its windows were broken several days earlier. The same mosque was set on fire on October 5, 2009, and was renovated with financial support from the government. The mosque in Karlovo was set on fire on April 17, 2010, and the mosque in Nikopol burned to the ground on October 7, 2009. On April 4, 2010, six youths desecrated the mosque in Varna. The mosque in Kazanlak had its windows broken on November 3, 2009, and the mosque in Haskovo on July 12, 2009. Three mosques in Plovdiv were painted with swastikas in November and December 2009. There were no reports of prosecutions in these incidents. In May 2010 the Ministry of Interior promised the community a detailed report on all anti-Muslim incidents in the last three years and guidelines for better cooperation between the police and the community at the local level.

Jehovah's Witnesses complained of persistent intolerance from the nationalistic Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) political party and in particular its branches in Varna, Vratsa, Rousse, and Dobrich, where VMRO supporters staged protests against Jehovah's Witnesses' memorial celebrations and gatherings.

'''Guru Ravidass Jayanti''' is the birthday of [[Guru Ravidass]], celebrated on [[Magh Purnima]], the full moon day in the month of [[Maagha|Magh]] month. It is the annual focal point for the [[Ravidassia Religion|Ravidassia]] religion. On the day the [[Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji]] is read, the [[nishaan]] is changed ceremonially, and there is a special [[Ravidassia Arti|aarti]] and a Nagar Kirtan procession bearing the guru's portrait are taken out to the accompaniment of music through the streets of the temple locality. Also devotees take holy dip in the river to perform rites. In the [[Ravidassia Bhawan|bhawan]]s, his image is worshiped. Every year, a grand celebration at [[Shri Guru Ravidass Janam Asthan]] Mandir, Seer Goverdhanpur, Varanasi takes place to mark the occasion along with [[lakh]]s of devotees who came from all over the world to celebrate the occasion.
The 2018 date is January 31.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.officeholidays.com/countries/india/guru_ravidas.php&lt;/ref&gt;

While a senior, he and his classmates decided to surpass an effort made by the previous year's graduating class, which had been to place a two-ton boulder on the campus, a lasting reminder of them. Tomlinson and his classmates searched the vicinity and located a [[syenite]] boulder on a farm belonging to the industrialist son of [[Simon Perkins|Akron's founder]], Colonel Simon Perkins.&lt;ref name="abj" /&gt; Tomlinson was sent to purchase the "pebble", as they called it,&lt;ref name="50-369"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/fiftyyearsofbuch00buchrich#page/368/mode/2up/search/Tomlinson ''Fifty Years of Buchtel'', pp. 369-370] Retrieved July 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which measured 7 feet tall, 5 feet wide and 3.5 feet across (2.1×1.5×1.1m) and 90 cubic feet (23 [[cubic meter|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]).&lt;ref name="abj" /&gt; The owner didn't want to sell and didn't think Tomlinson and his friends would be able to move it, saying "six yoke of oxen weren't able to budge it." Tomlinson replied, "But, Colonel, that was a good while ago and things have changed. The telephone has been invented, and lots else, and I think we can get it."&lt;ref name="abj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50-369" /&gt; They did have to pay a local building mover and the move took several days, but they were able to install "The Rock" on campus, where it remains a campus landmark.&lt;ref name="abj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50-369" /&gt;

[[Islam]] is an [[Abrahamic religion]] founded in the Arabian peninsula, while [[Sikhism]] is a [[Dharmic religion]] founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Islam means "submission" (to the will of God).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Etymology Dictionary|url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Islam&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website = www.etymonline.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Islam: The Religion and The People|author1=Lewis, Barnard |author2=Churchill, Buntzie Ellis |publisher = Wharton|year = 2009|isbn = 9780132230858|location = |pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word [[Sikh]] is derived from a Sanskrit word meaning 'disciple', or one who learns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Etymology Dictionary|url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Sikh|website = www.etymonline.com|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both religions are monotheistic. [[Sufi|Sufi Muslims]] and [[Sikh|Sikhs]] believe that the 'One' creator permeates the creation.&lt;ref name="sufism"&gt;{{cite|title=Sufism: A Short Introduction|author=William Chittick|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jj1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1/&gt; [[Salafism|Salafi Muslims]] on the other hand disagree. Sufi Muslims differ from Sikhs in that they believe that God manifests his attributes, namely [[Names_of_God_in_Islam#Lists_of_names|the 99 names or attributes]] through his creation.&lt;ref name="sufism"/&gt; According to Salafi Muslims, God's attributes are separate from his creation as he is only above his [[Throne_of_God#Islam|Throne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qTiTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|title=Chinese Muslims and the Global Ummah: Islamic Revival and Ethnic Identity|author=Alexander Stewart|page=43|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam believes that [[Muhammad]] was the last prophet, to whom the [[Quran]] was revealed by God in the 7th century CE. Sikhism was founded in the 15th century CE by [[Guru Nanak]] and the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is the scripture followed by Sikhs as "The Living Guru".&lt;ref name=jj1/&gt;&lt;ref name=g18/&gt;

In Islam, the legal system based on the Quran and the Sunnah is known as [[Sharia]]; there is no such legal system mentioned in Guru Granth Sahib. [[Salah|Daily prayers]] are one of the pillars of Islam and is mandatory for eligible Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fisher | first=Mary | title=Living religions : an encyclopedia of the world's faiths | year=1997 | isbn=978-1-86064-148-0 | page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baptized Sikhs read the five banis (prayers) as part of their daily routine, [[Nitnem]]. Islam requires annual [[zakah]] (alms giving) by Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rai | first=Priya | title=Sikhism and the Sikhs | publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1989 | isbn=978-0-313-26130-5 | pages=230–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirat Karna (doing an honest livelihood - earning honestly without any sort of corruption), Naam Japna (to chant and meditate on Naam, read and follow "The One") and [[Vand Chakna|Vand Chhako]] (Selfless service (Sewa) and sharing with others) are fundamental to Sikhism given by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Pilgrimage (to Mecca) is a crucial part of Islam, while Sikhism denounces pilgrimages,  circumcision and rituals.
.&lt;ref name="D.S Chahal Editors: John Peppin etc. 2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=D.S Chahal (Editors: John Peppin etc.) | title=Religious perspectives in bioethics | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | location=London u.a | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-415-54413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru stated in his 52 Hukamnamas that a Sikh should undertake Pilgrimages to Sikh Gurdwaras.

There has been a history of constructive influence and conflict between Islam and Sikhism. The Sikh scripture ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'' includes teachings from Muslims, namely saints [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Bhagat Farid]]), a Sufi Muslim of the [[Chishti]] Sufi order and [[Kabir]].&lt;ref name=shapiro924&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|year=2002|title=Songs of the Saints from the Adi Granth|publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society|pages=924, 925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deol/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|title=The Guru Granth Sahib: Canon, Meaning and Authority |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMvXAAAAMAAJ |year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-564894-2|pages=174–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, of [[Sikh gurus|total 10 Sikh gurus]], &lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution1/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution3/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution4/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution5/&gt; two gurus - [[Guru Arjan]] and [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] - were tortured and executed for refusing to convert to Islam,&lt;ref name="Singh2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution2/&gt; children of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] were killed,&lt;ref name=pri/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution6/&gt; along with numerous other revered figures of Sikhism such as [[Banda Bahadur]], [[Bhai Mati Das]], [[Bhai Sati Das]] and [[Bhai Dayala]]).&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution5/&gt;&lt;ref name=pri/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution6/&gt; for refusing to convert to Islam,&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution8&gt;Pashaura Singh (2005), Understanding the Martyrdom of Dhan Dhan Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji, Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), pages 29-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution1/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution6/&gt;&lt;ref name=pri/&gt; and for opposing the persecution of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]].&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution9&gt;{{cite journal  | last =McLeod   | first =Hew  | title =Sikhs and Muslims in the Punjab  | journal =South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies  | volume =22  | issue =s1  | pages =155–165  | year =1987  | doi =10.1080/00856408708723379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution2/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution3/&gt;&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution5/&gt; Some sources contest such a historical rendition.&lt;ref name="conversion3"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=f9D4Ob1YcJgC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;|title=South Asia: An Environmental History|author=Christopher V.

== Comparison ==

===Belief===

==== God ====
Sikhism believes that God is formless (''nirankar'').&lt;ref name=jj1&gt;{{cite book | last=Johal | first=Jagbir | title=Sikhism today | publisher=Continuum | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-4411-8140-4 | pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ysRDAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-106276-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called a form of [[pantheism]],&lt;ref name=sm1&gt;{{Google books|QGkoAAAAYAAJ|Sikhism in Its Relation to Muhammadanism|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name=jj1/&gt;
God in the nirgun aspect is without attributes, unmanifest, not seen, but all pervading and permeating, omnipresent. God in the sargun aspect is manifest has attributes, qualities, and seen
in the whole creation. 
[Ik Onkar There is only one God, he is the eternal truth, he is without fear, he is without hate, immortal, without form, Beyond birth and death...]

Islam believes in one God with Muhammad as his last messenger. It denies other gods, and is strictly monotheistic (''[[tawḥīd]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2356?_hi=0&amp;_pos=2 |title=From the article on Tawhid in Oxford Islamic Studies Online |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Ruthven14/&gt; This Islamic doctrine is a part of its [[Shahada]].&lt;ref name= Ruthven14&gt;{{cite book|author=Malise Ruthven|title=Historical Atlas of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wT1xGHPyMA8C |year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01385-8|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; (1) Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; (2) He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; (3) And there is none like unto Him. (4)] (Quran Al-Ikhlas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam101.com/quran/yusufAli/QURAN/112.htm |title=112. The Unity, Sincerity, Oneness Of Allah |publisher=Islam101.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Guru and Messengers====

Sikhism reveres Guru Nanak as the embodiment of the one divine creator lord on earth which is manifest in the ten forms of the ten [[Sikh gurus|Gurus of Sikhs]]. Sikhism accepts that there were divine messengers, including [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and [[Mohammed]] in other religions.&lt;ref name=jj1/&gt;

Islam believes that before Muhammad there were many messengers of God, Muhammad was the last messenger, and Quran was the last revelation to the last prophet.&lt;ref name=fg204&gt;{{cite book | last=Gülen | first=Fethullah | title=The Messenger of God Muhammad : an analysis of the Prophet's life | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-932099-83-6 | page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Scott Noegel |author2=Brannon M. Wheeler | title=Historical dictionary of prophets in Islam and Judaism | publisher=Scarecrow | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-8108-4305-9 | pages=227–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Duties/Articles of Faith ====
The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent on every [[Muslim]]. These duties are [[Shahada]] (testimony that "There is no god but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God"),&lt;ref name="jea" /&gt; [[Salat]] (prayers), [[Zakat]] (Giving of Alms), [[Sawm]] ([[Fasting during Ramadan]]) and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]). These five practices are essential to [[Sunni Islam]]; [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Muslims]] subscribe to eight ritual practices which substantially overlap with the five Pillars.&lt;ref&gt;See: * Mumen (1987), p.178, {{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pillars-of-Islam | title=Pillars of Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Ian |author2=Scollins|editor=Richard|title=Queen Victoria's Enemies: India No.3 |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0850459435|accessdate=17 January 2011|edition=Paperback |series=Men-at-arms|date=23 March 1990|publisher=Osprey Publishing; illustrated edition|isbn=0-85045-943-5 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three duties of Sikhs are [[Naam Japna]] (meditating on [[Waheguru|Waheguru's]] name), [[Kirat Karni]] (earn honest living) and [[Vand Chakna]] (sharing one's earning with others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Religion: Sikhism | website=BBC | date=1970-01-01 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml | accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baptized Sikhs, the Amritdharis are belonging to the Khalsa Panth. They wear the five articles of faith, known as 5 K´s,
(1. Kes, uncut hair and beard, 2. Kangha, a wooden comb, 3. Kara, a bracelet worn around the wrist, 4. Kirpan, a small dagger and 5. Kachera, a special underwear). The Khalsa Panth was created on Vaisakhi 1699 by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh.

====Social beliefs====
Sikhism has an ambivalent attitude towards miracles and rejects any form of discrimination within and against other religions.&lt;ref name="Baksh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFKYFcosJUsC|title=Islam and Other Major World Religions|first=Kaiyume|last=Baksh|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Trafford Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baksh"/&gt; Sikhism does not believe in rituals, but is permissive of traditions.&lt;ref name=g18&gt;{{cite book | first=Gurapreet| last=Singh | title=The soul of Sikhism | year=2003 | isbn=978-81-288-0085-6 | page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostasy====
Apostasy, that is abandonment of Islam by a Muslim and conversion to another religion or atheism, is a religious crime in Islam punishable with death.&lt;ref name=jea&gt;{{cite book | last=Esposito | first=John | title=The Oxford dictionary of Islam | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-19-512559-7 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ali | first=Kecia | title=Islam : the key concepts | publisher=Routledge | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-415-39638-7 | pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Hadith]]s, states John Esposito, leaving Islam is punishable by "beheading,  crucifixion or banishment", and [[Sharia]] (Islamic legal code) traditionally has required death by the sword for an adult sane male who voluntarily leaves Islam.&lt;ref name=jea/&gt; However, adds Esposito, modern thinkers have argued against execution as penalty for apostasy from Islam by invoking Quranic verse 2:257.&lt;ref name=jea/&gt;

Sikhism allows freedom of conscience and choosing the own path.&lt;ref name=pka&gt;Pal Kaur, Apostasy: A sociological perspective, Sikh Review, 45(1), 1997, pp. 37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

==== View on other religions ====
Sikhism teaches that all religious traditions are valid, leading to the same [[Waheguru]], and it rejects that any particular religion has a monopoly regarding absolute truth for all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kristen|last=Haar|title=Sikhism|isbn=978-1417638536|year=2005|publisher=San Val|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam teaches that non-Islamic religious traditions have been distorted by man to suit their desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rippin | first=Andrew | title=The Islamic world | publisher=Routledge | location=London | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-415-60191-7 | pages=252–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Munim| last=Sirry | title=Scriptural polemics : the Qur'an and other religions | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford New York | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-19-935936-3 | pages=43–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Predestination ====
Islam believes in [[predestination]], or divine preordainment (''al-qadā wa l-qadar''), [[God]] has full knowledge and control over all that occurs.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{cite quran|9|51|style=ref}}
* D. Cohen-Mor (2001), p.4: "The idea of predestination is reinforced by the frequent mention of events 'being written' or 'being in a book' before they happen: 'Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us…"&amp;nbsp;'&amp;nbsp;"
* {{cite encyclopedia | title=Fate | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | author=Ahmet T. Karamustafa &lt;!--| accessdate=2007-05-02--&gt;}}: The verb ''qadara'' literally means "to measure, to determine". Here it is used to mean that "God measures and orders his creation".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O84eYLVHvB0C&amp;pg=PA591 A Dictionary of Islam]: By [[Thomas Patrick Hughes]] {{ISBN|81-206-0672-8}} Page 591&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islamic tradition, all that has been decreed by God is written in ''al-Lawh al-Mahfūz'', the "Preserved Tablet".&lt;ref&gt;Farah (2003), pp.119–122; Patton (1900), p.130; Momen (1987), pp.177,178&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Sikhism also believes in predestination, and what one does, speaks and hears is already pre ordained, and one has to simply follow the laid down path per God's Hukum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Gurapreet| last=Singh | title=The soul of Sikhism | year=2003 | isbn=978-81-288-0085-6 | pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Practice ===

====Grooming and dress====
The Khalsa panth among Sikhs are guided by the [[five Ks]]. They keep their head hair long ([[Kesh (Sikhism)|kesh]]) and men wear [[turban]]s (head hair cover) Women may also wear a turban by their choice. They carry a wooden comb, wear an iron bracelet, wear a cotton underwear, and carry a [[kirpan]] (steel sword).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Religion: Sikhism | website=BBC | date=1970-01-01 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/customs/fiveks.shtml | accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non baptized Sikh women are free to dress as they wish in Sikhism.

====Circumcision====

====Food====
Islam has Quranic restrictions on food, such as how the meat is prepared.&lt;ref name="cite quran|2|173|style=nosup"&gt;{{cite quran|2|173|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halal meat is required in Islam, prepared by ritual [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] that involves cutting the [[jugular]] veins of the animal with a sharp knife. This leads to death, through bleeding, of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Riaz | first=Mian | title=Halal food production | publisher=CRC Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-1-58716-029-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meat from animals that die of natural causes or accident is not allowed, unless necessary.&lt;ref name="cite quran|2|173|style=nosup"/&gt; Beef is a religiously acceptable food to Muslims, but pork and alcohol is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Esposito | first=John | title=What everyone needs to know about Islam | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-19-979413-3 | pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims fast for the month of [[Ramadan]].

Sikhs are prohibited from eating Islamic ''[[halal]]'' or Jewish ''[[kosher]]'' style meat because to them, this manner of obtaining meat involves a ritualistic component and a slow death of the animal. This is known as [[Kutha meat]].&lt;ref name=bbcfood&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4718511.stm|title=In pictures: Sikhs in Britain|date=27 July 2005|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=en2005/&gt; The official Sikh Code of Conduct [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] only forbids the consumption of [[Kutha meat]] and instead suggests [[Jhatka]] style of preparation.&lt;ref name=en2005/&gt; Charity meals distributed at a Sikh [[Gurudwara]], called a [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]], is only [[lacto-vegetarian]].&lt;ref name=bbcfood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Angelo|title=The Sikh Diaspora: Tradition and Change in an Immigrant Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te_GBQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-52763-0 |pages=155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups&lt;ref name="Takhar2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Takhar|first=Opinderjit Kaur|title=Sikh identity: an exploration of groups among Sikhs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aeKWQzesOc4C&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=26 November 2010|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5202-1|page=51|chapter=2 Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Sikhism disagree with the consumption of meat altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann Goldman|author2=Richard Hain|author3=Stephen Liben|title=Oxford Textbook of Palliative Care for Children|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1fTsoA4wDMC&amp;pg=PA220 |year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-852653-7 |pages=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, some Sikhs eat meat,  the majority of Sikhs avoid  meat.

====Jizya====
Muslim rulers in history, compelled the payment of a special tax called [[Jizya]] from [[dhimmi]], those who refuse to convert to Islam but live in a Muslim state. Dhimmis were excluded from having to pay Islamic religious tax such as [[zakat]] and excluded from observing other Islamic religious obligations.&lt;ref&gt;John Louis Esposito, Islam the Straight Path, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ame1&gt;Anver M. Emon, Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199661633}}, pp. 99-109&lt;/ref&gt; Jizya was a tool of social stratification and treasury's revenue from non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=ame1/&gt; Jizya was a reminder of subordination of a non-Muslim under some Muslim rulers, and created a financial and political incentive to convert to Islam.&lt;ref name=ame1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Majid Khadduri (2010), War and Peace in the Law of Islam, Johns Hopkins University Press; pp. 162–224; {{ISBN|978-1-58477-695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhism has never required a special tax for non-Sikhs.

===Holy sites===
{{wide image|Golden temple pano.jpg|760px|The Harmandir Sahib (also known as the Golden Temple).}}
The [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar, India is not only a central religious place of the Sikhs, but also a symbol of human brotherhood and equality.

During the [[Mughal Empire]], Sikh gurus were persecuted along with other non-Muslims.

In other periods, Sikhs were persecuted during the Islamic rule of South Asia. [[Guru Arjan]] was tortured and executed by Mughal emperor Jahangir.

During the [[partition of India]] in 1947, there was much bloodshed between Sikhs and Muslims, there was mass migration of people from all walks of life to leave their homes and belongings and travel by foot across the new border, on trains and on land people were killed in what was felt to be revenge attacks.&lt;ref name=gp1&gt;{{cite book | last=Pandey | first=Gyanendra | title=Remembering partition violence, nationalism, and history in India | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-521-00250-9 | pages=1–19, 83–88, 153–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of Sikhs left Pakistan and moved into India, while millions of Muslims left India and moved into Pakistan.&lt;ref name=gp1/&gt; Malerkotla was however not affected and was viewed as a safe haven for Muslims during the partition.

Since [[9/11]] [[Sikhism in the United States|Sikhs in America]] have endured hate crimes, denial of employment, bullying in schools 
and profiling in airports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/268650/pinoyabroad/worldfeatures/sikhs-often-mistaken-for-muslims-call-for-better-understanding-of-their-religion&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], there have some instances of tension between Sikhs and Muslims on allegations that some Sikhs have been [[forced to convert to Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00731cf|title=Asian Network Reports Special - BBC Asian Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/6738455.stm|title=Protest march over 'conversions'|date=10 June 2007|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Taliban]] in [[Pakistan]] demanded that Sikhs in the region pay them the ''[[jizya]]'' (poll tax levied by Muslims on non-Muslim minorities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090417/world.htm#6 |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India – World |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, two Muslim teens bombed a gurdwara in the German city of Essen. The two teen converted fire extinguishers into an explosive device. The devices detonated after a wedding party had left for the reception. A gurdwara priest was injured seriously, while two others were treated for minor injuries. The gurdwara building was damaged severely. One of the teens was in deradicalization program. The two denied it was religiously motivated saying  “just for the kick of building fireworks!” However, before setting off the blast, the two 16-year-olds tried to break into the Sikh place of worship, North Rhine Westphalia (NRW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikh Temple bombing in Germany|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sikh-temple-bombing-in-germany-was-carried-out-by-isis-sympathisers-a7007166.html|website=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to the Islamic Council of Victoria, historians argue that Arab merchants dominated trade in Southeast Asia in the early ninth century. There existed a colony of foreign Muslims on the west coast of Sumatra by 674 CE; other Muslim settlements began to appear after 878 CE when Islam increasingly took root among the people. However, little remains from these early communities, and the religion did not spread to significant parts of the population until the 12th century.

[[File:Food jar (gadur), Mindanao, Maranao, brass with silver inlay, Honolulu Academy of Arts.JPG|thumb|A Muslim "Food jar" from the [[Philippines]], also known as ''gadur'', well known for its [[brass]] with [[silver]] inlay.]]

Islam came to the Southeast Asia, first by the way of Muslim traders along the main trade-route between [[Western Asia]] and the [[Far East]], then was further spread by [[Tariqah|Sufi orders]] and finally consolidated by the expansion of the territories of converted rulers and their communities.&lt;ref name="Camb"&gt;P. M. ( Peter Malcolm) Holt, Bernard Lewis, ''"The Cambridge History of Islam"'', Cambridge University Press, pr 21, 1977, {{ISBN|0-521-29137-2}} pg.123-125&lt;/ref&gt; The first communities arose in [[Aceh]] in Northern [[Sumatra]]. [[Malacca]] was a stronghold of Islam as well,  from where it was propagated along the trade routes in the region.&lt;ref name="Camb"/&gt; There is no clear indication of when Islam first came to the region, the first Muslim gravestone markings date to 1082.&lt;ref name="colin"&gt;Colin Brown, ''A Short History of Indonesia"'', Allen &amp; Unwin, July 1, 2003 {{ISBN|1-86508-838-2}} pg.31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Marco Polo]] visited the area in 1292 he noted that the urban port state of [[Peureulak|Perlak]] was Muslim,&lt;ref name="colin"/&gt; Chinese sources record the presence of a Muslim delegation to the emperor from the [[Pasai|Kingdom of Samudra (Pasai)]] in 1282,&lt;ref name="Camb"/&gt; other accounts provide instances of Muslim communities present in the [[Melayu Kingdom]] for the same time period while others record the presence of Muslim Chinese traders from provinces such as [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="colin"/&gt; The spread of Islam generally followed the trade routes east through the primarily [[Buddhist]] region and a half century later in the [[Malacca]]'s we see the first dynasty arise in the form of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] at the far end of the Archipelago form by the conversion of one [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara Dewa Shah]] into a Muslim and the adoption of the name Muhammad Iskandar Shah after his marriage to a daughter of the ruler of Pasai.&lt;ref name="Camb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colin"/&gt; In 1380, Sufi orders carried Islam from here on to [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref name="Nazeer"&gt;Nazeer Ahmed, ''"Islam in Global History: From the Death of Prophet Muhammed to the First World War"'', Xlibris Corporation, December 1, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7388-5962-1}} pg. 394-396&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Another driving force for the change of the ruling class in the region was the concept among the increasing Muslim communities of the region when ruling dynasties to attempt to forge such ties of kinship by marriage.&lt;ref name="Nazeer"/&gt; By the time the [[Colonialism|colonial]] powers and their [[missionaries]] arrived in the 17th century the region up to [[New Guinea]] was overwhelmingly Muslim with [[animist]] minorities.&lt;ref name="colin"/&gt;

The first written sources of Islam in Southeast Asia in 916 AD from a merchant describing his experience in 1?851 on the Island of Sumatra.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Over time a series of Muslim port villages emerged on the scarcely populated coast.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Islamic teachers from these port villages ventured to the interior of Sumatra.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Over time these ports attracted Muslims from India, China, and the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; These communities surpassed their utilitarian functions for trade and were integrated into the global network of Islam.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Islam was popular in Southeast Asia because it, unlike previous belief systems could be used to validate a ruler's power through the divine. Islam spread throughout the Indonesian archipelago slowly and with force.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

In the 12th century, the [[India]]n [[Chola]] navy crossed the ocean and attacked the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatunga Varman in Kadaram ([[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]]). The capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present-day [[Sumatra]] and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked. Soon after, the King of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional [[Hindu]] faith and converted to [[Islam]] with the [[Sultanate of Kedah]] established in year 1136. [[Samudera Pasai]] converted to Islam in the year 1267. The King of Malacca [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] married the princess of Pasai, and their son became the first sultan of Malacca. Soon Malacca became the centre of Islamic study and maritime trade; other rulers followed suit.

By the end of the 15th century, several areas of northern Sumatra, including what is now Java, were governed by Muslim rulers.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; It wasn’t until 1641 that the first Sultan took their title in what is now Java.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Islam initially arrived on the coast of Sumatra, and spread down and around the coast to the Malacca strait and jumped across the straight to the Malay Peninsula.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

In 1511, the Portuguese took over Malacca, but various other Muslim states began to grow in size and economic and political prominence. For example, Aceh dominated the region, both politically and economically, in the early seventeenth century. Through familial and trade relationships in these Muslim states, non-Islam states were slowly exposed to the faith. As it spread, Islam encountered pre-existing spiritual beliefs&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchId=R1&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=4&amp;userGroupName=lacc_main&amp;inPS=true&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GVRL.LACCMAIN&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424501558&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3424501558&amp;docType=GALE "Gale - Enter Product Login"].

Indeed, the faith introduced by some of the religious merchants was Sufism, a mystical version of Islam that is rejected by more conservative Muslims.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Houissa, Ali.

There are several theories to the [[Islamization]] process in Southeast Asia. The first theory is trade. The expansion of trade among [[West Asia]], [[India]] and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders brought Islam to the region. [[Gujarati Muslims]] played a pivotal role in establishing [[Islam]] in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gujarat helped establish Islam in SE Asia|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ampnbspGujarat-helped-establish-Islam-in-SE-Asia/articleshow/11262585.cms|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|last=Prabhune|first=Tushar|location=[[Ahmedabad]]|date=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second theory is the role of missionaries or [[Sufi]]s. The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by syncretising Islamic ideas with existing local beliefs and religious notions. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam which further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, [[Malacca Sultanate]], embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as the religion provided a unifying force among the ruling and trading classes near mister man. The word ''daulat'' refers to the legitimacy of a ruler, through the power of God, and suggests the strong relationship between rule, legitimacy, and the spread of Islam.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[http://islamtoday.berkeley.edu/Islam_SoutheastAsia "Islam in Southeast Asia | Islam, Youth &amp; New Media"]. ''islamtoday.berkeley.edu''. Retrieved 2016-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Islam to Southeast Asia also depended largely on the translation and availability of religious texts. This was largely through Malay, a language that transected class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are also a number of works in Javanese, particularly related to Javanese-Islamic mysticism.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Houben, Vincent (2003). "Southeast Asia and Islam". ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science''. '''588''': 149–170.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most significant Malay authors that helped in this translation are Hamzah Fansuri, Shams al-Din, and 'Abd al-Ra-uf.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Contemporary Islam in Southeast Asia==
Islam in Southeast Asia is multi-faceted and multi-layered. Different interpretations of the faith have resulted in a variety of groups. In Indonesia, there is the [[Nahdlatul Ulama]], which preaches closely to the Shafi`i school of legal accretion, and the [[Muhammadiyah]], whose outlook is a blend of modernist ideals with Islamic thoughts. Along with these two major groups, other Islamic groups also played an important role in Indonesian society, politics and economy, with their followers forming Islamic civil groups and political parties. Muslims in Southeast Asia also come from a variety of ethnic groups and backgrounds and speak a number of different languages, including Thai, Burmese, Malay, Marano, Tausug, Bahasa Indonesia, Javanese, and Chinese.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through travel to Arab countries—for the Hajj-pilgrimage or religious study—Muslims in Southeast Asia have also undertaken the translation of Islamic texts into local languages. Daily practices also vary among countries and different regions within each country. Many of these differences relate to government policies and also to whether Muslims make up the majority or minority of the country's population.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[File:Istiqlal Mosque Eid ul Fitr Jamaah 4.JPG|right|thumb|[[Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta]]]]
[[File:นายกรัฐมนตรี มอบบ้านตามโครงการแก้ไขปัญหาความเดือดร้อนท - Flickr - Abhisit Vejjajiva (10).jpg|thumb|[[Thai Malays]]]]
Despite these differences, there are still common traditions practiced among many Muslims in Southeast Asia. For example, the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five duties of Islam]] (Faith, Prayer, Charity, Fasting, Pilgrimage) form a foundation for many individuals' faith. Likewise, there are other shared traditions, such as prayer before meals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasociety.org/education/islam-southeast-asia "Islam in Southeast Asia"]. ''Asia Society''. Retrieved 2016-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1970s, an Islamic resurgence is taking place in the region. [[Dakwah]] movements mushroomed throughout Southeast Asia. These movements, in general, aim to create a strong Islamic identity among the Muslims and are understood as a response to changes in society and values. These movements have been referred to as "revivalism," "revitalization," "resurgence," "renewal," and "Islamization."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As a result, Islam began to assume a larger role in public life, underlined by the increased donning of [[Hijab|headscarves]] among Muslim women, for one example. Economic growth resulted in modest affluence which has translated into more religious investments like the [[Haj]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;j and [[Islamic]] literature. The Malaysian government promotes Islam through its Islamization policies covering society, economics and education and, most recently, [[Islam Hadhari]]. Some of these movements have reflected a perceived tension between modernity and tradition, and they reflect movements taking place at the same time in other regions, like the Middle East. For example, Southeast Asian scholars who traveled to the Middle East during the early 1900s brought back ideas from the Modernist movement. In Indonesia, there are two large Muslim organizations. One, [[Muhammadiyah]], is associated with this Modernist movement while the other, [[Nahdlatul Ulama]], is a more traditional organization meant to oppose the values of Modernism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Islam has intersected with other religious practices in Southeast Asia in many different ways. For example, ''jinn'', which indicates Islamic spiritual beings, has come to include Javanese spirits, as well. In countries such as Indonesia, in particular, animist traditions (as well as the traditions of other faiths, like Hindu and Buddhism) have become integral to the practice of Islam. Sufism has also shaped Islam in many Southeast Asian countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Pilgrimage to the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/fivepillars.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Five Pillars of Islam|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hajj was made easier by the advent of the steamship in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/Public/focus/essay1009_southeast_asia.html|title=Focus On... - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Hajj became more popular throughout Southeast Asia, Arabic and the Arabian brand of Islam were integrated further into the lives of Muslims in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; In accordance with the body of scholarly work on Islam in the Southeast Asia, the Hajj from Southeast garnered little to no attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/article/24195|title=Hajj Histories: Stories from Southeast Asian Pilgrims|website=www.international.ucla.edu|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In today's modern age, Muslims interact with global technology, consumerism, and ideas in a variety of ways while practicing their faith. For some, this has resulted in an increase in religiosity and the observation of traditions such as Islamic devotional practices and fasting during Ramadan. As another example, Muslims in Southeast Asia have performed pilgrimages to the Mecca since the 17th century and continue to do so.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;''Voices of Islam in Southeast Asia: A Contemporary Sourcebook''. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies Publications. 2006. {{ISBN|9812303685}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southeast Asia, Islam also influences other aspects of life, and there is a close relationship among religion, nation, and ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, there are an increasing number of private Islamic schools, which often combine Islamic religion, culture, and life. Likewise, medicine in Southeast Asia draws on a number of traditions, often combining animism, tibbun (which contains pre-Islamic elements), and hikmah (which is based upon a lineage of Muslim scholars and influenced modern biomedical practice).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Islamic banks are also founded on Islamic principles and, for example, do not charge interest.

The division of countries during colonialism divide some ethnic and religious groups, leading to some minority Muslim populations that live at the edge of countries. Various organizations, like the Muslim World League, have advocated for the rights of these minority populations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There is a [[persecution of Muslims in Myanmar|history]] in some countries of [[persecution]] of Muslims, including the ongoing [[ethnic cleansing]] of the [[Rohingya persecution in Myanmar (2016–present)|Rohingya in Myanmar]].&lt;ref name="BBC 2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=UN condemns 'devastating' Rohingya abuse in Myanmar|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38858655|accessdate=4 February 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the war on terrorism, particularly since 9/11, has influenced contemporary Islam in Southeast Asia. Many governments in the region have joined antiterrorist coalitions or signed antiterrorist pacts. In some countries, such as the Philippines, the U.S. has sent troops to combat specific terrorist groups associated with Islamic extremism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The '''Islamic Golden Age''' is the era in the [[history of Islam]], traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 14th century, during which much of the historically [[Islamic world]] was ruled by various [[caliphate]]s, and [[science in the medieval Islamic world|science]], economic development and cultural works flourished.&lt;ref name=Saliba&gt;[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', pp. 245, 250, 256–7.

The metaphor of a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] began to be applied in 19th-century literature about Islamic history, in the context of the western aesthetic fashion known as [[Orientalism]]. The author of a ''Handbook for Travelers in Syria and Palestine'' in 1868 observed that the most beautiful mosques of Damascus were "like Mohammedanism itself, now rapidly decaying" and relics of "the golden age of Islam".&lt;ref&gt;Josias Leslie Porter, ''A Handbook for Travelers in Syria and Palestine'', 1868, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zdfotKk6OtsC |page=49 }} p. 49].&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no unambiguous definition of the term, and depending on whether it is used with a focus on cultural or on military achievement, it may be taken to refer to rather disparate time spans. Thus, one author would have it extend to the duration of the caliphate, or to "six and a half centuries",&lt;ref&gt;"For six centuries and a half, through the golden age of Islam, lasted this Caliphate, till extinguished by the Osmanli sultans and in the death of the last of the blood of the house of Mahomet. The true Caliphate ended with the fall of Bagdad". ''New Outlook'', Volume 45, 1892, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; while another would have it end after only a few decades of Rashidun conquests, with the death of [[Umar]] and the [[First Fitna]].&lt;ref&gt;"the golden age of Islam, as Mr. Gilman points out, ended with Omar, the second of the Kalifs." ''The Literary World'', Volume 36, 1887, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 20th century, the term was used only occasionally, and often referred to the early military successes of the [[Rashidun Caliphs|Rashidun caliphs]]. It was only in the second half of the 20th century that the term came to be used with any frequency, now mostly referring to the cultural flourishing of science and mathematics under the caliphates during the 9th to 11th centuries (between the establishment of organised scholarship in the [[House of Wisdom]] and the beginning of the [[crusades]]),&lt;ref&gt;"The Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh centuries were the golden age of Islam" ''LIFE'' magazine,  9 May 1955, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=llYEAAAAMBAJ |page=74 }} p.74].&lt;/ref&gt; but often extended to include part of the late 8th or the 12th to early 13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;so Linda S. George, ''The Golden Age of Islam'', 1998: "from the last years of the eighth century to the thirteenth century."&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions may still vary considerably. Equating the end of the golden age with the end of the caliphates is a convenient cut-off point based on a historical landmark, but it can be argued that Islamic culture had entered a gradual decline much earlier; thus, Khan (2003) identifies the proper golden age as being the two centuries between 750–950, arguing that the beginning loss of territories under Harun al-Rashid worsened after the death of [[al-Ma'mun]] in 833, and that the [[crusades]] in the 12th century resulted in a  weakening of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Islamic empire]] from which it never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Arshad Khan, ''Islam, Muslims, and America: Understanding the Basis of Their Conflict'', 2003, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=FbnnJxar3aMC |page=19 }} p. 19].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Religious influence===
{{Main|Islamic attitudes towards science}} 
The various [[Quran]]ic injunctions and [[prophetic traditions|Hadith]], which place values on education and emphasize the importance of acquiring knowledge, played a vital role in influencing the Muslims of this age in their search for knowledge and the development of the body of science.&lt;ref name=Hans45&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Hans |editor1-last=Groth|title=Population Dynamics in Muslim Countries: Assembling the Jigsaw |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bpq9Mg-l5jMC&amp;pg=PA45 |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |location= |isbn=9783642278815 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Hamid Naseem |editor1-last=Rafiabadi |title=Challenges to Religions and Islam: A Study of Muslim Movements, Personalities, Issues and Trends, Part 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnH_YuN2ruUC&amp;pg=PA1141 |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |location= |isbn=9788176257329 |page=1141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salam |first=Abdus  |title=Renaissance of Sciences in Islamic Countries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfoQmi4o4zcC&amp;pg=PA9 |accessdate= |publisher= |location= |isbn= 9789971509460|page=9|year=1994  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government sponsorship===
The [[Islamic Empire]] heavily patronized scholars. The money spent on the [[Translation Movement]] for some translations is estimated to be equivalent to about twice the annual research budget of the United Kingdom’s [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]].&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01k2bv8|title=In Our Time - Al-Kindi, James Montgomery|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=May 18, 2013|date=28 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114060124/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01k2bv8#|archive-date=2014-01-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best scholars and notable translators, such as [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]], had salaries that are estimated to be the equivalent of professional athletes today.&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt;  The [[House of Wisdom]] was a [[library]] established in [[Abbasid]]-era [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] by Caliph [[al-Mansur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1-first=Sonja |author1-last=Brentjes |author2=Robert G.

===Earlier cultural influence===
{{Main|Greek contributions to Islamic world|Indian influence on Islamic science|Christian influences in Islam|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery}}
During this period, the Muslims showed a strong interest in assimilating the scientific knowledge of the civilizations that had been conquered. Many classic works of antiquity that might otherwise have been lost were translated from [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[History of India|Indian]], [[History of China|Chinese]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], and [[Phoenicia]]n civilizations into Arabic and Persian, and later in turn translated into Turkish, Hebrew, and Latin.&lt;ref name="Vartan"/&gt;

[[Christians]], especially the adherents of the [[Church of the East]] ([[Nestorian]]s), contributed to Islamic civilization during the reign of the [[Ummayads]] and the [[Abbasids]] by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] and [[ancient science]] to [[Syriac Language|Syriac]] and afterwards to [[Arabic Language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Donald.

It was easier to manufacture than [[parchment]], less likely to crack than [[papyrus]], and could absorb ink, making it difficult to erase and ideal for keeping records.

===Major contributors===
Among the various countries and cultures conquered through successive Islamic conquests, a remarkable number of [[List of pre-modern Iranian scientists and scholars|scientists]] originated from Persia, who contributed immensely to the scientific flourishing of the Islamic Golden Age. According to [[Bernard Lewis]]:"Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Persian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Babel to Dragomans: Interpreting the Middle East  |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004   |page=44 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Science, medicine, philosophy and technology in the newly Islamized Iranian society was influenced by and based on the scientific model of the major pre-Islamic [[Academy of Gondishapur|Iranian universities]] in the [[Sassanian Empire]]. During this period [[List of Iranian scientists and scholars|hundreds of scholars and scientists]] vastly contributed to technology, science and medicine, later influencing the rise of European science during [[the Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kühnel E., in ''Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesell'', Vol. CVI (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Further|Madrasa}}

The centrality of scripture and its study in the Islamic tradition helped to make education a central pillar of the religion in virtually all times and places in the history of Islam.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Jonathan Berkey|authorlink=Jonathan Berkey|title=Education|editor=Richard C. Martin|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|publisher=MacMillan Reference USA|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of learning in the Islamic tradition is reflected in a number of hadiths attributed to Muhammad, including one that instructs the faithful to "seek knowledge, even in China".&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; This injunction was seen apply particularly to scholars, but also to some extent to the wider Muslim public, as exemplified by the dictum of [[Al-Zarnuji]], "learning is prescribed for us all".&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; While it is impossible to calculate literacy rates in pre-modern Islamic societies, it is almost certain that they were relatively high, at least in comparison to their European counterparts.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt;

[[File:Al-Azhar (inside) 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Organized instruction in the Cairo [[Al-Azhar Mosque]] began in 978]]

Education would begin at a young age with study of Arabic and the Quran, either at home or in a primary school, which was often attached to a mosque.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; Some students would then proceed to training in [[tafsir]] (Quranic exegesis) and [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence), which was seen as particularly important.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; Education focused on memorization, but also trained the more advanced students to participate as readers and writers in the tradition of commentary on the studied texts.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; It also involved a process of [[socialization]] of aspiring scholars, who came from virtually all social backgrounds, into the ranks of the [[ulema]].&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt;

For the first few centuries of Islam, educational settings were entirely informal, but beginning in the 11th and 12th centuries, the ruling elites began to establish institutions of higher religious learning known as [[madrasa]]s in an effort to secure support and cooperation of the ulema.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; Madrasas soon multiplied throughout the Islamic world, which helped to spread Islamic learning beyond urban centers and to unite diverse Islamic communities in a shared cultural project.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; Nonetheless, instruction remained focused on individual relationships between students and their teacher.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; The formal attestation of educational attainment, ''[[ijaza]]'', was granted by a particular scholar rather than the institution, and it placed its holder within a genealogy of scholars, which was the only recognized hierarchy in the educational system.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; While formal studies in madrasas were open only to men, women of prominent urban families were commonly educated in private settings and many of them received and later issued ''ijazas'' in hadith studies, calligraphy and poetry recitation.&lt;ref name=lapidus-210&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lapidus | first = Ira M. | authorlink=Ira M.

Muslims distinguished disciplines inherited from pre-Islamic civilizations, such as philosophy and medicine, which they called "sciences of the ancients" or "rational sciences", from Islamic religious sciences.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; Sciences of the former type flourished for several centuries, and their transmission formed part of the educational framework in classical and medieval Islam.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt; In some cases, they were supported by institutions such as the [[House of Wisdom]] in Baghdad, but more often they were transmitted informally from teacher to student.&lt;ref name=berkey-ed/&gt;

The [[University of Al Karaouine]], founded in 859 AD, is arguably the world's oldest degree-granting university.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guinness Book Of Records'', Published 1998, {{ISBN|0-553-57895-2}}, P.242&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Al-Azhar University]] was another early university.  Islamic "universities" of the Middle Ages were in fact  ''madrasas,'' centers for the study of religious texts and law. Only after the Arabs came in contact with the institutions of higher learning of the Christian Greek Roman Empire during their conquests did the madrasas begin to teach other subjects as well - but the only degree granted remained that of expert in religious law:
&lt;references group="Dario Fernandez-Morera 'The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise.' chapter 2 page 65 ISI Books 2015 ISBN 9781610170956 (hardback)" /&gt;"There was no other 'doctorate' in any other field, no license to teach a field except that of the religious law". The madrasa is one of the relics of the [[Fatimid]] caliphate. The Fatimids traced their descent to Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]] and named the institution using a variant of her honorific title ''Al-Zahra'' (the brilliant).&lt;ref&gt;Halm, Heinz.

The body of substantive Islamic law was created by independent jurists ([[mufti]]s).

Classical Islamic theology emerged from an early doctrinal controversy which pitted the ''[[ahl al-hadith]]'' movement, led by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], who considered the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only acceptable authority in matters of faith, against [[Mu'tazilite]]s and other theological currents, who developed theological doctrines using rationalistic methods.&lt;ref name=lapidus-130-131&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lapidus | first = Ira M. | authorlink=Ira M.

{{Main|Islamic philosophy}}

[[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) and [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes) played a major role in saving the works of [[Aristotle]], whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought of the [[Christian world|Christian]] and [[Muslim world]]s. According to the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], translation of philosophical texts from Arabic to Latin in Western Europe "led to the transformation of almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world".&lt;ref name=standford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West|year=2014|author=Dag Nikolaus Hasse|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-influence/|date=|accessdate=2017-07-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020001417/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-influence/#|archivedate=2017-10-20|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Islamic philosophers in Europe was particularly strong in natural philosophy, psychology and metaphysics, though it also influenced the study of logic and ethics.&lt;ref name=standford/&gt;

===Metaphysics===
[[Avicenna]] argued his "[[Floating man]]" thought experiment concerning [[self-awareness]], in which a man prevented of sense experience by being blindfolded and free falling would still be aware of his existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00855lt|title=In Our Time: Existence|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=27 March 2013|date=8 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017222739/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00855lt#|archive-date=2013-10-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===
In [[epistemology]], [[Ibn Tufail]] wrote the novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' and in response [[Ibn al-Nafis]] wrote the novel ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]''. Both were concerning [[autodidacticism]] as illuminated through the life of a [[feral child]] [[spontaneous generation|spontaneously generated]] in a cave on a [[desert island]].

[[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] played a significant role in the development of [[algebra]], [[arithmetic]] and [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]].

===Geometry===
{{see|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Islamic art makes use of [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] and symmetries in many of its art forms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular [[decagon]], an elongated [[hexagon]], a bow tie, a [[rhombus]], and a regular [[pentagon]]. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]] argued that girih from the 15th century resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peter J.

===Calculus===
[[Alhazen]] discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]].

[[Alhazen]] played a role in the development of [[optics]]. One of the prevailing theories of vision in his time and place was the [[emission theory]] supported by [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], where sight worked by the eye emitting rays of light, and the other was the Aristotelean theory that sight worked when the essence of objects flows into the eyes. Alhazen correctly argued that vision occurred when light, traveling in straight lines, reflects off an object into the eyes. [[Al-Biruni]] wrote of his insights into light, stating that its velocity must be immense when compared to the speed of sound.&lt;ref name=Standrews&gt;{{cite web |author1=J J O'Connor |author2=E F Robertson |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Al-Biruni.html |title=Abu Arrayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni |work=MacTutor History of Mathematics archive |date=1999 |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=17 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121101131/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Al-Biruni.html |archivedate=21 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Systemic diseases" was the rough equivalent of today's [[internal medicine]] and was further divided into sections such as fever, infections and digestive issues. Every department had an officer-in-charge, a presiding officer and a supervising specialist. The hospitals also had lecture theaters and libraries. Hospitals staff included sanitary inspectors, who regulated cleanliness, and accountants and other administrative staff.&lt;ref name=aramco0317/&gt; The hospitals were typically run by a three-man board comprising a non-medical administrator, the chief pharmacist, called the shaykh saydalani, who was equal in rank to the chief physician, who served as mutwalli (dean).&lt;ref name=aramco/&gt; Medical facilities traditionally closed each night, but by the 10th century laws were passed to keep hospitals open 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name =sdouglas/&gt;

For less serious cases, physicians staffed outpatient clinics. Cities also had first aid centers staffed by physicians for emergencies that were often located in busy public places, such as big gatherings for Friday prayers. The region also had mobile units staffed by doctors and pharmacists who were supposed to meet the need of remote communities. Baghdad was also known to have a separate hospital for convicts since the early 10th century after the vizier ‘Ali ibn Isa ibn Jarah ibn Thabit wrote to Baghdad’s chief medical officer that "prisons must have their own doctors who should examine them every day". The first hospital built in Egypt, in Cairo's Southwestern quarter, was the first documented facility to care for mental illnesses. In [[Aleppo]]'s Arghun Hospital, care for mental illness included abundant light, fresh air, running water and music.&lt;ref name=aramco0317&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aramcoworld.com/en-US/Articles/March-2017/The-Islamic-Roots-of-the-Modern-Hospital|title=The Islamic Roots of the Modern Hospital|publisher=aramcoworld.com|accessdate=20 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321170327/http://www.aramcoworld.com/en-US/Articles/March-2017/The-Islamic-Roots-of-the-Modern-Hospital#|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=no|df=}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical students would accompany physicians and participate in patient care. Hospitals in this era were the first to require medical diplomas to license doctors.&lt;ref name=Alatas&gt;{{Cite journal|title=From Jami'ah to University: Multiculturalism and Christian–Muslim Dialogue|first=Syed Farid|last=Alatas|journal=Current Sociology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=112–32|doi=10.1177/0011392106058837|year=2006|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensing test was administered by the region's government appointed chief medical officer. The test had two steps; the first was to write a treatise, on the subject the candidate wished to obtain a certificate, of original research or commentary of existing texts, which they were encouraged to scrutinize for errors. The second step was to answer questions in an interview with the chief medical officer. Physicians worked fixed hours and medical staff salaries were fixed by law. For regulating the quality of care and arbitrating cases, it is related that if a patient dies, their family presents the doctor's prescriptions to the chief physician who would judge if the death was natural or if it was by negligence, in which case the family would be entitled to compensation from the doctor. The hospitals had male and female quarters while some hospitals only saw men and other hospitals, staffed by women physicians, only saw women.&lt;ref name=aramco0317/&gt; While women physicians practiced medicine, many largely focused on [[obstetrics]].&lt;ref name=aramco0816&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.org/8597/pioneer-muslim-physicians/|title=Pioneer Muslim Physicians|publisher=aramcoworld.com|accessdate=20 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321170835/http://www.islamicity.org/8597/pioneer-muslim-physicians/#|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=no|df=}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no conditions of consideration and payment, none is objected to or even indirectly hinted at for non-payment."&lt;ref name=adler/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pharmacies===
By the ninth century, there was a rapid expansion of private pharmacies in many Muslim cities. Initially, these were unregulated and managed by personnel of inconsistent quality. Decrees by Caliphs [[Al-Ma'mun]] and [[Al-Mu'tasim]] required examinations to license pharmacists and pharmacy students were trained in a combination of classroom exercises coupled with day-to-day practical experiences with drugs. To avoid conflicts of interest, doctors were banned from owning or sharing ownership in a pharmacy. Pharmacies were periodically inspected by government inspectors called [[muhtasib]], who checked to see that the medicines were mixed properly, not diluted and kept in clean jars. Violators were fined or beaten.&lt;ref name=aramco/&gt;

===Medicine===
{{main|Islamic medicine}}
The theory of [[Humorism]] was largely dominant during this time. Arab physician [[Ibn Zuhr]] provided proof that [[scabies]] is caused by the [[Sarcoptes scabiei|itch mite]] and that it can be cured by removing the parasite without the need for purging, bleeding or other treatments called for by humorism, making a break with the humorism of Galen and Ibn Sina.&lt;ref name=aramco0816/&gt; [[Rhazes]] differentiated through careful observation the two diseases [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], which were previously lumped together as a single disease that caused [[rash]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/alrazi.aspx|title=Abu Bakr Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi (Rhazes) (c. 865-925)|publisher=sciencemuseum.org.uk|accessdate=May 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506072259/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/alrazi.aspx#|archive-date=2015-05-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on location and the time of the appearance of the symptoms and he also scaled the degree of severity and prognosis of infections according to the color and location of rashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ircmj.com/291.fulltext|title=Rhazes Diagnostic Differentiation of Smallpox and Measles|publisher=ircmj.com|accessdate=May 31, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815233425/http://ircmj.com/291.fulltext|archivedate=August 15, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Zahrawi was the first physician to describe an [[ectopic pregnancy]], and the first physician to identify the hereditary nature of [[haemophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook to Life in the Medieval World | first1=Madeleine Pelner | last1=Cosman | first2=Linda Gale | last2=Jones | publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] | year=2008 |series=Handbook to Life Series |volume=2 | isbn=978-0-8160-4887-8 | pages=528–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Hygiene#Medical hygiene|hygienic]] practices, Rhazes, who was once asked to choose the site for a new hospital in Baghdad, suspended pieces of meat at various points around the city, and recommended building the hospital at the location where the meat putrefied most slowly.&lt;ref name=ncbi/&gt;

For [[Islamic scholars]], Indian and Greek physicians and medical researchers [[Sushruta]], [[Galen]], Mankah, [[Atreya]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Charaka]], and [[Agnivesa]] were pre-eminent authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Elgood, ''A Medical History of Persia and the Eastern Caliphate'', (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make the Indian and Greek tradition more accessible, understandable, and teachable, Islamic scholars ordered and made more systematic the vast Indian and Greco-Roman medical knowledge by writing encyclopedias and summaries. Sometimes, past scholars were criticized, like Rhazes who criticized and refuted Galen's revered theories, most notably, the [[Humorism|Theory of Humors]] and was thus accused of ignorance.&lt;ref name=ncbi&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Air of History (Part IV): Great Muslim Physicians Al Rhazes| pmc=3752886 | pmid=23983918 | doi=10.4103/1995-705X.115499| volume=14| issue=2 | year=2013| journal=Heart Views| pages=93–5 | last1 = Hajar | first1 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was through 12th-century [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Arabic translations]] that medieval Europe rediscovered [[Ancient Greek medicine|Hellenic medicine]], including the works of Galen and Hippocrates, and discovered [[Ayurveda|ancient Indian medicine]], including the works of [[Sushruta]] and [[Charaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pharmacognosy: An Indian perspective|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UQ8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=|author=K.

Apart from the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]], and [[Euphrates]], navigable rivers were uncommon in the Middle East, so transport by sea was very important. Navigational sciences were highly developed, making use of a rudimentary [[sextant]] (known as a kamal). When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. Muslim sailors were also responsible for reintroducing large, three-masted merchant vessels to the [[Mediterranean]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The name [[caravel]] may derive from an earlier [[Arab]] boat known as the ''qārib''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/shiplab/01George/caravela/htmls/Caravel%20History.htm |title=History of the caravel |publisher=Nautarch.tamu.edu |accessdate=2011-04-13 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YFFdE691?url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/shiplab/01George/caravela/htmls/Caravel%20History.htm# |archive-date=2015-05-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslims went to [[Islam during the Song dynasty|China]] to trade, and these Muslims began to have a great economic influence on the country.

Manuscript illumination was an important art, and [[Persian miniature]] painting flourished in the [[Persianate world]]. [[Calligraphy]], an essential aspect of written [[Arabic language|Arabic]], developed in manuscripts and architectural decoration.

===Architecture===

The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (in [[Tunisia]]), the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world excluding Turkey and the Balkans,&lt;ref name="kairouan mosque"&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=IaM9AAAAIAAJ |page=104 }} |title=John Stothoff Badeau and John Richard Hayes, '&amp;#39;The Genius of Arab civilization: source of Renaissance'&amp;#39;. |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis  |page=104 |accessdate=2014-04-11|isbn=9780262081368 |date=1983-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the best preserved and most significant examples of early great mosques.

The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] in Iraq was completed in 847. It combined the hypostyle architecture of rows of columns supporting a flat base, above which a huge spiralling [[minaret]] was constructed.

The beginning of construction of the [[Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba|Great Mosque at Cordoba]] in 785 marked the beginning of Islamic architecture in Spain and Northern Africa. The mosque is noted for its striking interior arches. Moorish architecture reached its peak with the construction of the [[Alhambra]], the magnificent palace/fortress of [[Granada]], with its open and breezy interior spaces adorned in red, blue, and gold. The walls are decorated with stylized foliage motifs, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions, and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] design work, with walls covered in [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrically patterned]] glazed tiles.

Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today, the most defining examples include the Al Azhar University and the [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Al Hakim mosque]].

==Decline==

===Invasions===
[[File:Isle of Graia3.jpg|thumb|[[Trade routes]] inherited by the Muslim civilization were ruined by invading [[Mongol]]s, which according to [[Ibn Khaldun]] ruined economies]]
In 1206, [[Genghis Khan]] established a powerful dynasty among the [[Mongol]]s of [[central Asia]]. During the 13th century, this [[Mongol Empire]] conquered most of the Eurasian land mass, including China in the east and much of the old Islamic caliphate (as well as [[Kievan Rus']]) in the west. The [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destruction of Baghdad]] and the [[House of Wisdom]] by [[Hulagu Khan]] in 1258 has been seen by some as the end of the Islamic Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=3qwuhK3BBH8C |page=215 }} |title=William Wager Cooper and Piyu Yue (2008), '&amp;#39;Challenges of the Muslim world: present, future and past'&amp;#39;, Emerald Group Publishing, page 215 |publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-11 |isbn=9780444532435 |year=2008 |last1=Cooper |first1=William W. |last2=Yue |first2=Piyu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|Ottoman conquest of the Arabic-speaking Middle East]] in 1516-17 placed the traditional heart of the Islamic world under Ottoman Turkish control. The rational sciences continued to flourish in the Middle East during the Ottoman period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=El-Rouhayeb |first=Khaled |title=Islamic Intellectual History in the Seventeenth Century: Scholarly Currents in the Ottoman Empire and the Maghreb |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-107-04296-4 |pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
To account for the decline of Islamic science, it has been argued that the Sunni Revival in the 11th and 12th centuries produced a series of institutional changes that decreased the relative payoff to producing scientific works. With the spread of madrasas and the greater influence of religious leaders, it became more lucrative to produce religious knowledge. This is easily refutable, as the scholars of the golden age were experts in both religious and secular fields, with many of the Islamic schools of thoughts having been established during the golden age itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Religion and the Rise and Fall of Islamic Science|url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/chaney/publications/religion-and-rise-and-fall-islamic-science|website = scholar.harvard.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222142744/http://scholar.harvard.edu/chaney/publications/religion-and-rise-and-fall-islamic-science#|archive-date = 2015-12-22|dead-url = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]] has rejected the thesis that lack of creative thinking was a cause, arguing that science was always kept separate from religious argument; he instead analyzes the decline in terms of economic and political factors, drawing on the work of the 14th-century writer [[Ibn Khaldun]]. Al-Hassan extended the golden age up to the 16th century, noting that scientific activity continued to flourish up until then.&lt;ref name=Hassan-Decline&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hassan |first=Ahmad Y |title=Factors Behind the Decline of Islamic Science After the Sixteenth Century |url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%208.html |encyclopedia=Islam and the Challenge of Modernity, Proceedings of the Inaugural Symposium on Islam and the Challenge of Modernity: Historical and Contemporary Contexts, Kuala Lumpur, August 1–5, 1994 |editor=Sharifah Shifa Al-Attas |publisher=International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization (ISTAC)|date=1996 |pages=351–399 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150434/http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%208.html |archivedate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other contemporary scholars have also extended it to around the 16th to 17th centuries, and analysed the decline in terms of political and economic factors.&lt;ref name=Saliba/&gt;&lt;ref name=King/&gt; More recent research has challenged the notion that it underwent decline even at that time, citing a revival of works produced on rational scientific topics during the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=El-Rouayheb |first=Khaled |title=The Myth of "The Triumph of Fanaticism" in the Seventeenth-Century Ottoman Empire |journal=Die Welt des Islams |volume=48 |year=2008 |pages=196–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=El-Rouayheb |first=Khaled |title=Opening the Gate of Verification: The Forgotten Arab-Islamic Florescence of the 17th Century |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=38 |year=2006 |pages=263–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
Economic historian Joel Mokyr has argued that Islamic philosopher [[al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111) "was a key figure in the decline in Islamic science", as his works contributed to rising [[mysticism]] and [[occasionalism]] in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

'''Ittifaq al-Muslimin''' (''The Union of the Muslims''; {{Lang-tt|Иттифак әл-мөслимин}}, ''{{Lang|tt|İttifaq âl-Möslimin}}'', {{Lang-ru|Иттифа́к аль-Муслими́н}})  was a liberal-democratic party of [[Muslims]] in [[Russian Empire]]. The party was formed after ''The First Congress of Muslims of Russia'' and the party line was similar to [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]]. It was dominated by [[Volga Tatars|Volga Tatar]] intellectuals, but also included [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]] and [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] representatives.

The main elements of Ittifaq's program were constitutional monarchy, recognition of [[democracy|democratic]] [[Political freedom|freedom]]s, distribution of state available land and [[alpawıt|landowners]]' redeemable land to peasants, equality of [[religion]]s, restitution of [[mosque]]s and [[madrassa]]s belongings to Muslims, etc.

The founders of Ittifaq were Äbüsoğud Äxtämev, [[Yusuf Akçura]], Säyetgäräy Alkin, [[Ismail Gasprinski]], R. İbrahimov, [[Alimardan Topchubashov]], Sälimgäräy Canturin, Äxmäthadi Maqsudi, etc. Permanently worked Central Committee and Central Bureau were elected. Ittifaq played a major part within Muslim fraction of [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">'''Jakob Rudnik''' (24 March 1894&amp;ndash;13 March 1963&lt;ref name="Litten"&gt;Litten, F.S. "The Noulens Case", ''The China Quarterly'', no. 138, June 1994, ''pp.'' 492-512&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born agent for the ''Otdel Mezhdunarodny Sviasy'' (OMS), which was the [[Communist International]]'s [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]], translated as the [[International Liaison Department (Comintern)|International Liaison Department]].

==Noulens Affair==
Rudnik rose to notoriety in 1931 under the [[Nom de guerre#Nom de guerre|nom de guerre]] '''Hilaire Noulens''' when he was arrested in [[Shanghai]] along with his wife Tatiana Moissenko by the Special Branch of the [[Shanghai Municipal Police]].

As a result of the actions of the [[Propaganda|propagandist]] [[Willi Münzenberg]] an international press furore was generated about the case. Celebrities such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]], [[Soong Ching-ling|Madame Sun Yat-sen]], and [[Henri Barbusse]] became involved in the International Noulens/Ruegg Defence Committee that was established and the case was discussed in both the British House of Commons and the [[United States Senate]].

News of the couple's fate, which had previously been the subject of press speculation, was soon overshadowed by events following the Japanese invasion of the Chinese administered areas of the city of Shanghai on 28 January 1932, following the [[Mukden Incident]].

==Later discoveries==
For almost 60 years, the identity of Noulens was incorrectly thought to be '''[[Paul Ruegg]]'''.  Thus, in the few works that deal with the arrest of Rudnik and his wife on 15 June 1931, this mistake is common.&lt;ref name="Litten" /&gt;

In his memoir ''Witness'' (1952), Whittaker Chambers refers to the "Noulens Affair" as the "Robinson-Rubens Case" and refers to Rudnik and "'''Richard Robinson-Rubens'''."&lt;ref name=chambers&gt;

[[Image:Religion in SF.png|thumb|300px|Science fiction often portrays real religions being exported to alien planets]]
[[Science fiction]] will sometimes address the topic of [[religion]]. Often [[List of religious ideas in fantasy fiction|religious themes]] are used to convey a broader message, but others confront the subject head-on—contemplating, for example, how attitudes towards faith might shift in the wake of ever-advancing technological progress, or offering creative scientific explanations for the apparently mystical events related in religious texts (gods as aliens, prophets as time travelers, etc.).  As an exploratory medium, science fiction rarely takes religion at face value by simply accepting or rejecting it; when religious themes are presented, they tend to be investigated deeply.

Some science fiction works portray invented religions, either placed into a contemporary Earth society (such as the [[Earthseed]] religion in [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Parable of the Sower]]''), or in the far future (as seen in ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by [[Frank Herbert]], with its [[Orange Catholic Bible]]).  Other works examine the role of existing religions in a futuristic or alternate society.  The classic [[Canticle for Leibowitz]] explores a world in which [[Catholicism]] is one of the few institutions to survive an apocalypse, and chronicles its slow re-achievement of prominence as civilisation returns.

[[Christian science fiction]] also exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John| last=Mort| title=Christian Fiction: a Guide to the genre| publisher=Libraries Unlimited| year=2002| isbn=1-56308-871-1| pages=159–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes written as [[allegory]] for inspirational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sammons| first=Martha C.| title="A Better Country": The Worlds of Religious Fantasy and Science Fiction| publisher=Greenwood Press| year=1988| isbn=0-313-25746-9| page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orson Scott Card]] has criticized the genre for oversimplifying religion, which he claims is always shown as "ridiculous and false".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing-world.com/sf/card.shtml "On Religion in SF and Fantasy: An Interview with Orson Scott Card"]; Writing World online&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Ubik]]'' (1969) by [[Philip K. Dick]] - In the novel a company uses a form of [[cryonic]] suspension to preserve deceased in a state of "half-life" which allows for limited consciousness and the ability to communicate.

==Angels==
{{See also|Angels|List of fictional angels}}

*In ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' (1938; part of the [[Space Trilogy]]), by [[C. S. Lewis]], the protagonist meets "eldila", mysterious beings of light native to the void of interplanetary space (who are actually what Christianity defines as "angels", and who are also identified as [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and other deities of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]), and are completely loyal and obedient to God, and have never wanted to be worshiped as gods themselves (although the ancient Greeks and Romans mistakenly did so)

==Creation myths==
{{See also|Creation myth|Cosmogony}}

* The film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) explores the myth that human life did not arise spontaneously by chance, but that a humanoid species, the "Engineers", [[Ancient astronauts in popular culture|created life on Earth]]. They also taught humans how to use technology and visited the Earth sporadically.  Some elements are similar to the [[Ancient Aliens]] myths.  The story develops when a scientific expedition travels to confront their creators.{{disputed inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- this template replaced the text &amp;lt;sup&gt;[Not a creation myth?]&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;
* In the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) based on [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', Roy Batty is an [[Android (robot)|artificial person]] looking to confront his creator, while Rick Deckard searches for lost humanity despite his job: hunting and "retiring" runaway [[replicants]].{{disputed inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- this template replaced the text &amp;lt;sup&gt;[Not a creation myth?]&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;

* The short story ''[[The Last Question]]'' (1956) by [[Isaac Asimov]] – Humans of the future ask the [[supercomputer]] [[Multivac]] how the net amount of [[entropy]] of the universe can be massively decreased. Multivac fails, displaying the error message "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER". The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally [[heat death of the universe|the universe dies]] with the exception of Cosmic AC – Multivac's final successor. At that point it has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Multivac drew all of humanity into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Multivac did decipher the answer, announcing "[[Let there be light|Let there be light!]]".
* The early part of [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' provides a detailed Creation myth, with the world being created through the singing of [[Angel]]-like beings under the direction of God. Similar to the [[Christian]] account of [[The War in Heaven]], this myth includes the rebellion of Melkor (equivalent of [[Lucifer]]/[[Satan]]) but considerably different in detail from the Christian account.

==Demons==
{{See also|Demons|List of fictional demons}}

* In the [[Doom series|''Doom'' series]] demons from Hell have come into the universe through an inter-dimensional portal which is located on Mars.
* In ''[[Princess of Wands]]'' by [[John Ringo]], a Christian housewife and soccer mom gets involved in an organization which co-operates with the FBI in dealing with demons.
* In ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], the villains of the story are guided by beings they call "macrobes" which are clearly meant to be demons.
* In ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' series, some of the villains of the story appear to be demons, beings of immense power and strength. They can be summoned by certain groups of people with arcane knowledge. They are known as daemons, and the people who hunt them, daemon hunters.

==Devil==
{{See also|Devil|Devil in popular culture}}

* The TV series, ''[[Futurama]]'', features a recurring character called the [[Robot Devil]]
* In the 1975 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Pyramids of Mars]]", the Doctor states that Satan is one of the names the last of the Osirians, Sutekh (who considers all life his enemy), is known by.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor: "Serve you, Sutekh? Your name is abominated in every civilized world, whether that name be Set, Satan, Sodos..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1978 sci-fi TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', the two part episode "[[War of the Gods (Battlestar Galactica)|War Of The Gods]]" features a character very much like the Devil who is portrayed by Patrick Macnee. His name is [[Count Iblis]] — Iblis being the Islamic name of the Devil.
* The 2006 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes "[[The Impossible Planet]]" and "[[The Satan Pit]]" feature an ancient being known as the Beast, which claims to be the basis of the Devil figure in all religions and mythologies; earlier in "[[The Dæmons]]", it is shown a race resembling the typical image of the Devil had visited Earth and become the basis for both Gods and Demons.
* In ''[[Perelandra]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], the protagonist must fight against a man possessed by a demon, hinted to be the devil himself.
* ''[[Ubik]]'' (1969) by [[Philip K. Dick]] - In the novel a company uses a form of [[cryonic]] suspension to give deceased limited consciousness and the ability to communicate. Ella is in such a state of "half-life" and instructs the protagonist who also appears to be in such a state on the usage of the spray "Ubik", whose name is derived from the Latin word "[[ubiquitous|ubique]]" (meaning "everywhere") which can preserve people who are in half-life. As the protagonist finds himself in an increasingly regressing world it is discovered that Jory Miller, another half-lifer, is the cause of this as he devours the life force of other people who are in [[suspended animation]] in order to prolong his own existence. While Ubik can be seen as a metaphor for God&lt;ref name="tessa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fitting/&gt; Jory Miller can be seen as an allegorical representation of the Devil.&lt;ref name=fitting&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitting|first1=Peter|title=''Ubik'': The Deconstruction of Bourgeois SF|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/5/fitting5art.htm|website=depauw.edu|publisher=Science Fiction Studies|accessdate=27 June 2015|date=March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the episode [[Rick and Morty (season 1)#ep9|"Something Ricked This Way Comes"]] (2014) of the science fiction comedy television series ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' a character "Summer" reports to her first job in an antique shop run by the Devil that sells items that fulfill a desire for the owner but come at a price making the item essentially worthless (the shop and the Devil's name, Mr. Needful, are both references and parodies of the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Needful Things]]''). During the episode a protagonist "Rick" sets up a competitive counter-business across the street that removes the [[curse]]s and runs the Devil out of business. The Devil is so dismayed that he tries to kill himself but Summer finds himself in the middle of his [[suicide]] attempt and revives him. They relaunch with a new dot-com company that becomes wildly successful. As it turns out, the Devil had no plans to include Summer in reaping the profits and has her hauled off by security. Betrayed by the Devil, she and Rick build muscle mass to get physical revenge.

* In the far future of ''[[Le Dernier Homme]]'' (1805) by [[Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville]] Earth is becoming sterile and the human ability to reproduce is failing. A man travels to the last fertile woman to begin a rebirth of the human race and at return meets [[Adam]], the first man, who has been condemned by God to watch all the damned among his descendants enter Hell, and is now charged with persuading the pair not to prolong the life of humanity, which God has determined must now end. The world then begins to end the dead to rise from their graves while Ormus, the spirit of Earth, who cannot survive without humanity, despairs.

* At the end of ''[[Tau Zero]]'' (1970) by [[Poul Anderson]] the universe collapses in a [[big crunch]] and then explodes in a new [[big bang]]. However, the starship with the book's protagonists on board survives because there is still enough uncondensed hydrogen for maneuvering, outside the monobloc, and eventually they could colonize one of the new universe's planets.
* ''[[Manifold: Time]]'' (1999) by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] begins at the end of space and time, when the last descendants of humanity face an infinite but pointless existence. Due to [[proton decay]] the physical universe has collapsed, but some form of intelligence has survived by embedding itself into a lossless computing substrate where it can theoretically survive indefinitely.  However, because there will never be new input, eventually all possible thoughts will be exhausted.  Some portion of this intelligence decides that this should not have been the [[ultimate fate of the universe]], and takes action to change the past, centering around the early 21st century.
* ''[[Left Behind]]'' is a series of 16 best-selling novels by [[Tim LaHaye]] and [[Jerry B. Jenkins]], dealing with [[Christianity|Christian]] [[dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] [[End Times]]: the [[Pretribulationism|pretribulation]], [[Premillennialism|premillennial]], [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatological]] viewpoint of the [[apocalypse|end of the world]]. The primary conflict of the series is the members of the Tribulation Force against the [[Global Community]] and its leader [[Nicolae Carpathia]]—the [[Antichrist]].

{{See also|Evangelism}}

* In [[S. M. Stirling]]'s [[Nantucket series|''Nantucket'' series]], the entire island of [[Nantucket]] is suddenly transported into the past, to about 1300 BC and the modern Americans marooned in the past must make the best of the Bronze Age world in which they find themselves; the Christians among them face the dilemma of whether or not to embark on missionary activity and spread their religion - even though Jesus Christ had not yet been born, and the very act of their spreading Christianity might so fundamentally change the world that Jesus might never be born at all
* In ''[[The Sparrow (novel)|The Sparrow]]'', by [[Mary Doria Russell]], most of the Jesuit missionaries sent to investigate a radio transmission from an unknown planet (believing that they have been chosen by God to be the first to set foot on an alien world) are killed by the planet's inhabitants; and the sole survivor is enslaved but eventually escapes and returns to Earth with his faith in tatters

==Fictional religions==
{{See also|List of fictional religions}}
&lt;!--Inclusion criteria: there has to be an article on the fictional religion or at least a considerable coverage of it in the book's/film's article.--&gt;

* A main theme of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968) is the fictional religion "[[Mercerism]]". It is Earth's main religion, in which Empathy Boxes link simultaneous users into a [[collective consciousness]] based on the suffering of Wilbur Mercer. In the shared experience of the Empathy Box, Wilbur Mercer takes an endless walk up a mountain while stones are thrown at him, the pain of which all users share. Television broadcasts of "Buster Friendly" represent a second religion, designed to undermine Mercerism.
* The [[Earthseed]] religion in [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]''
* The [[Vedek (Star Trek)|Bajoran religion]] – ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''
* ''Cavism'' in [[Gore Vidal]]'s novel ''[[Messiah (Vidal novel)|Messiah ]]'' - a religion founded by John Cave, an American undertaker. Cave teaches, among other things, not to fear death and to actually desire it under certain circumstances. Later followers come to glorify death, and even enforce it on other members. The founder John Cave is himself ironically killed by his followers when he proves inconvenient for the new religion's development. Cavism eventually completely displaces and destroys Christianity, even to the extent of all [[Gothic Cathedrals]] being blown up and destroyed to erase all trace of it.
* The [[Klingon culture#Religion|Klingon religion]] and various other religions from ''[[Star Trek]]''
* [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Buddislam]], Maometh Saari, [[Mahayana Christianity]], [[Zensunni|Zensunni Catholicism]] in [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series
* [[Bokononism]] and  in ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]]
* [[Chernobog]], the Satanic, cannibalistic, human-sacrificing god whose worship displaced Christianity in the remnants of [[Russia]] in the post-apocalyptic world of [[The Peshawar Lancers]] by [[S. M. Stirling]].  
* [[Church of All Worlds]] (inspired a non-fictional religious group of the same name) and other religions from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]
* Church of the Second Chance in [[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Riverworld]] series.
* [[Cylon (reimagining)#Religion|Cylon]] monotheistic religion – ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''

* [[Foundationism]] – ''[[Babylon 5]]''
* [[After Ford|Fordism]] – ''[[Brave New World]]''
* The [[Philosophy and religion in Star Wars|various religions]] ([[Sith]], [[Jedi]]) of ''[[Star Wars]]''
* Gorgolorism. In L. Sprague de Camp's ''The Goblin Tower'', the city state of Tarxia is a theocracy dominated by the priesthood of the frog god Gorgolor, who is cinsidered the One True God. In other places, Gorgolor is just a minor god in a big Pantheon. However, saying that in Tarxia might result in being burned as a heretic.
* [[Goa'uld]] religion – most Goa'uld pose as gods to control slave armies. "Goa'uld" means "God" in the [[Goa'uld language]] from the television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''
* Hemilkism in ''[[The Gate of Time]]'' by [[Philip José Farmer]] - in an [[alternate history]] where there never was a [[Roman Empire]] and European culture has many [[Abrahamic religions|Semitic]] elements, a major religion was founded in the Fourteenth Century by a charismatic Irish religious figure named [[Hamilcar |Hemilka]]. While having some resemblances to Christianity, Hemilkism is not an imperialist faith and therefore does not dominate its world in the way Christianity does in ours.
* Monism (specifically, Evangelical Monism) in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]''. In the last decades of the 21st Century, great waves of Monist proselyting swept out of [[Persia]] and numerous Westerners were converted. Two generations later, when the plot takes place, Evangelical Monism is one of the main religious denominations in the US, many American families observing the Monist ritual of lighting the Lamp of Peace during dinner. From references in the book, the Monist faith appears to be [[Deist]]ic, with a generalized acceptance of a deity having no particular defining characteristics or abilities, and including significant elements of [[Fire worship]] - suggesting the influence [[Mazdaism]], the pre-Islamic fire-worshiping religion of Persia. For such a religion to be strongly established in modern Persia/Iran implies a major upheaval in the position of Islam there - for which Heinlein provides no information [http://members.iglou.com/jtmajor/TunlSky.htm]. 
* [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] religion - the main antagonist in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' after the fall of the [[Goa'uld]]. Ori, ascended beings, relatives and mortal enemies of the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], thrive on the life force stolen from their worshippers. The clash is finally resolved in the movie ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''.
* [[Church of Science]] – the bogus religion established by [[Salvor Hardin]] in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''
* ''Soterism'' - in the [[alternate history]] of [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Aristotle and the Gun]]'', Christianity never arose. Its place during the Roman Empire was taken by Soterism, an Egypto-Hellenic synthesis founded by a fiery Egyptian prophet, whose followers called him "Soter" - the Greek word for "Savior". Soterism did not become as powerful as  Christianity in the history we know, with [[Mitraism]] and [[Odin]]ism surviving at its side. In later times, followers of these religions hounded the scientist Georg Schwartzhorn (much as [[Galileo]] was persecuted in our history).   
* [[Church of Humanity Unchained]] - the primary religion of the [[Grayson (Honorverse)|Grayson]] and [[List of locations in the Honorverse#M|Masada]] systems in the [[Honorverse]]. (Two churches, with one origin, but now mutually implacably hostile, with massively different theologies.)
* In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s story "Equinoctial"&lt;ref&gt;Included in "Picnic on Nearside", New York, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Rings of Saturn]] are inhabited by the followers of two mutually-antagonistic religions. ''The Church of Cosmic Engineering'' (informally ''The Engineers''), founded by Ringpainter the Great, considers it a Sacred Duty to paint red the Rings of Saturn - a duty holy enough to be worth the devoting of one's entire lifetime to it. The opposing ''Conservationist Church'' (''Consers'' in short) is equally certain that painting the Rings is the Ultimate Sacrilege and that undoing all such painting ''is'' the task to which one should devote one's life. The two are involved in a centuries-long, fierce [[religious war]] - both equally certain that the issue of painting or unpainting the Rings fully justifies killing on sight any member of the opposing Church (see [[Eight Worlds#Symbiotic spacesuits]]).

* In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode, "[[Who Watches the Watchers]]", a serious accident with a hidden scientific observation post starts a chain of events that leads to a primitive civilization becoming convinced that the [[Starfleet]] personnel are divine beings with Capt. [[Jean-Luc Picard]] being the supreme one; and the crew of the Enterprise struggle to prevent the reestablishment of religion in the civilization.
* In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[Who Mourns for Adonais?]]", the Enterprise crew encounters an alien figure who is the ancient Greek god, Apollo.
* In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel, ''[[VALIS]]'', the protagonist faces an all-powerful God who subtly manipulates the actions and thoughts of humans in an effort to redeem humanity.
* ''[[Ubik]]'' (1969) by [[Philip K. Dick]] - The protagonist Joe Chip is part of a team that was hired to secure the lunar facilities of a company that uses a form of [[cryonic]] suspension to give deceased limited consciousness and the ability to communicate from telepaths. Ubik, whose name is derived from the Latin word "[[ubiquitous|ubique]]" (meaning "everywhere"), can preserve people who are in half-life. Dick's former wife Tessa remarked that "Ubik is a metaphor for God. Ubik is all-powerful and all-knowing, and Ubik is everywhere. The spray can is only a form that Ubik takes to make it easy for people to understand it and use it".&lt;ref name="tessa"&gt;[http://tessadick.blogspot.com/2008/12/ubik-explained-sort-of.html UBIK Explained, sort of]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Tessa Dick, It's a Philip K.

* The protagonist of ''[[The Worthing Saga]]'', by [[Orson Scott Card]], keeps himself in hidden stasis over the years, and becomes the target of worship by the descendants of the very settlers that he delivered to a new world
* [[James K. Morrow]]'s [[James K. Morrow#The Godhead Trilogy|''Godhead'' trilogy]] considers the literal death of God, when the two-mile-long corpse of God is found floating at sea. In the first volume, ''[[Towing Jehovah]]'' (Harcourt Brace, 1994) the angel Raphael calls on supertanker captain Anthony Van Horne to tow the body to an icy tomb in the north, while the faithful and unbelieving alike seek to deal with the fallout of the death of God.
* In the short story ''[[The Last Question]]'' (1956) by [[Isaac Asimov]] humans of the future ask the [[supercomputer]] [[Multivac]] how the net amount of [[entropy]] of the universe can be massively decreased. Multivac fails, displaying the error message "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER". The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally [[heat death of the universe|the universe dies]] with the exception of Cosmic AC – Multivac's final successor. At that point it has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Multivac drew all of humanity into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Multivac did decipher the answer, announcing "[[Let there be light|Let there be light!]]" and essentially ascending to the state of God [[Genesis 1:3|in the Old Testament]].
* In [[Sara Paretsky]]'s novel [[Ghost Country (novel)|Ghost Country]] an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Fertility goddess]] calling herself Starr appears in present-day [[Chicago]]. She exudes an overwhelming sexuality, affecting both men and women, and attracts an enormous crowd of worshipers, especially from among Chicago's poor and homeless. To the chagrin and scandal of Protestant and Catholic clergy alike, she emulates many of the miracles of Jesus Christ - feeding many people with minute amounts of food, healing the sick and also bringing the dead back to life. Finally she is lynched by a mob of bigoted Christians inside one of the city's most prestigious churches - but her body unaccountably disappears from the morgue three days later, though no one actually saw her rise. Thus disappearing, she has had an enormous - and on whole, positive - impact on the lives of all the book's cast of characters.
* In the universal roleplaying setting Nova Praxis, a supercomputer with the ability to process theoretical environments encompassing all laws of physics, was created. It started inventing all kinds of obscure technology and jumped human technology and civilization forwards by over a millennium, before suddenly shutting down after 3 months of work, likely due to system overload. The computer, called Mimir (Pronounced "me-mer"), is considered by some to be a deity, prophesied to return to gift humanity with the ultimate ascension, and the virtual-reality library that contains all the data produced by "her", called "The black library" due to its black-and-white design, is considered a holy place of pilgrimage. &lt;ref&gt;Nova Praxis, Savage Worlds edition, Void Star Studios&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heaven and paradise==
{{See also|Heaven|Paradise|#Afterlife}}

* "The Reformers" (''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'' #20) — When three space men dressed in scifi versions of religious garb land on a planet to "free it of evil;" they are greeted by a man named Peter who informs them they are not needed (for there is no crime, no immorality, nor any of the evils seen in other societies); so they plan to create evil for which they can blame literature, clothing, and alcohol (as they have done on previous worlds)—including Earth—they are contracted by their leader (the Devil) who informs that their efforts are doomed...because they have landed in Heaven.
* In an [[Alternate ending|alternate scene]] of ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) astronaut Elizabeth Shaw who survived the clash with god-like aliens who turned out to be rather malicious asks the [[Artificial general intelligence|AI]] David to navigate a stranded alien spaceship toward where the alien came from instead of back to Earth, saying "I don't want to go back to where we came from...I want to go where they came from...I want to go to paradise."&lt;ref&gt;[http://alienexplorations.blogspot.de/2012/07/questions-about-god-and-paradise-lost.html Questions about God and Paradise Lost (Source Quotes)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alternatescene&gt;Quote from the alternate scene:

* In ''[[Behold the Man (novel)|Behold the Man]]'', by [[Michael Moorcock]], twentieth-century [[Karl Glogauer]] (a Jew obsessed with the figures of Jesus and [[Carl Jung]]), travels in time to the year 28 A.D. where he meets various New Testament figures (such as [[John the Baptist]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]), and discovers that Mary and Joseph's child, Jesus, is a mentally retarded hunchback, who could never become the Jesus as is portrayed in the Scriptures, and after having a mental breakdown, steps into the role of Jesus, eventually dying on the cross (having specifically asked [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] to betray him)
* In ''[[The Didymus Contingency]]'', by [[Jeremy Robinson]], a scientist's time-travel to see Jesus' death and resurrection—only to witness several scenes not recorded in the New Testament (while realizing Jesus was a fraud)—faces the dilemma of whether or not to make a revelation in the present which would shake the foundations of Christianity is complicated further with the appearance of an assassin from a different future...&lt;ref&gt;Note: The Didymus of the title is the [[Thomas the Apostle|Apostle Saint Thomas]], whose initial skepticism of the resurrection earned him the title "[[Doubting Thomas]]".&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Last Starship from Earth]]'', by [[John Boyd (author)|John Boyd]], is set in a ''[[dystopian]]'' society in the very near future (in an alternate timeline) where Jesus Christ became a revolutionary agitator and was never subjected to crucifixion; and who overthrew the Roman Empire by force of arms, and established a theocracy that has lasted until the twentieth century
* In [[Garry Kilworth]]'s story ''[[Let's Go to Golgotha!]]'', tourists from the future can book a time-traveling "Crucifixion Tour", but before setting out, they are strictly told that, when the crowd is asked whether Jesus or [[Barabbas]] should be spared, they must all join the call: "Give us Barabbas!"—however, when the moment comes, the protagonist suddenly realizes that the crowd condemning Jesus to the cross is composed ''entirely'' of tourists from the future, and that no actual Jewish Israelites of 33 A.D. are present at all
* When the protagonists of [[Clifford Simak]]'s ''[[Mastodonia]]'' make trips to the past commercially available, American church groups band together and seek to purchase an exclusive franchise for Jesus' time on Earth—not because they want to go there but because they do not want anyone at all to go there (the clergymen state quite forthrightly their apprehension that time travel would disprove some of the accounts given in the Gospels and thus undermine Christianity)—when refused, the church groups turn aggressive and energetically lobby Congress to ban time travel altogether; opening an enormous theological debate unresolved by the end of the book
* [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1949 story "The Man," reprinted in ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'', tells of a miracle worker who matches the description of Jesus and who travels from planet to planet, healing and teaching. When a spaceship lands on one such planet and is told that the miracle worker had been there just the day before, the arrogant captain vows to chase him down through space until he catches him. After the captain blasts off again in search of the man, another spaceman, who chose to remain behind because of his faith having been awakened by the faith of the people on that planet, is told that the man is still there.
* In ''[[The Rescuer]]'', by [[Arthur Porges]], future scientists destroy a three-billion dollar time-travel project because a religious fanatic had taken over the machine, heading for [[Golgotha]] with a rifle and five thousand rounds in an attempt to save Jesus and the affair must be kept from the public, since some might identify with "The Rescuer"
* ''[[Resurrection Day (Wyckoff novel)|Resurrection Day]]'' (1999) by [[Thomas Wyckoff]], is about a man sent back into time to steal Jesus' body to disprove Christianity
* In ''[[There Will Be Time]]'', by [[Poul Anderson]], a young twentieth-century American (who has discovered that he has the ability to travel through time without any need of a machine) reasons that there must be others like him and that Jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion is a good place to try locating them, goes there and walks through the street singing the Greek mass (which is meaningless to people of the time), but get himself located by agents of a time-travel policing organization, who take him to their headquarters in the far future—without getting to see Jesus at all
* In the ''[[TimeWars]]'' series by [[Simon Hawke]], set in 2461, Cardinal Lodovico Consorti proposes to use the recently discovered time-travel technology to obtain empirical proof that Christ indeed rose from the dead after being crucified, causing the Catholic Church to excommunicate him (the Church hierarchy preferring to continue relying on faith alone and not seeking factual confirmation)
* ''[[Times Without Number]]'', by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], depicts an alternate reality in which the [[Spanish Armada]] had conquered England; and when time travel is discovered—controlled by the Catholic Church—it is decreed that every new pope would be privileged to travel to Palestine in the time of Christ's ministry, while everyone else is strictly forbidden to go there
* In ''[[The Traveller (1954 novel)|The Traveller]]'', by [[Richard Matheson]], a confirmed skeptic is chosen to be the first to travel in time to see the crucifixion (in a kind of traveling cage which makes him invisible to the people of the past) and he witnesses the actual event, causing him to feel empathy for Jesus; and is hauled back to the present after attempting to save him; and, although he had seen no miracles, he is a changed man, having seen "a man giving up his life for the things he believed" and stating, "that should be miracle enough for everybody"
* The plot of ''[[Jesus Video]]'', a German novel by [[Andreas Eschbach]], revolves around the search for a hidden video camera that is believed to hold digital footage of Jesus recorded by a time traveler&lt;ref&gt;Note: The book, written in 1997, was adapted into a television movie called ''Das Jesus Video'' in 2002. The film was released in English under the title ''The Hunt for the Hidden Relic'' (or ''Hidden Relic'').&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Robert Silverberg]]'s ''[[Up the Line]]'', featuring a company organizing tours into the past, a character notes that "the crowd at the [[Sermon on the Mount]] grows bigger and bigger, every time I go there again"
* In one of the episodes of [[Philip José Farmer]]'s Riverworld series, Jesus was resurrected in a manner completely different from that depicted in Christian theology. Along with millions of other people from all times and places in history, he was given a new, completely human, life along the banks of a mysterious long river on another planet. In this depiction, the revived Jesus is a Jew who never intended to found a new religion, and when encountering Christians from later ages he does not recognize himself in the Divine Jesus which they believe in. He is delighted to encounter an Israelite woman who took part in the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt and whose eye-witness account of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron|Aharon]] is substantially different from that in the Bible. Eventually Jesus is tortured to death by a rabidly antisemitic Medieval German Baron, who angrily rejects the very idea that this Jew might be Jesus. Before dying again, Jesus cries out: "Father, they ''do'' know what they are doing!". &lt;ref&gt;Published in "Down in the Black Gang" (1971) {{ISBN|0-451-04805-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Another Son of God==

* In the [[alternate history]] timeline of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[In High Places (Turtledove novel)|In High Places]]'', in which the [[Black Plague]] was much worse than in our history, there appeared in the city of [[Avignon]] at that time of crisis a charismatic religious leader named Henri, claiming to be "The Second Son of God". He was executed as a heretic. However, on the day after his execution, the church where the Pope and the King of France were worshiping collapsed, killing both of them. This was taken as an act of Divine Retribution and a proof of Henri's claim. Therefore, the worship of Henri as the Second Son of God was officially taken up by the Catholic Church. The life of Henri was described in "The Final Testament", added to the [[New Testament]] (with the name implying that the Church would not welcome any Third Son); churches were henceforward built with two towers, standing for Jesus and Henri; since Henri was [[broken on a wheel]], the Wheel became the symbol of Christianity instead of the Cross; and Avignon remained the permanent seat of the Papacy and became a holy city, with pilgrims flocking to the locations associated with Henri's life and martyrdom. In later times, Christians tended in times of crisis to call on Henri rather than on Jesus. This upheaval in Christian theology had the effect of deepening the hostility between Christianity and  [[Islam]]. The Muslims - grown very powerful due to the Black Plague devastating Europe - [[Jesus in Islam| respected Jesus as a Prophet]], but refused to accord any such status to Henri.
* [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] story ''The Lingering Joy'', a sequel to [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Long Remembering'' &lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Multiverse: Exploring Poul Anderson's Worlds, ed. Greg bear and Gardner Dozois, [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;, depicts a world on the brink of destruction in [[nuclear war]]. A young woman, the story's protagonist, embarks on a kind of "mental time travel", enabling her to experience the life of a Prehistoric ancestress. Her main motivation is religious: to find out whether the [[Incarnation of Jesus]] was a single and unique event, or if God had before incarnated among the Neanderthals, to bring salvation to them, too. She experiences the life of a remote ancestress, a rebellious young Cro-Magnon woman who seeks to prove that she can be the equal of her tribe's male hunters. But while in courage and skill she is fully their equal, she cannot match the male hunters' ruthless cruelty. When visiting the last remaining enclave of the ''Goblins'' (Neanderthals), on the verge of final extinction, she cannot help feeling empathy and compassion for a male Goblin whose mate was raped and murdered by a male of her own tribe. And then she encounters the miraculous baby who was born to the doomed Goblins, his birth heralded by a strange new star which blazed in the sky, tens of thousands of years before the [[Star of Bethlehem]]...

==Theocracy==
{{See also|List of fictional theocracies}}
Depictions of a fictional society dominated by a [[theocracy]] are a recurring theme in science fiction. Such depictions are mostly [[dystopian]], in some cases humorous or satirical and rarely positive.

* ''[[The Accidental Time Machine]]'' (2007) by [[Joe Haldeman]] – [[Jesus Christ]] appears in the [[Oval Office]] and tells the President that the [[Second Coming]] is here - or so the President tells the nation that night.

* ''[[Gather, Darkness (novel)|Gather, Darkness]]'' (1943) by [[Fritz Leiber]] – A dystopian and rather satirical depiction of a future theocracy and the revolution which brings it down.

But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then, again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revaluation of prominent historical figures".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Orwell]], [http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Prevention_of_Literature/0.html "The Prevention of Literature"], ''Polemic'' (January 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Parafaith War]]'' (1996) by [[L. E. Modesitt, Jr.]] is set in a future where humanity has spread to the stars and divided into several factions. Two factions, the "Eco-Tech Coalition" and the "Revenants of the Prophet" are engaged in a futile war over territory and their competing social philosophies. The ecologically-aware Coalition must hold back the zealous "rev" hordes constantly seeking new territory for their ever-expanding theocratic society.
* In [[Robert Merle]]'s novel ''[[Malevil]]'' (1972) [[nuclear war]] devastated the world with an agrarian society slowly starting to reform thereafter. One of the main challenges of this new society is to fend off the threat of a new theocratic [[dictatorship]] that has taken over a neighboring village of the rationalistic community of Malevil castle, which in turn has to begin research into the reinvention of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolfe|first1=Gary K.|title=Evaporating Genres: Essays on Fantastic Literature|isbn=978-0819569370|quote=In Merle’s MaleviI, following the holocaust of nuclear chain-reactions, the rationalistic communal life of Malevil castle under the direction of Emmanuel Comte comes into conflict with an oppressive theocracy imposed on a neighboring village by the hypocritical false priest Fulbert le Naud. The ensuing struggle for supremacy not only validates the humanism of Malevil’s system, but also indirectly validates the need for technology, since the struggle convinces the inhabitants of Malevil that they must begin research into the reinvention of weapons in order to protect their interests and values—despite their acute awareness of what the technology of weaponry can ultimately lead to.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Fifth Sacred Thing]]'' (1993) by [[Starhawk]] residents of a post-apocalyptic [[San Francisco]] live in a utopian sustainable economy which is threatened by an ecologically devastated, violent and overtly-theocratic Christian fundamentalist [[Los Angeles]] that plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and dystopia against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion and American Cultures: Tradition, Diversity, and Popular Expression|page=1143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Szm2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1143|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MountSinaiView.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Mount Sinai]] in 2004.]]
The three major Abrahamic faiths (in chronological order of revelation) are [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Some strict definitions of what constitutes an Abrahamic religion include only these three faiths. However, there are many other religions incorporating Abrahamic doctrine, theology, genealogy and history into their own belief systems.

For example, [[Samaritanism]] is a religion closely related to [[Judaism]], as [[Druzism]], [[Ahmadiyya]] or [[Alevism]] are to [[Islam]]. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers itself a successor to the traditional Abrahamic religions. Somewhat related to Christianity are many [[Gnostic]] sects, as well as [[Mandaeism]]. [[Kurdish people#Religion|Kurdish religion]]s such as the various [[Yazdanism|Yazdani]] faiths are quasi- or post-Abrahamic, [[syncretic]], and may trace some portions of their theology to [[Iranian religions]] and in some cases [[Zoroastrianism]].

Generally speaking, sites significant to most, if not all Abrahamic religions include [[Mount Sinai]] ({{lang-ar|طور سيناء}} ''Ṭūr Sīnā’'', or {{lang|ar|جبل موسى}} ''Jabal Mūsá''; [[Egyptian Arabic]]: ''Gabal Musa'', lit. "Moses' Mountain" or "Mount Moses";             {{lang-he|הר סיני}} ''Har Sinai''; also known as "Mount Horeb"), a mountain in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]] that is the traditional and most accepted location of the [[Biblical Mount Sinai]]. The latter is mentioned many times in the [[Book of Exodus]] in the [[Torah]], the [[Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Hobbs, ''Mount Sinai'' (University of Texas Press) 1995, discusses Mount Sinai as geography, history, ethnology and religion.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=95&amp;tid=58726 |title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir |publisher=Tafsir.com |date=2002-10-26 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam]]ic tradition, the biblical Mount Sinai was the place where [[Moses]] received the [[Ten Commandments]]; the Tomb of Abraham in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]], as well as many other places within the "[[Promised Land]]" region of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. Many of these locations are featured in the history of the [[Jewish people]] and the various Abrahamic [[sacred text]]s such as the Judaic and [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], the [[Torah]], [[Tanakh]] and [[Talmud]]; the [[Christian Bible|Christian]] [[Bible]]; the Qur'an; and under some definitions [[Bahá'í literature]], the Druze [[Kitab Al Hikma]], as well as Yazdani, Ahmadiyya, Alevi and other texts and lore.

[[File:Baha'i arc from archives.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A view of the [[Mansion of Bahji]] from one of the [[Arc (Bahá'í)|Arc]] complex administrative buildings at the Bahá'í World Center in 2005.]]

Located in [[Bahji]], within the [[Arc (Bahá'í)|Arc]] building complex at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] (BWC) on [[Mount Carmel]] in [[Haifa, Israel|Haifa]], near [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Israel]], the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] is the most holy place for Bahá'ís and their ''[[Qiblih]]'', or direction of prayer. It contains the remains of Bahá'u'lláh and is near the spot where he died in the [[Mansion of Bahji]]. Bahá'ís regard Acre (He.: עַכּוֹ ''Akko''; Ar.: عكّا ''ʻAkkā'') itself as their [[holy city]], mostly due to the fact that it serves as the location of Bahá'u'lláh and his family's many affairs. Within Acre, Bahá'í sites include the [[House of `Abbúd]], the [[House of `Abdu'lláh Páshá]], the [[Garden of Ridván, Akka|Garden of Ridván]] and the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#Prison cell of Bahá'u'lláh|Prison cell of Bahá'u'lláh]]&amp;nbsp;– where Bahá'u'lláh was incarcerated.

The second holiest site in the Bahá'í Faith&amp;nbsp;– which is also revered by the few remaining [[Azali]]s (post-Bahá'í/Bábi split followers of Bábism, who number just several thousand worldwide)&amp;nbsp;– is the [[Shrine of the Báb]], also at the BWC. The Báb's Shrine contains within its walls the temporary [[Shrine of `Abdu'l-Bahá]].

The BWC also contains the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#Monument Gardens|Monument Gardens]]&amp;nbsp;– wherein can be found the graves of some of Bahá'u'lláh's family&amp;nbsp;– as well as [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#The House of `Abdu'l-Bahá|a house in which `Abdu'l-Bahá lived]], and [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#Resting place of Amatu'l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khanum|the resting place of]] [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] (August 8, 1910&amp;nbsp;– January 19, 2000; born Mary Sutherland Maxwell; the wife of Shoghi Effendi).

Bahá'u'lláh decreed pilgrimage in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas to two places: the [[Bahá'í pilgrimage#House of Bahá'u'lláh, Baghdad|House of Bahá'u'lláh]] in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] and the [[House of the Báb]] in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]]. While these major pilgrimages were later replaced (at least in terms of religious significance) by `Abdu'l-Bahá, many Bahá'ís still flocked to Bahá'u'lláh's home for pilgrimage until the house was confiscated by Muslim authorities hostile to the Bahá'í Faith in 1922. It has yet to be returned to the Bahá'í community. The House of the Báb was completely destroyed by Iranian Muslims during a [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|state-sponsored persecution of Bahá'ís]]. A road and mosque were built over the house and a telephone pole now marks the spot where the Báb proclaimed his prophethood. The city of Baghdad also includes the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]], which shares the same name as&amp;nbsp;– though is distinct from&amp;nbsp;– the Garden of Ridván in Acre.

[[File:Jerusalem Christian Quarter.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem. (Click to expand.)]]
Located in the [[Christian Quarter]] of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]], the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#The Rotunda and the Aedicule|Edicule]], also known as the Tomb of Christ, within the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] is the most holy site for many mainstream denominations within Christianity. The area of the Church is regarded as the site, according to their understanding, where [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] [[Passion (Christianity)|suffered, was crucified, died]], [[Entombment of Christ|buried]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected from the dead]] along a temporal pathway known as the [[Via Dolorosa]] (from the [[Latin]]; lit. "way of sorrows"). The first eight [[Stations of the Cross]] can be followed along the route leading up to the Church, inside of which are the final five Stations.

The [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] form the custodians of the Holy Sepulchre and collectively control the most holy pilgrimages within the church along with the [[Coptic Orthodox|Coptic]], [[Syriac Orthodox|Syriac]], and [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches who also hold some chapels. Within the walls of the church are the many traditional locations for the events associated with the Passion and death of Jesus: The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#Stone of Anointing|Stone of Unction]] (the anointing place of Christ's body), the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#Catholicon and Ambulatory|Prison of Christ]] (where Jesus was held, incarcerated, before his Passion), a treasure room which holds relics including fragments of the [[True Cross]], and of course [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#Calvary (Golgotha)|Calvary]] or [[Golgotha]] (where Christ was crucified) and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#The Rotunda and the Aedicule|Sepulchre]] itself&amp;nbsp;– to name a few.

[[File:Gartengrab.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The entrance to the [[Garden Tomb]] in 2005.]]
Many [[Protestant]] and [[nontrinitarian]] denominations regard the nearby [[Garden Tomb]] to be the actual crucifixion and resurrection site of Jesus.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Still others have claimed that [[Tomb of Jesus|Jesus's tomb]] is in [[Shingō, Aomori#Tomb of Jesus Christ|Japan]], or is really [[Talpiot Tomb|located outside of East Jerusalem]]. Some individuals in the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim community regard [[Roza Bal]] in [[Srinagar]], [[India]], to be Jesus's authentic grave.

[[File:Altar of the Crucifixion in The Church of The Holy Sepulchre.ogv|thumb|right|150px|The Altar of the Crucifixion ([[Golgotha]] or [[Calvary]], the traditional site of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus's crucifixion]]) in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]], in 2011.]]
Other holy sites and shrines of pilgrimage exist in the [[Holy Land]]. In Jerusalem the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], the [[Mount Zion]] [[Cenacle]] of the [[Last Supper]] and the [[Mount of Olives]], as well as the [[Chapel of the Ascension (Jerusalem)|Church of the Ascension]] prove spiritually important. Outside Jerusalem are pilgrimage places including the [[Sea of Galilee]], as well as locations in [[Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth]], and [[Capernaum]]:

[[File:Christian quarter Jerusalem Crosses.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The ninth [[Stations of the Cross|Station of the Cross]] along the [[Via Dolorosa]] with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the background, in 2006.]]
* [[Bethlehem]]: The location of the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Manger Square]], where Jesus was born.
* [[Capernaum]]: The town, bordering the [[Sea of Galilee]], is cited in the [[Gospel of Luke]] where it was reported to have been the home of the apostles [[Simon Peter]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], as well as the tax collector [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]. In the [[Gospel of Matthew]] the town was reported to have been the home of Jesus. According to Luke {{bibleref2c|Luke|4:31–44}}, Jesus taught in the synagogue in Capernaum on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]. Jesus then healed a man who had the spirit of an unclean devil and healed a fever in Simon Peter's mother-in-law. According to Luke {{bibleref2c|Luke|7:1–10}}, it is also the place where a Roman Centurion asked Jesus to heal his servant. Capernaum is also mentioned in the [[Gospel of Mark]] {{bibleref2c|Mark|2:1}}, in which it is the location of the famous healing of the paralytic lowered through the roof to reach Jesus. According to several Gospels, Jesus selected this town as the center of his public ministry in the [[Galilee]] after he left the small mountainous hamlet of Nazareth {{bibleref2c|Matthew|4:12–17}}. Capernaum has no obvious advantages over any other city in the area, so he probably chose it because it was the home of his first disciples, Simon ([[St. Peter|Peter]]) and [[St. Andrew|Andrew]].
* [[Nazareth]]: The location of the [[Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation|Church of the Annunciation]] (in the Catholic tradition marks the site where the [[Archangel Gabriel]] announced the future birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary {{bibleref2c|Luke|1:26–31}}), [[Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation|St. Gabriel's Church]] (an Orthodox alternative site for the Annunciation), the [[Synagogue Church]] (The [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]] lays claim to this site, which is traditionally that of the synagogue where Jesus preached {{bibleref2c|Luke|4}}), the Church of St. Joseph's Carpentry (occupies the traditional location for the workshop of [[Saint Joseph]]); the [[Mensa Christi Church]] (run by the [[Franciscan]] religious order, commemorates the traditional location where Jesus dined with the Apostles after his Resurrection), the [[Basilica of Jesus the Adolescent]] (run by the Salesian religious order, occupies a hill overlooking the city), the Church of Christ (an [[Anglican]] church in Nazareth), and the Church of Our Lady of the Fright (marking the spot where Mary saw Jesus being taken to a cliff by the congregation of the synagogue and felt fear on his account). The "[[Jesus Trail]]" pilgrimage route connects many of the religious sites in Nazareth on a 60&amp;nbsp;km walking trail which ends in Capernaum.

Other important locations identified with the life of Jesus include areas around the Sea of Galilee&amp;nbsp;– for instance [[Cana]] and the [[Church of the Multiplication]] in [[Tabgha]]&amp;nbsp;– as well as the [[Mount of Temptation]] (in the [[Judean desert]]), [[Mount Tabor]], [[Jacob's Well]], [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]] and [[Bethabara]] (on the [[Jordan River]]). The town of [[Tzippori]] is where the [[Virgin Mary]] spent her childhood.

Still other revered places may exist within or outside the Holy Land, involving localities associated with the lives of the [[Twelve Apostles]], the [[Church Fathers]], the [[Genealogy of Jesus|relatives and ancestors of Jesus]], [[saint]]s, or other figures or events featured in both the Old Testament (sharing religious significance with Judaism or other Abrahamic faiths) and New Testament. The reverence held for these sites may vary depending on denomination.

====Eastern Christianity====
Orthodox or Eastern Christians, like many other Christians, regard the Sepulchre in Jerusalem to be the holiest of places. They place emphasis on Nazareth, Bethlehem, Capernaum and other parts of the Holy Land as sacred since apostolic times, and note as places of special sanctity the sanctuaries built on the tombs of the apostles and other saints. There are many shrines with the [[relics]] of Christian [[saints]] and [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]] which are sacred pilgrimage sites for Orthodox Christians as well.

Historically, four of the five major [[episcopal see]]s of the Roman Empire (the [[Pentarchy]]) represent the modern [[patriarch]]al centers of the majority of Orthodox churches. These are, namely, [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Jerusalem]]&amp;nbsp;– excluding [[Rome]].

Among the Orthodox, there are many [[monasteries]] and [[convents]] which are held in high honor and sacred veneration.

If the Patriarch of Constantinople is taken to be one of the most prominent leaders in the Eastern Orthodox Communion, then the [[Church of St. George, Istanbul|Church of St. George in Istanbul]] (Greek: Καθεδρικός ναός του Αγίου Γεωργίου ''Kathedrikós Naós tou Agíou Geōrgíou''; {{lang-tr|Aya Yorgi}})&amp;nbsp;– the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarch&amp;nbsp;– may perhaps be one of the most important religious sites for Eastern Orthodox Christians.

Also of particular importance to the Eastern Orthodox Church and particularly the Greek Orthodox Church is the peninsular [[Mount Athos]] ({{lang-el|Όρος Άθως|translit=Oros Athos}}; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|θ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPA-el|ˈaθos}}), where the most masses in the world are celebrated daily in the [[Byzantine Rite]]. Mount Athos arguably comprises the largest community of [[Christian monasticism|Christian monastics]], [[ascetic]]s, and [[Christian mysticism|mystics]] (specifically [[hesychast]]s) in the world. It is home to twenty Eastern Orthodox monasteries under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch.

Oriental Orthodoxy is the faith of those [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] churches that recognize only three [[ecumenical council]]s&amp;nbsp;– the [[First Council of Nicaea]], the [[First Council of Constantinople]] and the [[First Council of Ephesus]]. They rejected the [[dogmatic definition]]s of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (c. 451). Hence, these Oriental Orthodox Churches are also called Old Oriental Churches, [[Miaphysite|Miaphysite Churches]], or the [[Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches.&lt;ref name="first seven"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]]|first=Leo Donald|title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology (Theology and Life Series 21)|year=1990|publisher=Michael Glazier/Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, MN|isbn=978-0814656167|pages=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches are generally not in communion with any of the multifarious Eastern Orthodox Churches but they are in dialogue for a return to unity.&lt;ref name="sor.cua.edu"&gt;[http://sor.cua.edu/Ecumenism/20010317oomtg4.html Syrian Orthodox Resources&amp;nbsp;– Middle Eastern Oriental Orthodox Common Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the potentially confusing nomenclature (Oriental meaning Eastern), Oriental Orthodox churches are distinct from those that are collectively referred to as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The Oriental Orthodox communion comprises five basic groups:  [[Coptic Orthodox]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox]], [[Eritrean Orthodox]], [[Syriac Orthodox]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/ecumenical/ooc-e.html Oriental Orthodox Churches&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406014259/http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/ecumenical/ooc-e.html |date=6 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches, while being in communion with one another, are hierarchically independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pluralism.org/affiliates/student/allen/Oriental-Orthodox/Home.html An Introduction to the Oriental Orthodox Churches&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] or Indian Orthodox church is technically autonomous, but still shares some ties with the Syriac Orthodox church.

This being the case, each of the six communal churches has their own spiritual headquarters which act as the episcopal sees of their respective Popes or Patriarchs:
* Armenian Apostolic&amp;nbsp;— [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]] ([[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]]), [[Vagharshapat]], [[Armenia]]

Latter-day Saints regard with reverence such places as the [[Garden Tomb]] and the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] in Jerusalem, due their connections with the life and ministry of [[Jesus]]. Additionally, the most holy place for members of the mainstream LDS Church are the numerous [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] around the world, particularly the "[[Ordinance room#Celestial room|celestial room]]" located inside each temple.  The purpose of these [[ordinance room]]s is to act as a symbolic representation of the presence of God himself. Additionally, a room inside the [[Salt Lake Temple]], designated as the [[Holy of Holies (LDS Church)|Holy of Holies]], is considered highly sacred due its primary function as a private meditation room for the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church's president]].

Mormon homes are also treated as sacred areas due the church's emphasis on the sacredness of family union and family-based ceremonies performed in LDS temples. On this subject, the [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|Bible Dictionary]] in the [[LDS edition of the Bible]] states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A temple is literally a house of the Lord, a holy sanctuary in which sacred ceremonies and ordinances of the gospel are performed by and for the living and also in behalf of the dead. A place where the Lord may come, it is the most holy of any place of worship on the earth. Only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness. ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/t/12]).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once a Mormon family starts dwelling in a home, a special prayer is given by the head of the family (or a close member of the church) asking for the residence to be a shelter against [[temptation]], and dedicating the place to God as long as the family inhabits it.

Other venerated sites for Latter-day Saints include historical locations throughout the [[United States]], due to their particular connection to Mormon history and theology. However, no mandatory peregrinations nor worship ceremonies are performed in such places. Examples include the [[Sacred Grove (Latter Day Saint movement)|Sacred Grove]] ([[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]], [[New York (state)|New York]]), the [[Kirtland Temple]] ([[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], [[Ohio]]) and [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]] ([[Daviess County, Missouri|Daviess County]], [[Missouri]]).

=====Other LDS movement sects=====
{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
Mormon breakaway sects, sub-sects and [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist groups]] sometimes hold the belief that their particular church alone can claim true authority and succession from Joseph Smith, and that other LDS denominations are therefore incorrect or heretical. Thus many sites throughout the United States represent the spiritual headquarters' of these churches: For example, the [[YFZ Ranch]] in [[Eldorado, Texas|Eldorado]], [[Texas]] at one time represented the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (FLDS) and the [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB) base themselves in [[Bluffdale, Utah|Bluffdale]], [[Utah]].

[[Ethiopia]] is of considerable importance as the setting of the life and death of [[Haile Selassie]]. Many Rastas consider Ethiopia the [[Promised Land]]. The city of [[Shashamane]] is particularly significant. In the capital of [[Addis Ababa]]
Haile Selassie is buried in the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral (Addis Ababa)|Holy Trinity Cathedral]] (often called ''Kidist Selassie'', from the Amharic), which is also a significant religious site for Ethiopian Orthodox Christians (see also [[List of religious sites#Oriental Orthodox churches|Oriental Orthodox churches]]), as it doubles as the seat of the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of their church.

[[Catholic Church|Catholics]], like many other [[Christianity|Christians]], regards the Sepulchre in Jerusalem to be the holiest of places. It also places emphasis on Nazareth, Bethlehem, Capernaum, and other parts of the Holy Land as sacred since [[Apostle (Christian)|apostolic]] times, and notes as places of special sanctity the sanctuaries built on the tombs of the Apostles.

Mainstream [[Catholicism]] as a whole is represented by the [[Holy See]] ({{lang-lat|Sancta Sedes}}, "holy chair") of the [[Vatican City]] state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/homepage.htm |title=Homepage of Vatican City State |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102133940/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/homepage.htm |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[List of English exonyms for Italian toponyms|Italian]]: {{lang|it|Stato della Città del Vaticano}}),&lt;ref&gt;This is the name used in the state's [[Constitution|founding document]], the [http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/FBFEA0E8-B43A-452A-AAA0-1AF49590F658/2614/TrattatoSantaSedeItalia.pdf Treaty between the Holy See and Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309093658/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/FBFEA0E8-B43A-452A-AAA0-1AF49590F658/2614/TrattatoSantaSedeItalia.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}, article 26.&lt;/ref&gt; a walled enclave within [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Inside the Vatican the largest church in history, [[St. Peter's Basilica]] ([[Latin|L.]]: ''Basilica Sancti Petri''), is the location of the Papal office and the living quarters of the [[Pope]] (in the [[Apostolic Palace]]), as well as [[Vatican Hill]]&amp;nbsp;– atop which are [[Saint Peter's tomb]] and place of crucifixion, [[Cathedra Petri|his throne]], and his [[St. Peter's baldachin|baldachin]]. Outside St. Peter's Square are many more churches throughout the Vatican and outlying Rome. One important landmark is the [[Sistine Chapel]] ([[Latin|L.]]: ''Sacellum Sixtinum''; I.: ''Cappella Sistina''), in which the [[Papal conclave]] takes place.

Rome is the place from which Catholics believe the [[Four Marks of the Church|one, holy, catholic and apostolic church]] were formally founded and begun by [[St. Peter]] (whom they consider to be the "[[Primacy of Simon Peter|Prince of the Apostles]]") as the appointed successor and first [[vicar of Christ]]. Thus while the Holy Sepulchre is still the most sanctified of places for Catholics, the Vatican is an extremely sacred place to the faithful (those of the [[Latin Church]], as well as the Churches ''[[sui iuris]]'') as the seat of their supreme authority on Earth. Important papal territories include the four [[major basilica]]s (L.: ''Basilica maior'', pl. ''-es''; excluding St. Peter's)&amp;nbsp;– namely the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]] (the ecumenical Catholic [[mother church]]), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls]] (containing the tomb of [[Paul the Apostle]]), and the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]].

Other locations of reverence for ardent Catholics include [[Marian shrines]], particularly the localities of [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] and [[Lourdes]], where [[miracles]] or [[Vision (spirituality)|apparitions]] attributed to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] took place.

[[File:Hajj.ogg|300px|right|Pilgrims circumambulating the [[Kaaba]] during [[Hajj]].]]

The ''[[Kaaba]]'', a [[cuboid]] structure located within the ''[[Masjid al-Ḥarām]]'' (''Sacred Mosque'')  in [[Mecca]], [[Saudi Arabia]], according to Islamic tradition was rebuilt by [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] (Abraham) and his son [[Ishmael|Ismail]] (Ishmael), and is one of the holiest places in Islam. During his life the Prophet Muhammad laid the [[Black Stone]] in one of the corners of the building. Many millions of Muslims visit Mecca and the surrounding areas each year during a pilgrimage known as the ''[[Hajj]]''&amp;nbsp;– the fifth and final [[pillar of Islam]]&amp;nbsp;– during which they circumambulate the Kaaba as part of the ritual.

Other significant areas within or surrounding Mecca include areas in which the Hajj takes place, including the [[Well of Zamzam]], [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] and [[Jamaraat Bridge|its bridge]], [[Muzdalifah]] and [[Mount Arafat]].

The second holiest place for Muslims is the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]], which is where the [[Prophet of Islam|Prophet]] Muhammad is buried under the [[Green Dome]]. [[Caliph]]s [[Umar]] and [[Abu Bakr]] are also said to be buried in the Masjid al-Nabawi. The [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]] is a sacred place in [[Sunni]] traditions as the site from which [[Muhammad]] ascended to heaven in the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] and was also the first [[qibla]]. [[Mount Sinai]] also holds significance in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/mountmoses.htm Mount Sinai (Mount Moses) in the Sinai of Egypt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Among Shias, the [[Imam Ali Mosque]] and [[Imam Husayn Shrine]] also hold high significance.

Other sites in the Arabian [[Hejaz]] are associated with Muhammad: near Mecca, on the mountain of [[Jabal al-Nour]] the cave [[Hira]] is the place of the Prophet's first revelation. Many other former places of devotion that are historically associated with Muhammad were destroyed under the alleged anti-idolatrous policies of the Wahhabi Saudi government.

====Druzism====
[[File:Nebishoaib.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]'s Tomb in Tiberias, Israel]]
Druzism is a highly distinguished sect of [[Ismailism|Ismāʿīli]] [[Shi'a]] Islam, practiced by the [[Druze]] community. Most Druze consider themselves Muslims, however most non-Druze Muslims (most Sunnis and many Shi'as) do not regard the Druze as practicing Islam&amp;nbsp;– and may even condemn their beliefs as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' ([[polytheism]]).

The ''[[Nabi Shu'ayb]]'', or Tomb of [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], near [[Tiberias]] in [[Israel]] is the most important religious site for the Druze. They have held religious festivals there for centuries and it has been a place of annual pilgrimage.

[[File:Tabernacle.gif|thumb|left|200px|A modern diagram of the Kodesh Hakodashim, or the tabernacle at [[Solomon's Temple]].]]
The ''[[Kodesh Hakodashim]]'', Judaism's [[Holy of Holies]], was the inner sanctuary of the [[Tabernacle]] in the time of [[Moses]] as described in the [[Torah]]; the term now refers to the space on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] where this sanctuary was located in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. (This location is often, but controversially, identified as being inaccessible within the footprint of the Islamic [[Dome of the Rock]].) Historically, it could be entered by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] only on [[Yom Kippur]]. [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] continue to regard the location as retaining some or all of its sanctity despite the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Entry into sanctified areas has been prohibited in recent times by powerful elements within traditional Judaism, and as a result many religious authorities prohibit or restrict entry into the [[Temple Mount]] by observant Jews.

Today, [[Jew]]s recognize the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of the city, wherein the Mount is located, to be a location of profound spiritual importance. Within the area a stone artifact known as the [[Western Wall]] is paramount as the last standing remains of the temple. Along the wall notable featured include the [[Western Stone]] and [[Wilson's Arch (Jerusalem)|Wilson's Arch]]. Beneath it [[Western Wall Tunnel|a tunnel]] runs closer toward what was the original Kodesh Hakodashim, ending approximately 150&amp;nbsp;ft. inward at a place called [[Warren's Gate]]. In an alley the [[Muslim Quarter]] of the city is a semi-concelead section of the Wall called the [[Little Western Wall]].

[[File:P6070038.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Aerial view of the Western Wall in 2008.]]
The [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]] is the second holiest site in Judaism. Other significant sites include a number of temples within the Jewish quarter of Old Jerusalem, namely the [[Hurva Synagogue|Hurva]], [[Belz Great Synagogue|Belz]], [[Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue|Tiferet Yisrael]] and the [[Four Sephardic Synagogues|Four Sephardic]] [[synagogue]]s. The [[Beit El Synagogue]] is of special importance to students of [[Kaballah]]. The [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] is believed to be the place where [[Moses]] received the [[Ten Commandments]] from God&amp;nbsp;– although there is considerable debate as to the location of the mountain. (Scholarly opinion places it at either the mountain historically known as "[[Mount Sinai|Sinai]]" or [[Mount Seir]].)

[[File:Samaritans on Mount Gerizim, West Bank - 20060429.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Samaritans atop Mount Gerizim in 2006.]]
[[Samaritanism]] is an [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] or Semitic religion closely related to&amp;nbsp;– or by some considered an early derivative of&amp;nbsp;– [[Judaism]], practiced by the [[Samaritan]] (Hebrew: שומרונים ''Shomronim'', Arabic: السامريون ''as-Sāmariyyūn'') [[ethnoreligious]] group, who mostly reside in the region of the [[Levant]] and claim ancestry to [[Israelite]]s with connections to the ancient [[Eastern Mediterranean]] kingdom of [[Samaria]]. The Samaritan ethnoreligious group and the subsequent Samaritan religion are considered to be, demographically, the smallest of their kind in modern times, with the number of Samaritans worldwide totalling at just 712 as of late 2007.

Adherents of Samaritanism consider a formation known as the Holy Rock, atop the summit of [[Mount Gerizim]] ([[Samaritan Hebrew]]: ''Ar-garízim'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: جبل جرزيم ''Jabal Jarizīm'', [[Tiberian Hebrew|T.H.]]: הַר גְּרִזִּים ''Har Gərizzîm'', [[Standard Hebrew|S.H.]]: הַר גְּרִיזִּים ''Har Gərizzim''; also romanized as ''Jirziem''), to be their "[[holy of holies]]". This is comparable with the [[Temple Mount]] of [[Jerusalem]] as idealized and revered by mainstream [[Jews]]&amp;nbsp;– however Gerizim is located near the Samaritan village of [[Kiryat Luza]] (الطيبه), adjacent to the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian]] city of [[Nablus]] (present-day Biblical [[Shechem]]), in the [[West Bank]].

[[File:Mahabodhitree1.jpg|thumb|right|The Bodhi Tree at the Mahabodhi Temple in [[India]]. The tree was initially propagated from the [[Sri Maha Bodhi]], which in turn is propagated from the original Bodhi Tree at this location.]]
Lumbini is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]] gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in 563 BCE. Lumbini is one of many magnets for [[pilgrimage]] that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha.

[[Bodh Gaya]], in the state of [[Bihar]] in [[India]], is considered by many adherents of Buddhism to be their most holy site. Gautama, who achieved [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|Enlightenment]] some time around 528 BCE, became [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] and founded [[Buddhism]]. The Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment while sitting under a [[Sacred fig|peepal]] tree, called the [[Bodhi tree]], located in Bodhgaya. At this site of his purported enlightenment the [[Mahabodhi temple]] now stands. Every year, many Buddhists make pilgrimages from all over the world to visit and meditate at the temple.

====Shugendō====

{{Main|Sanzan Gosaiden|Mount Haguro|Three Mountains of Dewa}}
[[Shugendō]] is a small, [[syncretic]], highly [[esoteric]] and [[ascetic]] sect or sub-sect of Buddhism (mostly related to, and often considered a distinct branch of the [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]] schools) combining elements of [[Zen]], [[Taoism]], [[Koshintō]], Japanese folk [[animism]] and [[shamanism]]. The faith is traditionally believed to have been founded by the [[śramaṇa]] and [[mysticism|mystic]]-[[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] [[En no Gyōja]] in the 7th or 8th century. In the same manner as the religion of [[Shintō]], Shugendō is largely relegated to [[Japan]].

The lay practitioners and monks of Shugendō, called [[Shugenja]] or [[yamabushi]] respectively, venerate [[mountains]] as both spiritual areas and, along with nature as a whole, "natural [[maṇḍala]]s" .

Adherents of Shugendō consider the collective [[Three Mountains of Dewa]] (consisting of Mount Haguro, [[Mount Gassan]], and [[Mount Yudono]]), located in the remote [[Dewa Province]] of Japan, to be their most sacred of places. The three mountains are also sacred in [[Shintō]].

===Hinduism===
[[File:Varanasiganga.jpg|right|thumb|Situated on the banks of river Ganges, Varanasi attracts millions of Hindu pilgrims every year.]]
[[File:Kottiyoor temple festival.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Kottiyoor Vysakha Mahotsavam|''Vysakha Pilgrimage'']] of Kottiyoor, the pilgrimage in the hills of Western Ghats in [[Kerala]] commemorating [[Daksha yajna]].]]
The Indian cities of  [[Varanasi]], [[Ayodhya]], [[Mathura]], [[Haridwar]], [[Kanchipuram]], [[Ujjain]] and [[Dwarka]] are said to be the major Pilgrim cities in [[Hinduism]]; as stated in the [[Vedas]]. Of these [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] is considered the Holiest ancient site and it is considered by many to be the most sacred place of pilgrimage for [[Hindu]]s irrespective of [[Hindu denominations|denomination]].

[[Shaivism|Shaivas]] in [[South India]], especially [[Tamil Nadu]], consider [[Chidambaram]] as the heart of the world and temple of temples. Although all temples are referred to as kovil, the holy city of Chidambaram is the true kovil. All recitations of the [[Thirumurai]] (12 holy scriptures of Shaivism) begin and end with the phrase "Thirucchittrambalam" (the auspicious holy of holies: chidambaram). [[Vaishnavites]] on the other hand consider [[Srirangam|Sri Rangam]] as the holiest city and refer to it as the earthly [[Vaikunta]].

The "[[garbha griha]]" (literally womb-house or womb-chamber), the shrine inside a [[Hindu temple|temple complex]] where the main deity is installed in an area that is in a separate building by itself inside the complex, is the most sacred site within the temple complex.

The garbha griha usually contains the [[murti]] (idol or icon), the primary focus of prayer. In temples with a spire or [[Vimana (tower)|vimana]], this chamber is placed directly underneath it, and the two them form a main vertical axis of the temple. These together may be understood to represent the axis of the world through [[Mount Meru]]. The garbha griha is usually also on the main horizontal axis of the temple which generally is an east-west axis. In those temples where there is also a cross-axis, the garbha griha is generally at their intersection. [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]] is a Hindu temple in the hill town of [[Tirumala]], near [[Tirupati]] in the [[Chittoor district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is around 600&amp;nbsp;km (370&amp;nbsp;mi) from [[Hyderabad]], 138&amp;nbsp;km (86&amp;nbsp;mi) from [[Chennai]] and 291&amp;nbsp;km (181&amp;nbsp;mi) from [[Bangalore]].

The Tirumala Hill is 853m above sea level and is about 10.33 square miles (27 km2) in area. It comprises seven peaks, representing the seven heads of [[Adisesha]], thus earning the name [[Seshachalam Hills|Seshachalam]]. The seven peaks are called Seshadri, Neeladri, Garudadri, Anjanadri, Vrushabhadri, Narayanadri, and Venkatadri. The temple is on [[Venkatadri]] (also known as Venkatachala or Venkata Hill), the seventh peak, and is also known as the "Temple of Seven Hills". The presiding deity of the temple is [[Venkateswara|Lord Venkateswara]], a form of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]]. Venkateswara is known by other names: Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa. The temple lies on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini, a [[Pushkarini|holy water tank]]. The temple complex comprises a traditional temple building, with a number of modern queue and pilgrim lodging sites.

The temple is the richest pilgrimage center, after the [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple]] in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]], of any faith (at more than INR 50,000 crore) and the most-visited place of worship in the world. The temple is visited by about 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims daily (30 to 40 million people annually on average), while on special occasions and festivals, like the annual [[Srivari Brahmotsavam|Brahmotsavam]], the number of pilgrims shoots up to 500,000, making it the most-visited holy place in the world.

There are yearly pilgrimage gatherings such as [[Kumbh Mela]] Pilgrimage(3 year or 12),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-15/hindu-pilgrims-kumbh-mela/4465516 Enormous crowd at Kumbh Mela - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324775/Kumbh-Mela Kumbh Mela (Hindu festival) - Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shabarimala]] Pilgrimage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sabarimala-pilgrimage/specialcoverage/10793762.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Sabarimala pilgrimage - News Stories, Latest News Headlines on Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-sees-heavy-rush/article5033447.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Sabarimala sees heavy rush | date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kottiyoor Vysakha Mahotsavam|Kottiyoor Vysakha Pilgrimage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/06/07/stories/2005060710270500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Thousands throng Kottiyur temple | date=7 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; where in thousands of people gather in a certain period of a year for pilfrimage.

===Jainism===
[[File:Shikharji Parasnath Giridih.jpg|thumb|Jain Temples at Parasnath Shikharji Hills - a view]]
The [[Palitana temples]] on [[Mount Shatrunjaya]], located by the city of [[Palitana]], in [[Bhavnagar district]], [[Gujarat]], [[India]] are considered one of the holiest places for Jains. Jains believes that a visit to this group of temples is essential once in a lifetime to achieve nirvana or salvation, although many Jains frequent it many times in their lifestyle.

[[Shikharji]] or Śrī Sammed Śikharjī (श्री सम्मेद शिखरजी), also known as the Parasnath Hill, located in Giridih district in Jharkhand, India, is a major Jain pilgrimage destination and is one of the most sacred place for Jains in the world. According to Jain belief, twenty of the twenty-four Tirthankaras (teachers of the Jains) attained Moksha (Nirvana) from this place. Parasnath Hill, with a height of 1,350 metres (4,430&amp;nbsp;ft)), is the highest mountain in the state of Jharkhand.
The number of Tirthankars who attained nirvana at Shri Sammet Shikharji is 20. For each of them there is a shrine on the hill.

The hill is also known as Parasnath, a name derived from Parshva, the 23rd Tirthankara who attained Nirvana there. The present temple is not very old, although the idol in the main temple is ancient. The Sanskrit inscriptions at the foot of the images indicate that they were installed in the temple in 1678 AD.

Archaeologists believe some of the existing temple edifices on Parasnath Hill date from 1765 AD although the place is of greater antiquity. It is certain that the present edifices replace older edifices, which were demolished. Jain temples are often pulled down and re-built.

===Sikhism===
[[File:Hamandir Sahib (Golden Temple).jpg|thumb|Harmandir Sahib]]
[[Harmandir Sahib]], or ''Darbar Sahib'' (also known as the Golden Temple), is culturally the most important shrine in [[Sikhism]], considered the spiritual and cultural centre of Sikhs. Located in [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[India]]. It is one of the oldest Sikh [[gurdwara]]s. It is located in the city of [[Amritsar]], [[India]], which was established by [[Guru Ram Das]], the fourth guru of the [[Sikhs]] and the city was also built around the shrine, known as "Guru Di Nagri" meaning city of the Sikh Guru. It is made from white marble to keep the ground cool and pleasant. It was later laid with real Gold which was provided by the emperor of [[Sikh Empire]], [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]].

Another significant place is the village of [[Nankana Sahib]] in [[Pakistan]], the birthplace of [[Guru Nanak]], founder of Sikhism. Each of Nankana Sahib's gurdwaras are associated with different events in Guru Nanak Dev's life. The town remains an important site of pilgrimage for Sikhs worldwide.

[[Confucianism]] is often regarded as either a religion, philosophy or quasi-religious system of beliefs based upon the teachings of the [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient]] [[Chinese people|Chinese]] sage [[Confucius]]. Confucius's philosophy stresses a firm sense of [[ethical]] and [[political]] order and how to achieve these ends in order to benefit [[society]].

While Confucianism is no longer as organized of an ideology as it once was, it still continues as a quasi-religious tradition and [[Kong Miao|temples of Confucius]] exist throughout [[China]]. The most important is [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|the Temple of Confucius]] in Confucius's hometown of [[Qufu]].

Followers of [[Tenrikyo]] believe that creation of the world occurred at a point called the ''[[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|Jiba]]'', in [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri City]], [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. A pillar called the ''Kanrodai'' is erected on the exact point of the Jiba, and a set of worship halls have been constructed around it. A sacred dance is performed around the Kanrodai during the monthly worship services, and the daily prayers of Tenrikyo practitioners are performed while facing the direction of the Jiba. As it is considered that humans were originally created at the Jiba, the greeting "welcome home" (''okaeri nasai'' in Japanese) is commonly used by believers to greet visitors.

The '''Marapu''' religion (also known as Marafu in Sumba) is a form of ancestral religion that is practiced mainly in the island of [[Sumba]] in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Trisha Sertori, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/08/30/sumba-show-bali.html Sumba on show in Bali'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Marapu is also practiced in many more remote areas of [[Sumba]] and [[Flores]]. Both the Christians and Muslims on these islands tend to combine their faiths with Marapu.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/11/28/sumbanese-princess-marries-american-traditional-pomp.html Sumbanese princess marries American in traditional pomp'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202190020/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/11/28/sumbanese-princess-marries-american-traditional-pomp.html |date=2014-02-02 }}, ''The Jakarta Post'', 28 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Marapu, like [[Kaharingan]] of the Dayaks, is not an official religion of Indonesia, and all Indonesian citizens are required to identify as a member of one of the religions sanctioned by law, members have chosen either [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] to self identify.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2011religiousfreedom/#wrapper&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
A member of the Marapu religion, joining forces with representatives of three other indigenous religions, brought a court case to Indonesia's Constitutional court, arguing that the civil rights of Marapu followers suffered because they had not been recognized as one of Indonesia's six official religions (Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism). On November 7, 2017, Indonesia's Constitutional Court decided in their favor, declaring that the earlier laws were discriminatory and violated the principle of equality under the law.  In the past, those who failed to declare that they followed one of the recognized religions on their national identity cards could be denied rights to marriage registration or land titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/11/07/constitutional-court-rules-indigenous-faiths-acknowledged-by-state.html |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |title=Constitutional Court rules indigenous faiths 'acknowledged' by state |accessdate=2017-11-17 |date=2017-11-07 |author=Marguerite Afra Sapiie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
They believe in temporary life in the world and eternal life in the Doomsday, the world of spirits in Marapu heaven&amp;nbsp;— Prai Marapu.  The word Marapu means: Firstly, the occupants of the eternal heaven, who lead a similar existence to men. They live in couples and one of these couples is the ancestor of the Sumbanese. Secondly, the spirits of Sumbanese ancestors in Prai Marupu. Thirdly, the spirits of their relatives.  Fourthly, all spirits dwelling the universe. Marapu has mysterious and magical authority over human life.

According to Marapu beliefs, any spirit consists of two elements: ''Ndewa'' and ''Hamanangu''. Marapu teachings concern the balance of universal life through which happiness can be gained. This balance is symbolized by the Great Mother (''Ina Kalada'') and the Great Father (''Ama Kalada'') who live in the universe and take the forms of the [[moon]] and the [[sun]]. In mythology, they are husband and wife who gave birth to the ancestors of the Sumbanese.

To honor Marapu, the Sumbanese put effigies, called Marapu statues, on stone altars where they lay their offerings in the forms of Sirih Pinang (a dish containing [[betel]] leaves, nuts and [[lime (fruit)|lime]]) and sacrificial cattle. The statues of Marapu are made of wood in the shape of human faces. These images are usually placed in the yard of their houses or inside the traditional houses.

A further manifestation of devotion to Merapu and the ancestors is reflected in the continuing construction in parts of East Sumba of impressive stone burial monuments, vestiges of one of the last surviving megalithic cultures on the planet. In many cases individuals will put their families into debts extending into future generations in order to build these tomb stones in the traditional manner.

Funeral ceremonies and burials can be delayed for decades during which the bodies of the deceased are kept in the homes of the living. Once sufficient funds have been acquired, it is not unusual for several generations of Sumbans to be buried or reburied together in segmented compartments of the below-ground tomb in a manner that does not violate incest taboos. While some now use winches and cattle trucks to lift and transport these stones, and others construct them out of cement, the practice of hauling slabs of rock weighing up to 70 tons atop log rollers across the countryside by hand persists in some eastern parts of the island. The actual event is preceded by months of negotiations between allied clans and villages culminating in hundreds of men participating in the ''tarik batu'' stone-pulling ceremony. Failure to perform the necessary rites, including the butchering of large numbers of [[Water buffalo|buffalo]], cows, pigs and occasionally horses, and nightly protection rituals at the quarries where the stones are cut, risks a violent reaction from malevolent ancestral forces whose approval is sought through the divining of animal innards.

Sumbans believe seven pairs of men and women descended from the sky on a ladder made of buffalo horns to a point in the north central part of the island, and that suitably buried, they too will ultimately ascend this same ladder to be reunited with their families.

While the influence of evangelical churches is growing in Sumba and reflected in mass conversion ceremonies, many islanders retain their beliefs practiced in secret. These conversions can be traumatic for elderly Sumbans who believe by converting they sever the relationship with their forbearers. Others, particularly young people, convert for more pragmatic reasons. Indonesia formally recognizes five state religions and sought-after positions in the civil service, police and military are closed to Merapu practitioners. While not common, there are cases where devout Christianized Sumbans have rebuilt ancestral burial tombs or provided money and support to ensure previous generations are buried in the prescribed manner. Similarly, Christian Sumbans are often buried in cement tombs modeled on the Merapu, though the service is conducted by church officials.

'''Maxwell International School''' was a co-ed [[Bahá'í school]] located on [[Shawnigan Lake]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It offered boarding students and day students instruction from grades 7-12. Its educational philosophy was based on the principles of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Students attended from all over the world. The school closed on its 20th anniversary in 2008.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:maxwell1.JPG|right|thumb|The school in 2004]] --&gt;Maxwell International School was established in 1988 by the [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of Canada in honour of [[May Maxwell|May]] and [[William Sutherland Maxwell]], two of the earliest Bahá’ís in Canada. William Maxwell was one of Canada's premier architects in the late 19th century and was responsible for many buildings. The [[Château Frontenac]] in [[Quebec]] was one he and his brother worked on while the [[Shrine of the Báb]] in [[Haifa]], Israel was his last design.

In 1988 the school was opened with guest of honour Amatu'l-Bahá [[Rúhíyyih Khánum]] (Mary Maxwell, daughter of May and Sutherland) and wife of the Bahá'í Faith's [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]], [[Shoghi Effendi]]. A tree was planted in dedication to the opening of the school.
In the early 2006-2007 school year, the school board decided to drop "Bahá'í" from its name, changing it to "Maxwell International School".

On 22 November 2007, the Cowichan News Leader and Pictorial reported that the school was to close in June 2008.

The school did close in 2008 leaving many of its students, faculty members and alumnus saddened.  The school was directed to close by the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada after it was decided that the NSA could no longer afford to operate the school at such a large deficit. Initially the Parent Teachers Association put together a proposal to recreate the school as a private enterprise/corporation independent of the funds of the Baha'i Faith, however their attempts ultimately proved to be in vain. Many of the former students transferred to [[Nancy Campbell Collegiate Institute]], the only other Baha'i international school in Canada. In 2009, the school property was sold to new owners who formed the Dwight School, which later changed its name to [[Brookes Shawnigan Lake]] in 2016.

== Learning program ==
Maxwell provided an accredited academic program for grades 7–12, leading to Canadian high school graduation certification.

Learning programs included a spiritual view of humanity, a use of practical, integrative, theme-based projects, the encouragement of creative and artistic expression, and the use of service learning. The average student/teacher ratio was about 9 to 1, and two computer labs with high-speed Internet connections supported the curriculum.

== Special programs ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:maxwell2.JPG|left|thumb|United Nations day]] --&gt;Maxwell offered English as a Second Language (ESL) programs aimed at students from non-English speaking countries. The ESL program allowed its students to learn in an academic environment while using practical application in everyday life.

The Maxwell Dance Workshop used the dynamics of dance, music and drama to propose insight and solutions to many of the critical issues challenging today's young people. Established at Maxwell International Bahá’í School in 1989 as a non-profit, educational, performing arts program, the Workshop performed for thousands of children, youth and adults in schools, colleges, universities and community events. The performers were students from grades 7 through 12 who came from diverse countries, religious and cultural backgrounds.

[[File:murmur seal.gif|frame|The Seal of Murmur according to the [[Ars Goetia]].]]
In [[demonology]], '''Murmur''' is a Great Duke and Earl of [[Hell]], and has thirty legions of [[demon]]s under his command. He teaches [[Philosophy]], and can oblige the souls of the deceased to appear before the [[Evocation|conjurer]] to answer every desired question. Before his rebellion against God, Murmur held the name "Matthias."

Murmur is depicted as a [[soldier]] riding a [[vulture]] or a [[griffin]], and wearing a ducal crown. Two of his ministers go before him making the sound of [[trumpet]]s. 'Murmur' in [[Latin]] means noise, whisper, murmur, and the sound of the trumpet. Some authors portray him simply as a [[vulture]]. 

''Other spelling'': Murmus, Murmuur, Murmux.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">An '''officiant''' is someone who '''officiates''' (i.e. leads) at a service or ceremony, such as [[marriage]], [[burial]], or [[namegiving]]/[[baptism]].

Religious Officiants are usually ordained by a religious denomination as members of the clergy.  Some officiants work within congregations in some denominations and for specified ceremonies (e.g. funerals), as non-ordained members on the clergy team. Clergy / Officiants differ from [[Chaplains]] in that the clergy serve the members of their congregation, while Chaplains are usually employed by an institution such as the military, a hospital or other health care facility, etc.

There may be more than one con-celebrant, but, even when a higher-ranking cleric is present, (save the Pope), there is only one principal celebrant.

Secular Officiants include [[Celebrant (Australia)|Civil Celebrants]],  Humanist Society appointed officiants,  [[Justices of the Peace]],  [[deputy marriage commissioner|marriage commissioners]], [[notaries]], and other persons empowered by law to perform legal marriage ceremonies. Many secular celebrants / officiants conduct the whole range of ceremonies which mark the milestones of human life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">In [[History of astronomy|classical, medieval, and Renaissance astronomy]], the '''Primum Mobile''' (or "first moved") was the outermost moving [[celestial spheres|sphere]] in the [[geocentric model]] of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Greer, ''A Brief History of the Western World'' (2004) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was introduced by [[Ptolemy]] to account for the apparent [[diurnal motion|daily motion]] of the heavens around the Earth, producing the east-to-west rising and setting of the sun and stars, and reached Western Europe via [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Galle, ''Peter of Auvergne'' (2003) p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and rotation==

The Ptolemaic system presented a view of the universe in which apparent motion was taken for real – a viewpoint still maintained in common speech through such everyday terms as ''moonrise'' and ''sunset''.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell'' (1975) p. 292-5&lt;/ref&gt; Rotation of the Earth on its polar axis – as seen in a [[heliocentric]] solar system, which (while anticipated by [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]) was not to be 
widely accepted until well after [[Copernicus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Hell'' p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; – leads to what  earlier astronomers saw as the real movement of all the heavenly bodies around the Earth every 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. C. Mantillo, ''Medieval Latin'' (1996) p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers believed that the seven [[naked-eye planets]] (including the Moon and the Sun) were carried around the [[spherical Earth]] on invisible orbs, while an eighth sphere contained the fixed [[star]]s. Motion was provided to the whole system by the Primum Mobile, itself set within the [[Empyrean]], and the fastest moving of all the spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 333 and p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spherical variations==

[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|300px|right]]

The total number of [[celestial spheres]] was not fixed. In this 16th-century illustration, the [[firmament]] (sphere of fixed stars) is eighth, a "crystalline" sphere (posited to account for the reference to "waters . . . above the firmament" in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:7) is ninth, and the Primum Mobile is tenth. Outside all is the Empyrean, the "habitation of God and all the elect."

==Copernicus and after==
Copernicus accepted existence of the sphere of the fixed stars, and (more ambiguously) that of the Primum Mobile,&lt;ref&gt;O. Pederson, ''Early Physics and Astronomy'' (1993) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; as too (initially) did [[Galileo]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Reston, ''Galileo: A Life'' (2005) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; – though he would later challenge its necessity in a heliocentric system.&lt;ref&gt;Galileo Galilei, ''Dialogue....'' (California nd) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]] was as sceptical of the Primum Mobile as he was of the rotation of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Ellis, ''Collected Works of Francis Bacon Vol 1 Pt 1'' (1996) p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Kepler]] had made the sun, not the Primum Mobile, the cause of planetary motion, however,&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Hanson, ''Constellations and Conjectures'' (1973) p. 256-7&lt;/ref&gt; the Primum Mobile gradually declined into the realm of metaphor or literary allusion.

==Literary references==
*[[Dante]] made the Primum Mobile the ninth of the ten heavens into which he divided his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradise'' p. 22-3 and end-piece&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[W. B. Yeats]] wrote: "The Primum Mobile that fashioned us / Has made the very owls in circles move."&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (1984) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11104">A '''provincial episcopal visitor''' ('''PEV'''), popularly known as a '''flying bishop''', is a [[Church of England]] [[bishop]] assigned to minister to many of the [[clergy]], [[laity]] and [[parish]]es who on grounds of theological conviction,&lt;ref&gt;"I think that the problem is for those who are not content with the idea that we should go forward along the line of ordaining women as bishops, the problem is not one of opinion, it's rather of obedience. It's one of obedience to scripture, or obedience to the consensus of the Church Catholic." Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, [http://rowanwilliams.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/1782/speeches-to-general-synod-on-women-bishops Archbishop of Canterbury website.], Accessed 7 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "are unable to receive the ministry of women bishops or priests."&lt;ref&gt;"Since those within the Church of England who, on grounds of theological conviction, are unable to receive the ministry of women bishops or priests continue to be within the spectrum of teaching and tradition of the Anglican Communion, the Church of England remains committed to enabling them to flourish within its life and structures;" the fourth of the Guiding Principles [https://www.churchofengland.org/media/2011184/gs%20misc%201076%20-%20women%20in%20the%20episcopate%20house%20of%20bishops%20declaration.pdf] (Accessed 7 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The system by which said bishops provide certain churches with oversight is referred to as '''alternative episcopal oversight (AEO)'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernchurch.org.uk/resources/mc/2012-9.htm Modern Church – When is a bishop not a bishop] (Accessed 22 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Church of England [[ordination|ordained]] its first women priests in 1994. According to acts of the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] passed the previous year, if a parish does not accept the ministry of women priests it can formally request that none be appointed to minister to it. Likewise, if the local bishop has participated in the ordination of women as priests, a parish can request to be under the pastoral and [[sacrament]]al care of another bishop who has not participated in such ordinations. In such a case the parish still remains in the [[diocese]] of the local diocesan bishop, at whose invitation the "flying bishop" makes his visitation.

On 4 December 2014, it was announced that the [[Bishop of Maidstone|see of Maidstone]] would be filled again in order to provide a further provincial episcopal visitor for particular [[Conservative Evangelicalism in Britain|conservative evangelical]] members of the Church of England who take a [[Complementarianism|complementarian]] view on headship.&lt;ref name="maid-pev"&gt;[http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/006797.html Thinking Anglicans – Appointment of a bishop who takes a conservative evangelical view on headship], Accessed 4 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The act empowers the [[Metropolitan archbishop|metropolitan]]s of the Church of England's two [[Ecclesiastical province|province]]s to appoint provincial episcopal visitors as [[suffragan]] bishops whose main purpose is to be available for such visits to parishes across the province. Accordingly, four PEV bishops have been appointed across the two provinces.

In December 2010, the then-bishops of Richborough and Ebbsfleet resigned to join the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. On 5 May 2011, their successors as PEVs were announced.&lt;ref name="canpev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterburydiocese.org/news/New%20PEVs%205May2011.doc|title=Diocese of Canterbury — New Provincial Episcopal Visitors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of PEV bishops==

===Province of Canterbury===
In the [[Province of Canterbury]]:

*The [[Bishop of Ebbsfleet|Bishop suffragan of Ebbsfleet]]: [[Jonathan Goodall]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebbsfleet.org.uk/ Bishop of Ebbsfleet] (Accessed 2 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Bishop of Maidstone|Bishop suffragan of Maidstone]]: [[Rod Thomas (bishop)|Rod Thomas]]&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/5545/suffragan-bishop-of-maidstone-announced Lambeth Palace – Suffragan Bishop of Maidstone announced] (Accessed 5 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bishopofmaidstone.org/rod-thomas-consecrated-as-bishop-of-maidstone-in-canterbury-cathedral/ Rod Thomas Consecrated as Bishop of Maidstone in Canterbury Cathedral] (Accessed 27 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Diocese of London]]: the bishop has designated the suffragan [[Bishop of Fulham]] ([[Jonathan Baker (bishop)|Jonathan Baker]]). Additionally, he performs a similar role as an [[assistant bishop]] licensed in the neighbouring diocese of [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]]. During the 2010–13 vacancy in the see of Fulham, those duties were temporarily assigned to then-[[Bishop of Edmonton (London)|Bishop of Edmonton]] [[Peter Wheatley]].

===Province of York===
In the [[Province of York]]:
*The [[Bishop of Beverley|Bishop suffragan of Beverley]]: [[Glyn Webster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/suffragan-see-of-beverley/|title=Suffragan See of Beverley - GOV.UK|website=www.number10.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015|4|1}}, the Bishop of Beverley ministered in 10 of the 12 dioceses in the northern province. The other two dioceses use different suffragan bishops: 
*[[Anglican Diocese of Leeds|Leeds]]: the area [[Bishop of Wakefield]] ([[Tony Robinson (bishop)|Tony Robinson]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswsh.com/diocese-detail.php?id=100s|title=The Society -        Leeds Diocese|website=www.sswsh.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oversight areas==

Until the appointment of [[Paul Ferguson (bishop)|Paul Ferguson]] in 2014, the [[Bishop of Whitby]] provided AEO in York diocese; with Ferguson's appointment that oversight lapses to the Bishop of Beverley as PEV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seeofbeverley.org.uk/fullposts.php?id=121|title=Appointment of the New Bishops of Selby and Whitby|website=seeofbeverley.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the retirement of [[John Goddard (bishop)|John Goddard]], Bishop of Burnley, on 19 July 2014, it was announced that Philip North would be consecrated as the next Bishop of Burnley on 2 February 2015 and would have AEO in the dioceses of Blackburn and Carlisle; however, while North is now listed as the AEO bishop for Blackburn diocese, Webster is listed for Carlisle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswsh.com/diocese-detail.php?id=128|title=The Society -        Carlisle Diocese|website=www.sswsh.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016}}, in the southern province, the bishops of Ebbsfleet and of Richborough together minister in 27 of the 30 dioceses. Of the three remaining dioceses, London and Southwark are ministered to by the Bishop of Fulham and Chichester by its diocesan bishop. The Bishop of Ebbsfleet serves the western 13 dioceses ([[Diocese of Bath and Wells|Bath and Wells]], [[Anglican Diocese of Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[Diocese of Bristol|Bristol]], [[Diocese of Coventry|Coventry]], [[Diocese of Derby|Derby]], [[Diocese of Exeter|Exeter]], [[Diocese of Gloucester|Gloucester]], [[Diocese of Hereford|Hereford]], [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]], [[Diocese of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Diocese of Salisbury|Salisbury]], [[Diocese of Truro|Truro]] and [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Worcester]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebbsfleet.org.uk/|title=Bishop of Ebbsfleet|website=www.ebbsfleet.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Bishop of Richborough serves the eastern half ([[Diocese of Canterbury|Canterbury]], [[Diocese of Chelmsford|Chelmsford]], [[Diocese of Ely|Ely]], [[Diocese in Europe|Europe]], [[Diocese of Guildford|Guildford]], [[Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich|St Edmundsbury &amp; Ipswich]], [[Diocese of Leicester|Leicester]], [[Diocese of Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[Diocese of Norwich|Norwich]], [[Anglican Diocese of Peterborough|Peterborough]], [[Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth|Portsmouth]], [[Diocese of Rochester|Rochester]], [[Diocese of St Albans|St Albans]] and [[Diocese of Winchester|Winchester]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richborough.org.uk/index.php/directory|title=Richborough Episcopal Area|website=www.richborough.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2018, 114 parishes have passed resolutions for conservative evangelical reasons; 53 of these have requested AEO from the [[Bishop of Maidstone]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.bishopofmaidstone.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Christmas-2017-Newsletter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rod Thomas (bishop)|Rod Thomas]] is an assistant bishop in the Dioceses of Birmingham, Bristol, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Chester, Derby, Ely, London, Manchester, Norwich, Portsmouth, Rochester, Sheffield and Southwark.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/4-august/gazette/appointments/appointments|title=Appointments|website=www.churchtimes.co.uk|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dioceseofnorwich.org/article?id=2449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bishopofmaidstone.org/licensing-assistant-bishop-rochester-diocese/|title=Licensing as Assistant Bishop in Rochester Diocese - The Bishop of Maidstone|website=www.bishopofmaidstone.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bishopofmaidstone.org/bishop-rod-to-be-assistant-bishop-in-growing-number-of-dioceses/|title=Bishop Rod to be Assistant Bishop in Growing Number of Dioceses - The Bishop of Maidstone|website=www.bishopofmaidstone.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church in Wales==
In the [[Church in Wales]], [[David Thomas (bishop)|David Thomas]] was appointed to the comparable office of Provincial Assistant Bishop in 1996 when the province voted to ordain women to the priesthood.

[[Image:Turku Cathedral on December morning.jpg|thumb|200px| The [[Cathedral of Turku]] is considered as the national shrine of Finland]]
[[Finland]] is a predominantly [[Christian]] nation where some 73% of the 5.5 million overall population follow [[Christianity]]; the vast majority being members of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] (Protestant), 26.3% are [[atheists]], having no religious belief at all, and 1.6% follow other religions like [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], [[folk religion]] etc.&lt;ref name="statfin"/&gt;

There are presently two [[National church]]es (as opposed to [[State church]]es): the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] (Protestant), which is the primary state religion representing 70.9% of the population by the end of 2017&lt;ref name="statfin"/&gt;, and the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], to which about 1.1 % of the population belongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/Kolme+nelj%C3%A4st%C3%A4+suomalaisesta+kuuluu+luterilaiseen+kirkkoon/a1305643997694|title=Kolme neljästä suomalaisesta kuuluu luterilaiseen kirkkoon|date=1 February 2013|work=HS.fi|publisher=Sanoma|language=Finnish|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ort.fi/uutiset/kirkon-vaeestoetilasto-2012|title=Kirkon väestötilasto 2012|date=23 January 2012|work=ORT.fi|publisher=Suomen ortodoksinen kirkko|language=Finnish|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Those who officially belong to one of the two national churches have part of their taxes turned over to their respective church.&lt;ref name=StateIR-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2013: Finland|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222213|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also approximately 50,000 followers of Pentecostal Christianity, and more than 12,000 Catholic Christians in Finland, along with Anglicans, and some various Independent Christian communities. Prior to its Christianisation, beginning in the 11th century, [[Finnish paganism]] was the country's primary religion. 

[[Irreligion in Finland]] is claimed by one fourth of the nation's total population. Other Scandinavian and Nordic countries also have large non-religious communities. 

The [[Muslim]] population in Finland is 1.2%, with more than 60,000 adherents, followed by [[Hinduism]] with 5,000 adherents, [[Buddhism]] with 5,000 adherents and [[Judaism]] with more than 1,500 adherents, respectively.

Most Finns     are members of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] (70.9%).&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;  With approximately 3.9 million members out of a total population of 5.5 million,&lt;ref name=statistics2&gt;{{cite web|title=Population by religious community, age and sex in 2000 to 2016|url=http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vaerak/065_vaerak_tau_206.px/?rxid=a9504f3a-6580-4017-aa77-55529fdd9203|publisher=Statistics Finland|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is one of the largest Lutheran churches in the world, although its membership has been on the decline recently. In 2015, [[Eroakirkosta.fi]], a website which offers an electronic service for resigning from Finland's state churches, reported that half a million church members had resigned from the church since the website was opened in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eroakirkosta.fi/media/none/tiedote_10_2015.html?year=2015 Eroakirkosta.fi-palvelulla 500 000 käyttäjää - Uskontokuntiin kuulumattomien osuus kaksinkertaistunut]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of church members leaving the Church saw a particular large increase during the fall of 2010. This was caused by statements regarding homosexuality and same-sex marriage - perceived to be intolerant towards [[LGBT people]] - made by a conservative bishop and a politician representing [[Christian Democrats (Finland)|Christian Democrats]] in a TV debate on the subject.&lt;ref name=Finns-leave&gt;{{cite news|title=Up to 18,000 Finns leave Lutheran Church over broadcasted anti-gay comments|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=up-to-18000-finns-leave-lutheran-church-over-broadcasted-anti-gay-comments-2010-10-18|accessdate=25 September 2015|agency=Helsingin Sanomat|date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second largest group - and a rather quickly growing one - of 26.3% by the end of 2017&lt;ref name="statistics" /&gt; of the population is non-religious. A small minority belong to the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] (1.1%) and to the [[Catholic Church]] (12,434 people or 0.2% of the population).&lt;ref name=diocese-helsinki&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dhels.html#stats|publisher=Catholic Diocese of Helsinki|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations are significantly smaller, as are the [[Sikhs]], [[Judaism in Finland|Jewish]], [[Islam in Finland|Muslim]], [[Buddhism in Finland|Buddhist]], [[Hinduism in Finland|Hindu]] and other non-Christian communities (totaling with the Catholics to about 1.6% of the population).

The main Lutheran and Orthodox churches are constitutional [[state church|national churches]] of Finland with special roles in ceremonies and often in school morning prayers. Delegates to Lutheran Church assemblies are selected in church elections every four years.

The majority of Lutherans attend church only for special occasions like Christmas, Easter, weddings and funerals. The Lutheran Church estimates that approximately 2 percent of its members attend church services weekly. The average number of church visits per year by church members is approximately two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35453.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2004 |work=[[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the most recent [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] (2010),&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf|title=Special Eurobarometer Biotechnology|page= 204|work=Fieldwork: January–February 2010; Publication: October 2010|accessdate=2012-10-17|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 22% "do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force". (In 2005, the figure was 16%)

According to Zuckerman (2005), 28-60% of Finns are agnostics, atheists, or non-believers.&lt;ref name="The Largest Atheist / Agnostic Populations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_atheist.html|title=Zuckerman, Phil.

== The Evangelical Lutheran Church ==
{{main|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland}}
[[File:Petäjävesi Old Church from south.JPG|thumb|right|[[Petäjävesi Old Church]] is an old Lutheran wooden church and a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]].]]
In 2017, the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Finland had about 3.9 million members, which is 70.9% of the population, registered with a parish. The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Finland is an episcopal church, that is governed by bishops, with a very strong tradition of parish autonomy. It comprises nine dioceses with ten bishops{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and 408 independent parishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Seurakuntaliitokset | trans-title = Parish mergers | publisher = Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland | work = evl.fi | date = 2016 | accessdate = 23 July 2016 | url = http://evl.fi/EVLfi.nsf/Documents/56B3F18677075BDEC225720C003B4B73?OpenDocument&amp;lang=EN | language = fi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average parish has 7,000 members, with the smallest parishes comprising only a few hundred members and the largest tens of thousands.&lt;ref name="Heino1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heino|first=Harri|title=Mihin Suomi tänään uskoo|trans-title=What does Finland believe in today|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=WSOY|location=Helsinki|language=fi|isbn=951-0-27265-5|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years many parishes have united in order to safeguard their viability. In addition, municipal mergers have prompted parochial mergers as there may be only one parish, or cluster of parishes, in a given municipality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Population register ==
Traditionally, the church has played a very important role in maintaining a population register in Finland. The vicars have maintained a church record of persons born, married and deceased in their parishes since at least the 1660s, constituting one of the oldest population records in Europe. This system was in place for over 300 years. It was only replaced by a computerised central population database in 1971, while the two state churches continued to maintain population registers in co-operation with the government's local register offices until 1999, when the churches' task was limited to only maintaining a membership register.&lt;ref name=vrk-history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=42|title=History|work=VRK.fi|publisher=[[Population Register Centre (Finland)|Population Register Centre]]|accessdate=18 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703082853/http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=42|archivedate=3 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1919 and 1970, a separate Civil Register was maintained of those who had no affiliation with either of the state churches.&lt;ref name=vrk-history /&gt; Currently, the centralised Population Information System records the person's affiliation with a legally recognised religious community, if any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=176|title=Rekisteriselosteet|work=VRK.fi|publisher=Väestörekisterikeskus|language=Finnish|accessdate=18 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513124630/http://www.vrk.fi/default.aspx?id=176|archivedate=13 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the new Freedom of Religion Act made it possible to resign from religious communities in writing. That is, by letter, or any written form acceptable to authorities. This is also extended to [[email]] by the 2003 electronic communications in the public sector act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2003/en20030013|title=Act on Electronic Services and Communication in the Public Sector|date=16 October 2003|work=FINLEX.fi|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resignation by email became possible in 2005 in most magistrates. [[Eroakirkosta.fi]], an Internet campaign promoting resignation from religious communities, challenged the rest of the magistrates through a letter to the [[Parliamentary Ombudsman|parliamentary ombudsman]]. In November 2006, the ombudsman recommended that all magistrates should accept resignations from religious communities via email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduskunta.fi/eoaratkaisut/eoak+2051/2005|title=Dnro 2051/4/05|last=Jääskeläinen|first=Petri|date=30 November 2006 |work=Eduskunta.fi|publisher=Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman|language=Finnish|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the recommendation by the ombudsman, the magistrates of Helsinki and Hämeenlinna do not accept church membership resignations sent via the Eroakirkosta.fi service.&lt;ref&gt;Eroakirkosta.fi - [http://eroakirkosta.fi/media/none/tiedote_10_2011.html?year=2011 Helsingin maistraatti jarruttaa kirkosta eroamista]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rene Rancourt'''  (born August 4, 1939)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/city/story/1040738 |title=Rene Rancourt: Boston Bruins' crooner started here |publisher=Sun Journal |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbackgroundchecks.com/SearchResponse.aspx?view=NM&amp;fn=Rene&amp;mn=&amp;ln=Rancourt&amp;city=&amp;state=&amp;zip=&amp;dob=19390804&amp;age= |title=You searched: Rene Rancourt 19390804 |publisher=Public Background Checks |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American singer. Rancourt has sung the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|U.S.]] and [[O Canada|Canadian]] [[National Anthem|national anthems]] at the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Boston Bruins]] home [[hockey]] games for over 40 years. He performed his last regular season anthem on April 8, 2018 after 42 years. He sang both anthems before Game 7 of the NHL Eastern Conference quarterfinal playoff series between the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and Bruins on April 25, 2018.

==Early life==
Rancourt was born in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], [[Maine]], the son of Leon Rancourt and Bernadette Guenette, French-Canadians from Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;[https://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/jacques-noel/monsieur-star-spangled-banner-a-boston-est-un-rancourt-damerique_a_23397365/ Monsieur «Star Spangled Banner» à Boston est un Rancourt d'Amérique] Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://newengland.com/today/living/new-england-nostalgia/rene-rancourt/ Rene Rancourt | Boston’s National Anthem Singer] New England Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salemnews.com/news/state_news/star-spangled-career-bruins-rene-rancourt-reflects-on-a-life/article_0b8ec8bb-9b87-50db-abe7-5b5e4eb46192.html Star-spangled career: Bruins' Rene Rancourt reflects on a life defined by the national anthem] The Salem News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Rancourt first began singing the anthem in Boston at [[Fenway Park]]. He took part in an [[opera]] singing audition on the [[radio]] and was heard by [[John Kiley]], long-time [[organist]] at both Fenway and the Boston Garden. Rancourt sang before Game 6 of the [[1975 World Series|World Series]] in 1975 when singer [[Kate Smith]] cancelled her appearance. Rancourt's ambition was to become an opera singer. The strength of his trained voice overcame the acoustic shortcomings of the old [[Boston Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://warwickonline.com/stories/bruins-anthem-singer-coming-to-reds-reunion-this-weekend,38806?print=1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, he began singing regularly for [[Boston Bruins]] games.

Rancourt's signature fist-pump at the end of the anthem was modeled after the "Stump Pump" of former Bruin [[Randy Burridge]], whom Rancourt admired. Rancourt also salutes at the end of the anthem. The salute is for men and women who have served in the armed forces, although it was initially inspired by an elderly fan of Rancourt.&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/legendary-boston-bruins-anthem-singer-rene-rancourt-reflects-on-his-career?curator=SportsREDEF&lt;/ref&gt; Rancourt performs the anthem before Bruins games, as well as singing at auto races, charity events and nursing homes in and around New England. He does not have a contract with the Bruins. According to Rancourt, "I've never had a contract; I've always just shown up and I've become associated with the Bruins."

Rancourt served in the U.S. Army in the 1960s in which after winning a singing contest he was assigned to GI traveling show which kept him from being sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunjournal.com/city/story/1040738 "Rene Rancourt: Bruins crooner got his start here" Lewiston-Auburn (ME) Sun Journal, June 6, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2018, the Bruins announced that Rancourt would retire at the end of the [[2017–18 NHL season|2017–18 season]]. He was honored during the Bruins' last regular season game against the [[Florida Panthers]] on April 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=bostonbruins.com|title=Bruins Announce Rene Rancourt's Retirement|url=https://www.nhl.com/bruins/news/bruins-announce-rene-rancourts-retirement/c-295026710|website=NHL.com|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His final playoff game was Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Second Round vs. the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] on May 4, 2018.  After the Lightning eliminated the Bruins in five games, he retired for good.

{{no footnotes|date=August 2016}}
'''[[Sadhu]] Haridas''' ([[Floruit|fl]]. 1837) was a [[hatha yoga|hatha yogi]] and [[fakir]] of nineteenth-century [[India]], renowned for his reputed power to control his body completely using the power of his mind, employing the energies of [[kundalini]].  His most notable feat, carried out in 1837, was to survive burial underground, without food or water, for forty days.  This feat was said to have taken place at the court of the [[Maharaja]] of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Ranjit Singh]], at [[Lahore]], India (now in [[Pakistan]]).

==Description==
Haridas was allegedly interred in the presence of the Maharaja, his whole court, and a number of French and British doctors. He adopted a sitting posture, and was covered over and sewn up in [[cerecloth]].  He was then placed inside a large wooden case, which was strongly riveted closed and sealed with the Maharaja’s own seal. The case was then lowered into a specially-constructed brick vault. Earth was piled upon the case, and a detachment of the Maharaja's guard was placed to keep watch over the vault; four sentries mounting guard over it by day, and eight by night. Forty days later, Haridas was disinterred in the presence of the Maharaja, his court, and the French and English doctors who had been previously present at his interment.  His apparently lifeless body was washed with hot water, massaged, and [[ghee]] placed on his eyelids and tongue; in a short time, he had recovered.

According to [[Claude Wade]], the British Resident at the Maharaja's court:  "From the time of the box being opened to the recovery of the voice, not more than half an hour could have elapsed; and in another half-hour, the Fakir talked with myself and those about him freely, though feebly, like a sick person. Then we left him, convinced that there had been no fraud or collusion in the exhibition we had witnessed."

The '''Siyot Caves''', sometimes referred to as the '''Kateshwar Budhhist Caves''',&lt;ref name="MishraRay2016" /&gt; are five [[Indian rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] caves located near Siyot village in the Lakpat Taluka of [[Kutch district]], [[Gujarat]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ignca.nic.in/mausam/Mausam_Concept.pdf |title=Maritime Landscapes and Coastal Architecture: The Long Coastline of India |last=Ray |first=Himanshu Prabha |website=IGNCA |page=3 |format=PDF |dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cave has east facing sanctum, ambulatory and space divisions which suggests a [[Shiva]] temple from the first or second century.&lt;ref name="MishraRay2016"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Susan Verma Mishra |author2=Himanshu Prabha Ray |title=The Archaeology of Sacred Spaces: The Temple in Western India, 2nd Century BCE–8th Century CE |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtDLDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |date=5 August 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-19374-6 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cave was used by Buddhists later which can be concluded based on the seals found herein and the traces of [[Brahmi]] inscriptions.

The excavation in 1988–89 recovered clay seals engraved with Buddha images in various [[mudra]]s and seals engraved with late Brahmi and [[Devnagari]] inscriptions. Other findings were copper rings, Gadhaiya coins, terracotta [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] with bell and chain, different types of earthen wares like ''Surahi''.

{{Jewish Labour Bund}}
The '''''Sotsyalistishe Kinder Farband or SKIF''''' ('Socialist Children's Union', '''S.K.I.F.''')&lt;ref&gt;Blatman, Daniel (2003). "For Our Freedom and Yours", Vallentine Mitchell.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in Eastern Europe as the youth organisation of the [[Jewish Labour Bund]], a Jewish Socialist political party. S.K.I.F has three core ideological principles: ''Chavershaft'' ("camaraderie", equality and empathy), ''[[Doikayt]]'' ("Being here", Jews should live, build their culture and struggle for their rights wherever they dwell, rather than seeking refuge in a [[Jewish homeland]]), and ''Yiddishkeit'' ([[Jewish identity]] through Jewish and Yiddish culture).&lt;ref&gt;http://skifinmelb.weebly.com/info.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multiculturalaustralia.edu.au/library/media/Video/id/1549.Arnold-Zable-describes-the-Bund-and-SKIF-and-post-Holocaust-development-of-the-Jewish-community-&lt;/ref&gt; The plural form of a SKIF member is ''Skifistn'' and the leaders who run skif are the ''Helfers'', aged 18-20.

The S.K.I.F. in Poland is now defunct.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skif.org.au/history%20files/skif_history.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melbourne]] S.K.I.F established itself in 1950. Melbourne SKIF, is one of the last remaining SKIF branches, subsequently it is usually regarded as the SKIF organization itself. However, the SKIF in France didn't disband, but in 1963 changed its name to [[:fr:Club laïque de l'enfance juive|Club laïque de l’Enfance juive]], CLEJ.

==S.K.I.F. in Poland==
In [[Interwar Poland]] and in [[Occupied Poland]], various members of the [[Jewish resistance under Nazi rule|Jewish Resistance]] were or had been associated with S.K.I.F. One of the leaders of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], [[Marek Edelman]] had been a S.K.I.F. member, as were members of the underground [[Jewish Fighting Organization]] [[Boruch Pelc]] and [[Jurek Błones]]. Other notable [[History of the Jews in Poland#World War II and the destruction of Polish Jewry (1939–45)|Jewish]] members included the painter [[Yosl Bergner]], the [[RAF]] pilot [[Rubin Lifszyc]] and the organizer of children's theater for the poor in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], [[Pola Lifszyc]]. Before [[World War II]], S.K.I.F. organized summer camps for children. [[Marek Edelman]], as a member of the organization, raised funds for playrooms for the children of the poor, in [[Warsaw]].

==S.K.I.F. in Melbourne==
The S.K.I.F. in Melbourne, Australia, was established in 1950. The first five children held weekly "Sunday meetings". They still have these today, with approximately 25 children attending. By the fourth year of Melbourne SKIF camps, there were enough campers to operate two separate camps. The organisation now runs three camps a year (summer, winter and spring, which is for seniors only) and at its peak has an average camp attendance of eighty children. The final two years of membership are spent in an intensive training course to prepare those who wish to continue as leaders.

With in the Melbourne Jewish Community, it is the only non-Zionist youth movement and the only one to sit outside of the umbrella organization of the Zionist Youth Council. Activities are focused more on broader topics to do with culture, (such as music appreciation,) rather than Israel and Jewish theology. Contrary to popular belief, the organisation is not anti-Zionist.

Whilst a number of activities and names pay homage to the groups socialist, worker past; the SKIF of today has a membership base with a broader political and social orientation.

'''Ten of Wands''' is a [[Minor Arcana]] [[Tarot]] card of the [[Suit of Wands]].

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;
{{cite book

  | date = 1980
  | isbn = 0-7156-1014-7
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==

Most often, the Ten of Wands card carries the meaning of overload and burdening situations where too much responsibility has been taken on by the subject. The trick is, can the subject (the [[supplicant]]) actually carry the burden, making progress beyond the [[Nine of Wands]] (seeing the burden with some small apprehension), to arrive at a balanced conclusion, as does the [[Page of Wands]]? [[Balance (metaphysics)|Balance]] is everything and everlasting – a state or place where [[acceptance]] is chosen in disregard of [[panic]]. "Balance walks the wire, whilst panic is in partnership with the perilous."

==Key Meanings==
The key meanings of the Ten of Wands:&lt;ref&gt;Trusted Tarot (2010) [http://www.trustedtarot.com/cards/ten-of-wands/ Ten of Wands]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Burdens
*Challenges
*Intense pressure
*Oppression
*Overcommitment

==Rider-Waite symbolism==

* A person overburdened by his enterprise, is nevertheless active and on the move, but not seeing past his wands (or obligations).
* A [[city]] can be observed in the background. He may be headed there, perhaps with the goal of ridding himself of this load.

'''Teresa Luisa Gardi''' (22 October 1769 – 1 January 1837) was an Italian [[Roman Catholic]] and a member of the [[Secular Franciscan Order]]. She devoted her life to the examples of the great saints [[John of the Cross]] and [[Teresa of Avila]]. She recorded a journal of experiences but such a journal did not reveal the details - she remained guarded on strong religious experiences.

She was declared to be [[Venerable]] in 2015 after [[Pope Francis]] recognized that she had lived a model life of [[heroic virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/venerable-teresa-luisa-gardi/|title=Venerable Teresa Luisa Gardi|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.santiebeati.it/santi_search.php%3Fquery%3DTeresa&amp;prev=search|title=Venerable Teresa Gardi|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Teresa Luisa Gardi was born in [[Imola]] on 22 October 1769; she had three brothers and sisters. Her mother died first in 1782 and her father soon followed in 1790. Despite these losses she looked after her siblings as she was the eldest. Her adolescence was spent in the home as she cared for her siblings and despite her poor health she dedicated her free time to the sick and the poor. She was devoted to the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.santiebeati.it/santi_search.php%3Fquery%3DTeresa&amp;prev=search|title=Venerable Teresa Gardi|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardi became a member of the [[Secular Franciscan Order]] in 1801 in an attempt to enter religious life and to follow the example of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]. Her profession into the order was made on 15 October 1802. She also devoted her time to emulating the examples of both Saints [[John of the Cross]] and [[Teresa of Avila]]. It was in 1804 that she started to have ecstatic visions and this was perhaps more prevalent after the reception of the Eucharist and during the [[Via Crucis]]. But it was on 25 July 1804 that she received the [[stigmata]] on each hand as well as her feet and side. The wounds on her feet caused her the difficulties of walking. Her spiritual advisor was the [[Order of Friars Minor|Capuchin]] Carlo Francesco Zanini from 1800 to his own death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/venerable-teresa-luisa-gardi/|title=Venerable Teresa Luisa Gardi|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in 1837 in Imola of an [[edema]] and was buried in the Church of the Observance. It was Cardinal Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti - the future [[Pope Pius IX]] - who affixed the inscription on her tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.santiebeati.it/santi_search.php%3Fquery%3DTeresa&amp;prev=search|title=Venerable Teresa Gardi|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beatification process==
The beatification process commenced under [[Pope John Paul II]] on 4 April 1995 which accorded her the title [[Servant of God]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} The process saw documentation being gathered in order to record her life and her virtues which were integral to the cause. It closed in Imola under the direction of Bishop Giuseppe Fabiani in a special Mass. The [[Positio]] was later submitted to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] in 1999.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

'''''Time Bandits''''' is a 1981 British [[fantasy film]] co-written, produced, and directed by [[Terry Gilliam]] and starring [[Sean Connery]], [[John Cleese]], [[Shelley Duvall]], [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Katherine Helmond]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Peter Vaughn]], and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]].

Gilliam has referred to ''Time Bandits'' as the first in his "Trilogy of Imagination", followed by ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985) and ending with ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988).&lt;ref name="essay"&gt;Matthews, Jack (1996). "Dreaming Brazil". Essay accompanying [[The Criterion Collection]] DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; All are about the "craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible."&lt;ref name="essay" /&gt; All three films focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination: ''Time Bandits'' through the eyes of a child, ''Brazil'' through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and ''Munchausen'' through the eyes of an elderly man.&lt;ref name="essay" /&gt;

==Plot==
Eleven-year-old Kevin has a vivid imagination and is fascinated by history, particularly [[ancient Greece]]; his parents ignore his activities, having become more obsessed with buying the latest household gadgets to keep up with their neighbours. One night, as Kevin is sleeping, an armoured knight on a horse bursts out of his wardrobe. Kevin is scared and hides as the knight rides off into a forest setting where once his bedroom wall was; when Kevin looks back out, the room is back to normal and he finds one of his photos on the wall similar to the forest he saw. The next night he prepares a satchel with supplies and a [[Polaroid camera]] but is surprised when six [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] spill out of the wardrobe. Kevin quickly learns the group has stolen a large, worn map and is looking for an exit from his room before they are discovered. They find that the bedroom wall can be pushed, revealing a long hallway. Kevin is hesitant to join until the visage of a menacing head—the Supreme Being—appears behind them, demanding the return of the map. Kevin and the dwarves fall into an empty void at the end of the hallway.

They land in Italy during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As they recover, Kevin learns that Randall is the lead dwarf of the group, which also includes Fidgit, Strutter, Og, Wally, and Vermin. They were once employed by the Supreme Being to repair holes in the [[spacetime]] fabric, but instead they realized the potential to use the map to steal riches. With the map and Kevin's help, they visit several locations in spacetime and meet figures such as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[Robin Hood]]. Kevin uses his camera to document their visits. They are unaware, however, that their activities are being monitored by Evil, a malevolent being who is able to manipulate reality and is attempting to acquire the map himself so that he can remake the universe to his design.

Through Evil's actions, Kevin becomes separated from the group and ends up in [[Mycenaean Greece]], meeting King [[Agamemnon]]. After Kevin inadvertently helps Agamemnon kill an enemy, the king adopts him. Randall and the others soon locate Kevin and abduct him, much to his resentment, and escape through another hole, arriving on the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. After it sinks, they are forced to tread water while they argue with each other. Evil manipulates the group and transports them to his realm, the Time of Legends. After surviving encounters with ogres and a giant, Kevin and the dwarves locate the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness and are led to believe that "The Most Fabulous Object in the World" awaits them, luring them into Evil's trap. Evil takes the map and locks the group in a cage over an apparently bottomless pit. While looking through the Polaroids he took, Kevin finds one that includes the map, and the group realises there is a hole in the Fortress near them. They escape from the cage, steal the map again and split: Kevin must distract their pursuers while the others go through the hole.

Evil confronts Kevin and takes the map back from him. The dwarves return with various warriors and fighting machines taken across time, but Evil has no trouble overpowering them all. As Kevin and the dwarves cower, Evil prepares to unleash his ultimate power. Suddenly, he is engulfed in flames and burned into charcoal; from the smoke, a besuited middle-aged man emerges, revealed as the [[Supreme Being]]. He reveals that he allowed the dwarves to borrow his map and the whole adventure had been a test of his creation. He orders the dwarves to collect all the pieces of concentrated Evil, warning that they can be deadly if not contained, recovers the map and allows the dwarves to rejoin him in his creation duties. The Supreme Being disappears with the dwarves, leaving Kevin stranded behind as a missed piece of Evil begins to smoulder.

Kevin awakes in his bedroom to find it filled with smoke. Firefighters break down the door and rescue him as they put out a fire in his house. One of the firemen finds that his parents' new toaster oven caused the fire. As Kevin recovers, he finds one of the firemen resembles Agamemnon and discovers that he still has the photos from his adventure. Kevin's parents discover a smouldering rock in the toaster oven. Recognizing it as a piece of Evil, Kevin warns them not to touch it. Ignoring him, they touch it and explode, leaving only their shoes. Kevin tentatively approaches the smoking shoes and is seen from above as his figure grows smaller, revealing the planet and then outer space, before being rolled up in the map by the Supreme Being.

==Production==
[[Terry Gilliam]] wrote the screenplay with fellow [[Monty Python]] alumnus [[Michael Palin]], who appears with [[Shelley Duvall]] in the small, recurring roles of Vincent and Pansy. The London-based independent company was backed in part by former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]], who wrote and performed the closing credits song "[[Dream Away (George Harrison song)|Dream Away]]" especially for this film. He is credited, together with [[Denis O'Brien (producer)|Denis O'Brien]], as being one of the [[executive producer]]s of the film.

In his book ''Monty Python: The Case Against Irreverence, Scurrility, Profanity, Vilification, and Licentious Abuse'', [[Robert Hewison]] describes the dwarfs as representing the [[Monty Python]] troupe. The nice one, Fidgit, is said to represent Palin; the self-appointed leader, Randall, Cleese; the acerbic one, Strutter, [[Eric Idle]]; the quiet one, Og, [[Graham Chapman]]; the noisy rebel, Wally, [[Terry Jones]]; and the nasty, filth-loving one, Vermin, Gilliam himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hewison, Robert (1989). ''Monty Python: The Case Against''. Heinemann Educational Books. {{ISBN|0-413-48660-5}}&lt;!-- Where in the book is this claim made? Page #s are necessary. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on the UK Arrow Blu-ray release of ''Time Bandits'' Gilliam claimed that the lyrics to "Dream Away" are Harrison's notes to him concerning Gilliam's behaviour during the production of the film and, more specifically, the tension that arose between them due to Gilliam's reluctance to include any songs performed by Harrison in the film.

==Reception==
''Time Bandits'' received critical acclaim and grossed over {{USD}}40 million on a budget of $5 million (£2.2 million).&lt;ref name="icon"&gt;Walker, Alexander (2005). ''Icons in the Fire: The Rise and Fall of Practically Everyone in the British Film Industry 1984–2000''. Orion Books. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed in a [[DVD]] interview with Palin and Gilliam, the film came out in the fall season (after the blockbuster summer films, but before the hit Christmas season) and became extremely successful at the U.S. box office, grossing $42.4 million, and making the film Gilliam's breakthrough hit in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=timebandits.htm ''Time Bandits''] at boxofficemojo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an 89% rating based on 45 reviews, averaging 7.9/10; the consensus states, "''Time Bandits'' is a remarkable time-travel fantasy from Terry Gilliam, who utilizes fantastic set design and homemade special effects to create a vivid, original universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_bandits/ | title=Time Bandits | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV series==
By July 2018, [[Apple Inc.]] worked with [[Anonymous Content]], [[Paramount Television]] and [[Media Rights Capital]] to gain rights for a ''Time Bandits'' television series, with Gilliam on board in a non-writing production role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://deadline.com/2018/07/time-bandits-apple-tv-series-deal-terry-gilliam-anonymous-content-paramount-television-mrc-1202435077/ | title = Apple Makes Rights Deal To Turn Terry Gilliam’s ‘Time Bandits’ Into TV Series | first = Mike | last = Fleming Jr. | date = July 28, 2018 | accessdate = July 28, 2018 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12127">[[File:Eduard Gurk Sankt Stephan.jpg|right|thumb|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], the most important edifice of the Roman Catholic Church in Vienna. Mozart's marriage and funeral took place here.]]
The celebrated composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was raised a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], and the church played an important role in his life.

==Life==

===Catholic upbringing===

Mozart's parents ([[Leopold Mozart]] and [[Anna Maria Mozart]]) were Catholics and raised their children in this religion, insisting upon strict obedience to the requirements of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Einstein, ''Mozart, His Character, His Work'', Oxford University Press: 1945, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; They encouraged family [[prayer]], [[fasting]], the veneration of [[saint]]s, regular attendance at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and frequent [[Confession (religion)|confession]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisen and Keefe (2006, 324)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold Mozart continued to urge strict observance upon Wolfgang even when the latter had entered adulthood. In 1777, he wrote to his wife and son, who at the time were on their journey to Paris:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Is it necessary for me to ask whether Wolfgang is not perhaps getting a little lax about confession? God must come first! From His hands we receive our temporal happiness; and at the same time we must think of our eternal salvation. Young people do not like to hear about these things, I know, for I was once young myself. But, thank God, in spite of all my youthful foolish pranks, I always pulled myself together. I avoid all dangers to my soul and ever kept God and my honor and the consequences, the ''very dangerous consequences'', before my eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Quote in Solomon 1995, 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By "very dangerous consequences", Leopold was most probably referring to a specific doctrine of Catholicism, namely that persons who die in a state of [[mortal sin]] will experience eternal punishment in [[hell]].

Leopold extended another important element of Catholic belief—the existence of earthly [[miracle]]s as signs from God—to the case of his son, whose abilities he considered to have a divine origin. In 1768, he wrote to his friend Lorenz Hagenauer, describing his son as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a miracle, which God has allowed to see the light in Salzburg ... And if it is ever to be my duty to convince the world of this miracle, it is so now, when people are ridiculing whatever is called a miracle and denying all miracles ... But because this miracle is too evident and consequently not to be denied, they want to suppress it. They refuse to let God have the honor.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon 1995, 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Order of the Golden Spur===

[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|Mozart wearing the insignia of the Order of the Golden Spur. Copy, dated 1777, of an older painting dating from his Italian journey]]

As a teenager, Mozart went on [[Mozart in Italy|tours of Italy]], accompanied by his father. During the first of these, Leopold and Wolfgang visited [[Rome]] (1770), where Wolfgang was awarded the [[Order of the Golden Spur]], a form of honorary [[knighthood]], by [[Pope Clement XIV]]. The papal patent for the award said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inasmuch as it behoves the beneficence of the Roman [[Pontiff]] and the [[Apostolic See]] that those who have shown them no small signs of faith and devotion and are graced with the merits of probity and virtue, shall be decorated with the honours and favors of the Roman Pontiff and the said See. (4 July 1770)&lt;ref&gt;Printed in translation in Deutsch 1965, 123–124&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following day Mozart received his official insignia, consisting of "a golden cross on a red sash, sword, and spurs," emblematic of honorary knighthood.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965, 124&lt;/ref&gt; The papal patent also absolved the awardee from any previous sentence of [[excommunication]] (unnecessary in Mozart's case) and stated "it is our wish that thou shalt at all times wear the Golden Cross." In the 1777 painting (shown here) known as the "Bologna Mozart", Mozart is indeed shown wearing his knightly insignia.

Mozart's Golden Spur decoration was the source of an unpleasant incident in October 1777, when he visited [[Augsburg]] during the job-hunting tour (1777–1779) that ultimately took him to Paris. Following the advice of his father,&lt;ref name="Schroeder 1999:87"&gt;Schroeder (1999:87)&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart wore his insignia in public, and in particular to a dinner arranged by a young aristocrat named Jakob Alois Karl Langenmantel. Langenmantel and his brother-in-law teased Mozart mercilessly about the insignia, and Mozart ultimately was moved to reply very sharply and eventually depart.&lt;ref&gt;The incident is described in detail in Melograni (2006:75–76), relying on a letter from Mozart to his father dated 16 October.&lt;/ref&gt; Thenceforth Mozart showed considerably more caution in wearing his decoration.&lt;ref name="Schroeder 1999:87" /&gt;

===Marriage===
Matrimony is a [[sacrament]] of the Roman Catholic Church, and Mozart was wedded in a Church ceremony. His bride was [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze Weber]]; the two were married on 4 August 1782 in a side chapel of [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in Vienna where they lived.&lt;ref&gt;Heartz (2009:47)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry===
{{Main|Mozart and Freemasonry}}
Mozart joined the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] in 1784, and remained an active member until his death. His choice to enter the lodge "Zur Wohltätigkeit" was influenced by his friendship with the lodge's master, Baron [[Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen-Hornberg]], and his attraction to the lodge's "shared devotion to Catholic tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Gutman 1999, 645&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was Mozart's Masonic commitment the most likely source of his occasional anti-clerical statements, and even less indicative of any essential antipathy to Catholicism. Such anti-clericalism is much more easily attributed to the fashionable anti-clericalism of [[Febronian]] Catholicism favored by those in power in Mozart's social ambit at this period, which still reflected curiously a very conservative Counter-Reformation aesthetic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Paul Fuchs: "A Resolution of Mozart and Freemasonry: Enlightenment and the Persistence of Counter-Reformation" (masonmusic.org).&lt;/ref&gt;

Freemasonry was banned by the Catholic Church in a Papal Bull entitled ''[[In eminenti apostolatus]]'' issued by [[Pope Clement XII]] on 28 April 1738. The ban, however, "was published and came into force only in the Papal States, Spain, Portugal, and Poland."&lt;ref&gt;Fahlbusch 2003, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not promulgated in Austria, where Mozart lived, until 1792 (after Mozart's death). Hence, although the Catholic Church's opposition to Freemasonry would eventually become known in Austria, during Mozart's lifetime "a good Catholic could perfectly well become a Mason," and it is clear that Mozart saw no conflict between these two allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein 1945, p. 81 and 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last rites===
There is conflicting evidence concerning whether Mozart received [[last rites]] of the Catholic Church on his death bed. In 1825, 33 years after Mozart's death, Mozart's sister-in-law [[Sophie Haibel]] prepared a brief memoir of Mozart's death for her brother-in-law [[Georg Nikolaus von Nissen]], the second husband of Mozart's widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]], who with Constanze's help was then preparing a Mozart biography. Sophie wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My poor sister came after me and begged me for heavens' sake to go to the priests at St Peter's and ask [one of] the priests to come, as if on a chance visit. That I also did, though the priests hesitated a long time and I had great difficulty in persuading one of these inhuman priests to do it.&lt;ref&gt;English translation taken from Deutsch (1965:525)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further annotations were written on Sophie's letter. One of them, in Nissen's hand, says, "The priests declined to come because the sick person himself did not send for them."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon 1995, 497&lt;/ref&gt; According to Halliwell, "A later annotation states that although Mozart did not receive the last rites (presumably [[absolution]] and [[Holy Communion]]), he was given [[extreme unction]]. Thus there is confusion about which, if any, of the sacraments for the sick and dying Mozart received."&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell 2006:207)&lt;/ref&gt; Gutman claims that Mozart was incapable of receiving any last rites other than extreme unction because he was unconscious at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman 1999:743-44)&lt;/ref&gt;
While it is unclear whether Mozart received last rites on his deathbed, there is no evidence suggesting that he actually refused them. Even Nissen, who was of the opinion that the priests failed to come, notes, "Even if Mozart did not receive the last rites, he would have received extreme unction."

===Funeral===
Mozart received a Catholic funeral service at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] and was given [[Wikt:exequy|exequies]] at a [[requiem]] mass in [[St. Michael's Church, Vienna|St. Michael's Church]].&lt;ref name="Eisen and Keefe 2006, 325"&gt;Eisen and Keefe 2006, 325&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgical works==
{{see also|List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart#Sacred music}}

During his lifetime, Mozart composed more than 60 pieces of sacred music. The majority were written between 1773 and 1781, when he was employed as court musician to the [[Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]].&lt;ref name="ncronline.org"&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Allen|title=Mozart: Catholic, Master Mason, favorite of the pope|date=1 September 2006|publisher= |url=http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006c/090106/090106i.php|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|pages = |accessdate=10 November 2007|language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204040828/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006c/090106/090106i.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important later liturgical works included the [[Große Messe (Mozart)|Mass in C minor]] ([[Köchel-Verzeichnis|K.]] 427), written for the Salzburg visit of 1783, the [[motet]] ''[[Ave verum corpus (Mozart)|Ave verum corpus]]'' (K. 618), written in [[Baden bei Wien|Baden]] in 1791, and the [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem mass]] (K. 626), left incomplete at Mozart's death.

Research on paper types by [[Alan Tyson]] suggests that a number of works long thought to be Salzburg material actually may date from Mozart's late Vienna years. As Tyson notes, this would make sense since Mozart was at the time engaged in a (successful) campaign to be appointed as the designated successor to [[Leopold Hofmann]] in the [[Kapellmeister]] position at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyson (1987:26-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wooden idols''' have traditionally been made in India, as a tractabe and commonly-available material to artists and craftsmen in architecture and sculpture. Few specimens survive of early works due to the perishable nature of wood, particularly ina hot and humid climate. However, other sources demonstrate the ancient use of woodcarving in Indian art.&lt;ref&gt;“…a motif was not necessarily invented or borrowed at the date of its first appearance in permanent material; indeed, a first appearance in stone is almost tantamount to proof of an earlier currency in wood.” – Ananda K Coomarswamy. see (1972). ''Introduction to Indian Art''. New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal. p 17&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a tradition of making [[icon]]s, often also of wood.&lt;ref&gt;see Dasgupta, Kalyan Kumar. (1990). ''Wood Carvings of Eastern India''. Kolkata: Firma KLM Pvt. Ltd. p 13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Earliest Reference'''

The earliest reference to any wooden idol made in India goes to the legend of Jīvantasvāmī – a sandalwood image of Mahāvīra or Vardhamāna,&lt;ref&gt;Died in c. BC 527.&lt;/ref&gt; the last Tīrthaṅkara of Jain pantheon. It is said that the idol was carved in his lifetime and worshiped by his followers.&lt;ref&gt;see ''ibid'', p 11. In this connection, mention could be made of another old tradition that refers to a wooden effigy of ''Yakṣa Moggarāpāni'' in a shrine outside the city of ''Rājagṛha'' (modern Rajgir, dist Nalanda, Bihar).&lt;/ref&gt;  This myth, though not materially substantiated, is an obvious proof in favor of an artistic practice – prevailing in the sixth century BC. However, it was only after another seven centuries that we find the oldest literary mention of wood as a suitable plastic medium for the sculpting of cult-icons.&lt;ref&gt;The other mediums are gold, silver, copper, jewels, stone, iron and alloy (Ch 258, ''sūtra'' 20-1). [see Tarkaratna, Panchanan &amp; Nyayateertha, Sreejib (tr. &amp; ed.). (''BS 1394''). ''Matsyapurāṇam''. Kolkata: Nava Bharat Publishers. p 892]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Textual References'''

The first concrete evidence to the tradition of making wooden idols comes in the form of an epigraph, hailed from today’s Andhra Pradesh. This inscription of Abhirā Vāsudeva, dated c. AD 278, describes an eight-armed wooden sculpture of Lord Viṣn̄u – named as Aṣṭabhujasvāmī. This effigy, said to have medicinal and energizing properties,&lt;ref&gt;see Chakraborty, Shyamal Kanti (ed.). (2001). ''Wood Carvings of Bengal in Gurusaday Museum''. Kolkata: Gurusaday Museum. p 7; also see Dasgupta, Kalyan Kumar. (2000). ''Pratimāśilpe Hindu Devadevī''. Kolkata: ''Paścimbaṅga Bāṅglā Ākādemi''. pp 11-2&lt;/ref&gt;  was installed on the Siddhalahari hill bordering Nagarjunikonda valley. The specimen, however, is not available today; yet the reference indeed ensures a living tradition in the third century AD. The next thirteen hundred odd years saw the tradition continuing with its vitality and context – and being documented in a series of indigenous literature.

All these texts, variably dated c. second-sixteenth century AD, tell us about a prevailing convention for the classification of divine images – based on the materials used in making them. They also tell us, categorically, how each and every such classification has referred to wood as one of the most suitable medium for this purpose.

In brief, all these scriptures proclaim in favor of seven major varieties – while each list contains wood as one of the most common phenomenon.

Such evidences are available also in other medieval writings like Vṛhat Saṁhitā&lt;ref&gt;Written by ''Varāhamihira'' in c. sixth century AD. See Ch XLIII, LIII and LIX [Bhat, M Ramakrishna (tr.) 1982 (part II): pp 564-7]&lt;/ref&gt; and Viṣn̄udharmottaram.&lt;ref&gt;Dated abruptly c. AD 400-500/450-650/600-900/600-1000. See Khanda III, ch 89 [Shah, Priyabala (tr.). (2002). ''Sri Visnudharmottara Purana''. Third Khanda. Delhi: Parimal Publications. pp 214-6]&lt;/ref&gt; They have discussed in length about all the intricate details on the ways and means of procuring suitable timber for the fashioning of divine images. Both have emphasized, in particular, on four significant aspects:
* suitability of different varieties of wood,
* trees that should be considered as forbidden, and
* suitable time for entering the forest, and
* technique of cutting down the required tree/s.
Similar instructions could also be traced in other texts like Viśvakarmā Prakāśa&lt;ref&gt;see Dasgupta 1990: p 7&lt;/ref&gt; and Rājaballabhava.&lt;ref&gt;see ''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mention could be made, in this connection, about the historical accounts by Huen Tsang or Hiuen Tsang,&lt;ref&gt;Also known as Hiuen Tsiang, Hsuan-tsang, Yuan Chwang and Xuanzang.&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese pilgrim, who came to India in the first half of the ninth century AD. During his visit, he encountered a reference to – or the actual specimen of – a wooden idol of Kuan-tzu-tsai Pusa.

“According to the Life the marvelous image of the Kuan-tzu-tsai Pusa was made of sandal wood, and it was enclosed by railings…”&lt;ref&gt;see Waters, Thomas. (1961). ''On Yuan Chwang’s Travels in India''. Vol. II. Delhi: Munshi Ram Manohar Lal. p 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, Kuan-tzu-tsai Pusa is none other than Avalokiteśvara, one of the sixteen forms of Bodhisattva; and it’s a sandal-wood image of him that the author has written about. The actual specimen, however, is not available today. But the reference advocates in favor of wood, as a useful material for the making of Buddhist-icons during late-eighth or early-ninth century AD.

This phenomenon has also been substantiated by the freestanding sculpture of Tārā,&lt;ref&gt;In Mahāyāna Buddhism Tārā is a female Bodhisattva, who appears as a female Buddha in the Vajrayāna branch of the religion. She is known as the ‘mother-of-liberation’, and represents the virtues of success in work and achievements. In the Indian subcontinent, Tārā is a Tantric meditation deity, whose practice is used by devotees of the Tibetan branch of Vajrayāna-Buddhism in order to develop certain inner qualities related to compassion and emptiness. However, Tārā is actually the generic name for a set of Buddhas or Bodhisattvas of similar aspect. These may be understood as different aspects of the same quality, as Bodhisattvas are often considered metaphoric for Buddhist virtues.&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddhist goddess (see Figure 1), discovered by late (Dr) Moreshwar Dikshit. In terms of iconography and style, it belongs to c. ninth-tenth century AD and is considered to be an import from eastern India. Similar Buddhist icons – collected in a monastery at Chittagong, Bangladesh – ranging in date from about ninth to twelfth-thirteenth century AD,&lt;ref&gt;see Spooner, D Brainerd (ed.). (1923/1990). ''Archaeological Survey of India, Annual Report, 1921-22''. Delhi: Swati Publications. p 81&lt;/ref&gt;  could also be mentioned in this connection.&gt;

'''The Earliest Specimen'''

Most Indian wooden idols of perceptible antiquity and aesthetic excellence – either originate, or belong to the eastern region of this country. Earliest of this genre is the Tārā-image mentioned above, hailed from the debris of cave XXX-I at Kanheri, near Mumbai of Maharashtra. But unfortunately, its present location is yet unknown. A photograph – published in Marg (36/1, 1982) – remains the only evidence, reminding about the Pāla-figures from Bihar and Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;Here ‘Bengal’ refers to the region, comprising today’s West Bengal (the Indian state) and Bangladesh (the neighboring country).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the surviving specimens, Bodhisattva Lokanātha&lt;ref&gt;In general, all the ''Buddha''s and ''Bodhisattva''s can be called as ''Lokanātha'', i.e., lord of the world; but in a more specific sense of the iconography, he should be considered as one of the forms of ''Avalokiteśvara''. Generally, the lord is represented alone and is occasionally accompanied by ''Tārā'' and ''Hayagrīva''.&lt;/ref&gt; (see Figure 2) from Tongibari of Munshigunj, Dhaka (in today’s Bangladesh), is considered to be the oldest one. Both in terms of form and style, it bears a striking similarity with the figure from Kanheri; and hence could be assigned to c. ninth-tenth century AD. Yet official records have opted for a much later date – i.e., the eleventh&lt;ref&gt;According to the record of BNM.&lt;/ref&gt; – making it contemporaneous with another specimen from Rampal, also of Munshigunj. This latter one is of Sthiracakra Man̄juśrī (see Figure 3), which in that case has also its share of the claim. However, both the specimens are presently on display at Bangladesh National Museum (E-189 and E-188) at Dhaka.

In this connection, refer could be made of the famous Jagannātha-triad of Puri in Orissa, which was originally installed sometime in c. eleventh century AD. It thus makes the tradition of Balarāma-Subhadrā-Jagannātha contemporaneous to the above-mentioned specimens from Bengal. But the actual specimens in the temple today are not of that antiquity; as the idols have customarily been replicated and replaced in regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;This traditional ritual known as ‘''Navakalevara''’ takes place, only when a double ''Āṣāhr̖ha'' month (June–July) appears in the local astronomical calendar – usually on every eighth / eleventh / nineteenth year.&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s true, indeed, that the earliest surviving wooden idols in India are not as old as that of from Egypt or China. But their refined approach and stylistic maturity certainly affirm a high quality practice, generated by an extremely old and rich traditional ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;“… a reasonably large-corpus of pre-Pāla sculptures… shows a continuous development from the introduction of figural art in Eastern India, many centuries before the Pāla period.” [see Asher, Frederick M. (1980). ''The Art of Eastern India, 300-800''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  It had a long history of evolution, though undocumented, which finally resulted into the new school of Indian sculpture – taking shape in the eastern provinces in c. AD 800.&lt;ref&gt;see ''ibid''; also see Banerji, R D. (1933). ''Eastern Indian School of Mediaeval Sculpture''. Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India. p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the earlier traditions, this new school also embraced wood – equally with other mediums like clay, stone, metal etc. – for the execution of plastic forms in relief and in-the-round. This very genre of wooden sculptures kept on flourishing till c. AD 1200, while the making of divine images remained as a virile and integral part. After losing volume and scale in the next three centuries, it regained strength and vitality through the renaissance of sixteenth. It again evolved, finally, through the following centuries in the dynamism and abundance of Assam, Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Nagaland, Orissa and Rajasthan.
