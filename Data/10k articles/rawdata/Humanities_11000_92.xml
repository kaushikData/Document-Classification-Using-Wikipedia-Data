==Plot summary and character list==

==="A Deal in Wheat"===

====Plot====

:I.	The first of the five sections of the story, entitled "The Bear- Wheat at Sixty-Two", takes place in rural [[Kansas]]. Sam Lewiston leaves his wife, Emma, home on the ranch while he goes into town one last time to try to sell his wheat to Bridges &amp; Co., Grain Dealers before being forced out of the market. At sixty-two cents a bushel, Lewiston can no longer afford to raise wheat and must take a job with his wife’s brother in Chicago.

:II.	The next section, "The Bull- Wheat at a Dollar-Ten", introduces the two main players of the Chicago-run wheat business, the bear and the bull: Treslow and Hornung. When Treslow had let the price fall to sixty-two cents, Hornung had almost run him out of business. Instead, Mr. Gates makes a deal with Treslow, on behalf of Hornung, to sell him one hundred thousand bushels for export at $1.10 each.

:III. Hornung has grown to dominate wheat sales at $1.50 a bushel. One day in "The Pit", a mysterious man named Kennedy sells one thousand bushels to three of Hornung’s men: Going, Kimbark, and Merriam. They get word that a total of twenty-five thousand bushels are being sold in Chicago by someone other than Hornung. Hornung instructs them to continue buying but, with The Bear supposedly out of the market, they do not know who they are buying from.

:IV. The fourth section, "The Belt Line", takes place in Hornung’s home. His broker, Billy, and a detective named Cyrus Ryder are there to discuss the now eighty thousand bushels he has purchased. Ryder reveals that the bushels are the same ones that Treslow had purchased to export. He had been shuttling them around the city on trains, making it appear as if they had just arrived. Hornung laughs upon finding out he has been cheated, and decides to further raise the price.

:V. The final section of the story, "The Bread Line", describes Sam Lewiston’s life in Chicago. He stands in the [[Bread lines|bread line]] with many other poor, hungry workers who rely on the bakery’s nightly giveaways, but the price of wheat has put too much of a strain on the bakery. Lewiston manages to find work as a street cleaner and climb the rankings to success but, because of his experiences as a farmer and a worker, his resentment towards the operators of the wheat business will not die.

===="The Wife of Chino"====

=====Plot=====
:I.	The story starts off with "Chino’s Wife", in which Lockwood, the superintendent of the Hand-over-fist Gravel Mine in [[Placer County, California]], sits in solitude on his porch smoking tobacco after dinner. He graduated from the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Columbia School of Mines]] and has since spent his life in isolated Western mining communities. He enjoys isolation, and spends every evening admiring the scenery and fantasizing about Felice Zavalla, a beautiful [[Mexican American|Mexican]] woman married to one of his employees.

:II.	"Madness", documents Lockwood’s strong desire to be married to Felice despite his inability to understand her. He has never seen the world or socialized much, having studied for the first part of his life and worked for the latter. His isolation causes him to get carried away with emotions, and he is convinced he should have Felice.

:III.	In "Chino Goes to Town", Lockwood begins finding excused to interact with Felice, such as to give her mail, until he at once realizes that he has crossed the line and begins to avoid her entirely. He, instead, buries himself in his work until an accident in the mine breaks his foot. He usually goes to the Iowa Hill Post Office every couple of weeks with Chino to deliver the brick of gold collected from the mine, but his injury prevents him from going. He is left with nothing but thoughts of Felice to ease the pain.

:IV.	In the section, "A Dispatch from the Express Messenger", Felice confronts Lockwood and asks why he has been avoiding her. She gave him a look that told him she had made a mistake with Chino. Just when Lockwood realizes that he will not keep himself from having an affair with Felice he gets a message from [[Iowa Hill, California|Iowa Hill]] informing him of a criminal named Reno Kid on the trail. The messenger advises him not to leave, but Chino was already on his way. Lockwood realizes he has no other options, and struggles his way onto a horse and takes off.

:V.	"The Trail" documents Lockwood’s pursuit of Chino. He almost reaches Iowa Hill with no sign of him or Reno Kid, so he turns around to search harder. He eventually hears a horse galloping in the darkness and assumes it to be Reno Kid and shoots, but it is Chino.

:VI.	"The Discovery of Felice" begins when Lockwood arrives back at the Zavalla’s house and confesses his actions to Felice. Felice fetches the doctor and, as he examines Chino’s wound, she tells Lockwood that now they can be together. Lockwood, however, suddenly sees Felice in a different light. She appears savage and unfaithful.

===="A Bargain with Peg-Leg"====

=====Plot=====
:This story describes Bunt McBride’s account of Peg-Leg Smith, an infamous one-legged criminal. Bunt retells the story on his break from the night shift at the mine.

:Peg-Leg amputated his own leg and fashioned himself one from a tree stump after he was shot. He was known for his nastiness and spent his life trying to get people to stop using cuss words. Bunt encountered him at a bar in [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] when Bunt was just a teenager. He was there watching his friend, Clarense, play a gambling game with some men that involved taking their temperatures. Clarence won, and the guys start accusing him of cheating. Peg-Leg had been sleeping in the back room, but he appeared and tackled Clarence from across the room. Bunt jumped to Clarence’s defense and pulled off Peg-Leg’s leg. Knowing he was in trouble, he chucked the wood out the window, grabbed Peg-Leg’s gun from the back room, and took off across the street. Outside, a kid had gone to retrieve the leg and went to hand it to Peg-Leg, but Bunt grabbed it. Peg-Leg assured Bunt that he would come after him someday. Bunt knew what Peg-Leg is capable of and did not want to live in fear, but he also knew his weakness, so he made a deal with Peg-leg to never swear again in exchange for his safety. Peg-Leg was desperate to have at least one convert, so he gave in.

:Three years later, Bunt says, he came across Peg-Leg again in Sonora, Arizona. The town was full of men seeking gold. He got word that a hotel was on fire and rushed over to see Peg-Leg at the window of the flaming building. People below were yelling for him to jump, promising to catch him on a blanket. Bunt starts chucking before he can finish the story. There hadn’t been a blanket there.

===="The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock"====

=====Plot=====
:This story, like the last, describes Bunt McBride’s account of the life of a Western criminal, Cock-Eye Blacklock. Bunt and the narrator finish dinner by the campfire and ride out into the [[Idaho]] desert because it is Bunt’s night to ride the herd. Bunt has lived in the West for a long time and is wise when it comes to herding.

:Bunt begins his story by recounting a herding experience in a Nevada blizzard. He and Cock-Eye Blacklock rubbed [[Tobacco water|tobacco juice]] in their eyes to stay awake. Blacklock was a bad man and had killed a lot of people. Bunt says that he went bad about two years after that, though, He traveled around gambling, taking all the money from a community before moving on. He got through [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] and was making his way through Nevada when he shot a kid in Reno and headed up to a mining camp in Placer County, California. He immediately got into trouble there, too, and before long was driven out of camp.

:Bunt lived nearby in Iowa Hill at the time, and he used to take weekly fishing trips to the [[American River]] with his boss. On one trip they noticed that all the fish had been shot out of the river. The Fish Commissioners of the State assigned a guard to the area, but the fish kept dying. Blacklock was an obvious suspect, so Bunt, the Boss, and a marshal set up shooting boxes in trees to stand watch and try to catch him in the act. Unsuccessful for weeks, they caught a break one day with the help from a local dog named Sloppy Weather. Blacklock [[Blast fishing|threw dynamite into the water to kill the fish]], but Sloppy Weather jumped in to fetch the dynamite and bring it back. Blacklock ran, but the dog chased him until the dynamite went off and they both got caught in the explosion. On his grave they wrote, "Moral: A hook and line is good enough fish-tackle for any honest man".

:The sun rises over the desert just as Bunt finishes the story. He and the narrator ride back into camp.

===="A Memorandum of Sudden Death"====

=====Plot=====
:In this story the narrator reads a manuscript written by Arthur Staples Karslake just before he died while serving in the [[United States Cavalry]]. The narrator has no personal connection to the author but has received permission from Patterson Karslake, the author’s brother, to publish the manuscript. He gets it form Juan Tejada, a harness-maker in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], who has been keeping it for a bone collector by the name of Bass while he is on a trip in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]]. Parts of the manuscript are in pen and parts are in pencil. The narrator interjects periodically while reading the manuscript to explain that the pieces are in fragments.

:The manuscript begins with Bunt, Idaho, Estorijo, and Karslake spotting 8 Native Americans following them while they are jogging. They stop to get water, and Karslake writes the first account while they are stopped. In it he refers to them as "bucks". They continue on, and the next day it appears as if there are 9. The "bucks" charge towards them, but veer off at the last minute, then circle around and continue following them. They constantly move in and out of shooting range, but Idaho manages to kill one of them. Shots are fired periodically, but each day the four men continue on and each night they set up camp. On the fifth and final day of the account Bunt, Idaho, Estorijo, and all of their horses have died. Karsdale describes a feeling of revelation he experiences as he weakens and death grows closer. He explains that, as death is upon him, he begins to understand the secret of life. He identifies himself and the other men he was with, and he leaves his unfinished work to his brother, Patterson Karslake.

===="Two Hearts That Beat as One"====

=====Plot=====
:In this story, Bunt McBride, shocked that Mr. Dixon is not familiar with The Three Black Crows, retells a story of one of their missions on the Pacific arranged, as usual, by Cyrus Ryder. This story is the first of four in the collection about The Three Black Crows.

:Barreto Palachi was a revolutionary trying to get to San Francisco to smuggle arms, but he could not get there without being arrested. Cyrus Ryder sent Bunt, Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan to meet with Palachi’s agent, Esperanza Ulivarri. Bunt was not looking forward to the meeting, as he notes that he is not good with females. Esperanza instructed the four men on how to meet Palachi in [[San Diego]], and gave them half of a calling card to match with the other half that she was to give him. They were struck by her beauty, and Hardenberg and Strokher immediately began fighting over who would have her when they left her office. The arguing continued aboard the [[schooner]], and on a calm day they held a boxing match. It was very competitive but ended in a draw.

:When they arrived in the [[San Diego Bay|San Diego Harbor]] Esperanza and another woman appeared in a rowboat. The woman was Palachi in disguise and, while he climbed aboard, Hardenberg and Strokher both get into the [[Rowing|rowboat]] and stay behind with Esperanza.

===="The Dual Personality of Slick Dick Nickerson"====

=====Plot=====
:I.	The first section of this story takes place in Cyrus Ryder’s office in San Francisco. The Three Crows, Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan, are ready for their next assignment, and are considering sailing to [[Point Barrow]] in Alaska where some Russians are hunting [[sea otter]]s. Their skins can be sold to China for great profit. Ryder tells them that an agent of his named Dick Nickerson must accompany them. He used to be a [[Methodism|Methodist]] preacher but he hit his head one day and, when he regained consciousness, he had [[Amnesia|no memory of his past]]. A month after this meeting the team departed on the Bertha Miller.

:II.	The sail to Alaska is a rough journey filled with poor weather and freezing temperatures. They finally arrive and locate the hunters, to whom they pretend to be a rescue boat searching for survivors from a nearby steam whaler wreck. Strokher remains onboard while the others befriend the Russians, get them drunk, and steal the otter skins.

:III.	The Bertha Miller departs, but Dick Nickerson takes a bad fall on the deck and hits his head. His condition improves after a few days, but he does not remember why they are there. The others explain the purpose of their mission and show him the skins to try to probe his memory. They arrive in [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] and, immediately upon disembarking, Dick goes to the customs office. He tells an officer that he is a Methodist minister being detained on a pirate ship with stolen goods. The Three Crows frantically leave the port and, thinking they are being pursued by a [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|U.S. cutter]], burn the otter skins. The cutter approaches, and two men on board inform them that their crewmember broke into the American consul and resisted arrest.

===="The Ship That Saw a Ghost"====

=====Plot=====
:In this story Mr. Dixon describes a dangerous mission, B. 300, he attempted with The Three Black Crows aboard the ''Glarus''. Everyone thought they were heading back up to San Francisco from [[Callao]] but, in fact, they were traveling further south. Dixon says that the mission gave the ''Glarus'' a bad reputation, and now no one in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is willing to take her out again. They think she is haunted.

:The sailors had seen nothing but ocean for days, and the isolation was getting to them. They were looking for an island that a boat had come across 200 years prior. Dixon does not say what they did there for fear of getting in trouble with the [[Admiralty law|maritime law]], but it was evil. As they were leaving the island something came out of the sea that killed twenty men within a week. After another week there were six men remaining, and they all died on the island. Dixon recalls that each of the men on the ''Glarus'' felt uneasy about the mission. He felt like they were being watched. One night Strokher said he fell asleep while on watch and awoke to find a ship in the distance. It was unusual looking, with three [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and no sails, and looked abandoned and frightening. The same night their shaft broke. They decided to continue for the island, but for days the wind would not let them budge. They had no choice but to turn around and saw the old ship in the distance behind them as they left. Upon returning to San Francisco the word spread that the ''Glarus'' had seen a ghost, and she has not seen the sea since.

===="The Ghost in the Crosstrees"====

=====Plot=====
:I.	Cyrus Ryder wants to claim a new island, the Island of Paa, so he calls upon the Three Black Crows. It had previously been discovered by "Old Rosemary", but be had died while his title application was being processed. Ryder knows that great profit lies within the island in the form of [[Nitrate|nitrate beds]]. Another man named Petersen is also after the island, so he stresses the urgency to Hardenberg, Strokher, and Ally Bazan. They agree to fix up the ''Idaho Loss'' to take on the mission.

:II.	Mr. Dixon, the story’s narrator, goes to visit the three men at the port in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] where they are working on the boat. He stays over, and wakes up in the middle of the night to find Hardenberg staring at something in the air behind him.

:III.	Hardenberg tells Dixon of a moving figure in the [[crosstrees]] of the [[Mast (sailing)|foremast]]. They witness the figure raise the sails and then disappear. They decide not to tell the others in the morning, but it comes out when Ally Bazan asks why the sails are raised. Ally Bazan is scared, but the other three stand watch the next night and chase it off. The following night all four of them stand watch, but it does not return for three nights. They stop watching, and wake up to raised sails in the morning.

:IV.	The ghost only appears when Ally Bazan is not standing watch. Ally Bazan does not want to take the haunted boat to sea. Strokher falls ill, so the Three Crows decide to abort the mission. Two years later, Dixon and Ally Bazan are on a [[Waterfowl hunting|duck-hunting]] trip when the same figure appears. As it is hoisting the [[jib]] its face catches the light, and Dixon identifies Ally Bazan as the figure. He asks Ally Bazan if he [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalks]], but never brings up the ghost.

===="The Riding of Felipe"====

=====Plot=====
:I.	In the first section, entitled "Felipe", Felipe Arillaga leaves the home of Rubia Ytuerate, where he has lived for three months having an affair with Rubia. He misses his wife, Buelna Martiarena, but Rubia is furious and vows to curse the woman who Felipe next kisses. Felipe is superstitious and stops to confess at the [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]], but he runs into Buelna and her uncle, Old Martiarena. He kisses Buelna’s hand, but can offer no explanation when Old Martiarena demands to know why he won’t kiss her. Buelna rides away, leaving Felipe heartbroken.

:II.	The next section is called "Unzar". Felipe, after a month of misery from losing Buelna, stops for the night at Lopez Catala’s wine shop on a ride home from Monterey. Unzar Ytuerate arrives looking for Felipe, for he is Rubia’s brother and has been sent to kill him. The two begin fighting with knives.

:III.	In "Rubia", Felipe wakes up in a bed and the inn with bandages on his head and shoulder. Rubia is there, and she explains that a week after sending Unzar for him she realized her mistake. She professes her love for Felipe, but Felipe insists that he loves Buelna. Rubia kisses Felipe, besetting her curse upon herself. Unzar is dying, so Rubia rushes to his bedside. He yells at her for not standing by him after driving him into the fight, then he dies. Rubia repeats the words of her curse, realizing that it has come true.
 
:IV.	The final section, "Buelna", begins when Felipe stops at the Rancho Martiarena and demands to talk to Buelna. Rafael, the superintendent, tells him that she left for Santa Teresa that day and will become a nun at midnight. Felipe rushes away to try to stop her. The journey to Santa Teresa is long and Pepe, Felipe’s horse, struggles quite a bit towards the end. After many obstacles, they arrive just as Buelna is kneeling at the altar. They kiss in the middle of the church, and get married the following day. Two days later a beautiful woman drowns in a river near Lopez Catala’s wine shop.

==Critical reception==
:Critics felt that many of Norris' short stories lacked the substance and purpose that his novels possessed. Though short stories and essays, including this collection, were published after ''The Pit'', they did not affect Norris' reputation as he was viewed primarily as a novelist. Bixler notes, however, "the scattered reviews of these books were not flattering" (Bixler 119). Some stories were described as merely anecdotal, while stories like "The Ship That Saw a Ghost" were enjoyed for their "sensational value" (Dillingham 172). Franklin Walker describes "The Wife of Chino" as an "ineffective melodrama" (Walker 288).

==Other==
:Frank Norris preferred writing novels to short stories, but he understood that, once he had established himself as a successful American novelist, he would be able to sell short stories and articles to periodicals to make additional money. As a result, a number of his short stories were thrown together during times when he needed an additional income. Norries wrote "A Memorandum of Sudden Death", "A Bargain with Peg-Leg", and "The Passing of Cock-Eye Blacklock" so that he could afford to buy his wife, Jeanette Black, a Christmas present (Walker 286).

:A 1909 film directed by [[D.W. Griffith]], ''[[A Corner in Wheat]]'', was based on Norris' "A Deal in Wheat", along with his 1903 novel ''[[The Pit (Norris novel)|The Pit]]''.

'''Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah''' (d. 161 AH; {{circa}} 776 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Shaban, M.A., ''The 'Abbāsid Revolution'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 139. {{ISBN|978-0521295345}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Abu Hashim''' was a member of the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraish tribe in Mecca.  He was one of the [[Salaf]] and a [[Narrator of hadith]].  After Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya died, his son [[Abu Hashim]] claimed the [[imamate]]. According to medieval mystic [[Jami]], Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah (died c. 716) was the first person to be called a "Sufi".[33]

==Life==
After Abu Hashim's death, the [[Abbasids]] claimed that on his deathbed Abu Hashim had nominated his distant cousin Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdullah ibn Abbas ibn Abdu'l-Muttalib ibn Hashim as the imam. His son Abu'l-Abbas Abdullah [[as-Saffah]] became the first Abbasid caliph, repudiating Shi'ism, which effectively extinguished the sect that had recognized Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah as an imam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=An Introduction to Shi'i Islam | author=Momen, Moojan|authorlink= Moojan Momen | publisher=George Ronald | place=Oxford, U.K. | year=1985 | pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Hashim's father was [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah|Muhammad ibn al Hanafiyyah ibn Ali]], a son of [[Ali]]. Abu Hashim had a brother named [[Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah|Hasan]].

After his father's death in 700 CE, the [[Hashimiyya]] sub-sect of the [[Kaysanites Shia]] looked to Abu Hashim as the heir of his grandfather Ali. After his own death, the early [[Abbasid]]s claimed that Abu Hashim had designated Muhammad, father of the first two Abbasid caliphs, [[As-Saffah]] and [[Al-Mansur]], as his heir and head of the clan of the [[Banu Hashim]].

According to the Sunnis, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] graded the two sons of [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]] to be [[Da'if|weak in Hadith]], arguing that one was a [[Murji'ah|murji'i]], and the other to be a [[Shi'a|Shi'ite]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tahdhib al-Tahdhib (Asqalani)|Tahdhib al-Tahdhib]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Ibn Sa'd]] stated that "Abu Hashim has knowledge and transmission. He was [[Thiqah|reliable in Hadith]], and had narrated a few accepted [[hadith]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Book of the Major Classes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anti-Flirt Club''' was an [[United States|American]] [[Club (organization)|club]] active in [[Washington, D.C.]], during the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peacemaking: Lessons from the Past, Visions for the Future|chapter=Catcalls and Military Strategy|first=Sally J. |last=Scholz|editor1-last=Presler|editor1-first=Judith |editor2-last=Scholz|editor2-first=Sally J. |publisher=Rodopi|year= 2000|isbn=90-420-1562-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSZdx2xJoBwC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the club was to protect young women and girls who received unwelcome attention from men in [[automobile]]s and on street corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Driving Home | first = Gail | last = Ghai | journal = The Women's Review of Books | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | year = 1985 | page = 16 | publisher = Old City Publishing, Inc. | doi = 10.2307/4019732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Amazons, Bluestockings and Crones: A Feminist Dictionary|first1=Cheris|last1= Kramarae|first2= Paula A.|last2= Treichler|first3= Ann|last3= Russo|publisher= Pandora|year=1992|isbn=0-04-440863-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Flirt Club launched an "Anti-Flirt" week, which began on March 4, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington girls have organized to protect selves from unwelcome advances|publisher=Lowell Sun|date=March 6, 1923|url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=glpnews&amp;search=washington%20girls%20have%20organized%20to%20protect%20selves%20from%20unwelcome%20advances%20here%20are%20some%20charter%20members%20of%20the%20club%20alice%20reighly%20president%20day%20instead&amp;img=\\na0041\6803820\56392625_clean.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club had a series of rules, which were intended as sound and serious advice. These were:&lt;!-- ABSURD SPELLING ERROR IS FROM WASHINGTON POST ARCHIVE PAGE --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10 GIRLS START WAR'S ON AUTO INVITATION|work=Washington Post|date=March 28, 1923|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/193251682.html?dids=193251682:193251682&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Feb+28%2C+1923&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;startpage=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Don't [[Flirting|flirt]]: those who flirt in haste oft repent in leisure.
#Don't accept rides from flirting motorists—they don't invite you in to save you a walk.
#Don't use your eyes for ogling—they were made for worthier purposes.
#Don't go out with men you don't know—they may be married, and you may be in for a [[Catfight|hair-pulling match]].
#Don't wink—a flutter of one eye may cause a tear in the other.
#Don't smile at flirtatious strangers—save them for people you know.
#Don't annex all the men you can get—by flirting with many, you may lose out on the one.
#Don't fall for the slick, dandified cake eater—the unpolished gold of a real man is worth more than the gloss of a [[lounge lizard]].
#Don't let elderly men with an eye to a flirtation pat you on the shoulder and take a fatherly interest in you. Those are usually the kind who want to forget they are fathers.
#Don't ignore the man you are sure of while you flirt with another. When you return to the first one you may find him gone.

A ''[[Washington Post]]'' article from February 28, 1923, titled "10 Girls Start War on Auto Invitation," laid out the problem: "Too many motorists are taking advantage of the precedent established during the war by offering to take young lady pedestrians in their cars, Miss Helen Brown, 639 Longfellow Street, declared yesterday." Brown, the secretary of the nascent Anti-Flirt club, warned that these men "don't all tender their invitations to save the girls a walk," and while there were "other varieties of flirts," motorists were the absolute worst.

Brown, along with the president—a Miss Alice Reighly of 1400 Harvard Street—made their plan of action known. On March 4, 1923, the first-ever Anti-Flirt Week (and only since) would commence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/02/stop-that-skirt-chaser-the-movement-to-outlaw-flirting-in-the-1920s/273068/|title=Stop That Skirt-Chaser!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13643">'''Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur''' (September 18, 1888 &amp;ndash; September 9, 1971) was a scholar of early English, German, and Old Norse literature at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  He is known primarily for his scholarly work on ''[[Beowulf]]'' and his translation of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Prose Edda]]'' for [[The American-Scandinavian Foundation]], but also as a writer of pulp fiction and for his left-wing politics.

==Early life and education==
Brodeur was born in [[Franklin, Massachusetts]], to Clarence Arthur Brodeur, a private school teacher who served as Superintendent of Schools at [[Warren, Massachusetts|Warren]] and  [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]], and to Mary Cornelia (''née'' Latta).&lt;ref name=UCAL&gt;W.

The '''Basel Paper Mill''' ([[German Language|German:]] ''Basler Papiermühle''), also known as the '''Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing''' ([[German Language|German:]] ''Schweizerisches Museum für Papier, Schrift und Druck'') in [[Basel]], is primarily dedicated to [[papermaking]], the art of book [[printing]] and [[writing]] in general. Through a combination of pictures and objects, visitors gain insights into the old artisanal techniques of dipping paper, printing and [[bookbinding]].

The museum is located in a carefully restored building that began its life as a [[paper mill]] 500 years ago. It is a [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance]] (1995), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Arthur Quarles''' (January 23, 1904 – November 16, 1996) was an [[African-American]] historian, administrator, scholar, educator, and writer. Major books by Quarles include ''The Negro in the Civil War'' (1953), ''The Negro in the American Revolution'' (1961), ''Lincoln and the Negro'' (1962), and ''Black Abolitionists'' (1969). He demonstrated that blacks were active participants in major conflicts and issues of American history. His books were narrative accounts of critical wartime periods that focused on how blacks interacted with their white allies and emphasized blacks' acting as vital agents of change rather than receiving favors from whites.&lt;ref&gt;August Meier, "Benjamin Quarles and the Historiography of Black America," ''Civil War History,'' June 1980, Vol. 26#2, pp. 101-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Quarles was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1904. His parents were Margaret (O'Brien), a homemaker, and Arthur Benedict Quarles, a subway porter.&lt;ref&gt;''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives,'' Volume 4: 1994-1996, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, Benjamin went to local public schools.

In his twenties, Quarles enrolled at [[Shaw University]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and received his B.A. degree in 1931. He earned his M.A. degree from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1933, and Ph.D. from there in 1940. Initially he faced resistance for wanting to write black history but finally received support for his goal. He learned his writing style from Professor William Hesseltine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nathanielturner.com/benjaminquarlesbio.htm "Chronology of the Life &amp; Career Benjamin Arthur Quarles"], ''Chickenbones: A Journal, for Literary &amp; Artistic African-American Themes''] [link accessed 2007-04-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Shaw, working as an instructor of history (1935–39). He next taught at [[Dillard University]] (1939–1953) in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. There he became a full professor and also served as dean. His last appointment was as professor of history and chair of the department at [[Morgan State University]], [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] (1953–1974). At Morgan, Quarles reached near-legendary status as the long-time head of the History Department. He was a revered teacher and counselor, an intellectual and professional mentor for two generations of African-American scholars. Many of his books became required reading in the African-American history courses that were developed in American universities during the 1960s. This movement was inspired both by the civil rights movement and increasing scholarly interest in the history of minorities and women. After Quarles's official retirement in 1969, he was awarded professor ''emeritus'' status and kept teaching for several years.

Quarles was an active member of many political and historical organizations, such as Project Advisory Committee on Black Congress Members, the committee to oversee the founding of the Amistad Center at [[Tulane University]], the Department of the Army Historical Advisory Committee, and the American Council of Learned Societies. He was one of the few men in the profession who openly supported the founding of the Association of Black Women Historians.

==Author==
A prolific writer, Benjamin Quarles published ten books, 23 articles, and hundreds of shorter pieces of various sorts. In his writings, he focused on exploring in detail the contributions made by the black soldiers and abolitionists of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775-1783), and the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865). His essays in the ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' in 1945 and 1959 were the first from a Black historian to be published in a major historical journal.

His books include:
*''Frederick Douglass'' (1948) (published dissertation)
*''The Negro in the Civil War'' (1953)
*''The Negro in the American Revolution'' (1961)
*''Lincoln and the Negro'' (1962)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8004">A '''caretaker government''' is a [[government]] that rules on a temporary basis, due to the loss of election or a pending transition of power.

== Definition ==
Caretaker governments may be put in place when a government in a [[parliamentary]] system is defeated in a [[motion of no confidence]], or in the case when the house to which the government is responsible is dissolved, to be in place for an interim period until an election is held and a new government is formed. In this sense, in some countries which use a [[Westminster system]] of government, the caretaker government is simply the incumbent government, which continues to operate in the interim period between the normal dissolution of parliament for the purpose of holding an election and the formation of a new government after the election results are known. Unlike in ordinary times, the caretaker government's activities are limited by custom and convention.

In systems where [[coalition government]]s are frequent a caretaker government may be installed temporarily while negotiations to form a new coalition take place. This usually occurs either immediately after an election in which there is no clear victor or if one coalition government collapses and a new one must be negotiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hasanuzzaman |first=Al Masud |year=2012 |chapter=Caretaker Government |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Caretaker_Government |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caretaker governments are expected to handle daily issues and prepare budgets for discussion, but are not expected to produce a [[government platform]] or introduce controversial bills.

A caretaker government is often set up following a war until stable [[democracy|democratic]] rule can be restored, or installed, in which case it is often referred to as a [[provisional government]].

==Caretaker governments associated with elections==
Many countries are administered by a caretaker government during election periods, such as:
*[[Caretaker government of Australia]]
*[[Caretaker government of Bangladesh]]
*[[Demissionary cabinet]], a Dutch caretaker cabinet.
Other countries that use similar mechanisms include [[Pakistan]] and [[Elections in New Zealand|New Zealand]].

==Caretakers==
{{See also|Widow's succession}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
Heads of caretaker governments are often referred to as a "caretaker" head, for example "caretaker prime minister".

Similarly, but chiefly in the [[United States]], '''caretakers''' are individuals who fill seats in government temporarily without ambitions to continue to hold office on their own. This is particularly true with regard to [[United States Senate|United States Senators]] who are appointed to office by the [[Governor (United States)|Governor]] of their [[U.S. state|state]] following a vacancy created by the death or resignation of a sitting senator.  Sometimes governors wish to run for the seat themselves in the next election but do not want to be accused of unfairness by arranging their own appointments in the interim. Also, sometimes they do not wish to be seen as taking sides within a group of party factions or prejudicing of a [[primary election]] by picking someone who is apt to become an active candidate for the position. At one time, [[widow]]s of politicians were often selected as caretakers to succeed their late husbands; this custom is rarely exercised today, as it could be viewed by some as [[nepotism]].

In a similar vein, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] was said to be a ''caretaker'' [[Vice President of the United States]] (1974&amp;ndash;1977). He was nominated for the office by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]], who had succeeded the resigned President [[Richard Nixon]]. Rockefeller made it apparent that he had no further presidential ambitions of his own (unlike many Vice Presidents), despite having run for the office three times in the past, and he had no intention of even running for a full term in the vice presidential office. He followed through on his intention when Ford's running mate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]] was Senator [[Bob Dole]].

In [[Canada]] and most other English-speaking countries, the more widely accepted term in this context is ''interim'', as in [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]]. In Italy this kind of premier is the President of [[Government of Experts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3317">[[Image:Cerro de Las Mesas Stela 6.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Stela 6, from '''Cerro de las Mesas'''.  Note the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] date of 9.1.12.14.10 (April 468 [[Common Era|CE]]) at the lower left.  The glyphs above the date are one of the few, and latest, [[Epi-Olmec script]] texts yet discovered.]]
'''Cerro de las Mesas''', meaning "hill of the altars" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], is an [[archaeological site]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Veracruz]], in the [[Mixtequilla]] area of the [[Papaloapan River]] basin.  It was a prominent regional center from 600 BCE to 900 CE, and a regional capital from 300 CE to 600 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, et al. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Located about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} due south of [[Veracruz City]], Cerro de las Mesas is on the west edge of what had been the [[:Image:Olmec Heartland 1.png|Olmec heartland]].  Rising to prominence after the decline of the [[Olmec]] civilization's culture, some researchers consider Cerro de las Mesas, along with similar sites like [[La Mojarra]] and [[Tres Zapotes]], to be a center of [[epi-Olmec culture]], a successor culture to the Olmecs, and one that itself gave way to [[Classic Veracruz culture]] in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[Image:Classic sites 1.png|thumb|left|Cerro de las Mesas and other important Classic Era settlements.]]

The site contains a man-made lagoon as well as hundreds of artificial mounds, usually in groups, often clustered with a long and a conical mound.  These mound groups were likely built during the epi-Olmec period, 400 BCE to 300 CE.&lt;ref name="Pool, p. 270"&gt;Pool, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also during this period that the influence of [[Teotihuacan]] appears in the [[archaeological record]].

Sometime later, during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]], a cache of some 800 jade items, some dating from Olmec civilization hundreds of years earlier, were [[votive deposit|buried]] at the base of the large mound of the central group.&lt;ref name="Pool, p. 270" /&gt;  

Cerro de las Mesas is home to many [[stele]] — artistic stone slabs — several of which contain portrait carvings.  Four of these stele — numbers 5, 6, 8, and 15 — contain what are likely to be pieces of [[Isthmian script|Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script]].&lt;ref&gt;Justeson and Kaufman, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cottage window''' is a [[double-hung window]] — i.e., a window with two sashes sliding up and down, hung with one atop the other in the same frame — in which the  upper sash is smaller (shorter) than the lower one. The upper sash often contains smaller lights divided by [[Muntin|muntins]] (often known as a "divided light pattern" or "grille"), although in some cases both sashes may be divided. 

Cottage windows are especially characteristic of [[bungalow]] or [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]]-style houses. Also called a "front window".

Its use in [[Public school (U.S.)|government funded schools]] has been the most controversial, as critics contend that a government-sanctioned endorsement of religion violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution. Arguments against the pledge include that the pledge itself is incompatible with [[democracy]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], pledges of allegiance are features of [[totalitarian state]]s such as [[Nazi Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Objections on the grounds of religion ==

Even before the addition of the phrase "under God" in 1954, legal challenges were frequently founded on the basis of [[freedom of religion]].

Central to early challenges were [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], a group whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power lesser than [[God]].  In the 1940 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Minersville School District vs. Gobitis]]'', an 8–1 majority in the Court held that a school district's interest in promoting national unity permitted it to require Witness students to recite the Pledge along with their class mates. ''Gobitis'' was an unpopular decision in the press, and it led to a rash of mob violence and intimidation against Jehovah's Witnesses;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= To the Flag: The unlikely history of the Pledge of Allegiance |last= Ellis|first= Richard J.|year= 2005 |publisher= University Press of Kansas |isbn= 978-0700613724 |pages=105–109 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 24, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
three years later in ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education vs. Barnette]],'' the Court reversed itself, voting 6–3 to ''forbid'' a school from requiring the Pledge.

As a result, since 1943 public schools have been disallowed from punishing students for not reciting the Pledge. Nonetheless, it remains taught to and expected of school children in many schools, as the Court leaves many details in such matters up to respective state governments.

More specific objections have been raised since the addition of the phrase "under God" to the Pledge. The year of its addition, 1954, was also near the beginning of the [[Cold War]] [[anti-Communism|anti-communist]] movement in the United States.

===''Matter of Lewis v. Allen''===
In response to the June 14, 1954 Congressional change of the wording of the Pledge (found in U.S. Code, tit. 36 § 172) to include "under God", a series of lawsuits were filed in the New York State courts by [[Joseph L. Lewis]] challenging the constitutionality of the addition of the new phrase. Lewis was a publisher, writer, and co-founder of Freethinkers of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America's Most Hated Woman: The Life and Gruesome Death of Madalyn Murray O'Hair|author=Ann Rowe Seaman|publisher=Continuum|date=March 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the cases involved Joseph Lewis desiring the Court to order the Commissioner of Education of The State of New York, James E. Allen, Jr. to remove the new words from the Pledge, these cases are referred to as the ''Matter of Lewis v. Allen''.

====1957 case====
The first case brought by Lewis found its way to the New York State Supreme Court in 1957. Joseph Lewis maintained that the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York had a duty, which he had failed to perform, to revoke the regulation requiring the recitation of the Pledge with the new phrase, and reinstate the old wording. Lewis did not cite any state regulations concerning the Commissioner, but held the Commissioner was bound to act by the U.S. First Amendment (which was applied to the State governments through the Fourteenth Amendment) and by article I and XI of the New York State Constitution.

The court held that it was not within the Commissioner's domain to determine the constitutionality of acts performed by the State or Federal Legislatures. The Court then turned to Lewis' contention that the New York law that ordered the recitation of the Pledge had been rendered unconstitutional by the new wording, "Petitioners claim that freethinkers, nonbelievers, atheists and agnostics cannot be compelled to recite the present pledge of allegiance because it includes the words 'under God', and such compulsion violates the aforesaid constitutional provisions."&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Matter of Lewis v. Allen 5 Misc.2d 68 (1957)|url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=1957735Misc2d68_151.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referencing the 1943 case ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' which resulted in fines and threats of imprisonment against those refusing to say the pledge being ruled unconstitutional, the Court held that "The regulation under attack here has no compulsory aspect. No penalties attach to a failure or refusal to recite the pledge.The pledge is made voluntarily and no penalties are imposed for noncompliance."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

Having pointed out that neither threats nor actual imprisonment or deprivation of property had made for noncompliance, the Court moved onto the other half of the definition of "establishment" set out in Supreme Court Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]]'s concurring opinion in ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]''. New York State Justice Isadore Bookstein wrote "If I properly apprehend the intent, design and purposes of the First Amendment, it was conceived to prevent and prohibit the establishment of a ''State Religion''; it was not intended to prevent or prohibit the growth and development of a ''Religious State''."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

Operating on the interpretation of the First Amendment that holds that the state is prohibited from establishing a single religion or denomination as the official religion, but is free to support all religions in general (as long as it shows none of them preference above the others), Justice Bookstein listed several examples felt to support that interpretation. These included Supreme Court rulings such as the 1892 ''[[Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States]]'' which stated "this is a religious nation", and the 1952 ruling ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'' which stated "We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being." Bookstein also cited wording in the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg Address, and the preamble of the New York Constitution which expressed gratitude "to Almighty God for our Freedom". In addition the Justice pointed out that American coins had "In God we trust" inscribed on them (a practice that had been implemented sporadically since 1864), and pointed to the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|Presidential oath]] of "So help me, God" (he made no mention that the Constitution gives the president-elect the option to affirm without invoking a deity).

Bookstein wrote "If petitioners' contention be sound, it may be wondered whether the public school curriculum might properly include the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address. Could "America" ("Protect us by thy might, Great God, our King!") be sung in a public school without offending the First Amendment? And might not the presidential oath of office have questionable constitutional status?"&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

The Justice held with House Report No. 1693 that the ''Zorach v. Clauson'' case "clearly indicated that the references to the Almighty which run through our laws, our public rituals, and our ceremonies in no way flout the provisions of the First Amendment.&amp;nbsp;... [for] if this recognition of the Almighty was not so, then even a fastidious atheist or agnostic could object to the way in which the Court itself opens each of its sessions, namely, 'God save the United States and the Honorable Court'."

Bookstein held that "the child of a nonbeliever may simply omit the words, 'under God', in reciting the pledge. His 'non-conformity', if such it be, will not, in the circumstances of this case, set him apart from his fellow students or bring 'pressure' to bear in any real sense."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Bookstein again cited ''Zorach v. Clauson'' holding that to side with Lewis' claims against the government {{"'}}would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do not'. The First Amendment does not require this."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

Justice Bookstein's words in this ruling were later quoted by the state of New York in one of its briefs, when defending its position in the ''Engel v. Vitale'' case before the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt;

====1960 case====
Lewis brought a similar argument in 1960 holding that the Pledge with the new words was unconstitutional "as it involves 'the use of the public schools—both physically and pedagogically—for the dissemination of purely religious dogma' and, second, as it imposes 'an intolerable degree of compulsion upon the young children of non-believers&amp;nbsp;... to listen to, learn and repeat thousands of time a religious concept which they repudiate and abhor{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Lewis1960"&gt;{{cite web|title=Matter of Lewis v. Allen, 11 AD 2d 447 - NY: Appellate Div., 3rd Dept. 1960|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17443608638846749458&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court cited New York's recent decision in the case ''Engles v. Vitale'' where the state had allowed officials of a school district to order its teachers to teach and lead students in a nondenominational prayer crafted by the government to remain in place as long as more safeguards were put into place to insure that students and parents were informed that children could remove themselves from the classroom if they did not wish to participate or be exposed to the prayer crafted by the New York board of Regents (this decision was later reversed by the United States Supreme court in 1963). The New York Court held that due to the 1943 case ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' there was general knowledge that there could be no compulsion on students to participate or expose themselves to the Pledge.

The Court dismissed Lewis' claims that the pledge was an establishment of religion citing ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'', "There cannot be the slightest doubt that the First Amendment reflect the philosophy that Church and State should be separated.&amp;nbsp;... The First Amendment, however, does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and State. Rather, it studiously defines the manner, the specific ways, in which there shall be no concert or union or dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of the matter. Otherwise the state and religion would be aliens to each other—hostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly.&amp;nbsp;... Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First Amendment."&lt;ref name="Lewis1960"/&gt;

The court also dismissed Lewis' argument that the Pledge violated New York's Constitution that {{"'}}forbids the use of public money or other property in aid of any denominational school or any school' in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught".&lt;ref name="Lewis1960"/&gt; Stating simply "From our determination that the claim of unconstitutionality under the First Amendment cannot be sustained, it follows that the regulation does not contravene the like provisions of the State Constitution."&lt;ref name="Lewis1960"/&gt;

Lewis appealed this decision to the New York Court of Appeals in 1964, they affirmed the previous decision which ruled against his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matter of Lewis v. Allen, 14 NY 2d 867 - NY: Court of Appeals 1964|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6066968445469971278&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Links to the school prayer controversy ===
The use of the Pledge of Allegiance has been cited in landmark cases concerning government led prayer within public schools. These decisions, made in the 1960s, were often seen suspiciously as they occurred during the [[Cold War]] against the USSR which was officially atheistic. In addition, many Southern politicians saw these rulings, along with the concurrent decisions advancing racial Civil Rights, as an assault on State's Rights.

====Invoking the Pledge in ''Engel v. Vitale''====
In 1962 the [[United States Supreme Court]] addressed the question of whether a government led school prayer "to be said in conjunction with the Pledge of Allegiance and 'as an incident to the Pledge of Allegiance ceremony{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Record"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962). Term Year: 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; was constitutional in the case ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]''.

In the state's briefs, "the insertion of the words 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance" was cited as one of the "literally countless illustrations&amp;nbsp;... [to] the fact that belief and trust in a Supreme Being was from the beginning and has been continuously part of the very essence of the American plan of government".&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt;

In part, the state of New York defended the prayer by equating its effects with the Pledge, saying in one of their briefs "The Regents' Prayer&amp;nbsp;... serves as a simple reminder that Americans trust in God, as the Pledge of Allegiance serves as a simple reminder of our obligations to our 'one nation under God'."&lt;ref name="Opposition"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962). Brief in Opposition. File Date: 11/22/1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; They pointed out that "The challenged recitation follows the pledge of allegiance, which itself refers to God",&lt;ref name="Opposition"/&gt; and held that if the court outlawed the government-crafted prayer due to "the conscientious objections of the minority" that "Such a determination would require not only that the Regents' Prayer be discontinued, but also that all schools cease the voluntary recitation of the pledge of allegiance, which, as amended by 36 U.S.C. §172, contains the words 'under God'."&lt;ref name="Opposition"/&gt;

The Court ruled that government-crafted and led prayer was unconstitutional. The decision was highly controversial, and ''[[obiter dictum]]'' within Justice [[William O. Douglas]]' concurring opinion received particular attention.

=====Justice Douglas' ''obiter dictum''=====
In his ''[[obiter dictum]]'', Douglas postulated what the reasoning of the ruling might have on current government practices. He wrote: "The point for decision is whether the Government can constitutionally finance a religious exercise. Our system at the federal and state levels is presently honeycombed with such financing. Nevertheless, I think it is an unconstitutional undertaking whatever form it takes."&lt;ref name="U.S. 421"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=370&amp;invol=421#ttt1|title=Enge v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a footnote illustrating "such financing", he also noted that "The slogan 'In God We Trust' is used by the Treasury Department, and Congress recently added God to the pledge of allegiance",&lt;ref name="U.S. 421"/&gt; thereby calling those practices' constitutionality under question as well.

Opponents of the decision (including legislators calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reverse its effects) saw Douglas' ''obiter dictum'' as a likely indicator of future decisions including the end of daily recitals of the Pledge in schools.

Senator [[Absalom Willis Robertson]] berated the decision and declared "We have no clear assurance that the Court will not follow the broad concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in rendering future decisions. That is why I say we cannot sit complacently".&lt;!-- sentence continues --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Congressional Record|date=August 25, 1962|page=17588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Herman Talmadge]] asked Robertson, "[Can you theorize] If they did what their decision presages? It would remove all the chaplains in the armed services, the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, the word 'God' in ''The Star-Spangled Banner'', and everything else that the American Republic has held dear throughout the history of our country."&lt;ref name="Aug 17592"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Congressional Record|date=August 25, 1962|page=17592}}&lt;/ref&gt; To which Robertson replied "That is the clear implication of the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas."&lt;ref name="Aug 17592"/&gt;

Senator [[Wayne Morse]], despite coming to an acceptance of the ruling, expressed concern if Douglas' dicta did not indicate a coming end to many practices within the government including the Pledge, saying "Undoubtedly the special concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas will have some persuasive influence not only on practicing lawyers, but also on lower courts.&amp;nbsp;... [Still, as it is only ''dicta''] what Mr. Justice Douglas said in many parts of the decision does not involve principles and tenets which are yet the law of the land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Congressional Record|date=July 27, 1962|page=14888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mention of the Pledge in ''Abington School District v. Schempp''====
While the move to amend the Constitution to reverse the effects of ''Engel v. Vitale'' did not get out of the Congressional Judiciary Committees, and the calls to impeach the Justices or to establish a "Court of the States" (that would allow representatives of the states to act as a court above the Supreme Court) failed to gather support, another school prayer case came before the Court in 1963. The Court was asked to rule on practices in the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland.

In this case, called ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'', the Court considered whether school officials could read aloud or have students read aloud Bible passages for devotional purposes which "was followed by a standing recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]], together with the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag by the class in unison".&lt;ref name="Schempp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=374&amp;invol=203|title= Abington School Dist. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) 374 U.S. 203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court ruled against the state, but avoided saying anything similar to the highly controversial dicta Justice Douglas had previous written.

The decision did specifically mention the Pledge at several points. The Court theorized that the Pledge might be constitutional if either the words "under God" inserted in 1954 had, due to the passage of time, lost their religious meaning by 1963, or if one equated a personal public declaration of loyalty with the act of reading a document created by a historical figure—"This general principle might also serve to insulate the various patriotic exercises and activities used in the public schools and elsewhere which, whatever may have been their origins, no longer have a religious purpose or meaning. The reference to divinity in the revised pledge of allegiance, for example, may merely recognize the historical fact that our Nation was believed to have been founded 'under God'. Thus reciting the pledge may be no more of a religious exercise than the reading aloud of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which contains an allusion to the same historical fact."&lt;ref name="Schempp"/&gt;

With this reasoning the Supreme Court specifically categorized the Pledge as secular, contrasting it to the religious exercises under consideration. The Court held that if, as the states claimed, Bible reading and ''The Lord's Prayer'' were being used to achieve secular ends ("fostering harmony and tolerance among the pupils"&lt;ref name="Schempp"/&gt;) than "it would seem that less sensitive materials might equally well serve the same purpose.&amp;nbsp;... It has not been shown that readings from the speeches and messages of great Americans, for example, or from the documents of our heritage of liberty, daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, or even the observance of a moment of reverent silence at the opening of class, may not adequately serve the solely secular purposes of the devotional activities without jeopardizing either the religious liberties of any members of the community or the proper degree of separation between the spheres of religion and government. Such substitutes would, I think, be unsatisfactory or inadequate only to the extent that the present activities do in fact serve religious goals. While I do not question the judgment of experienced educators that the challenged practices may well achieve valuable secular ends, it seems to me that the State acts unconstitutionally if it either sets about to attain even indirectly religious ends by religious means, or if it uses religious means to serve secular ends where secular means would suffice."&lt;ref name="Schempp"/&gt;

As Justice Douglas' ''obiter dictum'' had included questioning the constitutionality of the fact that "There is Bible-reading in the schools of the District of Columbia"&lt;ref name="U.S. 421"/&gt; the controversy over the Court's rulings did not die out.

====''Parker v. Board of Education''====
On June 17, 1963, the same day that the ''Schempp'' case was decided, A. L. Wirin, an attorney for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], filed a lawsuit on behalf of Haswell Parker, a fifty-one-year-old high school history teacher. Parker, who "said he did not belong to any church",&lt;ref name="Ocala"/&gt; objected "as a matter of personal conscience"&lt;ref name="Bee"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Modesto Bee|date=October 3, 1963|title=Board Exempts Teacher from Pledge Action|location=Los Angeles|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Los Angeles Board of Education's policy (instated in 1959) that made daily recitation of the pledge with the 1954 addition of the words "under God" mandatory.&lt;ref name="Ocala"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Ocala Star|date=June 20, 1963|author=Associated Press|location=Los Angeles|title=Civil Liberties Union Says 'Under God' In Allegiance Is Illegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This action was decried by both the media and politicians, such as Alan H. Newcomb of WBT-TC who was cited by Senator [[Sam Ervin]], he stated "almost before that opinion [''Schempp''] was understood by the people, the Civil Liberties Union brought suit&amp;nbsp;... We suggest that the history teacher study his history. The trend toward eradicating all reference to God from every official document and act in this country is not merely protecting a few tiny minorities from a fancied infringement of their rights. It goes far deeper than that. If carried to the ultimate conclusion, it would destroy the whole American philosophy of human liberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 11, 1963|title=Congressional Record|page=12414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutionality of the Pledge was not challenged in 1963 as the Los Angeles Board of Education "advised the court it will not require Parker to lead the pledge of allegiance".&lt;ref name="Bee"/&gt; Parker and Wirin dropped the suit on October 4, 1963.

===== 2003 District ruling =====

Teachers or any other staff also cannot be forced to participate in the pledge. In the case of ''Lane v. Owens'', three teachers and six students sued the Colorado state government over a 2003 law requiring daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by students and teachers. Granting the plaintiffs a temporary restraining order,  U.S. District Judge Lewis Babcock said: "It doesn't matter whether you're a teacher, a student, a citizen, an administrator, or anyone else, it is beyond the power of the authority of government to compel the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance".&lt;!-- unclear from source whether sentence continues --&gt; Colorado subsequently (2004) amended the law to remove the requirement to recite the Pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== 2005 District ruling ===

In early 2005, Dr. [[Michael Newdow]] brought a new lawsuit on behalf of himself and others.  On September 14, 2005, U.S. District Judge [[Lawrence Karlton]] ruled that it violated the Establishment Clause for public schools to lead their students in the Pledge of Allegiance to comply with California's requiring the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.  The judge said he was bound by 2002 precedent of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] decision even though it had been vacated by the Supreme Court. Judge Karlton held that the words "one nation under God" violate the right to be "free from a coercive requirement to affirm God".

On November 30, 2005, the [[Becket Fund for Religious Liberty]], an organization claiming to defend religious rights for people of all faiths, appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit and filed a brief that declared, {{nowrap|"[Intervenors]}} object to the ruling that the pledge violates any part of the [[Establishment Clause]]."  Derek Gaubatz, Director of Litigation for the Becket Fund, said his group would appeal the decision "if necessary to the Supreme Court to get that ruling reversed to secure the constitutionality of the pledge once and for all".

=== "Under God" ruling ===

The words "under God" were added to the Pledge on June 14, 1954 when then U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed a bill into law. At the time, Eisenhower stated that "From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our Nation and our people to the Almighty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The matter of the Pledge's constitutionality simmered for decades below the public eye. In 1992, the [[Chicago]]-based [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] decided the first challenge to the constitutionality of the words "under God", ruling in ''Sherman v. Community Consolidated School District 21'' that the use of the words "under God" in the Pledge did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]].  On June 26, 2002, in a case (''[[Newdow v. United States Congress]]'') brought by an atheist father objecting to the Pledge being taught in his daughter's school, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[San Francisco]] ruled the addition of "under God" an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism.

Shortly after the ruling's release, Judge [[Alfred T. Goodwin]], author of the opinion in the 2–1 ruling, signed an order staying its enforcement until the full Ninth Circuit court could decide whether to hear an appeal.

The day after the ruling, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] voted in favor of the Pledge as it stood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r107:FLD001:S56105-S56106 Senate debate records]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House of Representatives|House]] followed suit, accepting a similar resolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.+Res.+459:{{Full citation needed|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate vote was 99–0 (Senator [[Jesse Helms]] could not attend, but had been expected to vote "yes"); the House 416–3 with 11 abstaining. President [[George W. Bush]] and many other politicians spoke out in favor of the existing Pledge.

The stay on the ruling was lifted on February 28, 2003 when the full Ninth Circuit court of appeals decided not to take the case, letting the ruling stand. A second stay was granted, however, to give the school district time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If it had held, the court's ruling would have affected more than 9.6 million students in [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Guam]].{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

In the months following the court's decision, [[Attorney General|Attorneys General]] from all 50 states filed papers asking the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to review the decision, 49 of whom joined a legal [[brief (law)|brief]] sponsored by [[Oklahoma]] Attorney General [[Drew Edmondson]] and [[Idaho]] Attorney General [[Lawrence Wasden]].  California filed a separate brief, also urging the Supreme Court to hear the case.

On January 12, 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal on March 24 of the same year. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] recused himself from the case after he had criticized the Ninth Circuit judgment in the Newdow case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/911/2003/012003/01132003/846367/printer_friendly|title=Religious freedom praised|author=Gould, Pamela|date=2003-01-13|accessdate=2006-06-19|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709032508/http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/911/2003/012003/01132003/846367/printer_friendly|archive-date=2012-07-09|dead-url=yes|publisher=The Free Lance-Star Publishing Company}} &lt;!-- not good link as of 2006-06-19: [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,100104,00.html]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1066080440869 |title=Scalia Recusal Revives Debate Over Judicial Speech, Ethics | author=Mauro, Tony |work=Legal Times |publisher=ALM Properties, Inc. |date=2003-10-20 |accessdate=2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=APAB&amp;p_theme=apab&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_text_search-0=constitutional%20scalia&amp;p_field_label-0=Topics&amp;s_dispstring=constitutional%20scalia%20AND%20date(1/13/2003%20to%201/13/2003)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1/13/2003%20to%201/13/2003)&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |title=Supreme Court justice says courts misinterpreting church-state separation |author=Holland, Gina |publisher=Associated Press |date=2003-01-13 |accessdate=2006-06-19 |format=Summary only - Subscription required for full article }} Note that this is the article used by Newdow to request Scalia's recusal - see {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} where difference in reporting between AP and local paper noted, and {{cite web|author=Thorne, Mister |url=http://www.misterthorne.org/ESSAYS/scalia_recusal.htm |title=What She Said He Said |date=2003-11-26 |accessdate=2006-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721203700/http://www.misterthorne.org/ESSAYS/scalia_recusal.htm |archivedate=2006-07-21 |df= }} for criticism of the reporting.&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court rejected [[Newdow]]'s claim by an 8–0 vote, stating that as a non-custodial parent, he did not have standing to act as his daughter's legal representative.

In August 2005, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] held 3–0 in Myers v. Loudoun County Public Schools that teacher-led recitations of the Pledge did not violate the Establishment Clause. The Plaintiff in that case, Edward Myers, decided not to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

=== General patterns in issues of church and state ===

The points-of-view, compromises, and personal interests in this matter are often viewed as examples of a wider debate over the role of religion in U.S. government.

Several dissenting Supreme Court Justices concluded that U.S. judges exceed their authority in decisions on issues of religion.  Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote, and Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] agreed, that "the Court's position is the repressive one" when the Supreme Court approved of the lower courts declaring a law unconstitutional because it mandated that teaching of "evolution science" be balanced by teaching of "creation science." (''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
|litigants=Edwards v. Aguillard
|vol= 482
|reporter=U.S.
|opinion= 578
|year= 1987  |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=482&amp;page=578 }} Text of the court decision at [[FindLaw]]&lt;/ref&gt;). Justice Scalia has also said that courts have gone too far to keep religion out of public schools and other forums, and that the Pledge of Allegiance question would be better decided by lawmakers than judges. &lt;!-- http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,100104,00.html if you're interested (broken link) --&gt;{{Citation needed | date = March 2012}}

The Supreme Court has banned some expressions of "God" from public schools. For example, in 1962 the Supreme Court banned the teacher-led recitation of the invocation, "[[God|Almighty God]], we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
|litigants=Engel v. Vitale
|vol= 370
|reporter=U.S.
|opinion= 421
|year= 1962  |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=370&amp;page=421#422}} Text of the court decision at [[FindLaw]]&lt;/ref&gt; This objectionable "Almighty God" recitation was voluntary, of the same nature as the Pledge of Allegiance.
&lt;!-- And the parents, even the one that claimed to be an "[[Agnosticism|agnostic]]", did not complain about the "God" in the Pledge of Allegiance. --&gt;

In the same 1962 case, the Court admitted that the "God save this honorable court" invocation uttered at the beginning of each Court session was a "prayer." However, the Court also ruled that "A religion is not established in the usual sense merely by letting those who choose to do so say the prayer that the public school teacher leads." Rather, the Court found fault with the teacher-led prayer because the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] had financed a religious exercise in requiring the teacher-led recitation of the prayer. Nevertheless, neither the parents nor the Court made the same assertion regarding the Pledge of Allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|370|421|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition of "religious exercise" ===

The dissenting justice{{who|date=January 2013}} in the [[#"Under God" ruling|2002 "Under God" ruling]] stated that the ruling conflicted with the Supreme Court's explicit stance that the phrase "under God" is merely a ceremonial reference to [[history]] and not an affirmation of religious [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/virtual/2002/law/newdow.reh.pet.6.pdf Justice brief at 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents contend that this contradicts the 1954 House Report of the legislators who inserted the "under God" phrase into the Pledge, which stated that the words "under God" served to "acknowledge the dependence of our people and our Government upon the moral directions of the Creator." 154 U.S.C.A.A.N 2339, 2340.

The plaintiff, [[Michael Newdow]], an [[atheist]], took issue with the phrase "[[In God We Trust]]" on the coins of American currency, believing that the phrase was a state-sponsored statement of religious faith—illegal under the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} of the judges in the 2002 ruling agreed that Newdow had a right to direct the [[religious education]] of his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/virtual/2002/law/newdow.reh.pet.6.pdf Justice brief at 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; Newdow explained his view of 'freedom of religious exercise' by asking whether Christians would be glad if the atheists were in the majority and if the atheists inserted into the pledge of allegiance the phrase "one nation under NO God."&lt;ref name="CNN phone interview"/&gt; In an interview with Connie Chung, Newdow stated, "The Constitution says the congress will make no laws respecting an establishment of religion which means that the Supreme Court says, and as you have said, nobody should be made to feel like an outsider. And I would only ask everyone of those people to ask themselves, if they had to say every morning when they pledged allegiance to the flag, that we were one nation under Sun Myung Moon, or one nation under David Koresh, or one nation under Jesus, or one nation under Mohammad, how would they feel?" Thus Newdow claimed that the reference to God is meaningful, and hence the court should recognize, and correct, the resulting religious bias.

== Objection that the Pledge promotes a socialist state ==

[[Francis Bellamy]], the author of the Pledge, was a former Baptist minister who preached that Jesus was a socialist. He was allied ideologically with his cousin, [[Edward Bellamy]], one of the most renowned socialists of the late 19th century. Strongly opposed to capitalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/pledge-of-allegiance-origins_b_4497369.html|title=The Surprising Story Of The Pledge Of Allegiance|author=James Peron|date=July 11, 2012|publisher=Chattanoogan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis advocated income taxation, central banking, nationalized education, nationalization of industry, and other tenets of socialism. A primary objective of his was to replace the existing federalist view of the country (where states are sovereign) in the public's mind with a nationalist one that would open the way to creating a centralized government.

When provided the opportunity to write a pledge to the American flag in a campaign to sell flags to public schools, Bellamy turned to the words and principles of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2012/7/11/230070/The-Surprising-Story-Of-The-Pledge-Of.aspx|title=The Socialist Origins of the Pledge of Allegiance|date=December 24, 2013|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, if American youth could to be taught "loyalty to the State", it would pave the way for the socialist utopia that was described in his famous socialist cousin Edward Bellamy's ''[[Looking Backward]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The central idea of "one nation" in the pledge was especially important for achieving his vision of the kind of consolidated, monopoly government necessary for a socialism to be adopted. Additionally, he considered adding the socialist bywords, "liberty, fraternity and equality", but knew that state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans.

As Bellamy believed youth should be trained in devotion to the State, the public schools as a government institution were the perfect setting for planting the requisite fervent loyalty and patriotism.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} To promote the Pledge nationwide, a "National Public School Celebration" was held 1892 on Columbus Day. It was the first government sponsored propaganda event on behalf of the Pledge of Allegiance. It was a massive campaign that involved government schools and politicians throughout the country. Not only was the Pledge recited ''en masse'' for the first time at the behest of government, but public schools were promoted while private schools, especially parochial ones, were criticized.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Other objections and rulings ==

Some people generally oppose the pledge because they feel that the mandatory recital of what amounts to an oath, particularly by children, led by government employees in public schools, is a form of compulsory speech, amounting to indoctrination, that is the antithesis of the liberty the flag itself represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaxchoicevt.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/vtwoman-freespeech.pdf|title=Compulsory speech: The silent side of the First Amendment|date=November 2012|work=|publisher=Vermont Woman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in ''Barnette'', Justices Black and Douglas wrote in a concurring opinion, "Words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to nothing but self-interest. Love of country must spring from willing hearts and free minds, inspired by a fair administration of wise laws enacted by the people's elected representatives within the bounds of express constitutional prohibitions." Likewise, the majority opinion by Justice Robert Jackson, included one of the great statements in American constitutional law and history, stated: "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein."

=== 2006 District ruling ===

In the 2006 Florida case ''Frazier v. Alexandre'', No. 05-81142 (S.D. Fla. May 31, 2006), "A federal district court in Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, even though the law allows students to opt out, because they can only do so with written parental permission and are still required to stand during the recitation. Cameron Frazier, a student at Boynton Beach High School, was removed from a class after he refused to follow his teacher's instructions to recite the Pledge or stand during recitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

It has appeared on social networking sites such as [[Myspace]], [[Quora]], [[LiveJournal]], and [[Facebook]], where, in April 2006, it had generated more than a million visits per week.&lt;ref name="UTD"/&gt; The comic's authors attribute its success to its often controversial nature,&lt;ref name="UTD"&gt;{{cite web

==Conception==
''Cyanide &amp; Happiness''  began as a small series of comics drawn by Kris Wilson at the age of sixteen. Wilson was at home with strep throat and had doodled some [[stick figure]] comics.&lt;ref name="zug"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.zug.com/live/84155/Kris-Wilson-is-the-Picasso-of-Exploding-Stick-Figures.html

| df = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his DeviantArt profile page, he notes that he "created ''Cyanide &amp; Happiness'' in 2004 because I can't help but draw stupid looking characters to spew out my stupid ideas."&lt;ref name="DeviantArt"&gt;{{cite web

| last = Wilson | first = Kris
| accessdate = January 10, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showcased his comics on his Comicaze website,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and then on Sticksuicide.com, "a website devoted to animations and games graphically depicting the violent deaths of stick figures", which was founded by Rob DenBleyker in 2004.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, DenBleyker and Matt Melvin  had been working on projects where they "made bad stick figure death movies together after posting their stuff at [[Newgrounds]] back in around 1999 and 2000." The forum's webmasters, including DenBleyker, Melvin, and Dave McElfatrick (who joined Sticksuicide) liked the format of Wilson's comics. Melvin said, "When we decided to branch off from just stick figure death movies and do something more with the site, we started Explosm and brought Kris on board."&lt;ref name="gethappy"/&gt; Wilson and the webmasters then collaborated on the comics, where each person would contribute content. One of the earliest ''Cyanide &amp; Happiness'' comics, #15, was posted by Wilson on Explosm.net on January 26, 2005.&lt;ref name="zug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="number15" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = Explosm.net
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of the comic's title is first mentioned in #121, in which one character sells cotton candy, and explains that it is made of "Cyanide &amp; Happyness" [sic], after which the other character replies: "Happyness!?!? Hot damn! I'll take 4".&lt;ref name="number121" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite web

==Production==
[[File:Cyanide and Happiness 02.jpg|thumb|Rob DenBleyker and background artist Shawn Coss, Toronto, 2012]]

===Development===
The cartoonists started out in different locations: In 2006, DenBleyker was a college student at [[University of Texas at Dallas]].&lt;ref name="UTD"/&gt; Wilson lived in [[Fort Bridger, Wyoming]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to his DeviantArt page, Wilson has since moved to [[Fort Collins, Colorado]].&lt;/ref&gt; Melvin in [[San Diego, California]], and McElfatrick in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="robot6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would also use Skype for occasional collaboration.&lt;ref name="zug"/&gt; Melvin said, "We collaborate here and there on them, but the comics are most often individual efforts. The animated shorts, however, are big collaborative projects, often bringing in people from outside our little, core group."&lt;ref name="flux"/&gt; Although they started working on the project in 2004, the authors did not meet each other face-to-face until the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2007 San Diego Comic-Con]].&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt;

===Format===
The format of ''Cyanide &amp; Happiness'' is typically a single page where the cartoonist would post his comic. The page can vary in length and number of panels. The drawings are done in Macromedia Flash.&lt;ref name="UTD"/&gt;  Although generally static, some of the comics have animated panels.&lt;ref name="signedprints"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others [[break the fourth wall]]; for instance, in #375, one of the characters looks at the reader, and the other asks what he is looking at. He then looks out and says "Holy shit! It's a person!"&lt;ref name="number375" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite web

===Influences===
Wilson and DenBleyker have mentioned the traditional comic ''[[The Far Side]]'' by [[Gary Larson]] and the webcomic ''[[The Perry Bible Fellowship]]'' by Nicholas Gurewitch as influences for the comic.&lt;ref name="zug"/&gt; Wilson mentioned [[Don Hertzfeldt]], [[Bill Hicks]], ''[[White Ninja Comics]]'', [[Monty Python]], and [[David Wong (writer)|David Wong]] as influences.&lt;ref name="robot6"/&gt; At a [[Davenport College]] panel, DenBleyker commented that he writes for up to ten hours a day and collaborates with friends,&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt; however, in April 2013, he tweeted to replace "reading classic philosophy texts" with "sitting in my car crying".&lt;ref name="twitter20130420"&gt;{{cite tweet |author= Rob DenBleyker |user= RobDenBleyker|number= 325409845392064512 |date= April 20, 2013 |title= C&amp;H wiki wrongly says I write comics by "reading classic philosophy texts", someone pls replace with "sitting in my car crying". Source: me. |access-date= May 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McElfatrick was inspired by old English children's comics such as ''[[The Beano|The Beano and The Dandy]]''.&lt;ref name="robot6"/&gt; Melvin did not read comics as a kid, but enjoyed Larson's ''The Far Side'' and [[Matt Groening]]'s ''[[Life in Hell]]''; he preferred live-action sketch comedy shows such as ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'', ''Monty Python'', ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'', and ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David|Mr. Show]]''.&lt;ref name="robot6"/&gt;

==Setting and characters==

The cartoonists regularly make jokes on controversial topics including [[abortion]], [[suicide]], and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt; Their characters rarely have names and are usually only distinguishable by the colors of their shirts. The male characters almost always have no hair, which became a joke in itself in #642.&lt;ref name="number642" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = June 10, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female characters are distinguishable by their long hair and chest size, often used to comedic effect. Jesus makes appearances, accompanied with religious puns.&lt;ref name="number312" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explosm.net/comics/312/

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recurring characters have names, such as "[[Obese]] Maurice" and the [[epileptic]] superhero "Seizure Man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6509550/The-10-best-webcomics-from-Achewood-to-XKCD.html|website=[[Telegraph.co.uk]]|title=The 10 best webcomics, from Achewood to XKCD|last=Chivers|first=Tom|date=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; DenBleyker added that the stick figure style "makes the characters seem very transient, as if they only exist for a given comic. 'Cyanide and Happiness' prides itself on having no characters or themes. If we ever bring up a character, we usually retire it after its share of original jokes has run out."&lt;ref name="UTD"/&gt;

==Publication==
One of the cartoonists' strips would be featured on a single page for the day. Melvin says that they "keep a schedule of sorts, but it's nothing completely set in stone."&lt;ref name="gethappy"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://comixtalk.com/node/12549 | title = Get Happy!

The Internet has ADD, and if you're not constantly giving them something new, you're going to lose them."&lt;ref name="zug"/&gt;

===Events===
On occasion, the ''Cyanide &amp; Happiness'' cartoonists have featured Depressing Comic Weeks, where they wrote depressing and/or upsetting comics. In an interview, Melvin said, "we'd made comics that were funny because of how dark they were. But now DCW is just about making really sad comics with no punchline whatsoever."&lt;ref name="flux"/&gt; The December 30th episode of the Cyanide and Happiness Show featured the "depressing episode" - coinciding with the 8th depressing comic week at explosm.net.

''Cyanide &amp; Happiness'' has featured Guest Weeks, where readers submit entries, and some would be featured as daily comics over the course of the week.{{citation needed|date=January 2013|reason=need blog post for this event}}

On October 14, 2007, Wilson announced a desire for every comic in their archive to be translated into other languages. In a subsequent post, he reported a "phenomenal" 1300 replies with offers to translate into over 20 different languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2013|reason=need post}}

In 2010, author Dave McElfatrick, a Northern Ireland native, started a petition for a visa into the United States, in order to be with the other writers to produce more animated shorts. The petition garnered over 132,000 signatures in less than three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hey guys, REALLY need your help! - The Explosm Fora|url=http://forums.explosm.net/showthread.php?t=67947|accessdate=28 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802020157/http://forums.explosm.net/showthread.php?t=67947|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2013|reason=need article explaining that he got the VISA, and the 132,000 signatures}} On September 1, 2010,  it was officially announced that Dave qualified for the visa that would allow him to enter the United States to work on more comics and animated shorts with Wilson, DenBleyker, and Melvin.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} On August 31, 2014, Matt Melvin announced that he was no longer part of Cyanide and Happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I am No Longer Part of Cyanide and Happiness|url=https://www.facebook.com/RobotsWithFeelings/photos/a.10151068914020086.488349.70629230085/10152740505495086/?type=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=January 2013|1=Critical Reception, Popularity as noted by Webcomics industry and general media, any awards}}

John Hargrave of [[zug.com]] said that "Despite all this solo effort, the end product is coherent and strangely logical, as if the four creators were each viewing the peculiar world of C&amp;H from a slightly different angle -- a world in which disembodied heads turn into seagulls, and Jesus is a designated driver."&lt;ref name="zug"/&gt;

DenBleyker has mentioned that the comic's popularity grew from their sharing policy, "which encourages readers to repost and re-blog comics, effectively allowing anyone to spread ''Cyanide and Happiness''{{'}} content."&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt; In January 2006, the comic was getting about 20,000 unique visitors a day, but "we added a little box under each comic which allows people to post an Explosm-linked version of the comic, which brings a lot of traffic back to us. After we put that box up, the traffic started exploding." After a few days, the comic received about 300,000 unique visitors a day, which consisted of mostly traffic from MySpace and LiveJournal blog links.&lt;ref name="UTD"/&gt;

In response to the question regarding controversial topics, DenBleyker said that the authors have not received a huge amount of serious negative feedback and do not intend to tone down the edginess of their comics.&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt; Melvin notes that some of the respondents have criticized them on one topic, but at the same time praised them for a different one.&lt;ref name="flux"&gt;{{cite web

{{main|The Cyanide &amp; Happiness Show}}
In addition to creating ''Cyanide &amp; Happiness'' comic strips, the cartoonists have done animations drawn in a similar stick figure style. As of July 2017, there have been three full seasons of ''[[The Cyanide and Happiness Show]]'' (for a total of 31 episodes), and shorter cartoons continue to be produced weekly (and sometimes more often than that). The animations are in [[Adobe Flash]] format and are typically voiced by the cartoonists.&lt;ref name="dA"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.explosm.net/movies/| title = List of Explosm.net Flash Movies| work = Explosm.net| accessdate = 2009-04-01| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090329055955/http://www.explosm.net/movies/| archivedate = 2009-03-29| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase Suddarth contributes occasionally to the shorts. DenBleyker made a series called ''Joe Zombie'', which lasted six episodes, and left fans to anticipate a seventh, where he stated "will come out eventually".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.explosm.net/showthread.php?p=2152489#post2152489 |title=Yes, another Joe zombie question... - The Explosm Fora |publisher=Forums.explosm.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2016, Explosm started a [[Kickstarter]] project for a ''Cyanide &amp; Happiness'' card game titled ''Joking Hazard'', in which cards represent panels of a 3-panel comic and the players must attempt to form a humorous combination. The project's funding finished on March 10, 2016, with over $3.2 million [[USD]] in backings. ''Joking Hazard'' is currently the second most funded card game in Kickstarter history, after ''[[Exploding Kittens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/binging-indie/16827-Cyanide-and-Happiness-Kickstarter-Card-Game-Joking-Hazard|publisher=''[[The Escapist (website)|The Escapist]]''|title=Cards Against Hilarity - Small Parts of ''Joking Hazard''|last=Monroe|first=Nick|date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2016/03/82920-cyanide-happiness-joking-hazard-named-second-most-funded-card-game-on-kickstarter/|publisher=''Crowdfund Insider''|title=Cyanide &amp; Happiness’ Joking Hazard Named Second Most Funded Card Game on Kickstarter|last=Hurst|first=Samantha|date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyanideandhappiness/joking-hazard/posts/1515049|title=Update 29: THANK YOU!! · Joking Hazard|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2017, Explosm began another Kickstarter for a Cyanide and Happiness video game with a goal of $300,000, earning over $575,000. The game is described to borrow elements from games such as [[South Park: The Stick of Truth]], and throughout backing players could pledge to put themselves in the game via different ways, such as a "memorial wall", a permanent school record, a grave stone or even become an actual NPC. The game is slated to be released near the end of 2018.

'''Dominican Creole French''' is a [[French-based creole languages|French-based creole]], which is the generally spoken language in [[Dominica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/creole.cfm |title=The Creole Language of Dominica |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly mutually intelligible with its much more widely spoken immediate neighbor, [[Antillean Creole]], of which it might be considered a distinct variety.

==History==
It is a sub-variety of [[Antillean Creole]], which is spoken in other islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and is very closely related to the varieties spoken in [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Grenada]] and parts of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The intelligibility rate with speakers of other varieties of Antillean Creole is almost 100%. Its syntactic, grammatical and lexical features are virtually identical to that of Martinican Creole, though, like its Saint Lucian counterpart, it includes more English loanwords than the Martinican variety. People who speak [[Haitian Creole]] can also understand Dominican Creole French, even though there are a number of distinctive features; they are mutually intelligible.

Like the other [[French-based creole languages]] in the Caribbean, Dominican French Creole is primarily French-derived vocabulary, with African and Carib influences to its syntax.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In addition, many expressions reflect the presence of an [[English Creole]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] influences are also very much present in the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1635, the French seized Guadeloupe and Martinique and began establishing sugar colonies. Dominica, for its part, had not been colonized because all attempts to colonize it had failed. Before 1690, lumberjacks (English and French) had traveled to Dominica for its forest resources.  Subsequently, French from Martinique and Guadeloupe and their slaves settled in Dominica by establishing small farms of coffee, cotton, wood, and tobacco. Creole thus develops among the slaves, Dominican Creole thus comes from the mixture of the Creoles from Guadeloupe and Martinique, and then it is enriched further with Amerindian and English words.  From now on, the Creole would stay until the present. Despite the future transfer of the island to the English and the addition of English words, the Creole remains strongly French in Dominica and despite what is said, is his place in the center of the Dominicans culture. The underdevelopment of the road system in Dominica hindered for a long time the development of English, the official language of the country, in isolated villages, where Creole remained the only spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60126665|title=The Dominica story : a history of the island|last=Lennox.|first=Honychurch,|date=1995|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0333627768|location=London|oclc=60126665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classic or Current changes ===
We must remember that Creole developed in the French slavery plantation environment. While Africans pronounced the French language the best they understood with their own accents, not all its consonants would be reproduced exactly the same. The "R" was realized as "W". Commonly, the Creole countries that have French as their official language no longer retain this characteristic; however, the islands sold to the English do retain this usage.

== Verbes ==

=== Les Verbes Créoles ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are verbs well known for their frequent use in Creole. As Creole is made by the fusion of different languages and cultures, pronunciation is the basis of language training. The negative is formed by adding the "pa" in front of the verb whereas there are two exceptions (below).

*&lt;blockquote&gt;vlé (lé) = vouloir / pé = able : note that negation is an exception for "le" and "pe" which become "le pa" and "pe pa"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Les Articles ==

=== L’article défini ===
When using the article, we add it after the name which differs from what we see in the French syntax. "La" follows nouns that end with a consonant or "y". When a name ends with a vowel, it is followed by "a" only.
{| class="wikitable"
|''Nonm-la''
|''The Man''
|-
|''Fanm-la''
|''The Woman''
|-
|''Payay-la''
|''the Papaya''
|-
|''Lawi-a''
|''The Street''
|-
|''Zaboka-a''
|The Avocado
|}

=== L’article indéfini ===
L’article indéfini a deux formes. Le masculin « yon » et la féminine « yonn » par exemple.

{| class="wikitable"
|''Yonn tab''
|''a table''
|-
|''Yon nonm''
|''a man''
|}

=== Le pluriel ===
Le pluriel de l'article se forme en ajoutant « sé + nom + la/a ».  La même règle applique en mettant l’article défini après le nom.
{| class="wikitable"
|''Sé nonm la''
|''The Men''
|-
|''Sé fanm la''
|''The Women''
|-
|''Sé timoun la''
|''The children.''

[[File:Moreau Voltaire Dom Pedre.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Michel Moreau]]: Illustration of Don Pedre 1786]]
'''Don Pèdre, roi de Castille''' (''Don Pedro, King of Castille'') is a tragedy in five acts by [[Voltaire]]. He began work on it in 1761 but only finished it in 1774.&lt;ref name="Pearson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Pearson|title=Voltaire Almighty: A Life in Pursuit of Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbklD47SK1UC&amp;pg=PT335|date=15 December 2010|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4088-2080-3|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rejected by the [[Comédie-Française]] and published unperformed in 1775.

==Action==
The action takes place at the court of medieval [[Kingdom of Castile|Castille]]. Don Pèdre ([[Peter of Castile]]) faces claims from his half brother Transtamare ([[Henry II of Castile]]) both for the throne and for the hand of Léonore de la Cerda. With better connections and the support of the Church, Transtamare defeats Don Pèdre with the help of French soldiers led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]]. Transtamare murders Pèdre with his own hands and seizes the throne. Léonore chooses to die rather than endure marriage with him.&lt;ref name=“Detemple”&gt;Siegfried Detemple: Voltaire: Die Werke, Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag, Berlin, 1994, p.237ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Voltaire began working on the material for the play in 1761.  As his campaigns against Church abuses gathered pace (under the slogan 'écrasez l’infâme’) he reworked it to place particular emphasis on the unhealthy influence of the religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Valérie André: Don Pèdre, in: Dictionnaire Voltaire, Hachette Livre, 1994, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire’s perspective on the characters was unusual; most previous writers had presented Transtamare as a hero and Don Pedro as his evil opponent; he reversed the usual roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Álvarez Rubio |first1=Ma del Rosario |title=De héroes y mitos de la historia de España: Pedro el Cruel en la literatura francesa (siglos XVII-XIX) |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/4047101.pdf |website=Dialnet.unirioja.es |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The [[Comédie-Française]] declined to put on the play, and it was not taken up  by any other theatre.  This rejection was not particularly to do with the play's critical attitude towards the Church, but more to do with the unsatisfactory and inconsistent characterisation.&lt;ref name=“Detemple” /&gt; When the play was published, Voltaire added a dedicatory letter to [[d'Alembert]] and a historical and critical discourse about the tragedy, as well as four short texts: ''Éloge historique de la raison'', ''De L'encyclopédie'', ''Dialoque de Pégase et du vieillard'' and ''La Tactique''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8325">[[File:Wharncliffe Dragon.JPG|thumb|right|Slaying the Wharncliffe Dragon, [[Sheffield Town Hall]]]]
'''The Dragon of Wantley''' is a legend of a dragon-slaying by a knight on Wharncliffe Crags in South Yorkshire, recounted in a comic broadside ballad of 1685, later included in [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s 1767 ''[[Reliques of Ancient Poetry|Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'', and enjoying widespread popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, although less well-known today. The ballad tells how the Falstaffian knight, Moore of Moore Hall, obtains a bespoke suit of spiked Sheffield armour and delivers a fatal kick to the dragon's "arse-gut," its only vulnerable spot - as the dragon explains with its dying breath. The topography of the ballad is accurate in its detail as regards Wharncliffe Crags and environs, but the story, and its burlesque humour, has been  enjoyed in places far from the landscape from which it appears to derive and has been used to make a number of points unrelated to it.

More Hall is a 15th-century (or earlier) residence immediately below the gritstone edge of Wharncliffe Crags—Wharncliffe being formerly known in the local vernacular as Wantley—The dragon was reputed to reside in a den, and to fly across the valley to Allman (Dragon's) Well on the Waldershelf ridge above Deepcar.

==The 1573 case==

A lawsuit was taken out in 1573 by one George More of Sheffield on behalf of the Sheffield Burgery (the 'free men' of Sheffield) against the Lord of the manor of Sheffield, George Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, in respect of his appropriation of the proceeds of Sheffield 'waste' land, which hitherto had paid for Sheffield's poor, civic works and the parish church. [see ''The Records of the Sheffield Burgery'' by John Daniel Leader (1897); and ''Church and Manor: A Study in English Economic History'', by Sidney Oldall Addy (1913)]. This had long been the practice under an agreement in 1297 by one of Talbot's predecessors, one Thomas Furnival [see ''Sheffield (History and Guide)'' by David Fine (1991)], and had seemed secure after a successful petition some two decades previously to the newly enthroned Queen Mary with the full support of George Talbot's father (the previous—fifth—Earl of Shrewsbury, Francis Talbot) [see the ‘history’ section of the website of the Sheffield Church Burgesses Trust http://www.sheffieldchurchburgesses.org.uk/history-of-sheffield-church-burgesses-trust.htm].

==Percy's Interpretation==

In his ''Reliques of Ancient English Poetry'' Thomas Percy holds that the story of ''The Dragon of Wantley'' relates to a dispute over the alleged misappropriation of church tithes in Wharncliffe by [[Sir_Francis_Wortley,_1st_Baronet|Sir Francis Wortley]] who was opposed by a local lawyer named More.&lt;ref name=Shrimpton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shrimpton|first1=Nicholas|title=Explanatory Notes to ''[[The Warden]]'' by Anthony Trollope|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966544-0|page=248|edition=Oxford World's Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The Augustan parody==
[[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]] wrote the libretto to a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] [[opera]] called ''The Dragon of Wantley'' in 1737.  The opera, with music composed by [[John Frederick Lampe]], punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at [[Robert Walpole]] and his taxation policies. The opera was a huge success and its initial run was 69 performances in the first season; a number which exceeded even ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''. The opera debuted at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. Part of its satire of opera was that it had all of the words sung, including the recitatives and da capo arias. The play itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. ''The Musical Entertainer'' from 1739 contains engravings showing how the staging was performed *

The piece is at once a satire of the ridiculousness of operatic staging and an indirect satire of the government's tax policy.  In Carey's play, Moore of Moorehall, "a valiant knight, in love with Margery," is a drunk who pauses to deal with the dragon only between bouts of drinking and carousing with women.  Margery offers herself as a human sacrifice to Moore to persuade him to take on the cause of battling the dragon, and she is opposed Mauxalinda, Moore's "cast-off mistress," who has interest in him now that a rival has appeared.

The battle with the dragon takes place entirely offstage, and Moore only wounds the dragon (who is more reasonable than Moore in his dialogue) in its anus.  The main action concerns the lavish dances and songs by the two sopranos and Moore.

The opera is now rarely performed. A fully staged production was performed by the West London amateur group, Isleworth Baroque, in the theatre at West Thames College and the University of Birmingham performed the opera as part of their Summer Festival in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts.

==The novel==
A novel, ''The Dragon of Wantley'', was written by [[Owen Wister]] (best known as the author of ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'') in [[1892 in literature|1892]].  Published by Lippincott Press, the story is a comic "burlesque" (in the author's words), concerning the "true" story of the Dragon.  It is a romantic story set at Christmastime in the early 13th century.  The book was a surprise success, going through four editions over the next ten years.

==Representations==
There is a representation of the dragon above More Hall on the opposite side of the valley to Wharncliffe Crags. The snaking stone wall culminating in a carved dragon's head can be found at the southern edge of Bitholmes Wood (Grid Ref:295 959).  There is also a bas-relief frieze of a knight killing a dragon, said to be a representation of More and the Dragon of Wantley, in the entrance hall to [[Sheffield Town Hall]].&lt;ref name=TownHall&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/tourist-information/visitor-attractions/heritage/town-hall/main-entrance-hall |publisher=Sheffield City Council |archiveurl=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/tourist-information/visitor-attractions/heritage/town-hall/main-entrance-hall |archivedate=25 April 2010|title= Town Hall Entrance Hall|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other references to ''The Dragon of Wantley''==

In his [[Chronicles_of_Barsetshire|Barsetshire novels]] [[Anthony Trollope]] names an inn and posting house in [[Barchester]] ''The Dragon of Wantley''. When it is first mentioned, in [[The Warden]], this pub is owned by John Bold, a local doctor, who is pursuing a dispute with the church authorities over the alleged misapplication of ecclesiastical revenues.&lt;ref name=Shrimpton/&gt;

'''Dress-up''' is a game played mainly by children. It involves dressing up, usually to impersonate someone or something, like an animal or character in a fairy tale. The type of clothes they dress up in often resembles who they are trying to be, either adults' clothing or special play clothes designed specifically for dress-up like feather boas and [[jewelry]].

Computer games in which users dress up characters have been published on the Internet.

== Paper dolls ==
{{Main|Paper doll}}

The extension of playing dress up onto dolls made of paper can be traced back as far as the mid-1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.opdag.com/History.html|title=History of Paper Dolls|publisher=OPDAG |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have enjoyed great popularity around the world, as they are relatively cheap to produce, yet still offer a rich, dress up experience. They had been published in books, in newspapers and in magazines. In the 20th century, the genre was dominated by dolls created by artist Tom Tierny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virtual dress-up ==
=== Early dolls ===
In the mid- to late 1990s, webmasters began creating interactive [[Virtuality|virtual]] dress-up games in which a person could [[drag and drop]] clothes onto a [[Paper doll|paper doll-like]] image. One of the most notable early adaptors of virtual dress up technology were the Kisekae System Sets (KiSS), which were developed in Japan. These stand-alone games featured a manga-styled model and a small wardrobe. The next phenomenon was Dollz: small, pixel-art GIF images that were presented scattered on websites, and allowed users to be dragged onto the pixel dolls.&lt;ref name="KillScreen"&gt;{{cite news| author = Mariam Naziripour| title = The Awfulness and the Importance of the Dress-Up Game| newspaper = Kill Screen| date = February 26, 2014| url = https://killscreen.com/articles/awfulness-and-importance-dress-game/| accessdate = 2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adobe Flash ===
By 2007, dress up games had changed.  With the introduction of Macromedia (later Adobe) Flash technology, the number of dress-up games creator dramatically increased. Flash offered a visual-based way for artists to learn simple programming, and put a powerful tool in the hands of doll enthusiasts. The number of games and websites grew, as companies found easy success in a market that was previously under-supplied. The genre continued expanding, yielding an over-supply of mass-produced dress up game websites. The saturation is reminiscent of the [[video game crash of 1983]].

=== Doll maker renaissance ===
In the late 2010s, a few websites managed by dedicated dress up fans utilized Adobe Flash to create dress up games that also allow complete customization of the featured character, advancing the genre to "doll makers". These applications also featured extensive hairstyle and clothing choices, allowing for longer gameplay.&lt;ref name="KillScreen" /&gt; The games pushed beyond the usual stereotypes of the genre, and expanded to more pop culture and fantasy themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Ellie Hall| title = You Need To Play This "Game Of Thrones" Dress-Up Game| newspaper = BuzzFeed| date = April 16, 2014| url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/you-need-to-play-this-game-of-thrones-dress-up-game| accessdate = 2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of a '''fantasy author''' is somewhat diffuse, and a matter of opinion – [[Jules Verne]] considered [[H. G. Wells]] to be a fantasy author – and there is considerable overlap with [[List of science fiction authors|science fiction authors]] and [[List of horror fiction authors|horror fiction authors]]. However some notable part of the output of the [[List of fantasy authors|fantasy writers]] leans more to the fantasy end of the spectrum.

The art of '''flag throwing''' dates back to [[medieval]] [[guild]]s (principally in Italy, Germany and Flanders). A guild's banner or [[flag]] was considered a symbol of purity, and as such it was not allowed to touch the ground.

There are two major categories of flag throwing: '''classical''' and '''acrobatical'''.  In classical flag throwing, the flag is turned left and right around the body in a standing posture.  In acrobatical flag throwing, the thrower uses both hands to move the flag in a sitting, laying, or kneeling posture.

'''Hopscotch''' is a [[children's game]] that can be played with several players or alone. Hopscotch is a popular [[playground]] game in which players toss a small object into numbered triangles or a pattern of rectangles outlined on the ground and then hop or jump through the spaces to retrieve the object.

=== The court  ===
To play hopscotch, a court is first laid out on the ground. Depending on the available surface, the court is either scratched out in the dirt or drawn with [[chalk]] on [[pavement (material)|pavement]]. Courts may be permanently marked where playgrounds are commonly paved, as in elementary schools. Designs vary, but the court is usually composed of a series of linear squares interspersed with blocks of two lateral squares. Traditionally the court ends with a "safe" or "home" base in which the player may turn before completing the reverse trip. The home base may be a [[square (geometry)|square]], a [[rectangle]], or a [[semicircle]]. The squares are then numbered in the sequence in which they are to be hopped.

=== Playing the game ===
The first player tosses a stone or marker also called a "lucky", onto the court. This object should land in the square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. It is typically a small flat stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm (in Ireland, it is usually played with an old shoe polish tin or flat stone, called a piggy){{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The marker must land completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the square with the marker in it. Single squares must be hopped on one foot. For the first single square, either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the right square. Optional squares marked "Safe", "Home", or "Rest" are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into "Safe", "Home", or "Rest", the player must then turn around and return through the course (square 9, then squares 8 and 7, next square 6, and so forth) on one or two legs depending on the square until reaching the square with the marker. The player stops in the square before the marker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameskidsplay.net/games/other_games/hopscotch.htm |title=Hopscotch |accessdate=2017-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidspot.com.au/things-to-do/activities/hopscotch |title=Hopscotch |work=kidspot |publisher=NewsLifeMedia |accessdate=2017-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fungameskidsplay.com/hopscotchgame.htm |title= Hopscotch Game |work=Fun Games Kids Play |accessdate=2017-04-24 |quote="The two basic rules to remember - 1. Players can only have 1 foot in each square of the hopscotch board at a time. 2. Players have to hop over the square with the rock (or marker) in it." }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaches down to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or stepping into a square with another player's marker.

Upon successfully completing the sequence, the player continues the turn by tossing the marker into square number two, and repeating the pattern.

If, while hopping through the court in either direction, the player steps on a line, misses a square, or loses balance, the turn ends. Players begin their turns where they last left off. The first player to complete one course for every numbered square on the court wins the game.

Although the marker is most often picked up during the game, historically, in the boy's game, the marker was kicked sequentially back through the course on the return trip and then kicked out.

== Origin ==
[[File:Magpie hopscotch.jpg|thumb|A hopscotch game with a traditional [[One for Sorrow (nursery rhyme)|magpie rhyme]] in [[Morecambe]], England]]

It is attested that an ancient form of hopscotch was played by Roman children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hopscotch - Toys and Games |url=http://maf.mcq.org/jeux/jouets/vignettes/en/jd_mcq_marelle_153.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203010/http://maf.mcq.org/jeux/jouets/vignettes/en/jd_mcq_marelle_153.php |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the first recorded references to the game in the English-speaking world date to the late 17th century, usually under the name "scotch-hop" or "scotch-hopper(s)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Shadwell]]|title=''The Sullen Lovers''|year=1668}} :'Play at Catt, Stoolball, Scotch-hopp and Trap-ball.'  Cited in Oxford English Dictionary, Third edition, June 2011; online version March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A manuscript ''Book of Games'' compiled between 1635 and 1672 by [[Francis Willughby]] refers to 'Scotch Hopper‥. They play with a piece of tile or a little flat piece of lead, upon a boarded floor, or any area divided into oblong figures like boards'.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript was published in 2003: see [[David Cram|Cram, D.]], [[Jeffrey L. Forgeng|Forgeng, J. L.]], and [[Dorothy Johnston|Johnston, D.]], ''The Book of Games of Francis Willughby (1635-1672). A Seventeenth-century Treatise on Sports, Games, and Pastimes''. ([[Aldershot]], 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Poor Robin|Poor Robin's Almanack]] for 1677, the game is referred to as "Scotch-hoppers". The entry states, "The time when schoolboys should play at Scotch-hoppers." The 1707 edition of Poor Robin's Almanack includes the following phrase… "Lawyers and Physicians have little to do this month, so they may (if they will) play at Scotch-hoppers."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book | title = The journal of the British Archaeological Association, Volume 26 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UDAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=hopscotch%20roman&amp;pg=PA242&amp;ci=190,917,741,423#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, [[Noah Webster|Webster]]'s ''[[An American Dictionary of the English language]]'' also referred to the game as 'Scotch-hopper' ... 'a play in which boys hop over scotches and lines in the ground.'&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third edition, June 2011; online version March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the game was known and popular in the seventeenth century, it is logical to suppose it may have existed at least a few decades (or perhaps even many centuries) before its earliest literary reference; but no conclusive evidence has yet been presented to support this theory.

=== Etymology ===
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the [[etymology]] of ''hopscotch'' is a formation from the words "hoop" and "{{Not a typo|scotch}}", the latter in the sense of "an incised line or scratch".&lt;ref&gt;OED Online. March 2012. Oxford University Press. 24 April 2012: 'scotch: An incision, a cut, esp. a long gash made in the flesh; a score; a notch. Obs. (arch. and Eng. regional (E. Anglian) in later use).'&lt;/ref&gt; The journal of the [[British Archaeological Association]], Volume 26 (dated March 9, 1870) states, "The sport of Hop-Scotch or Scotch-Hoppers is called in [[Yorkshire]] 'Hop-Score,' and in [[Suffolk]] 'Scotch Hobbies or Hobby,' from the boy who gets on the player's back whilst hopping or 'hicking,' as it is there termed; and in Scotland it is known as 'Peevers, Peeverels, and Pabats.'"

== Variations ==
[[File:Amarelinhacefet.jpg|thumb|left|A variation in the entrance of [[Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica de Minas Gerais|CEFET-MG]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].]]
There are many other forms of hopscotch played across the globe.&lt;ref name="Lankford"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lankford | first = Mary T. | authorlink = |author2=Karen Dugan | title = Hopscotch Around the World | publisher = William Morrow | year = 1992 | location = New York | pages = | isbn = 0-688-14745-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]] it is called Stapu, Nondi (Tamil) or Kith-Kith, in [[Spain]] and some Latin American countries, it's ''rayuela'', although it may also be known as ''golosa'' or ''charranca''. In [[Turkey]], it is Seksek (the verb "sek" means to jump with one foot). In [[Russian language|Russian]] it is known as ''классики'' ([[diminutive]] for the word meaning ''classes''). In [[Poland]], it is called ''klasy'', meaning ''classes'' (rectangular shape, with the use of no marker but with speaking names of various items of a given class, e.g. colours or flowers, while jumping on successive fields) or ''pajac'', meaning ''[[buffoon]]'' (human shape, with the use of a thrown marker, e.g. a piece of glass or stone). Swedes name the game ''hoppa hage'' (lit. ''jumping the garden''), while in [[Norway]] it is called ''paradis'', or [[Paradise]].  In [[Italy]] the game is known as ''campana'' (meaning ''bell''), or ''mondo'' (meaning ''world''). In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], it is called ''Hinkelen''. In [[Bosnia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] it is called ''školica'', meaning ''little school''. In [[Malaysia]] the most popular variant is called ''tengteng''. In [[Mexico]], it is called ''bebeleche (mamaleche)'' meaning ''drink milk'' &lt;!--- mamaleche means 'suck milk' ---&gt; or ''avioncito'' meaning ''little plane'' ("probably because of the shape"). In [[Cuba]] and in [[Puerto Rico]] it is called "La Peregrina" (meaning "Pilgrim Girl") and the squares represent the 9 rings the pilgrim traveler has to pass in order to reach Heaven from Purgatory according to [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's Inferno]]. In [[Romania]] the game is called ''șotron'' and is widely played by children all over the country. In [[Brazil]] it is called ''amarelinha''. The name evolved from ''marelle'', the French name for the game, but was identified to the radical ''amarelo'' (yellow) and its diminutive in -inho/a. In [[Breton language|Breton]], the name is ''reg'' or ''delech''. The Albanian variant is called ''rrasavi'', which is composed of two words: ''rrasa'' ("the flat stone", an object used to play the game) and ''vi'' ("line", a reference to the lines that comprise the diagram of the course). In [[Philippines]], hopscotch is called "piko" (pee-ko) and sometimes also called kiki (ki-ki). Its common court in the Philippines has six squares. In India, hopscotch is called "thikrya", because broken stones called 'thikrya' are slid across the grid as players hop to next squares. In [[South Korea]], hopscotch is called ''sabancchigi'' (''사방치기'', meaning "Hitting the Four Cardinal Directions") and is widely played across the nation.

=== Laylay (or Khane bazi) ===
[[File:Hopscotch old.jpg|thumb|Street mosaic in the shape of hopscotch game in [[Boston]], USA]]
The game's generic name in Persian is Laylay. The most common form of Laylay in Iran resembles the older Western types and uses six or more (always an even number) side-by-side squares successively (vertically) numbered.  The player uses a peg or a flat stone that the player must kick to the next square as the player is hopping.  If either the stone or a player's foot lands on a line, the player forfeits the game (or loses a turn).  Although somewhat less common, the contemporary Western type is also played.

=== Peevers or Peever ===
In the Glasgow area, the game is called "beds" or "Peever(s)". "Peever" is also the name of the object which is slid across the grid to land in a square. In the 1950s and 1960s in Glasgow, it was common for the peever to be a shoe polish tin filled with stones or dirt and screwed shut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/words/601 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201204404/http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/words/601 |archivedate=2013-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourglasgowstory.com/story.php?sid=48&amp;start=0&amp;end=14&amp;id=1075906452&amp;o= |title=Children's Games: Beds (Peever) |publisher=OurGlasgowStory |date=2005-01-17 |accessdate=2015-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131032230/http://www.ourglasgowstory.com/story.php?sid=48&amp;start=0&amp;end=14&amp;id=1075906452&amp;o= |archivedate=2013-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Escargot ===
A French variant of hopscotch is known as ''escargot'' (snail) or ''marelle ronde'' (round hopscotch). It is played on a spiral course. Players must hop on one foot to the center of the spiral and then reverse their path to back out again.

If the player reaches the center without stepping on a line or losing balance he or she marks one square with his or her initials, and from then on may place two feet in that square, while all other players must hop over it. The game ends when all squares are marked or no one can reach the center, and the winner is the player who "owns" the most squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supercooltoystore.com/game-guides/how-to-play-snail-hopscotch |title=Closed for Maintenance |publisher=Super Cool Toy Store |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104042224/http://www.supercooltoystore.com/game-guides/how-to-play-snail-hopscotch |archivedate=2015-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Himmel und Hölle ===
In [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]] the game is called ''Himmel und Hölle'' (Heaven and Hell) although there are also some other names used, depending on the region. The square below ''1'' or the ''1'' itself are called ''Erde'' (Earth) while the second to last square is the ''Hölle'' ([[Hell]]) and the last one is ''Himmel'' ([[Heaven]]). The first player throws a small stone into the first square and then jumps to the square and must kick the stone to the next square and so on, however, neither the stone nor the player may stop in ''Hell'' so they try to skip that square.

=== Kith-Kith ===
[[File:Filles jouant à la marelle, Jaura, Inde.jpg|thumb|left|Girls playing hopscotch, [[Jaora]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India.]]
In [[India]], hopscotch is also called ''Kith-Kith'', ''Stapu'',  in the Hindi-speaking areas, or ''Ekhaat Duhaat'' or ''Ekka Dukka'' in [[Bengal]],  ''Chirpi'' in [[Maharashtra]], Kunte bille in Karnataka, [[Paandi]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], and [[Tokkudu Billa]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. These games have similar principles in that players must hop on one foot and must throw the marker in the right square. The game is mostly common among girls in India, though some boys play too.

=== Potsy ===
Hopscotch was/is called Potsy in New York City. (The name probably refers to the "potsherd" that was used as a marker.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/potsy/ |title=The Big Apple: Potsy |publisher=Barrypopik.com |date=2005-03-07 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amarelinha ===
In Brazil, this game is called Amarelinha.

=== Australian Hop Scotch ===
In Australia, hopscotch is played in stages. The first stage is played by hopping per the standard rules. Once this stage is complete, the player is promoted to the next stage called "jumps" where the player jumps into each square with two feet. The final stage is the most difficult stage called "sizzles", which is similar to jumps except the legs are crossed. The first player to complete all three stages wins. If a player touches a line, he is demoted to the start of his current stage. For younger players, "helps" can be used. These are lines typically extended at the sides between squares 2 and 3 so younger players can use these to get closer to throwing the "tortoise " into the required square.

=== Rayuela ===
Is the name of the game, at least in Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay and Spain.

=== Chindro ===
Chindro is the South Asian version of hopscotch.[[File:ICKA.gif|100px|right|thumb|A Hungarian hopscotch version]]

==World record==
The current ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' holder for the fastest hopscotch game is [[Ashrita Furman]], at 1 minute and 8 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashrita.com/records/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413104156/http://www.ashrita.com/records/index.html|date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infotainment''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''information'' and ''entertainment''),&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/infotainment|title=the definition of infotainment|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called soft news, is a type of [[Electronic media|media]], usually television, that provides a combination of information and [[entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;Demers, David, "Dictionary of Mss Communication and Media Research: a guide for students, scholars and professionals," Marquette, 2005, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used disapprovingly against more serious hard news.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam- Webster, The Cambridge Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  Many existing, self-described infotainment [[website]]s and [[social media]] [[Mobile app|apps]] provide a variety of functions and services.&lt;ref&gt;"an extraordinary form of strategic internal communications" (infotainment.be) and historically accurate [[factoid]] collections (how-infotaining.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}            
The label "infotainment" is emblematic of concern and criticism that journalism is devolving from a medium which conveys serious information about issues affecting public interest, into a form of entertainment which happens to have fresh "facts" in the mix. The criteria by which [[reporter]]s and editors judge news value—whether something is worth putting on the front page, the bottom of the hour, or is worth commenting on at all—are integral parts of this debate. Some blame the media for this perceived phenomenon, for failing to live up to ideals of civic [[journalistic responsibility]], while others blame the [[commercialism|commercial]] nature of many media organizations, the need for higher ratings, combined with a preference among the public for feel-good content and "unimportant" topics such as [[celebrity]] [[gossip]] or sports.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In a critique of infotainment, Bonnie Anderson of ''News Flash'' cited a [[Cable News Network|CNN]] lead story on February 2, 2004 following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|exposure of Janet Jackson's breast]] on national television. The follow-up story was about a [[ricin]] chemical attack on then-[[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Bill Frist]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Bonnie M., "News Flash", Wiley 2004, p. 1, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialization process has also occurred, beginning with the rise of [[mass market]] special-interest magazines, moving into broadcast with the advent of [[cable television]], and continuing into new media such as the [[Internet]] and [[satellite radio]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} An increasing number of media outlets are available to the public which exclusively focus on single topics such as current events, home improvement, history, movies, women and Christianity. Consumers have a broad choice whether they receive a general feed of the most "important" information of the day or a highly customized presentation of a single type of content. Highly customized content streams may not be considered newsworthy nor contain a neutral point of view. Some publications and channels have found a sizable audience in the "niche" of featuring hard news.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Controversy has continued over the size of the audience and whether outlets are diluting content with too much "soft" news. The distinction between [[journalist]]s and anchors versus reporters are "[[human interest]]", personality, or celebrity news story pieces.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} ''Soft'' news reporters and stories are typically directed by marketing share departments based on a demographic appeal and audience share. It is commonly accepted news anchors are also media personalities which may also be considered celebrities. Media outlets commonly use on-air personalities for their public appeal to promote the network's investments similar to the regular broadcast schedule including self-promotion and advertising. Critics might go so far as to view anchors as a weak link, representing the misplacement of both the credit and the accountability of a news journalism organization&amp;mdash;hence adding to a perceived erosion of journalistic standards throughout the news business.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} (See [[yellow journalism]].)

Most infotainment television programs on [[Television network|networks]] and broadcast cable only contain general information on the subjects they cover and should not be considered to be formal learning or instruction.  An example of a broadcast may include [[Criminal accusation|accusation]]s of a celebrity or other individual committing a crime with no verifiable factual support or evidence of such claims. It can be said that many viewers and social critics disapprove of how media, particularly TV and cable, seem to hurtle from one event to another, often dwelling on trivial, celebrity-driven content &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media &amp; culture: An introduction to [[mass communication]]. Bedford/St.Martin’s, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As seen with the commodification celebrities and public figures/leaders, news media is more frequently commodifying and selling the stories of people’s lives for pure viewer reaction and entertainment as opposed to more focus being placed on real stories with informative meaning behind them.

In October 2010 at the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]], American political satirist [[Jon Stewart]] made a metaphorical statement regarding the media today: "The press can hold its magnifying glass up to our problems . . . illuminating issues heretofore unseen, or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected, dangerous flaming ant epidemic." This statement referred to the news media's ability to focus in on the real problems of people, and transform them into what is known as infotainment, when this information is solely provided for the public's entertainment. Today's broadcasting of informative news is often diluted with stories of scandal, although this is no concern for media and news broadcasters because if you can keep enough viewers week after week focused on whatever is that next "flaming ant epidemic" (e.g., a congressman’s sexual indiscretions, [[conspiracy theories]] about the president's birth certificate and other examples related to [[politainment]]), you can boost audience ratings and sell ads at higher rates&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media &amp; culture: An introduction to mass communication. Bedford/St.Martin’s, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For women ===
Historically, the term ''infotainment'' was used to discredit woman journalists who were assigned soft news jobs. Soft news was expected to be consumed by only women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HemsBuz3kqkC&amp;pg=PA534&amp;lpg=PA534&amp;dq=infotainment+women+journalists-Car.+-cars#v=onepage&amp;q=infotainment+women+journalists-Car.+-cars&amp;f=false|title=Portraits of American Women: From Settlement to the Present|first=G. J.|last=Barker-Benfield|date=16 October 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780195120486}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually, thanks to the presence of more women in the news force and the changing media landscape, it became the norm of news media in general.&lt;ref name="thecut.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/05/how-barbara-walters-invented-the-internet.html|title=How Barbara Walters Invented the Internet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==&lt;!-- Note: [[Hard news]] redirects here --&gt;

Some define "journalism" only as reporting on "serious" subjects, where common [[journalistic standards]] are upheld by the reporter. Others believe that the larger "news business" encompasses everything from professional journalism to so-called "[[soft news]]" and "infotainment", and support activities such as [[marketing]], [[advertising]] sales, finance and delivery. Nevertheless, a differentiation of the two concepts of "hard news" and "soft news" is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Reinemann, C., Stanyer, J., Scherr, S., &amp; Legnante, G. (2012). Hard and soft news: A review of concepts, operationalizations and key findings. Journalism, 13(2), 221-239. doi:10.1177/1464884911427803&lt;/ref&gt; Professional journalism is supposed to place more emphasis on [[research]], fact-checking, and the [[public interest]] than its "non-journalistic" counterparts.  Because the term "[[news]]" is quite broad, the terms "hard" and "soft" denote both a difference in respective standards for [[news value]], as well as for standards of conduct, relative to the professional ideals of [[journalistic standards|journalistic integrity]].

The idea of '''hard news''' embodies two [[orthogonal]] concepts:
* '''Seriousness:''' Politics, economics, crime, war, and disasters are considered serious topics, as are certain aspects of law, business, science, and technology.
* '''Timeliness:''' Stories that cover current events—the progress of a war, the results of a vote, the breaking out of a fire, a significant statement, the freeing of a prisoner, an economic report of note.
The logical opposite, '''soft news''' is sometimes referred to in a derogatory fashion as '''infotainment.'''
Defining features catching the most criticism include:
* '''The least serious subjects:''' Arts and entertainment, sports, lifestyles, "human interest", and celebrities.
* '''Not timely:''' There is no precipitating event triggering the story, other than a reporter's curiosity.

Timely events happen in less serious subjects—sporting matches, [[celebrity]] misadventures, movie releases, art exhibits, and so on.

There may also be serious reports which are not event-driven—coverage of important social, economic, legal, or technological trends— [[investigative reporting|investigative]] reports which uncover ongoing [[corruption]], [[pollution]], or immorality— or discussion of unsettled political issues without any special reason.  Anniversaries, holidays, the end of a year or season, or the end of the first 100 days of an administration, can make some stories time-sensitive, but provide more of an opportunity for reflection and analysis than any actual "news" to report.

The spectrum of "seriousness" and "importance" is not well-defined, and different media organizations make different tradeoffs.  "News you can use", a common marketing phrase highlighting a specific genre of journalism, spans the gray area.  Gardening tips and hobby "news" pretty clearly fall at the entertainment end.  Warnings about imminent natural disasters or acute domestic [[security threat]]s (such as air raids or terrorist attacks) are considered so important that broadcast media (even non-news channels) usually interrupt other programming to announce them.  A medical story about a new treatment for breast cancer, or a report about local [[ground water pollution]] might fall in between.  So might book reviews, or coverage of religion.  On the other hand, people frequently find hobbies and entertainment to be worthwhile parts of their lives and so "importance" on a personal level is rather [[subjectivity|subjective]].

Infotainment is generally identified by its entertaining nature through the use of flashy graphics, fast-paced editing, music,  and the use sensationalism or satire. Popular examples include ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and shows that would not be classified as news earlier, such as ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/infotainment|title=infotainment - television program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infotainers ===
'''Infotainers''' are entertainers in infotainment media, such as [[news presenter|news anchors]] or satirists who cross the line between journalism (quasi-journalism) and entertainment. [[Barbara Walters]], was for many an infotainer [[icon]]. She pioneered the many techniques used in the Infotainment media today.&lt;ref name="thecut.com"/&gt; Other notable examples in the U.S. media are [[Jon Stewart]], [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O’Reilly]], [[Rachel Maddow]] and [[Geraldo Rivera]] among others.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

When [[Geraldo Rivera]] became the host of his own news-oriented talk show on [[CNBC]], others within the NBC organization voiced their protest, including [[Tom Brokaw]] who was reported to have threatened to quit.  Rivera had a notorious history as a "sleaze reporter" and daytime [[talk show]] host, where he and one or two others were representative of "[[Tabloid talk show]]s"; television seen to have little social value or redeeming intelligence, but still popular with viewers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Commodification==

The broadcast of important or interesting events was originally meant simply to inform society of local or international events for their own safety and awareness. However, local news broadcasters are more regularly commodifying local events to provoke [[titillation]] and entertainment in viewers. [[Commodification]] is known as the process by which material objects are turned into [[marketable]] goods with monetary (exchange) value.&lt;ref&gt;Sturken &amp; Cartwright, 1980: p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Essential qualities of human beings and their products are converted into commodities, into things for buying and selling on the market,&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, T. M. The devil and commodity fetishism in South America. Chapel Hill (NC): America University of North Carolina Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; just as entertaining stories are sold to buy the attention of viewers.

Commodity fetishism is the process through which commodities are emptied of the meaning of their production (the labour that produced them and the context in which they were produced) and filled instead with the abstract meaning (usually through [[advertising]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sturken, M., and L. Cartwright. Practices of looking: An introduction to visual culture. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At their worst, the media's appetite for telling and selling stories leads them not only to document tragedy, but also to misrepresent or exploit it&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media &amp; culture: An introduction to mass communication. Bedford/St.Martin's, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As often seen in the news (with stories of extreme obesity or unusual deformities) present-day "infotainment" commodifies humans through their personal tragedies or [[scandal]]s, providing entertainment and titillation to public viewers.

==Social media implications==

The topic of news media today being more commonly considered “infotainment” has increased with the growing popularity and use of [[social media]] applications. These popular social media outlets are what German theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] would define as the "[[public sphere]]". According to Habermas, it defines a [[social space]] (which may be virtual) in which citizens come together to debate and discuss the present issues of their society. The term has been used more recently in the plural to refer to the multiple public spheres in which people debate contemporary issues.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the case of social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]], which were originally created for the purpose of connecting, re-connecting and sharing personal thoughts and information with public, they have now provided a new medium for the spread of "infotainment" and exploitation of public matters. There is no doubt that these social media websites are dominating, and what is so pressing about the matter is the fact that alongside cell phone technology, these ways of [[online communication]] are becoming prominent to the simple relaying of informative news. Of necessity, a commodity-based society produces such phantom [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]], and in so doing it obscures its roots.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, T. M. The devil and commodity [[fetishism]] in South America. Chapel Hill (NC): America University of North Carolina Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The public society are relying more frequently on [[television]] [[news broadcasting]] and now social media outlets to obtain a mixture of information and entertainment updates which are known as "infotainment."

==Origin==
The terms "infotainment" and "infotainer" were first used in September 1980 at the '''Joint Conference of Aslib''', the '''Institute of Information Scientists and the Library Association''' in [[Sheffield]], UK.  The Infotainers were a group of British information scientists who put on comedy shows at their professional conferences between 1980 and 1990.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  In 1983, infotainment began to see more popular usage &lt;ref name="dictionary.com"/&gt;
Around this time, infotainment gradually began to replace soft news with communications theorists.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

An earlier, and slightly variant term, "infortainment" was coined in 1974 as the title of the 1974 convention of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS), the association of college radio stations in the United States. It took place on April 5–7, 1974, at the Statler Hilton Hotel, now the Hotel Pennsylvania. It was defined as the "nexus between Information and Entertainment".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6127">'''''Isla presidencial''''' ({{lang-en|Presidential Island}}) is an [[Adult animation|adult]] [[web animation]] page from Venezuela. The [[political satire]] follows the heads of state of Latin America and Spain who are stranded on an island. The three seasons amassed more than 50 million views on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellick|first1=Adam B.|last2=Jensen|first2=Taige|last3=El-naggar|first3=Mona|title=How to Cope With Trump?

==Plot==
[[File:Ringtone-Isla-Inca 642.jpg|thumb|Scene from the episode "Inca Capai", from left to right, [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Evo Morales]], [[Lula da Silva]], [[Rafael Correa]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]].]]
Several presidents met at the 74º [[Ibero-American Summit]], and have a cruise after it. The cruise crashes with an iceberg, and all the presidents arrive at a desert paradise island. The episodes focus on their attempts to survive in the wild or escape from the island. Several presidents who were not included in the first episodes were added later, with a plane crash.

Hugo Chávez disappears from the island, kidnapped by [[Barack Obama]] for unmentioned reasons. A malfunctioning robot that impersonates Chávez leaves Obama's secret base, until he manages to turn him off. Many presidents died during an attack of "Chávez-raptors" (savage hybrid dinosaurs with the face of Chávez), and they are finally rescued at the end of the second season.

At the beginning of the third season, the presidents are stranded on another island free of dinosaurs. Several presidents were killed off in the second and third season (corresponding to the end of their terms in real life). The show parodies pop culture, such as ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]''

==Production==
Almost all of the characters were voiced by Emilio Lovera. The third season was released on ''NuevOn'', one of the [[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|YouTube Original Channels]].

==Reactions==
Hugo Chavez mentioned an episode of the series to Evo Morales in 2011, with [[ABC News]] quoting him: "You've got to see this show, Evo!" Chávez boomed to his staff, laughing about how Morales was left snoring while "Hugito" sang until sun-up. "They sound just like us!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=News|first1=A. B. C.|title=Venezuelan Comedians Seek Life After Chavez|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/venezuelan-comedians-seek-life-chavez/story?id=18766359|website=ABC News|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolás Maduro]], president of Venezuela, was portrayed as a man of limited intelligence, twisted speech, and capable of talking with birds. This is a reference to a comment made by Maduro during the 2013 elections in Venezuela, when he said that the late Chávez had reincarnated in a little bird and talked to him to bless his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/mundo/Maduro-pajarito-llegan-Isla-Presidencial_0_977902438.html|title= Maduro y su pajarito llegan a "La Isla Presidencial"|trans-title=Maduro and his bird arrive on "La Isla Presidencial"|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 20, 2013|work= |publisher= Clarín|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maduro criticized his portrayal in the animation. He said that it was not an accurate representation of his face, his moustache, of his voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cnnchile.com/noticia/2013/08/19/nicolas-maduro-hablo-sobre-su-llegada-a-isla-presidencial|title= Nicolás Maduro habló sobre su llegada a Isla Presidencial|trans-title=Nicolás Maduro spoke about his arrival to Isla Presidencial|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 19, 2013|work= |publisher= CNN Chile|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israel Exploration Society (''IES'')''' ([[Hebrew]]:החברה לחקירת ארץ ישראל ועתיקותיה - Hakhevra Lekhakirat Eretz Yisrael Va'atikoteha), originally the '''Jewish Palestine Exploration Society''', is a society devoted to [[History|historical]], [[Geography|geographical]] and [[Archaeology|archaeological]] research of the [[Land of Israel]]. The society was founded in 1914 with the object of studying the History and Civilization of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and of disseminating its knowledge.

==Overview==
The Israel Exploration Society plays a key role in archaeological research covering all periods, from prehistoric times to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period. It coordinates much of the multi-institutional archaeological research carried out by both Israeli and foreign archaeological expeditions in Israel. Major activities undertaken by the IES include organizing [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s, enlisting financial support for archaeological projects, publishing excavation reports and liaison and cooperation with Israeli and foreign institutions in the field of publication and in a collective effort to promote the cause of archaeology.

The IES is a [[non-profit organization]] governed by an Executive Committee and a Council comprising representatives from all of the institutes of archaeology in the Israel and several major archaeological [[museum]]s.

==History==
The Society’s activities were disrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]] but resumed in 1920, when it became known as the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society. During the period of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], it was responsible for the first archaeological excavations ever conducted by a Jewish organization in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], at [[Hamat Tiberias]], where  [[Nahum Slouschz]] discovered a synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;N. Slouschz, "Additional Notes on the Excavations at the Springs of Tiberias," Journal of the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society I/2-4 (1922-24): 49-51, Fig. 12 [Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies, Martin Goodman, Jeremy Cohen, David Jan Sorkin, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 826&lt;/ref&gt;Other digs were carried out at [[Yad Avshalom|Absalom’s tomb]], around [[Jerusalem's Old City walls]], [[Ramat Rachel]], [[Beit She'arim National Park|Beit She'arim]] and [[Tel Bet Yerah]].

Following Israel’s [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|War of Independence]], the IES received the first excavation permit issued by the Israeli government allowing it to excavate at [[Tell Qasile]]. Since then, the IES has organised and sponsored some of the most important archaeological projects carried out in the country including [[Tel Hazor]], [[Masada]], the excavations in [[Jerusalem]] near the [[Temple Mount]], in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and at the [[City of David]], the [[Judean Desert]] Expeditions, [[En-gedi|En-Gedi]], [[Tel Arad]], [[Lachish]], [[Aphek (biblical)|Aphek]], [[Jericho]], [[Herodium]], [[Tel Yokneam|Yoqneam]], [[Tel Dor|Dor]] and [[Tel Megiddo]].

Another facet of the IES’s activity is the dissemination of knowledge gained from the exploration of Israel to the general public in Israel and abroad. Fifty-nine archaeological conferences have been held for members of the IES. These annual gatherings include lectures by archaeologists and guided tours of recently discovered sites. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-speaking members receive the semi-annual ''Qadmoniot'', while the semi-annual ''[[Israel Exploration Journal]]'' caters for English readers. The ''[[Eretz Israel]]'' festschrift series publishes original archaeological, historical and geographical studies in Hebrew and English in honor of leading international scholars in these fields. Twenty-seven volumes have appeared to date.

The IES, in cooperation with other institutions, has held thirty annual meetings for the professional archaeological community in Israel. Two international congresses on [[Biblical archaeology]] were held in 1984 and 1990, attracting hundreds of participants from around the world. The proceedings of both have been published in two volumes entitled ''Biblical Archaeology Today''. In 1997 an international congress was held in Jerusalem marking 50 years since the discovery of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]]. The proceedings appear in the volume ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Fifty Years after their Discovery''.

Publications include ''The Ancient Pottery of Israel and Its Neighbors from the Neolithic through the Hellenistic Period'' prepared together with the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and the [[American Schools of Oriental Research|W.F. Albright Institute]]; and ''The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land'', which appeared in four-volume Hebrew and English editions in 1993.

==Awards==
In 1989, the Israel Exploration Society was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for its special contribution to society and the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1989 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashmag/Tashnab_Tashmag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashmat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citation of the judges’ committee notes: “It has been the principal and most effective institution for furthering knowledge of the archaeology and history of the country both at home and abroad since it was founded seventy-five years ago.”

[[Image:JohnnyKaw.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Statue of Johnny Kaw in [[Manhattan, Kansas]]]]
'''Johnny Kaw''' is a mythical [[Kansas]] settler and the subject of a number of [[Paul Bunyan]]-esque [[tall tale]]s about the settling of the territory.

The legend of Johnny Kaw was created in 1955 by George Filinger, a professor of horticulture at [[Kansas State University]], to celebrate the [[centennial]] of [[Manhattan, Kansas]].  The stories were initially printed in the city newspaper, ''The Manhattan Mercury'', during the centennial and later collected into a self-published book by Filinger, who created Kaw to be Kansas' answer to other heroes like Bunyan and [[Pecos Bill]].  Elmer Tomasch of the Kansas State University Art Department provided ink drawings to illustrate the stories and the book.

Fiilinger's stories related how Johnny Kaw created the Kansas landscape, geography and pioneer trails.  Kaw was said to have dug the [[Kansas River]] Valley, planted wheat, invented [[sunflower]]s, and grown giant potatoes.  Kaw even controlled the weather, lopping the funnels off tornadoes and wringing out the clouds to end droughts.  His pets were the mascots for the two state universities: a [[Kansas State Wildcats|wildcat]] and a [[Kansas Jayhawks|jayhawk]], who enjoyed a good fight.  The [[Dust Bowl]] was said to be a result of their fights.

Filinger's book was not republished after 1969, but Kansas author Jerri Garretson released a children's picture book about Johnny Kaw in 1997. Her book was illustrated by another KSU art instructor, Diane A. Dollar. A color edition of the book was published in September 2011 and the original B&amp;W version was included in the 2008 anthology, "Kansas Tall Tales."

==Statue==
A {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} statue of Johnny Kaw holding a [[scythe]] stands in the city park in Manhattan, Kansas {{nowrap|({{coord|39.1802|-96.5736|type:landmark_region:US-KS|display=inline|name=Johhny Kaw statue}})}}. It was constructed in 1966 at a cost of $7,000.  All materials and labor were donated, and contributions were made by local citizens who hoped that the statue would establish Johnny Kaw as a local legend and would prove to be a [[roadside attraction]].  The statue is constructed of concrete over a steel beam framework.  The design was intended to withstand wind and weather and be easy to maintain.

The statue was featured in a [[Zippy the Pinhead]] [[comic strip]] on September 17, 2005.

'''''Kaogu''''' ({{zh|c=考古|l=Archaeology}}) is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] monthly [[academic journal]] of [[Archaeology of China|Chinese archaeology]], published by the [[Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|Institute of Archaeology]] of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]].&lt;ref name=kaogu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/About_IA_CASS/Introduction/2013/1025/31855.html |title=Introduction of the Institute of Archaeology, CASS |date=2005-04-28 |publisher=Institute of Archaeology, CASS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The predecessor to what would become Kaogu was published from 1934-1937, with each issue containing only a couple of articles.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|title=《Archaeology》 Publishing report|url=http://oversea.cnki.net/kns55/oldNavi/n_YearStats.aspx?NaviID=48&amp;Flg=local&amp;BaseID=KAGU&amp;NaviLink=Search%3a%E8%80%83%E5%8F%A4-%2fkns55%2foldNavi%2fn_list.aspx%3fNaviID%3d48%26Field%3dcykm%24%25%2522%7b0%7d%2522%26selectIndex%3d0%26Value%3d%25e8%2580%2583%25e5%258f%25a4%7cArchaeology-%2fkns55%2foldNavi%2fn_item.aspx%3fNaviID%3d48%26Flg%3dlocal%26BaseID%3dKAGU|publisher=China Academic Journals Full-text Database|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest version of the journal was published in 1955,&lt;ref name=CNKI&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeology|url=http://oversea.cnki.net/kns55/oldNavi/n_item.aspx?NaviID=48&amp;Flg=local&amp;BaseID=KAGU&amp;NaviLink=Search%3a%E8%80%83%E5%8F%A4-%2fkns55%2foldNavi%2fn_list.aspx%3fNaviID%3d48%26Field%3dcykm%24%25%2522%7b0%7d%2522%26selectIndex%3d0%26Value%3d%25e8%2580%2583%25e5%258f%25a4%7cArchaeology|publisher=China Academic Journals Full-text Database|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it appeared irregularly until 1959. Regular publication was temporarily suspended between 1966–1971, during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Content==
The journal publishes summarized descriptions of excavations across China, but more recently research articles have also been included. Following cultural heritage laws, the work of foreigners on China must first be published in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and so ''Kaogu'' is also the main repository of data on international joint research between Chinese and non-Chinese that intensified in the 1990s. Most articles contain short English summaries.

Translator Chris Markham.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lycian language|Lycian]]: ''Khbide'';&lt;ref name=Adieg-mark762/&gt; [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|el|Καῦνος}}; {{lang-la|Caunus}}) was a city of ancient [[Caria]] and in [[Anatolia]], a few km west of the modern town of [[Dalyan]], [[Muğla Province]], [[Turkey]].

The Calbys river (now known as the Dalyan river) was the border between Caria and [[Lycia]]. Initially Kaunos was a separate state; then it became a part of Caria and later still of Lycia.

Kaunos was an important sea port, the history of which is supposed to date back till the 10th century BC. Because of the formation of [[İztuzu Beach]] and the silting of the former Bay of Dalyan (from approx. 200&amp;nbsp;BC onwards), Kaunos is now located about 8&amp;nbsp;km from the coast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Köyceğiz-Dalyan, a journey through history within the labyrinth of nature; Altan Türe; 2011; Faya Kültür Yayınları-1; {{ISBN|978-978-978-605-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city had two ports, the southern port at the southeast of ''Küçük Kale'' and the inner port at its northwest (the present ''Sülüklü Göl'', Lake of the Leeches). The southern port was used from the foundation of the city till roughly the end of the Hellenistic era, after which it became inaccessible due to its drying out. The inner or trade port could be closed by chains. The latter was used till the late days of Kaunos,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dalyan 2005 Gezi Kitabı/Travel book; Fatih Akaslan; {{ISBN|975-270-471-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the silting of the delta and the ports, Kaunos had by then long lost its important function as a trade port. After Caria had been captured by Turkish tribes and the serious [[malaria]] epidemic of the 15th century AD, Kaunos was completely abandoned.

In 1966 Prof. Baki Öğün started the excavations of ancient Kaunos. These have been continued up to the present day, and are now supervised by Prof. Cengiz Işık.

The archeological research is not limited to Kaunos itself, but is also carried out in locations nearby e.g. near the Sultaniye Spa where there used to be a sanctuary devoted to the goddess Leto.&lt;ref&gt;History surfaces from Köyceğiz Lake, Land of Lights, October 28th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
According to mythology Kaunos was founded by King [[Kaunos (mythology)|Kaunos]], son of the Carian King [[Miletus (mythology)|Miletus]] and [[Cyane|Kyane]], and grandson of [[Apollo]]. Kaunos had a twin sister by the name of [[Byblis]] who developed a deep, unsisterly love for him. When she wrote her brother a love letter, telling him about her feelings, he decided to flee with some of his followers to settle elsewhere. His twin sister became mad with sorrow, started looking for him and tried to commit suicide. Mythology says that the Calbys river emerged from her tears.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', 446 – 665&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Parthenius of Nicaea|Parthenius]], ''Love Romances'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The oldest find at the Kaunos archeological site is the neck of a [[Protogeometric]] [[amphora]] dating back to the 9th century BC, or even earlier. A statue found at the western gate of the city walls, pieces of imported [[Attic]] ceramics and the S-SE oriented city walls show habitation in the 6th century BC. However, none of the architectural finds at Kaunos itself dates back to earlier than the 4th century BC.

===First Persian rule===
Kaunos is first referred to by [[Herodotus]] in his book [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]. He narrates that the Persian general [[Harpagus]] marches against the Lycians, Carians and Kaunians during the Persian invasion of 546 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus I.171&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus writes that the Kaunians fiercely countered Harpagus' attacks but were ultimately defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus I.176&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the Kaunians themselves said they originated from [[Crete]], Herodotus doubted this.&lt;ref name="Herodotus I.172"&gt;Herodotus I.172&lt;/ref&gt; He thought it was far more likely that the Kaunians were the original inhabitants of the area because of the similarity between his own Carian language and that of the Kaunians. He added that there were, however, great differences between the lifestyles of the Kaunians and those of their neighbours, the Carians and Lycians. One of the most conspicuous differences being their social drinking behaviour. It was common practice that the villagers -men, women and children alike- had get-togethers over a good glass of wine.&lt;ref name="Herodotus I.172"/&gt;

Herodotus mentions that Kaunos participated in the [[Ionian Revolt]] (499–494 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus V.103&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important inscriptions in [[Carian language]] were found here, dating to c. 400 BC, including a [[bilingual inscription]] in Greek and Carian found in 1996. They helped to decipher the [[Carian alphabets]].&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio-Javier Adiego Lajara, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=alQqw2IxJO0C&amp;pg=PA3 ''The Carian Language''.] Volume 86 of Handbook of Oriental Studies. BRILL, 2006 {{ISBN|9004152814}} p3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek influences ===
After [[Xerxes I]] was beaten in the [[Second Persian War]] and the Persians were gradually withdrawn from the western Anatolian coast, Kaunos joined the [[Delian League]]. Initially they only had to pay 1 [[talent (measurement)|talent]] of tax, an amount that was raised by factor 10 in 425&amp;nbsp;BC. This indicates that by then the city had developed into a thriving port, possibly due to increased agriculture and the demand for Kaunian export articles, such as salt, salted fish, slaves, pine resin and black mastic – the raw materials for tar used in boat building and repair &lt;ref&gt;Ancient Caria: In the garden of the sun, CANAN KÜÇÜKEREN, Hürriyet Daily News, 28 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;– and dried figs. During the 5th and 4th centuries BC the city started to use the name Kaunos as an alternative for its ancient name Kbid, because of the increased [[Hellenistic]] influence. The myth about the foundation of the city probably dates back to this period.

=== Second Persian rule ===
After the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387&amp;nbsp;BC, Kaunos again came under Persian rule. During the period that Kaunos was annexed and added to the province of Caria by the Persian rulers, the city was drastically changed. This was particularly the case during the reign of the [[satrap]] [[Mausolos]] (377–353 BC). The city was enlarged, was modeled with terraces and walled over a huge area. The city gradually got a Greek character, with an [[agora]] and temples dedicated to Greek deities. [[Alexander the Great]]'s 334&amp;nbsp;BC brought the city under the rule of the [[Macedonian empire]].

=== Hellenistic period and Roman rule ===
After [[Death of Alexander the Great|Alexander's death]], Kaunos, due to its strategic location, was disputed among the [[Diadochi]], changing hands between the [[Antigonids]], [[Ptolemies]], and [[Seleucids]].

Because of differences between the Hellenistic kingdoms, the [[Roman Republic]] was able to expand its influence in the area and annex a considerable number of Hellenistic kingdoms. In 189&amp;nbsp;BC the [[Roman senate]] put Kaunos under the jurisdiction of Rhodes. At that time it was known as the [[Rhodian Peraia]].

In 167&amp;nbsp;BC this led to a revolt by Kaunos and a number of other cities in western Anatolia against Rhodes. As a result, Rome discharged Rhodes from its task. In 129&amp;nbsp;BC the Romans established the Province of Asia, which covered a large part of western Anatolia. Kaunos was near the edge of this province and was assigned to Lycia.

In 88&amp;nbsp;BC [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] invaded the province, trying to curb further expansion by the Romans. The Kaunians teamed up with him and killed all the Roman inhabitants of their city. After the peace of 85&amp;nbsp;BC they were punished for this action by the Romans, who again put Kaunos under Rhodian administration. During Roman rule Kaunos became a prospering sea port. The [[amphitheater]] of the city was enlarged and [[Roman baths]] and a [[palaestra]] were built. The agora fountain was renovated and new temples arose.

=== Byzantine era ===
[[File:Mozaïek bij de Koepelbasiliek.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Mosaics next to the domed Byzantine basilica]]Kaunos was [[christianized]] at an early date and when the [[Roman Empire]] officially adopted the [[Christian]] faith, its name changed into '''Caunos-Hegia'''.
 
=== Decline of Kaunos ===
From 625&amp;nbsp;AD onwards Kaunos was faced with attacks by Muslim Arabs and pirates. The 13th century brought invasions by Turkish tribes. Consequently, the old castle on the [[acropolis]] was fortified with walls, giving it a typical medieval appearance. In the 14th century the Turkish tribes had conquered part of Caria, which resulted in a dramatic decrease in sea trade.

The resulting economical slump caused many Kaunians to move elsewhere. In the 15th century the Turks captured the entire area north of Caria and Kaunos was hit by a [[malaria]] [[epidemic]]. This caused the city to be abandoned. The ancient city was badly devastated in an earthquake and gradually got covered with sand and a dense vegetation. The city was forgotten until the English archeologist [[Hoskyn]] found a law tablet, referring to the Council of Kaunos and the inhabitants of this city. Hoskyn visited the ruins in 1842 and brought the ancient city under the attention again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Kaunos was [[christianized]] at an early date and when the [[Roman Empire]] officially adopted the [[Christian]] faith, its name changed into Caunos-Hegia.

Residential [[Bishop]]s are known beginning from the 4th century. Four bishops are mentioned by [[Lequien]] :&lt;ref&gt;Le Quien,(I, 981)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Basil, who attended the [[Council of Seleucia]] in 359; 
*Antipater, who attended the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451; 
*Nicolaus, who subscribed the letter to [[Leo I (emperor)|Emperor Leo]] in 458; and 
*Stephanus, who attended the [[Second Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 787.

The ''[[Synecdemus]]'' of [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] and most ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'', as late as the 12th or 13th century, place it in [[Lycia]], as a suffragan of [[Myra]].&lt;ref name=CE&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03458c.htm Sophrone Pétridès, "Caunus" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main archeological sites ==
[[File:Een dalyan bij Kaunos.jpg|thumb|left|320px|The fishing weir at the foot of the Heraklion of Kaunos]]

Kaunos is a site that is interesting for both its archeological and ecological importance. Situated in the [[Köyceğiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area]], it offers outstanding vistas and is rich in wildlife. The ruins of the city are near [[Dalyan]], on the west bank of the ancient [[Kalbis]] river. The main sights at the archeological site itself are:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*The Acropolis (Persikon), situated on a 152&amp;nbsp;m high rock, fortified with [[Byzantine]] walls. The city's [[acropolis]] was called ''Imbros'' and it lay at the foot of Mount Tarbelos (present-day ''"Mount Ölemez"'').
:Adjacent to the acropolis is a smaller fortification, called Heraklion. Until the 5th century BC this 50&amp;nbsp;m high cape reached into sea and there were two ports south and north of it. From the Acropolis there is a stunning view of the ancient city, Dalyan, the Dalyan river, the estuary and [[İztuzu Beach]]. From the small fortification, you look down on a traditional ''dalyan'' (fishing weir) situated quite near the former southern port.
*The theater on the slope of the acropolis featuring both Hellenistic and Roman characteristics
:The theater has a diameter of 75&amp;nbsp;m and was built at a 27-degree angle. It had a capacity for 5000 spectators and is in a fairly good state. It is still occasionally used for performances.
*The palaestra with its [[Roman baths]], a [[wind measuring platform]] and a domed Byzantine [[basilica]]
:Archaeological research has shown that the palaestra was built over part of the old city that most probably had been a place of worship.
:The Roman baths served as a social meeting place and were meant to impress the Kaunians — by their sheer dimensions — of the power of the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine era the baths were dismantled and the [[frigidarium]] was re-used as a church. The wind-measuring platform dates back to 150&amp;nbsp;BC and was used for city planning. According to the archeologists Öğün and Işık, it must have consisted of a circular building with a base diameter of 15.80&amp;nbsp;m and a top diameter of 13.70&amp;nbsp;m. The building has collapsed, however, probably as a result of an earthquake. The measuring method is therefore not quite clear. In his ''[[De architectura]]'' the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] stated that wind-measuring platforms were used to plan streets in accordance with the prevailing wind direction, in order to keep the air in cities clean. The domed Byzantine basilica on the palaestra terrace dates back to the 5th century AD. It was made with building materials taken from previous buildings on a foundation belonging to a 4th-century building that was probably also used as a place of worship. The archeologist team think that its inner walls were plastered and decorated with [[frescoes]]. The domed basilica is the only remaining Byzantine edifice in Kaunos that still stands. Next to the basilica [[mosaic]]s have been uncovered.
*The  port agora, the [[stoa]] and the [[nymphaeum]]
:The port agora is located at the flat area in front of Sülüklü Lake. It dates back to the 4th century BC and kept its function as an economic, political and social meeting place until the end of the Roman era. The remains of pedestals indicate that there must have been many (bronze) statues of influential Romans, but these have not been found. Most likely these were melted down in the Byzantine era, for the archeologists found a smelting furnace of that period near to the pedestal of a bronze equestrial statue of the Roman governor of Asia, [[Lucius Licinius Murena]]. The covered stoa at the north side of the agora offered sun and rain protection. The stoa was created in the early Hellenistic era (3rd century BC), but part dates to the early Roman era. The Nympheon is also Hellenistic, but the fountain basin was extended during the Roman era. Inscriptions from the period of [[Emperor Hadrian]] reveal that the toll for merchants and boat owners was relaxed to compensate for the gradually silting port.
*The temples
:Six temples have been excavated, two of Hellenistic and four of Roman origin. Probably the terrace temple of the 3rd century BC facing a circle of columns has the greatest appeal. Inside the circle an obelisk has been found, which is also depicted on old Kaunian coins. The obelisk was the symbol of king Kaunos, who according to mythology established the ancient city bearing his name.

[[File:Turkey.ancient.tombs.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Kaunian rock tombs in Hellenistic style]]

Outside the official Kaunos archeological site, there are:
*Six rock tombs on the Dalyan river (4th – 2nd century BC), which are Dalyan's prime sight
:The façades of the rock tombs resemble the fronts of Hellenistic temples with two [[Ionic order|Ionian]] pillars, a triangular [[pediment]], an [[architrave]] with toothed [[frieze]]s, and [[acroterion]]s shaped like palm leaves.
*The Kaunos city walls
:The spectacular Kaunos city walls were erected during the reign of Mausolos in the 4th century BC. They are extraproportional in relation to the size of Kaunos and its population, presumably because the satrap had high expectations of the city's future as a marine and commercial port. The city walls start west of the inner port and run along the hills N and NW of the city, to the top of the steep cliff opposite Dalyan centre. There is a walking track along the wall, starting at the Çandır water station. The regularly-shaped rectangular blocks and the way the blocks have been positioned give a fine impression of Hellenistic building techniques. Parts of the wall are well-kept, other parts have been taken down and rebuilt.
*The [[niche tomb]]s at the port of Çandır
:Kaunos is surrounded by ancient [[necropolis|necropoli]], because the ancient Greeks and Romans always buried their deceased at considerable distance from their homes. The niche tombs were the most common ones. The ashes of the deceased were put in urns and then placed in a niche. At the port of Çandır, some km beyond the archeological site of Kaunos, there are tens of niche tombs hewn from the rock of Kızıltepe.

The '''killer ape theory''' or '''killer ape hypothesis''' is the theory that [[war]] and interpersonal [[aggression]] was the driving force behind [[human evolution]]. It was originated by [[Raymond Dart]] in the 1950s; later it was developed further in ''[[African Genesis]]'' by [[Robert Ardrey]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Ardrey"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Ardrey| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Ardrey
| title = African Genesis: A Personal Investigation Into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man
| year = 1961 | publisher = [[Atheneum Books]]| location = New York

| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Yg1AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory, the ancestors of humans were distinguished from other [[primate]] species by their greater aggressiveness and this aggression remains within humanity, which retains many [[murder]]ous instincts.

The theory gained notoriety for suggesting that the urge to do [[violence]] was a fundamental part of human [[psychology]]. The [[hunting hypothesis]] is often associated with the theory, because of similarities and because Robert Ardrey has developed both.

==Definition==
The expression ''killer ape'' does not mean an outstanding aggressive kind of ape; in fact the term refers to anthropological analysis of human aggression. Accordingly, the killer ape is a notably belligerent species on which our instincts might be rooted, because this very ancestor could establish itself due to its special aggression.

As founder of this thesis, [[Raymond Dart|Raymond A. Dart]] (1893–1988) dealt with this issue in his professional article ''The predatory transition from ape to man'', 1953.&lt;ref name="Dart"&gt;{{cite journal

==The predatory transition from ape to human==

===The step from ape to human===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] refers to the Australian anatomist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871–1937), a specialist in anthropology.

The question is what exactly caused the evolutionary step from ape to human. Basically, there are three versions: the increase of brain size, the acquisition of speech, or upright posture. [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Smith]] excludes this last option; otherwise the traditional erect gibbon would be a possible ancestor of humans. For him, the most relevant differentiator was the bigger brain. It would have made the bipedal movement possible and would have accelerated the enlargement through common use of its hands, which are no longer needed for locomotion.

Until [[Raymond Dart]] found the [[Australopithecus africanus]] (1925a), this controversial problem could not be solved.

===The "Taung Child"===
This approximately 2.5 million year old cranial bone, also known as “[[Taung Child]]”, was a first proof of bipedal apes. [[Robert Broom]] (1866–1951), primarily a Scottish physician, who spent his life as an archeologist in Australia since 1892, agreed to this statement, too. Five years later he decided to spend the rest of his life in South Africa. His excavations from 1946 pointed into the same direction, when he also discovered bones from the [[Australopithecus africanus]].

However, further examinations showed that, in these cases, the size of the brain was not to be equated with the evolution’s level. In fact, it is much more popular to connect the accomplishment of more and more complex movements directly with an evolutionary response, which caused the brain to grow.

Both [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Broom|Broom]], as well as [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), agreed that this new type of locomotion brought a remarkable advantage in comparison to other co-specifics, to rival animals or to the quarry.

===The findings of Makapan===
Osseous findings at a limestone cave located in Makapan, South-Africa, led to the question to what extent this advantage, in combination with a more and more improved skill using tools, affected the behavior of the apes.

These findings showed explicit cracks and fractures, which are likely to be done on purpose. Additionally, there were clubs, bludgeons and spears formed by the long limb bones or the horns of antelopes. This new special weapon leaves small punctured, round, and triangular holes in skulls, depending on how it was formed.

This new development in building weapons shows a clear increase concerning the aggression of the animals.

===The "proto-men"===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] carries that issue to extremes and equips this new type of ‘carnivorous and killing’ apes (“proto-men” in his own words) with weapons. Furthermore, he describes them as organized in a tribe, so they were able to hunt bigger animals. The ability of making fire and remarkable social skills prompt [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] to bring them more in line with humans.

Observations from Sgt. H. B. Potter (Zululand, South Africa) show that this kind of development is still up to date as it is mentioned in ''The predatory transition from ape to man'' by [[Raymond Dart]].&lt;ref name="Dart"/&gt; He describes a pride of baboons that hunts antelopes. Indeed, he admits that this depends on seasonal circumstances, because nutrition was rare. Nevertheless, he proves explicit behavior.

===The eating habits===
Concerning the eating habits from then until now, [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] argues that there has always been an ambition to eating meat: grubs and insects, bigger mammals and even human flesh (i.e. distinctive [[cannibalism]]) are the results.

A deficit from “animal proteins” has to be compensated, so consuming meat is essential to survive.

==Reception==
The comment written by the editor of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] article Dr. Alan H. Kelso shows how few scientists accepted the new ideas of [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]]. Not only did Dart require a long time to publish his work, but also the epilogue contains notices like: “Professor Dart’s thesis that the South African apemen, at the stage they were found, were omnivorous, must be considered as proven. Of course, they were only the ancestors of the modern Bushmen and Negroes, and of ''nobody else''.”

Another obvious piece of evidence would be the rejection of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] thesis by a scientific convention at [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] ([[Zambia]], Southern Africa), which led [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]] into writing his book ''African Genesis''. He felt himself forced to defend the opinion of his mentor.

The ethologist [[Konrad Lorenz]] also showed interest in similar ideas, in his book ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Lorenz"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Lorenz | first = Konrad | authorlink = Konrad Lorenz
| title = On Aggression
| year = 1966 | publisher = [[Methuen Publishing]] | location = London

| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rIVK7wuY3kIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction he describes rival butterfly fish defending their territory, leading him to raise the question of whether humans, too, tend to intraspecific conflict.

The [[Seville Statement on Violence]], released under US auspices in 1986, rejected violence and in particular [[warfare]] as genetically determined.

A 2008 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Dan Jones stated that "A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought." Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the [[Cinderella effect]]). [[Chimpanzee]]s have violence between groups which have similarities to raids and violence between human groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for human non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower among humans living in small group societies than among chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between [[ingroup and outgroup]] which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies. This suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced [[blood feud]]s due to better functioning [[justice system]]s may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = D. | title = Human behaviour: Killer instincts | doi = 10.1038/451512a | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7178 | pages = 512–515 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18235473| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that man is naturally warlike has been refuted in for example the book ''War, Peace, and Human Nature'' (2013), edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]].&lt;ref name=Haas&amp;Piscitelli&gt;See for example Jonathan Haas and [[Matthew Piscitelli]] (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/2968441/The_Prehistory_of_Warfare_Misled_by_Ethnography?login=&amp;email_was_taken=true "The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography"] In War, Peace, and Human Nature edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]], pp. 168-190. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in fiction==
Movies such as ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) show that this issue affected common people, too. In fact, it’s based on [[Pierre Boulle]]’s novel of the same title, but the content is almost similar to the topic.

This theory can be seen in the opening sequence of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and also appears in the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', which made extensive use of the killer ape theory in storyline arcs involving the Kromaggs.  (The names of ''Dart'' and ''[[Ardrey]]'' were combined by the professor Arturo character in the series into "''Drayer''" who purportedly came up with his world's "killer ape theory".)

'''''Lacanian Ink''''' is a cultural journal based in New York City and founded in the Autumn of 1990 by [[Josefina Ayerza]] to provide the American intellectual scene with the theoretical perspective of European [[post-structuralism]]. It features major analyses of [[psychoanalytic theory]], poetry, philosophy and contemporary art. A distinctive element of its contents is the dissemination of the work of French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], whereby the seminars given by [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] at Paris VIII on Lacanian theory have become available in English. 

[[Richard Kostelanetz]] in his book ''The Decline and Fall of a Soho Art Community'' notes that ''Lacanian Ink'', together with a number of other journals involved in contemporary culture, have been witnesses to the century's last decade phenomena. "Today, there are but three of these magazines that continue... ''Bomb Magazine'' and ''Lacanian Ink'' are two of them."{{cn|date=March 2013}}

==History==
From its inception Slovene philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] joined the editorial board bringing out first drafts of his books in the magazine; since then, he has been published in ''Lacanian Ink'' regularly. He aptly expressed the axiom guiding the work of ''Lacanian Ink'': "By rejecting the assertion of identities associated with [[cultural studies]] ''Lacanian Ink'' outlines a new philosophical universalism." In 2000 French philosopher [[Alain Badiou]] joined the editorial board with specialized writing on Lacanian theory and the European [[Marxist]] tradition.

In 1997, ''Lacan dot com'' became the official site for ''Lacanian Ink'', integrating the texts of its various theorists with an extensive special section on contemporary artists. Notably, the archives of the site, include a wide variety of articles and essays by Slavoj Žižek, [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and Alain Badiou, as well as by modern French theorists.

===One: Hache===
Published in 2008

After years of incessant fighting, the war between humanity and the High Beasts is brought to an end after the humans begin using [[firearms]], forcing the comparatively primitive High Beasts to declare a truce. It is decided that an interspecific marriage be formed between Aube, the daughter of the human nobleman Arcan, and Loup-de-Feu, the son of the Beast Lord Loup-de-Traille. Aube is not pleased with the arrangement, believing that the product of such a union would be a [[blasphemy]]. When the time comes to consummate the marriage, Aube's brother Saliat assassinates Loup-de-Feu, and escapes with his sister while the High Beasts declare the truce null. After the High Beasts indulge in a slaughter, Arcan is approached by Griffe-Tout, a lynx who offers to give him information on his daughter on the condition that he sacrifice a pound of his own flesh to him. He reveals that Saliat has been killed by the High Beasts, while Aube escaped to the Wood of Virgins, an area from only [[virgin]]s can come out alive.
[[Image:Les Betes Haute.jpg|thumb|The High-Beasts advance against human forces]]
Years later, the war between the two races has reached a [[stalemate]], with neither side gaining advantage over the other. Though the humans are technologically superior, the High Beasts are physically stronger, more numerous, and have faster growth rates, thus allowing troops to be replenished quicker. In order to break the stalemate, the humans send an envoy, Hugo, to find the banished Lord Clam, who is a famed wolf killer. Under similar orders from his own superior officer, Loup-de-Traille reluctantly accepts to find his eldest and most skilled son, Loup-Gris whom he previously disowned for having married a fox. Loup-de-Traille discovers that his son now has two hybrid children, and refuses to involve himself in the war. Suspecting that his son's wife Lady Goupil has softened him, Loup-de-Traille leaves heavy hearted. Along the way, he finds a band of human bandits attacking a group of foxes. Loup-de-Traille intervenes, but is decapitated by the bandit leader. His body is found by Griffe-Tout and his band of lynxes, and is taken to his son, who decides to form an alliance of High and Low Beasts in order to defeat the human forces. Meanwhile, Hugo discovers a delirious human soldier covered in plant-like growths. Hugo takes him to a monastery, where it is discovered that he found Aube in the Wood of Virgins. The abbot of the monastery reveals himself to be the disgraced Arcan, who offers to aide in the war effort on condition that his daughter be found and returned to him. Hugo crosses a cursed swamp filled inhabited by tree spirits, and finds Clam in a Church, taking a sacrament. The two depart to the Wood of Virgins.

==Single surname==
Although the term "maternal surname" can be confused with "matriname", there is a difference in [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cultures, where the ''maternal'' surname is the mother's patriname. In addition, in some cultures, women inherit a surname from their mother as well as from their father.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} {{Which one|date=December 2017}}In such patrilineal cultures, matrinames are able to co-exist with patrinames.

For example, where matrinames exist, they are passed from mother to child along with [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA). Similarly, where patrinames exist, they are passed from father to son along with [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] DNA ([[Y-DNA]]). Within a patrilineal culture, if any group of women sharing mtDNA (from their common mother-line ancestor) was to choose a surname and then hand it down to successive generations, by definition, that surname would become a matrilineal surname or matriname within a patrilineal culture.&lt;ref name="sykes" /&gt; The test of whether a particular surname is a matriname is to determine if it is being handed down from mother to daughter in a ''matriline''.

The usual lack of matrinames to hand down in patrilineal cultures makes ''traditional [[genealogy]]'' more difficult in the mother-line case than in the normal (father-line) case.&lt;ref name=sykes/&gt; After all, ''father-line'' surnames originated partly "to identify" individuals "clearly" and [[Surname#History|were adopted]] partly "for administrative reasons";{{efn|For a more complete historical background, see {{section link|Surname|History}}.}} and these ''patrinames'' help in searching for facts and documentation from centuries ago. Patrinames are stable ''identity-surnames'', surnames which identify an individual, whether now or in the past or future; and matrinames similarly are ''identity-surnames'' for women.

In the 1979 "Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women," or [[CEDAW]], the UN officially adopted a provision, item (g) of CEDAW's Article 16, to the effect that women and men, and specifically wife and husband, shall have the same rights to choose a "family name", as well as a "profession" and an "occupation".&lt;ref&gt;UN Convention, 1979. "[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]", or CEDAW. Archived at WebCite [https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm] on 1 Apr 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These three rights are only a small part of the document's long list of rights related to [[gender equality]] meant to ensure women have equal opportunities to men. However, according to the article, the United States has not yet ratified this UN Convention or the multilateral treaty.

In non-discriminating states, women may eventually gain the same right to their own matriname as men have traditionally had (within father-line cultures) to their own patriname. And similarly, within mother-line or matrilineal cultures, men may gain the right to their own patriname. In other words, the ''handing down of both'' matrinames and patrinames would co-exist within each culture to avoid discriminating against either women or men. (Note that some cultures have ''no'' [[surnames]]{{snd}} but if a culture has surnames then in this regard a non-discriminating culture would be a both-lines [mother-line and father-line] or [[ambilineal]] culture.)

The actual use of a matriname would involve, first, invention or choice of a name by a group of women who share mtDNA (from their common matriline ancestor)&lt;ref name="sykes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, Una (1977). ''Mrs Man''. San Francisco: Germainbooks. {{ISBN|0-914142-02-X}}; pp. 334–37. &lt;/ref&gt; and then using it in their daughters' [[birth record]]s (or [[birth certificate]]s).

This use of the mother's matriname would be parallel to and symmetric with the normal use of the father's patriname in each new son's birth record. Note well; this ''is'' the above-mentioned "handing down of both" the matriname and the patriname.

It should be mentioned that the ''patriname'' is normally a single surname, like Smith or Jones, normally not a double surname like Smith-Jones or Smith Jones.{{efn|name=2patri|By reading within the [[Family name]] article, one notices that the single-surname (or patriname) is indeed used as the identity-surname, such as Smith or Jones, and that the double-surname Smith-Jones ''is'' normally used as ''two'' patrinames. Similarly one notices that patrinames normally are not changed.}} And, just as men normally do not change their patriname,{{efn|name=2patri}} so also women would normally not change their matriname. Thus, both identity-surnames should be equally stable over the generations.&lt;ref name=sykes/&gt;

Note that one's birth surname is one's ''legal surname'', unless one changes the latter{{snd}} such as in some purely patrilineal cultures where women traditionally change to their husband's patriname at marriage, as described in [[Married and maiden names]] and in [[Name change]].

Here is a specific example to illustrate and summarize these concepts: the father and sons in a [[nuclear family]] have the very-familiar patriname ''Smith'' while the mother and daughters have the matriname ''Momline'' as their own (and thus equally stable) identity-surname.

==Double surname==
The 4 '''double surname''' possibilities which combine a matriname with a patriname, in either order, and with or without a hyphen, and which thus provide the aforementioned "gender symmetry", are as follows: matriname patriname, matriname-patriname, patriname matriname, and patriname-matriname. The patrilineal surname or patriname that is received from the mother in patrilineal cultures does not qualify as a matriname, as stated in the preceding section.

3 of the 4 possibilities enumerated above are used together in the example below. Such conventions of double surnames were proposed&lt;ref name=sykes /&gt; in ''[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]'', and an English family with the matriname "Phythian" actually used one of them, as demonstrated and discussed in an online "feature" article.&lt;ref name="dblname"&gt;Sarah Louisa Phythian-Adams, 20 Aug. 2008. "[http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2008/08/in_the_name_of In the Name of...] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc1oy0QR?url=http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2008/08/in_the_name_of|date=2011-04-01}}", an ''TheFWord.org'' featured article by the author. (To find the family tree etc. of this pioneering matriname double-surname case, search the ''article'' for the word "proposal".) Archived at WebCite [https://www.webcitation.org/5xc1oy0QR?url=http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2008/08/in_the_name_of] on 1 Apr 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a hypothetical example of these double surnames, let the matrinames be "Mamaname" and "Momline" and the patrinames be "Smith" and "Jones". The mother, with birth double surname "'''Momline'''-Jones", and the father, with birth double  surname "Mamaname '''Smith'''", both choose to retain their birth double surnames unchanged throughout their lives and agree in some wise to denominate all of their daughters and sons with the birth double surname "Smith Momline": The mother hands down her matriname and, symmetrically, the father hands down his patriname. All of their sons have the Y-DNA of and, accordingly, the patriname "Smith" of their patriline, while all of the daughters have both the mtDNA of and, accordingly, the matriname "Momline" of their matriline.&lt;ref name=sykes/&gt;&lt;ref name=dblname/&gt; (Note that most societies give all children of a family the same surname, as in this example.) Thus, each person has only one identity-surname, which in this example is either "Momline" or "Smith". The identity-surname of each is stable throughout life{{efn|name=2patri}} and always half of whatever double surname(s) he or she assumes throughout life, including at birth and marriage(s).

The family in this hypothetical example could choose to adopt a convention, given its 3 co-existing surnames "Momline-Jones", "Mamaname Smith", and "Smith Momline", of all members using only one family "usage name" in daily social life. Possible samples of this family's usage name might be any one of its 3 co-existing double surnames; one of its identity-surnames "Momline" or "Smith"; or an invented surname, e. g., "Momith", which combines "Momline" and "Smith".&lt;ref name=MrsMan &gt; Stannard 1977; pp. 334–37 on actual invented surnames and pp. 84–88 on double surnames.&lt;/ref&gt; Single surname families could use such usage names also. There is some relevant discussion in this footnote.{{efn|Not only this double-surname family, but also its ''single surname'' version at the end of the previous section might both somehow choose to use a ''single'' name as a ''usage name'', whether "Momline", "Smith", "Momith", or another invented single surname. In principle, any new friends have no way of knowing whether either of the family's surnames are actually single or double. These 2 cases would look the same to all others{{snd}} except someone handling their legal documents.}} This family's 3 surnames, however, ''should'' be used in their respective members' personal legal documents, and could also be used otherwise such as in the respective members' personal profession/vocation.

Rather than keeping their own birth or legal surnames, the parents in this example might prefer ''at marriage'' to change their surnames to "Smith Momline", the same as their children-to-be, so that the members of their nuclear family would all share this one surname.

Of course, one's own identity-surname (here, the matriname "Momline" or the patriname "Smith") would always be available as one's own usage name, such as in one's profession/vocation.

This double surname example should be compared with its single surname counterpart at the end of the preceding section.

In toto, the gender-symmetric single surnames presented in the preceding section have the advantage of being simpler and briefer, but if used alone, would give ''different'' surnames for members of the different genders in a nuclear family. In contrast, all of the children in a nuclear family would have the ''same double'' surname. Also, these double surnames would ''record'' on legal documents both the matriname and patriname, with ''both'' identity-surnames later aiding ''each'' gender in genealogy and other searches of historical records.&lt;ref name=sykes /&gt;&lt;ref name=dblname /&gt;&lt;ref name=MrsMan /&gt;

'''Mazı Underground City''' is an ancient [[underground settlement]] in [[Cappadocia]] in central [[Turkey]]. It is located 18 [[kilometers]] from [[Ürgüp]] and 10 kilometers east from the [[Kaymaklı Underground City]].&lt;ref name=cappadociaturkey&gt;{{cite web|title=Mazi village underground city|url=http://www.cappadociaturkey.net/mazi_village_underground_city.htm|website=Cappadocia Turkey|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is one of many subterranean cities in Cappadocia including [[Özkonak]], [[Derinkuyu]] and Kaymaklı.

== History ==
The ancient name of the city was known as Mataza. The presence of the city dates back to as early as the Roman period. The city contains tombs dating back to the early Roman period and also contains aspects of the [[Byzantium]] period.&lt;ref name=cappadociaturkey/&gt;

== Description ==
Mazi is carved to the west of the village perpendicular to the valley slope. It contained four different access points for entrance and exit to the city which all lead to a central hall. The main entrance to the city is made of millstone in which a stone could be rolled over and used to cover the entrance.&lt;ref name=uniassignment&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Cappadocia In Relation To Their Respective Architecture History Essay|url=http://www.uniassignment.com/essay-samples/history/ancient-cappadocia-in-relation-to-their-respective-architecture-history-essay.php|website=Uni Assignment|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture includes steep tunnels networking between corridors. Within the city, areas were provided to serve as barns, with each area designated for different specialties. The space inside the city also contained a winery between the areas served as barns. In order for the winery to obtain grapes, there was a chimney which led to the surface and allowed grapes to fall down into.&lt;ref name=uniassignment/&gt; Additionally, the city contains a church which can be accessed via a short corridor.

The doctrine of '''mental reservation''', or of '''mental equivocation''', was a special branch of [[casuistry]] (case-based reasoning) developed in the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], and most often associated with the [[Jesuits]].

==Secular use==
Mental reservation is a form of [[deception]] which is not an outright [[lie]]. It was argued for in [[moral theology]], and now in [[ethics]], as a way to fulfill obligations both to tell the truth and to keep secrets from those not entitled to know them (for example, because of the [[Seal of the Confessional and the Catholic Church|seal of the confessional]] or other clauses of [[confidentiality]]). Mental reservation, however, is regarded as unjustifiable without grave reason for withholding the truth. This condition was necessary to preserve a general idea of [[truth]] in social relations.

In '''wide mental reservation''', [[equivocation]]s and [[amphibology|amphibologies]] are used to imply an untruth that is not actually stated. In '''strict mental reservation''', the speaker mentally adds some qualification to the words which they utter, and the words together with the mental qualification make a true assertion in accordance with fact.

A frequently cited example of equivocation is a well-known incident from the life of [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. When [[Julian the Apostate]] was seeking Athanasius's death, Athanasius fled Alexandria and was pursued up the [[Nile]]. Seeing the imperial officers were gaining on him, Athanasius took advantage of a bend in the river that hid his boat from its pursuers and ordered his boat turned around. When the two boats crossed paths, the Roman officers shouted out, asking if anyone had seen Athanasius. As instructed by Athanasius, his followers shouted back, "Yes, he is not very far off." The pursuing boat hastily continued up the river, while Athanasius returned to Alexandria, where he remained in hiding until the end of the persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Henry Newman]]. [http://www.newmanreader.org/works/apologia65/noteg.html ''Apologia pro Vita Sua'', Note G: Lying and Equivocation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another anecdote often used to illustrate equivocation concerns [[Francis of Assisi]]. He once saw a man fleeing from a murderer.  When the murderer then came upon Francis, he demanded to know if his quarry had passed that way. Francis answered, "He did not pass this way," sliding his forefinger into the sleeve of his [[cassock]], thus misleading the murderer and saving a life.&lt;ref&gt;Zagorin, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this anecdote is cited by the [[canonist]] [[Martin de Azpilcueta]] to illustrate his doctrine of a mixed speech (''oratoria mixta'') combining [[speech]] and [[gestural]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin de Azpilcueta]] Azpilcueta, Martin, (Navarra), ''Commentarius in cap. Humanae Aures, XXII. qu. V. De veritate responsi; partim verbo expresso, partim mente concepti. &amp; de arte bona &amp; mala simulandi'', Roma, 1584. Quoted by J.-P. Cavaillé, ''[http://dossiersgrihl.revues.org/document281.html Ruser sans mentir, de la casuistique aux sciences sociales : le recours à l’équivocité, entre efficacité pragmatique et souci éthique]'', published in [[Serge Latouche]], P.-J. Laurent, O. Servais &amp; M. Singleton, ''Les Raisons de la ruse. Une perspective anthropologique et psychanalytique'', Actes du colloque international « La raison rusée », Louvain la Neuve, mars 2001, Paris, La Découverte, 2004, p. 93&amp;ndash;118 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible contains a good example of equivocation. [[Abraham]] was married to Sarah/Sarai, his half-sister by a different mother. Fearing that as he traveled people would covet his beautiful wife and as a result kill him to take her, he counselled her to agree with him when he would say that "she is my sister." This happened on two occasions, first with the [[Pharaoh]] of Egypt, told in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12:11-13, and second, with a king called Abimelech in Gen 20:12.

==''Mentalis restrictio'' in moral theology==
The 16th-century Spanish theologian [[Martin de Azpilcueta]] (often called "Navarrus" because he was born in the Kingdom of [[Navarre]]) wrote at length about the doctrine of ''mentalis restrictio'' or mental reservation. Navarrus held that mental reservation involved truths "expressed partly in speech and partly in the mind," relying upon the idea that God hears what is in one's mind while human beings hear only what one speaks. Therefore, the Christian's moral duty was to tell the truth to God. Reserving some of that truth from the ears of human hearers was moral if it served a greater good. This is the doctrine of '''strict mental reservation'''. A user of the doctrine could reply aloud "I know not" to a human interlocutor, and "to tell you" silently to God, and still be telling the truth (''stricte mentalis'').

Traditionally, the doctrine of mental reservation was intimately linked with the concept of [[equivocation]], which allowed the speaker to employ double meanings of words to tell the ''literal'' truth while concealing a deeper meaning. Navarrus, however, went beyond this, giving the doctrine of mental reservation a far broader and more liberal interpretation than had anyone up to that time. Although some other Catholic theological thinkers and writers took up the argument in favor of strict mental reservation, the concept remained controversial within the Roman Catholic Church, which never officially endorsed or upheld the doctrine and eventually condemned it.

The linked doctrines of mental reservation and equivocation became notorious in England during the [[Elizabethan era]] and the [[Jacobean era]], when Jesuits who had entered  England to minister to the spiritual needs of Catholics were captured by the authorities. The Jesuits [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]] (c. 1561&amp;ndash;1595) (who was also a poet of note) and [[Henry Garnet]] (1555&amp;ndash;1606) both wrote treatises on the topic, which was of far more than academic interest to them. Both risked their lives bringing the sacraments to [[recusancy|recusant]] Catholics&amp;nbsp;— and not only ''their'' lives, since sheltering a priest was a capital offence.&lt;ref name=Kaveny&gt;Cathleen Kaveny. [http://www.faqs.org/periodicals/201001/1938473571.html "Truth or Consequences: In Ireland, Straying Far from the Mental Reservation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807064945/http://www.faqs.org/periodicals/201001/1938473571.html |date=2010-08-07 }}. ''Commonweal'', January 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1586, [[Margaret Clitherow]] had been [[peine forte et dure|pressed]] to death for refusing to enter a plea on the charge of harbouring two priests at York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/york-margaret-clitherow-shrine.htm Margaret Clitherow Shrine, York].&lt;/ref&gt; When caught, tortured and interrogated, Southwell and Garnet practiced mental reservation not to save themselves&amp;nbsp;— their deaths were a foregone conclusion&amp;nbsp;— but to protect their fellow believers.&lt;ref name=Kaveny/&gt;

Southwell, who was arrested in 1592, was accused at his trial of having told a witness that even if she was forced by the authorities to swear under oath, it was permissible to lie to conceal the whereabouts of a priest. Southwell replied that that was not what he had said. He had said that "to an oath were required justice, judgement and truth", but the rest of his answer goes unrecorded because one of the judges angrily shouted him down.&lt;ref&gt;Fiorella Sultana De Maria. ''Robert Southwell''. London: CTS, 2003, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Convicted in 1595, Southwell was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. More famous in his own era was Henry Garnet, who wrote a defense of Southwell in 1598; Garnet was captured by the authorities in 1606 due to his alleged involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. Facing the same accusations as Southwell, his attempts to defend himself met with no better result: later that year Garnet was executed in the same fashion.

The [[Protestantism|Protestants]] considered these doctrines as mere justifications for lies. Catholic ethicists also voiced objections: the [[Jansenist]] "[[Blaise Pascal]]...attacked the Jesuits in the seventeenth century for what he saw as their moral laxity."&lt;ref&gt;Randal, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; "By 1679, the doctrine of strict mental reservation put forward by Navarrus had become such a scandal that [[Pope Innocent XI]] officially condemned it."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Other casuists justifying mental reservation included [[Thomas Sanchez]], who was criticized by Pascal in his ''[[Provincial Letters]]''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; although Sanchez added various restrictions (it should not be used in ordinary circumstances, when one is interrogated by competent magistrates, when a [[creed]] is requested, even for [[heresy|heretics]], etc.), which were ignored by Pascal. Of the 26 theses condemned by [[Pope Innocent XI]], several were in Sanchez's works (see op. mor. in præc. Decalogi, III, vi, n. 15). One of them stated:

{{cquote|If anyone, by himself, or before others, whether under examination or of his own accord, whether for amusement or for any other purpose, should swear that he has not done something which he has really done, having in mind something else which he has not done, or some way of doing it other than the way he employed, or anything else that is true: he does not lie nor perjure himself.}}

This type of equivocation was famously mocked in the porter's speech in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', in which the porter directly alludes to the practice of deceiving under oath by means of equivocation.

{{cquote|Faith, here's an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale; who committed treason enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. (''Macbeth'', Act 2, Scene 3)}}

See, for example [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]] and [[Henry Garnet]], author of ''A Treatise of Equivocation'' (published secretly c. 1595)—to whom, it is supposed, Shakespeare was specifically referring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Shakespeare made the reference to priests because the religious use of equivocation was well known in those periods of early modern England (e.g. under [[James VI and I|James VI/I]]) when it was a capital offence for a Roman Catholic priest to enter England.  A Jesuit priest would equivocate in order to protect himself from the secular authorities without (in his eyes) committing the sin of lying. For example, he could use the ambiguity of the word "a" (meaning "any" or "one") to say "I swear I am not a priest", because he could have a particular priest in mind who he was not.  That is, in his mind, he was saying "I swear I am not one priest" (e.g. "I am not Father Brown".)

According to [[#{{harvid|Malloch|Huntley|1966}}|Malloch and Huntley (1966)]], this doctrine of permissible "equivocation" did not originate with the Jesuits. They cite a short treatise, ''{{lang|la|in cap. Humanae aures}}'', that had been written by [[Martin Azpilcueta]] (also known as Doctor Navarrus), an [[Augustinian]] who was serving as a consultant to the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malloch|first1=A. E.|last2=Huntley|first2=Frank L.|title=Some Notes on Equivocation|journal=PMLA|volume=81|issue=1|date=Mar 1966|pages=145&amp;ndash;6|doi=10.2307/461317|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Rome in 1584. The first [[Jesuit]] influence upon this doctrine was not until 1609, "when Suarez rejected Azpilcueta's basic proof and supplied another" (speaking of [[Francisco Suárez]]).

Following Innocent XI's condemnation of strict mental reservation, equivocation (or wide mental reservation) was still considered orthodox, and was revived and defended by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]. The Jesuit [[Gabriel Daniel]] wrote in 1694 ''Entretiens de [[Cleanthes|Cleanthe]] et d'[[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxe]] sur les lettres provinciales'', a reply to Pascal's ''Provincial Letters'' in which he accused Pascal of lying, or even of having himself used mental reservation, by not mentioning all the restrictions imposed by Sanchez on the use of this form of deception.

==Legacy==

===Kant and Constant===
This type of untruth was condemned by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] in ''On a supposed 'right to lie’''. Kant was debating against [[Benjamin Constant]], who had claimed, from a [[consequentialist]] stance opposed to Kant's [[categorical imperative]], that:
{{cquote|To tell the truth is thus a duty; but it is only in respect to one who has a right to the truth. But no one has a right to a truth which injures others.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Stapleton, "[http://www.cfh.ufsc.br/ethic@/ETICA5.PRN.pdf Is Kantian Ethics Left Defenseless in the Face of Evil?]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, Kant asserted, in the ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty) because it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it is universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies (this last clause was accepted by casuists, hence the reasons for restrictions given to the cases where deception was authorized).&lt;ref name=Cavaille/&gt; The right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in himself. And the theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences. However, it was permissible to remain silent or say no more than needed (such as in the infamous example of a murderer asking to know where someone is).

===Others===
The doctrines have also been criticized by [[Sissela Bok]]&lt;ref&gt;Bok, pp. 35&amp;ndash;7 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Paul Ekman]], who defines lies by omission as the main form of lying&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; though larger and more complex moral and ethical issues of [[Lie|lying]] and [[truth]]-telling extend far beyond these specific doctrines. Ekman, however, does not consider cases of deception where "it is improper to question" the truth as real form of deceptions&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Ekman]], [https://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Why-Dont-We-Catch-Liars.pdf "Why Don't We Catch Liars?"], ''Social Research'', Vol. 63, No. 3 (Fall 1996), pp. 801–817.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; this sort of case, where communication of truth is not to be expected and so deception is justified, was included by casuists.&lt;ref name=Cavaille&gt;J.-P. Cavaillé, ''[http://dossiersgrihl.revues.org/document281.html Ruser sans mentir, de la casuistique aux sciences sociales : le recours à l’équivocité, entre efficacité pragmatique et souci éthique]'', published in [[Serge Latouche]], P.-J. Laurent, O. Servais &amp; M. Singleton, ''Les Raisons de la ruse. Une perspective anthropologique et psychanalytique'', Actes du colloque international « La raison rusée », Louvain la Neuve, mars 2001, Paris, La Découverte, 2004, p. 93&amp;ndash;118 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Clinton]] famously equivocated, during his trial during the [[Lewinsky scandal]], "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is."

[[Social psychology|Social psychologist]]s have advanced cases&lt;ref&gt;Janet Beavin Bavelas, Alex Black, Nicole Chovil, and Jennifer Mullet, ''Equivocal Communications'', Newbury Park, CA, Sage Publications, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; where the actor is confronted with an [[avoidance-avoidance conflict]], in which he both doesn't want to say the truth and doesn't want to make an outright lie; in such circumstances, equivocal statements are generally preferred. This type of equivocation has been defined as “nonstraightforward communication...ambiguous, contradictory, tangential, obscure or even evasive.”&lt;ref&gt;Bavelas et al., p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; People typically equivocate when posed a question to which all of the possible replies have potentially negative  consequences, yet a reply is still expected (the situational theory of communicative conflict).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Peter Bull]], [http://www.ils.uw.edu.pl/PL2007/pliki/1181989221Peter%20Bull.pdf Equivocation and Facework in the Discourse of Televised Political Interviews].&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Ireland===
The [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Irish Catholic Church]] allegedly misused the concept of mental reservation when dealing with situations relating to [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland|clerical child sexual abuse]], by disregarding the restrictions placed on its employment by moral theologians and treating it as a method that "allows clerics (to) mislead people...without being guilty of lying",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/1126/breaking86.htm "Church 'lied without lying'"], ''[[The Irish Times]]'', 11 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; for example when dealing with the police, victims, civil authorities and media. In the [[Murphy Report]] into the [[Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin]], Cardinal [[Desmond Connell]] describes it thus:

{{cquote|Well, the general teaching about mental reservation is that you are not permitted to tell a lie. On the other hand, you may be put in a position where you have to answer, and there may be circumstances in which you can use an ambiguous expression realising that the person who you are talking to will accept an untrue version of whatever it may be&amp;nbsp;– permitting that to happen, not willing that it happened, that would be lying. It really is a matter of trying to deal with extraordinarily difficult matters that may arise in social relations where people may ask questions that you simply cannot answer. Everybody knows that this kind of thing is liable to happen. So mental reservation is, in a sense, a way of answering without lying.}}

[[Cathleen Kaveny]], writing in the Catholic magazine ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', notes that Henry Garnet in his treatise on the topic took pains to argue that no form of mental reservation was justified&amp;nbsp;— and might even be a [[mortal sin]]&amp;nbsp;— if it would run contrary to the requirements of faith, charity or justice.&lt;ref name=Kaveny/&gt; But according to the Murphy Report:

{{cquote|The Dublin Archdiocese's preoccupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the church, and the preservation of its assets. All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities. The archdiocese did not implement its own [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon-law]] rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the state.}}

Kaveny concludes: "The truths of faith are illuminated by the lives of the [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]]. Southwell and Garnet practiced mental reservation to save innocent victims while sacrificing themselves. The Irish prelates practiced mental reservation to save themselves while sacrificing innocent victims. And that difference makes all the difference."&lt;ref name=Kaveny/&gt;

'''Negative atheism''', also called '''weak atheism''' and '''soft atheism''', is any type of atheism where a person does not believe in the existence of any deities but does not explicitly assert that there are none.  '''Positive atheism''', also called '''strong atheism''' and '''hard atheism''', is the form of [[atheism]] that additionally asserts that no [[Deity|deities]] exist.&lt;!--

The terms "negative atheism" and "positive atheism" were used by [[Antony Flew]] in 1976&lt;ref name="Flew1976"/&gt; and have appeared in [[George H. Smith]]'s&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080713012926/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smithdef.htm Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies - an excerpt]; George H.

"negative atheism, the position of not believing a theistic God exists" / "positive atheism: the position of disbelieving a theistic God exists"; p.&amp;nbsp;464: "Clearly, positive atheism is a special case of negative atheism: Someone who is a positive atheist is by necessity a negative atheist, but not conversely".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of application==
Because of flexibility in the term [[god (word)|''god'']], it is possible that a person could be a positive/strong atheist in terms of certain [[conceptions of God]], while remaining a negative/weak atheist in terms of others. For example, the God of [[classical theism]] is often considered to be a personal supreme being who is [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], [[omnipresent]], and [[omnibenevolent]], caring about humans and human affairs. One might be a positive atheist for such a deity (see [[problem of evil]]), while being a negative atheist with respect to a [[deism|deistic]] conception of God by rejecting belief in such a deity but not explicitly asserting it to be false.

Positive and negative atheism are frequently used by the philosopher [[George H. Smith]] as synonyms of the less-well-known categories of [[implicit and explicit atheism]], also relating to whether an individual holds a specific view that gods do not exist.&lt;ref name="Smith1"/&gt;  "''Positive''" atheists explicitly assert that it is false that any deities exist. "''Negative''" atheists assert they do not believe any deities exist, but do not explicitly assert it is ''true'' that no deity exists. Those who do not believe any deities exist, but do not assert such non-belief, are included among ''implicit atheists''. Among "implicit" atheists are thus included the following: children and adults who have never heard of deities; people who have heard of deities but have never given the idea any considerable thought; and those agnostics who suspend belief about deities, but do not reject such belief. All ''implicit'' atheists are included in the ''negative/weak'' categorization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000831235652/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm The Case Against God - en excerpt]; George H. Smith; 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-negative-atheism-247866|title=Are You a Negative Atheist?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the negative atheism classification, agnostics atheists. The validity of this categorization is disputed, however, and a few prominent atheists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] avoid it. In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Dawkins describes people for whom the [[Spectrum of theistic probability|probability of the existence of God]] is between "very high" and "very low" as "agnostic" and reserves the term "strong atheist" for those who claim to know there is no God. He categorizes himself as a "[[de facto]] atheist" but ''not'' a "strong atheist" on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[The God Delusion]], pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;  Within negative atheism, philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] further distinguishes between [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], who find the claim "God exists" uncertain, and [[Theological noncognitivism|theological noncognitivists]], who consider all talk of gods to be meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |year=2006 |title=Worshipping an Unknown God |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9329.2006.00339.x |journal=Ratio |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=442 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.2006.00339.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate meanings==
[[Jacques Maritain]] used the negative/positive phrases as early as 1949, but with a different meaning and in the context of a strictly [[Catholic]] [[apologist]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |authorlink=Jacques Maritain |date=July 1949 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |quote=By positive atheism I mean an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God – that is to say, anti-theism rather than atheism – and at the same time a desperate, I would say heroic, effort to recast and reconstruct the whole human universe of thought and the whole human scale of values according to that state of war against God. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113062053/http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |archivedate=2005-11-13 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goparaju Ramachandra Rao]] (1902–1975), better known by his [[nickname]] Gora, was an [[India]]n social reformer, anti-caste activist, and atheist. He proposed a philosophy he called "positive atheism", which treated atheism as a way of life in his 1972 book, ''Positive Atheism''.&lt;ref name="gorapositive"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robyn E. Lebron|title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...Can There Be Common Ground?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KILFE33zGngC&amp;pg=PA532|accessdate=2013-09-08|date=January 2012|publisher=CrossBooks|isbn=978-1-4627-1262-5|page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Atheist Community of Austin (ACA) uses the term ''positive atheism'' in the sense of putting a positive face to atheism and dispelling the false and negative image of atheism portrayed by religious people, especially in places of worship. ''Positive Atheism Magazine'' "sees atheism as being a positive, healthy outlook -- much healthier than any theistic approach to life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000823031822/http://www.positiveatheism.org/mission.htm What is Positive Atheism?]; Positive Atheism Magazine; November, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnostics are not always merely implicit atheists. For instance, [[Philip Pullman]], the English author of the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' fantasy trilogy, which has atheism as a major theme, is an explicit atheist,&lt;ref name=PullmanAtheist01&gt;"As an atheist I'm rather on difficult ground here, but presumably this is what a Christian believes." [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/03/17/bodark17.xml The Dark Materials debate: life, God, the universe...] (interview of Pullman by Rowan Williams), Telegraph.co.uk, March 17, 2004 (Accessed November 12, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PullmanAtheist02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/26/051226fa_fact|title='Far From Narnia'|accessdate=31 October 2007|author=Miller, Laura|format=Life and Letters article|publisher=The New Yorker|quote=he is one of England’s most outspoken atheists. ... He added, “Although I call myself an atheist, I am a Church of England atheist, and a 1662 Book of Common Prayer atheist, because that’s the tradition I was brought up in and I cannot escape those early influences.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also describes himself as technically an [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name=PullmanAgnostic01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pluggedin.com/upfront/2007/sympathyforthedevil.aspx |title=Sympathy for the Devil by Adam R.

Since the end of the 20th century, [[propaganda]] has evolved significantly. Today's propaganda is characterised by [[psych-op]]s and [[disinformation]], whereas a few decades ago it was dominated by posters and simple films.


==Middle East==

===Afghan War===

In the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]], [[psychological operations]] tactics were employed to [[demoralization (military)|demoralise]] the [[Taliban]] and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six [[EC-130E|EC-130E Commando Solo]] aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages. [[Pamphlets|Leaflets]] were also dropped throughout Afghanistan, offering rewards for [[Osama bin Laden]] and other individuals, portraying Americans as friends of Afghanistan and emphasising various negative aspects of the Taliban. Another shows a picture of [[Mohammed Omar]] in a set of crosshairs with the words: "We are watching."

===Iraq War===

Both the [[United States]] and [[Iraq]] employed propaganda during the [[Iraq War]]. The United States established campaigns towards the American people on the justifications of the war while using similar tactics to bring down [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Altheide, David L 2009"&gt;Altheide, David L. "War and Mass Mediated Evidence." Cultural Studies&amp;nbsp;— Critical Methodologies 9 (2009): 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraqi propaganda====

The Iraqi insurgency's plan was to gain as much support as possible by using violence as their propaganda tool.&lt;ref name="Garfield, Andrew 2007"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 23–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Vietcong]]'s tactics,&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"&gt;Schleifer, Ron. "Reconstructing Iraq: Winning the Propaganda War in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly (2005): 15–24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgents]] were using rapid movement to keep the [[coalition]] off-balance.&lt;ref name="Garfield, Andrew 2007"/&gt; By using low-technology strategies to convey their messages, they were able to gain support.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 24&lt;/ref&gt; Graffiti slogans were used on walls and houses praising the virtues of many group leaders while condemning the Iraqi government. Others used flyers, leaflets, articles and self-published newspapers and magazines to get the point across.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Insurgents also produced CDs and DVDs and distributed them in communities that the Iraq and the [[U.S. Government|US Government]] were trying to influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq."

====US propaganda in Iraq====
[[File:your future al-Zarqawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States of America|US]] [[Psychological operations|PSYOP]] [[pamphlet]] disseminated in [[Iraq]]. The pamphlet says: "This is your future, Al-Zarqawi", and shows [[Al-Qaeda]] fighter [[Al-Zarqawi]] caught in a rat trap.]]
To achieve their aim of a moderate, pro-western Iraq, US authorities were careful to avoid conflicts with Islamic culture that would produce passionate reactions from Iraqis, but differentiating between "good" and "bad" Islam has proved challenging for the US.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt;

The US implemented [[Black Propaganda|black propaganda]] by creating false radio personalities that would disseminate pro-American information, but supposedly run by the supporters of Saddam Hussein. One radio station used was ''Radio Tikrit''.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt; Another example of use of black propaganda is that the United States paid Iraqis to publish articles written by US troops in their newspapers under the idea that they are unbiased and real accounts; this was brought forth by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="ShahAnup"&gt;Shah, Anup. Iraq War Media Reporting, Journalism and Propaganda. Aug 1, 2007. May 12, 2009. &lt;http://www.globalissues.org/article/461/media-reporting-journalism-and-propaganda.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that it was the [[Lincoln Group]] who had been hired by the US government to create the propaganda. However, their names were later cleared from any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="ShahAnup" /&gt;

The US was more successful with the ''[[Voice of America]]'' campaign, which is an old [[Cold War]] tactic that exploited people's desire for information.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt; While the information they gave out to the Iraqis was truthful,{{fact|date=February 2016}} they were in a high degree of competition with the opposing forces after the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, Sol 2008"&gt;Goldstein, Sol. "A Strategic Failure: American Information Control Policy in Occupied Iraq." Military Review 88.2 (Mar. 2008): 58–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' alleged that the [[United States military]] had [[media manipulation|manipulated news]] reported in Iraqi media in an effort to cast a favourable light on its actions while demoralising the [[insurgency]]. Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said the program is "an important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents", while a spokesman for former [[Defense Secretary]] [[Donald H. Rumsfeld]] said the allegations of manipulation were troubling if true. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] confirmed the existence of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Baldor | first = Lolita C. | title = U.S. Military Unclear on 'Planted' Stories | agency = Associated Press | date = November 30, 2005 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/11/30/national/w140545S58.DTL | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060630204816/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2005%2F11%2F30%2Fnational%2Fw140545S58.DTL | archivedate = June 30, 2006 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Baldor | first = Lolita C. | title = Pentagon describes Iraq propaganda plan | agency = Associated Press | date = December 2, 2005 | url = http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/13305355.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051205031408/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/13305355.htm |archivedate = December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propaganda aimed at US citizens====
The extent to which the US government used propaganda aimed at its own people is a matter of discussion. The book ''Selling Intervention &amp; War,'' by Jon Western, argued that president Bush was "selling the war" to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Thrall, A. Trevor. "A Review of: "Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq, by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber Weapons of Mass Persuasion: Marketing the War Against Iraq, by Paul Rutherford Selling Intervention &amp; War: The Presidency, the..." Political Communication 24.2 (Apr. 2007): 202–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

President George W. Bush gave a talk at the Athena Performing Arts Centre, at Greece Athena Middle and High School, Tuesday, May 24, 2005, in Rochester, New York. About halfway through the event, Bush said: "See, in my line of work, you got to keep repeating things over and over, and over again, for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda."

People had their initial reactions to the War on Terror.  While the United States' official stance was to remove Saddam Hussein's power in Iraq with allegations that his government held weapons of mass destruction or was related to [[Osama Bin Laden]],&lt;ref name="O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas 2004"&gt;O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas.

==North Korea==
{{Main|Propaganda in North Korea}}
[[File:NKmuseum.jpg|thumb|North Koreans touring the [[Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities|Museum of American War Atrocities]].]]
Every year, a state-owned publishing house{{which|date=July 2014}} releases several cartoons (called ''[[geurim-chaek]]'' in [[North Korea]]), many of which are smuggled across the [[China–North Korea border|Chinese border]] and, sometimes, end up in university libraries in the United States. The books are designed to instill the ''[[Juche]]'' philosophy of [[Kim Il-sung]] (the "father" of North Korea)—radical self-reliance of the state. The plots mostly feature scheming capitalists from the United States and Japan who create dilemmas for naïve North Korean characters.

DPRK textbooks claim that US missionaries came to the Korean Peninsula and committed barbarous acts against Korean children, including injecting dangerous liquids into the children and writing the word "THIEF" on the forehead of any child who stole an apple for missionary-owned orchards in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentaryaddict.com/Nuclear+Nightmare+Understanding+North+Korea-10151-doc.html Nuclear Nightmare: Understanding North Korea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexican drug cartels==

Drug cartels have been engaged in propaganda and psychological campaigns to influence their rivals and those within their area of influence. They use banners and [[narcomanta|''narcomantas'']] to threaten their rivals. Some cartels hand out pamphlets and leaflets to conduct public relation campaigns. They have been able to control the information environment by threatening journalists, bloggers and others who speak out against them. They have elaborate recruitment strategies targeting young adults to join their cartel groups. They have successfully branded the word ''narco'', and the word has become part of Mexican culture. There is music, television shows, literature, beverages, food and architecture that all have been branded ''narco''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/101026/mexico-drug-war-cartels-newspapers|title=Analysis: A PR department for Mexico's narcos|last=O'Connor|first=Mike|date=November 5, 2010|work=[[GlobalPost]]|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/the-narco-generation/|title=The Narco Generation|last=Beckhart|first=Sarah|date=February 21, 2011|work=AL DÍA|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]'s Mexico Institute|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2003), ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'', University of Hawaii Press, p. 1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

This town is well-known for its colonial architecture and its contributions to Colombian cultural and political life. It is also known as the "white city" due to the color of most of the colonial buildings in the city center, where several churches are located, such as San Francisco, San José, Belén, Santo Domingo, San Agustín, and the [[Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption, Popayán|Catedral Basílica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción]], known locally as "La Catedral". The city's cathedral was home to the [[Crown of the Andes]], a 16th-century [[Society of Mary (Marianists)|Marianist]] devotional object featuring emeralds taken from the captured [[Inca]] Emperor [[Atahualpa]]. It was sold to finance local [[health care]] institutions.

Popayán has been home to seventeen Colombian presidents, as well as noted poets, painters, and composers. The [[University of Cauca]] (est. 1827), one of Colombia's oldest and most distinguished institutions of higher education, is located here, so Popayán is also known as the "University City." Nearby is [[Puracé National Natural Park]]. The nearest large city is [[Cali]], in the [[Valle del Cauca Department]], north of Cauca.

Much of the city's original splendor was destroyed on 31 March 1983, when [[1983 Popayán earthquake|an earthquake]] toppled many buildings. Though many were rebuilt and repaired, the heart of the city still has ruins and empty lots. In 2005, Popayán was declared by the [[UNESCO]] as the first city of gastronomy because of its variety and meaning to the intangible patrimony of Colombian culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=28229&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Popayan, Colombia appointed first UNESCO City of Gastronomy] [[UNESCO]] 28 Aug 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The culinary history of the [[Cauca Department]] was chosen because it maintains traditional food preparation methods which has been passed down orally for generations. In 2009 UNESCO also declared the Semana Santa processions during [[Easter]] Week a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Patrimony of Humanity.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Etymology ==
The word Popayán comes from an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] language. There are different theories about the origin of this word, one claims it means: ''Po'': "Two"; ''pa'': "reed"; ''yan'': "village", or; "Two villages with reed roofs". Another theory says that the word Popayán comes from the name of the indigenous ''[[cacique]]'', called ''Payán'', who used to live around Eme Hill, nowadays known as Las Tres Cruces Hill. Yet another theory says that according to the historian Arcecio Aragón, the origin of the word Popayán is "Pampayán" and it comes from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] language: ''pampa'' (valley) and ''yan'' (river), or in other words, the "Valley of the river", where river refers to the [[Cauca River]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== History ==

===Colonial era===
[[File:Centro Histórico 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Popayán downtown]]
No records exist of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic]] history of the indigenous village of Popayán, but on 13 January 1537 the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]] arrived in Popayán. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Popayán was administered by an appointed governor under the jurisdiction of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]].

Popayán was a very important town during the colonial period because of its location between [[Lima]], [[Quito]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. Even after the discovery of the [[Pacific Ocean]], Popayán remained a transfer point for gold and other riches going to Cartagena on their way to [[Spain]]. Popayán also served as a colonial mine, and produced various denominations of gold [[escudo]] coins and silver [[Spanish colonial real|reales]] from 1760 through 1819; it continued producing coinage for the new Republic of Colombia after 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Krause "World Coins 1701-1800" 4th Ed and "1801-1900" 5th Ed, Colin R. Bruce II, Sr. editor&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Centro Histórico 1.JPG|thumb|left|140px|Popayán downtown]]

The city is the home of an ancient [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic]] pyramid known as [[El Morro del Tulcán]], already abandoned when the first Spanish arrived.  Analyses of dental samples have revealed that individuals buried there probably belonged to the upper class of their society.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Popayán has been destroyed by several [[earthquake]]s. The most recent and destructive lasted eighteen seconds and occurred on 31 March 1983. The reconstruction of the colonial city took more than ten years and today it is still possible to see some lots that have not been rebuilt. The first earthquake [[Seismic analysis|seismic design code]] was established in Colombia as a consequence of this earthquake.

=== Colonial city ===
Popayán's historic downtown is considered one of the most beautiful and best preserved in Colombia and Latin America.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Popayán has preserved its colonial architecture for more than four centuries. The cobblestone streets were almost all paved in 1937; however, a few projects currently seek to recover the old city's original look.

== Places of interest ==
[[File:El Morro de Tulcán.JPG|thumb|right|200px|El Morro, in the background]]

=== El Morro del tulcán ===
[[El morro del tulcán]] is the main archaeological site of Popayán. It consists of a truncated pyramid built between 500 and 1600 A.C., a period known as late [[chiefdom]] societies. To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the city's founding, a monument was erected in 1937 in honor of city founder [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]], with an equestrian statue by Spanish artist [[Victorio Macho]].

=== Francisco José de Caldas Auditorium ===
Better known as the Paraninfo, this imposing mid-18th-century building was part of the [[Dominican order]] monastery until 1826. It was first built with a mud and straw roof, then reinforced over the years with rammed earth and tile. In 1827 [[Simón Bolivar]] declared it a property with historic heritage value, when it was already a two steps hose{{what|date=March 2018}} in front of the Santo Domingo plaza. The last great governor of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]], don Miguel de Arroyo Hurtado, made more renovations and reforms that gave it the most current look. When the building was given to the [[University of Cauca]] in the early twentieth century, several changes and additional extensions were made, which recovered all the original spaces. 
[[File:Parque Caldas 1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Caldas Park]]

=== Caldas Park ===
This park was born at the same time as Popayán in 1537, when the track in grid generated around religious, governmental, and founders buildings.{{what|date=June 2018}} Initially it was a marketplace. In 1538 it was placed a trap in the center of the park, where [[Jorge Robledo]] and Álvaro Oyón were beheaded. This trap lasted until 1766 when it was replaced by a water faucet, until 1805 when a stone pile was put in its place, but it was removed too in 1910 after the inauguration of the monument to [[Francisco José de Caldas|Sabio Caldas]], a piece by the French sculptor {{ILL|Raoul Verlet|fr}}, which has remained there since. A replica of it exists in the Plazoleta de las Nieves in [[Bogotá]]. Leafy trees were planted at this time. In May 2007 a proposal by architect Lorenzo Castro aimed to expand the pedestrian zone around the park, and in April 2009 the first phase of the work began.

[[File:Unicauca - El Carmen 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Humanities Faculty of University of Cauca]]

=== University of Cauca ===
[[File:Torre del Reloj de la Catedral.jpg|thumb|200px|Clock Tower]]
[[File:El Humilladero.jpg|thumb|200px|Humilladero Bridge]]
The university gathers students from around the country. It was founded in 1827 by decree of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]. Its motto is ''Posteris Lumen Moriturus Edat''. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the main headquarters have been in the [[Dominican Order]] cloister, one of the best examples of [[Sacred architecture|religious architecture]] in the city.

=== Clock tower ===
Called "the nose of Popayán" by [[Guillermo Valencia]], the clock tower is a well-known symbol of the city. It was built next to the [[cathedral]] between 1673 and 1682 with 96,000 bricks. The clock, made in [[England]], was placed in 1737. Its mechanism operated by the action of two lead weights which were changed by [[Antonio Nariño]] in the Colombia independence dispute in 1814, when metal was required to manufacture ammunition.

After the earthquake of 1983, the clock was restored and put back in operation by the same English company that had manufactured it, but it has since stopped working.

=== Humilladero Bridge ===
This bridge connects the central and northern zones of the city. It was built in 1873 on arches of brick and masonry. The designs were prepared by the Italian friar Fray Serafin Barbetti and a German engineer whose mummified remains are preserved in the Archdiocesan Museum of Religious Art. The bridge crosses a fault between the city center and the El Callejón (now Bolivar) neighborhood which was previously extremely difficult to cross, requiring pedestrians to almost crawl on their knees. Accordingly, the new bridge was named ''Humilladero''. 
For a long time this bridge was one of the main entrances to the city. The liberating armies crossed it to enter Popayán during the early stages of the struggle for Colombia independence. Its well-planned design and strong construction has allowed the bridge to remain intact through many earthquakes.

=== Calibio ===
This country house was built in the 17th Century. On its grounds a battle was fought for the independence of Colombia on January 15, 1814.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.nl/books?id=pkAsXgdpQuYC&amp;lpg=PA29 Casa de Hacienda: Architecture in the Colombian Countryside]'', German Tellez et al&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iglesia belen.jpg|thumb|200px|Belén church]]

=== San Francisco ===
According to the architect, critic and historian Germain Téllez, the [[facade]] of this church is the best example of [[Baroque architecture|baroque style]] in Colombia. In its tower is a famous bell donated by Don Pedro Agustín de Valencia. This temple is remarkable because of its altar decorations and the proportions of its [[nave]]s and [[apse]]. In San Francisco's square stands a monument to local hero [[Camilo Torres Tenorio|Camilo Torres]], whose replica is located in the square of the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé in [[Bogotá]].

=== Santo Domingo ===
Late Neogranadino [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] work, designed by the Spanish architect Antonio Garcia. It has excellent examples of architectures, metal works, and furniture from [[Quito]] and [[Spain]] schools. His pulpit was designed in the first half of the nineteenth century by an illustrious son of the city, [[Francisco José de Caldas]]. Next to this church is the faculty of Law and Political and Social Sciences of the [[University of Cauca]], also in [[Spanish Colonial architecture|colonial]] style.

=== San Agustín, church and convent ===
Fray Jeronimo Escobar founded the convent of the [[Augustinians]] in the late seventeenth century, whose temple was destroyed in the earthquake in 1736. Then, it was reconstructed thanks to contributions from notable people of the city, but it was necessary to restore it again after the earthquake of 1983. In particular it stands out its altar carved in wood and covered in gold, its expository [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] made in silver and a beautiful image of the [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Lady of Sorrows]].

=== La Ermita ===
It is the oldest church in the city and sometimes it served as "Pro Tempore" Cathedral. It dates from 1546 and contains a fine altar discovered after the earthquake of 1983.  The principal attraction of this church is the street because its road is made of stones, like old roads in Popayán.

=== Catedral Basílica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción ===
Originally it was a straw hut, but in 1609 it was opened a second cathedral of mud and masonry. The current construction was consecrated in 1906 by Archbishop Manuel Antonio Arboleda, who brings it a magnificent European [[pipe organ]]. Its style is the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], and much of the building was restored because of the earthquake of 1983, including the great dome of 40 meters high, whose restoration was made according to guidelines of the original structure designed by the local artist Adolfo Dueñas.

=== San José ===
It was built in 1702 according to the architectural guidelines of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in the American [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]]. It has put up with some changes, for example, the most recent occurred in 1983, when much of the facade which had been covered with paint and lime for at least two centuries, was left on view.

=== Belén Chapel ===
It is located on the hill of Belén, and from the chapel you can see a panoramic view of the city. To arrive to this church, it is necessary to pass through the “quingos", a road of stone steps that allow a nice climb to one of the viewpoints of the city.

Since 1717 this chapel is in charge of the image of Santo [[Ecce Homo]], patron saint of the city. Next to the church there is a cross of quarry stone of 1789, which are attributed to many legends. The original church was completely replaced by a new structure after the earthquake of 1983.

== Museums ==

=== House-Museum Mosquera ===
This house displays a very interesting collection of colonial art and precious memories of the Mosquera family. This house is administrated by Universidad del Cauca.
It works in the house that belonged to the Mosquera Arboleda family, a recognized family in the history of Colombia, whose members occupied the highest positions of political power, ecclesiastical, military and diplomatic, simultaneously during much of the nineteenth century. The most important were: [[Joaquín Mosquera]], [[Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera]], Manuel José Mosquera and Manuel Maria Mosquera. The father of them all, Jose Maria Mosquera y Figueroa, was considered by the Liberator [[Simón Bolívar]] as the only person he would choose as a second parent.

=== Archdiocesan Museum of Religious Art ===
The old residence of the Arboleda family, was built in the eighteenth century based on plans of the priest Andres Perez Marcelino Arroyo, and it was acquired by the city in 1974 and renovated for its current use in 1979. Their collections are extraordinary examples of religious art, silverware, pictures of the so-called [[Quito School]] and paintings of the colonial period. Monstrances of the collection have such value that they are only exposed to the public for a few days during [[Easter]].

=== National Museum Guillermo Valencia ===
It is located in a mansion on the Próceres street, and it is dedicated to the poet [[Guillermo Valencia]], one of the most prominent members of [[Modernism]] in [[Spanish literature]]. Its numerous rooms are decorated with valuable works of art and artistic pieces, as well as a collection of hundred of selected books, diplomas, medals and awards that Master Valencia received for his distinguished political life and for its fine literary and poetic compositions. In the park located across the street it stands the statue of the poet, made by the Spanish sculptor Victorio Macho. It has too a family cemetery where the remains of several generations of Valencia are resting.

=== Natural History Museum ===
The museum depends on the [[University of Cauca]]. It offers an exhibition of animals, like insects, butterflies and birds native to the region, and a collection of pre-Columbian pottery.

=== Holy Week ===
{{Main article|Holy Week in Popayán}}
[[File:Paso de La Verónica.jpg|thumb|200px|La Verónica]]
Popayán is widely known for the solemnity of its [[Holy Week in Popayán|Holy Week processions]], during which it commemorates the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] and death of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Since roughly the mid-sixteenth century - documents in the historical archives of Popayán mention processions in the year 1558 - sacred processions have taken place each night from Tuesday until Holy Saturday, with ancient religious images paraded through Popayán's historical downtown streets.  They are borne on wooden platforms by means of four projecting wooden "bars" at the front and four at the back.  These bars rest on the shoulders of the “cargueros”, responsible for carrying the platforms.

These processions represent episodes from the [[Gospel]]s, relating the Passion, [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and death of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Each representation is called a "[[Paso]]". Since the time of the conquest the pasos have been carried through the streets on the shoulders of the traditional 'cargueros' in a route shaped like a cross, which takes in the main churches and temples of the city.  Since 2009 the Popayán Holy Week processions have been inscribed in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;See the entry in the [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00259|UNESCO website], accessed 4 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Holy Week, Popayán is also home to the Festival de Música Religiosa (Religious Music Festival), begun in the 1960s by Edmundo Mosquera Troya. This festival presents choirs, soloists and artists from around the world, specialists in sacred music. 
It is also the tradition at this time of the year to hold art and craft fairs selling [[handicraft]]s and commercial products. One of the most important handicrafts samples is Manos de Oro, which displays the  works of artists of [[Colombia]].

=== Amo Jesus of Puelenje ===
[[File:Amo Jesus.JPG|thumb|Amo Jesus of Puelenje on the [[procession]]]]
Amo Jesus Nazareno of Puelenje is a Catholic devotional image located in the church of Puelenje, part of the metropolitan area of Popayán, Colombia.  Amo Jesus is the patron of the parish of Puelenje.  The image is a polychrome [[baroque]] wooden sculpture of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] carved in the eighteenth century in the style of the [[Quito School|Quito school]].  The image is processed on the Wednesday as part of the expression of popular piety celebrated in Popayán during [[Holy week|Holy Week]] (see above).&lt;ref&gt;See the description on the [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00259|UNESCO website], accessed 4 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A festival in honour of Amo Jesus as patron of the parish is celebrated with fireworks, [[procession]]s, religious ceremonies and cultural events beginning on the 15th day before the last Sunday in August each year.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the notice (in Spanish)  [http://allevents.in/mosquera/fiesta-patronal-del-amo-jes%C3%BAs-en-puelenje/677304295691122|Fiesta Patronal del Amo Jesús en Puelenje] advertising the festival as held in 2014.  Accessed 4 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fiestas de Pubenza ===
Popayán celebrates these festivities at the beginning of the year, from January 5 to 13. These ''fiestas'' celebrate the spirit of racial diversity in the country, in the same way as the [[Carnival of Blacks and Whites]], which takes place in the same week, in [[Pasto]], which originally initiated in Popayán during the slavery period as a way of escaping the [[racial discrimination]] prevailing at the time.

=== Music ===
It is said that among the original performers there were good music interpreters, excelling in playing the [[chirimía]], that is made up of flutes (transverse cane), guacharacas, drums, castrueras and triángulos, making its appearance in the traditional celebrations of Popayán, especially at [[Christmas]] time and at the end of the year.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

On the plateau of Popayán, groups of farmers play stringed instruments, composed of three guitars and maracas which have incorporated into their repertoire paseos, [[Merengue music|merengue]]s, pasillos and [[bolero]]s in vocal and instrumental form.

=== Gastronomy ===
[[File:Creative cities network Popayan.jpg|thumb|Creative cities network Popayan of the UNESCO]]
Popayán has been declared a City of Gastronomy by [[UNESCO]], in tribute to its significant tradition of regional cooking.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Typical dishes of the city are a legacy of both Spanish and indigenous cultural interaction, integrating components of local origin with fruits brought from [[Spain]].

The National Gastronomy Congress of Popayán has been held each September since 2003, and in 2005 was recognized by UNESCO as a cultural heritage event of the United Nations creative network.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The Congress is organized by the Gastronomic Corporation of Popayán, which has presented seven events which have also featured the participation of various countries as special guests: [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], [[Spain]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Italy]] and [[France]]. Today, this congress is recognized as the second largest popular event in the [[Cauca Department]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As it has an academic format, it is distinguished from other culinary events and is the only one to be listed nationally.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Film ===
Traditional cinema is represented in the city by the Bolivar Cultural Center, which shows independent films. There is also a theater, the Royal Films multiplex in the Campanario Mall, which has four modern 3D digital cinema screens, and a new theater, Cine Colombia multiplex in the Terra plaza Mall (the newest in the city)

In addition there are several film clubs, many of them located within the [[University of Cauca]]. The Cineclub La Tuátara runs every Wednesday in the Comfacauca Institute of Technology auditorium (opened 2001), which has established itself as a cultural space for the city.

A very important innovation is the program of the Radio Universidad del Cauca station 104.1 fm, 'Cinema Radio', on air Saturdays at noon, in which are created thematic cycles.  They present news about cinema, 'the seventh art', and also discuss the history of film and audiovisual language. 
Talking about cinematographic production, there are some people who are working to strengthen the seventh art in the municipality.

== Transport ==
Popayan has one commercial airport, [[Guillermo León Valencia Airport]], served by [[Avianca]].

== Climate ==
Popayán has a humid but relatively mild [[tropical climate]], more specifically a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Am) that is close to being a [[subtropical highland climate]], though unusually the driest months from June to August are opposite to when they would be expected, given that the city is actually north of the [[equator]].

'''Principlism''' is a system of ethics based on the four moral principles of:

1. Autonomy—free-will or agency, 

2. Beneficence—do good, 

3. Nonmaleficence—do no harm, and 

4. Justice—social distribution of benefits and burdens.

Advocates for principlism argue that from the beginning of recorded history most moral decision-makers descriptively and prescriptively have used these four moral principles; that they are part of or compatible with most intellectual, religious, and cultural beliefs.

==Principlism formalized into national and international law==

Principlism was first formalized as a moral decision-making approach by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in a document called the [[Belmont Report]] on April 18, 1979. The Commission came into existence on July 12, 1974 when the [[National Research Act]] (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law. After four years of monthly deliberations, the Commission met in February 1976 for four days at the Smithsonian Institution’s Belmont Conference Center which resulted in a statement of the basic ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice, for biomedical and behavioral research. The Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety as a statement of the Department’s policy for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.

The Belmont Report’s cause of origin can be traced back to December 9, 1946 when the American Military Tribunal started criminal proceedings against 23 German physicians and administrators for [[war crime]]s and [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. During the trials, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was drafted for the establishment of standards for judging individuals who conducted biomedical experiments on [[Internment|concentration camp]] prisoners. The Nuremberg Code in its final form was established in 1948 and was the first international document that advocated voluntary [[informed consent]] for participants of research on human subjects.

==Belmont report and its three core principles==

Principlism is a moral approach based on judgments that are generally accepted by most intellectual, cultural and religious traditions. For example, the Belmont Report defines 3 key principles by which to judge the ethicality of biomedical and behavioral research.  These principles are:

1. Respect for persons—Autonomy,

2. Beneficence—do good, and

3. Justice—specifically distributive justice wherein those who bear the burdens of research also receive its benefits.

==Principlism as a practical approach==

Principlism has evolved into a practical approach for ethical decision-making that focuses on the common ground moral principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.

==Specifying and balancing==

Once these principles have been established the practical activity then becomes that of specifying how the principles are to be used in specific situations and balancing the principles with the other competing moral principles. In using this approach, every moral decision will be dilemmatic in that the agent will be to some degree either morally right and morally wrong under a single principle, and/or there will be two or more competing moral principles and the agent will not be able to completely fulfill one or more moral principles without violating or competing with one or more other moral principles. Dilemmatic decision-making is not unusual when making pluralistic social decisions. The Bill of Rights in [[United States Constitution|the United States Constitution]] perfectly exemplifies this process. A citizen’s [[freedom of speech]], for example, does not allow someone to yell “FIRE” in a crowded theater when there is no fire as individual [[Constitutional right|Constitutional Rights]] and Liberties are constrained by other [[individual rights]] and liberties and therefore they must be specified for specific situations and then balanced with the other inevitable competing principles. 

Principlism, presented as a formal criterion, is a [[Linguistic prescription|description and prescription]] of moral decision-making with a deep and rich heritage that has yet to be formalized for pluralistic interdisciplinary groups. However, since most moral decision-making ultimately use this approach, in one form or another, moral decision making in pluralistic environments is possible as Principlism descriptively describes how people do in fact make moral decisions and prescriptively prescribes how people ought to act based on the intersubjective agreements of common morality. Instead of focusing on the epistemic differences of various philosophical and religious perspectives, Principlism focuses on the intersubjective agreements, and that is why it works so effectively in interdisciplinary pluralistic environments.

Principlism could be modified by adding or subtracting certain component principles yet practically the four principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice are broad and comprehensive enough to sufficiently cover most cases and will provide the necessary output power for making interdisciplinary moral decisions.

==Incommensurable beliefs==

Even though pluralistic groups will in large part have shared universal values—Principlism, it is still clearly recognized that there is and will be incommensurable beliefs as to how the specification and balancing procedures found in the principlistic approach ought to be implemented. However, Principlism has the advantage over most other moral approaches in that Principlism emphasizes the shared interdisciplinary [[universal values]] or principles and uses them in a systematic and transparent fashion resulting in a greater shared understanding and/or compromise. Certainly, Principlism does not claim to be able to solve all moral dilemmas caused by conflicts of beliefs, yet Principlism, without a doubt, has tremendous output power for practicing interdisciplinary moral decision-making. 

==Unified approach==

Principlism is unified approach in that each [[Morality|moral principle]] seems to converge into each of the other three principles. For example, it can be argued that Principlism, as a comprehensive moral approach, is just another term for justice. To the extent that justice is socially valued because of how it effectively establishes autonomy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence, both personally and socially, it can be argued that Principlism only needs its fourth principle—justice, in order to fulfill its moral function. However, this argument can also be made with regards to each of the four principles as each principle seems to be able to include each of the other three principles. Personal autonomy results in the maximization of personal benefits—beneficence and the minimization of personal burdens—nonmaleficence within a legitimate social structure—justice. Likewise, nonmaleficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, beneficence, and justice and beneficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, nonmaleficence, and justice. 

The fact that each of the four principles can be argued to be the supreme moral principle further validates the Principlistic approach towards moral decision-making. In other words, Principlism is a unified moral approach in which the addition of each principle strengthens the legitimacy of each of the other principles to the extent that each principle is specified and balanced using independent criteria and yet each principle still supports each of the other principles. 

Science illustrates the importance and necessity of such unification. For example, if several academically distinct fields converge on a unified position that would generally give more credence towards that position. On the other hand, if one [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] has a hypothesis that contradicts several or all of the other academic disciplines, then that would be reason either to reject that hypothesis or at least to give it some pause. One example of such unification would be the comparison of evolution vs. [[creationism]]. Evolution converges in several academic fields such as Biology, Microbiology, Astronomy, Cosmology, Geology, Paleontology, Oceanography, Pathology, Medicine, Anthropology, and more. Creationism, on the other hand, is based on the non-academic discipline of [[Faith|religious faith]] and is not supported by any of the empirical academic disciplines. As a result, creationism does not have the same academic stature as evolution and is therefore not considered as a plausible option by any of the empirical or rational academic disciplines. Therefore, other than creationism being a curious sociological, anthropological, or psychological phenomena of culture, religion, and/or belief, creationism has no place in academic empirical rational discourse. Of course academic sciences are by definition limited to empirical and rational discourses and some knowledge is clearly not of that category.  For example, intersubjective experiences of [[sense data]] such as: sight, taste, smell, touch, hearing, and emotional states such as: love, and faith, are real and true experiences yet they elude rational and/or empirical quantification. However, since creationism claims to be an academic empirical conclusion, then it is legitimate to hold creationism to academic standards of universal academic consistency. 

Principlism validates itself with its universally recognized moral principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. These principles are distinct moral attributes that converge and unifies moral decision-making even within pluralistic environments.

==Goal of moral decision-making==

The goal in moral decision-making is ultimately to specify and balance each of the four principles recognizing that there is no set hierarchical order of principles in that one or more moral principle may override one or more other moral principles depending on the circumstances. Specifying is the narrowing down or making the broad moral principles relevant for a particular decision and balancing is the attempt to maximize, as much as possible, all of the contributing or competing moral principles.

==Applying principlism==

The following is an approach that can be used towards applying Principlism to a particular case.

'''DETERMINE THE RELEVANT PARTIES'''
       a.	SPECIFYING THE RELEVANT PARTIES:
                i.	Positive rights: (Obligation of others to provide something)
                        1.	Subject, guardian, or [[Social organisation|social institutions]]
                        2.	Relatives
                        3.	Community
                        4.	State government
                        5.	Federal government
                        6.	International government
                        7.	Other
                 ii.	Negative rights: (Obligation of others to not interfere)
                         1.	Subject, guardian, or social institutions
                         2.	Relatives
                         3.	Community
                         4.	State government
                         5.	Federal government
                         6.	International government
                         7.	Other
        b.	BALANCING THE RELEVANT PARTIES: 
                 If appropriate put the relevant parties in hierarchical order, and/or indicate if one or more party has more compelling interests over one or more of the others. 
 
'''I.	AUTONOMY'''
        a.	'''SPECIFYING AUTONOMY:''' (Relate to [[negative and positive rights]] if relevant)
                i.	Personal Authorization
                       1.	Intention: usually communicated by Express, Implied, or Tacit Consent
                       2.	Substantial knowledge: usually provided using the Professional Practice Standard, [[Reasonable person|Reasonable Person]] Standard, or Subjective Standard
                       3.	Substantial freedom: usually effected by such aspects as Persuasion, Coercion, and Manipulation
               ii.	Institutional Authorization
                       1.	Intention: usually implemented by a signed document
                       2.	Substantial knowledge: usually provided by a written document based on the Professional Practice Standard and/or the Reasonable Person Standard
                       3.	Substantial freedom: If the document is not signed then the services are usually not provided 
         b.  '''BALANCING AUTONOMY:''' 
             Balance the above by putting the obligations in hierarchical order, and/or by indicating if one has a more [[Strict scrutiny|compelling interest]] over the other.
 
'''II.	NONMALEFICENCE'''
        a.	'''SPECIFYING NONMALEFICENCE:'''
                i.	What are the burdens of the various options for the subject and/or relevant parties? 
                ii.	What personal and [[social rights]] need to be considered?
                        1.	Positive rights: Obligation(s) of others for preventing or alleviating a harm
                        2.	Negative rights: Obligation(s) of others to not interfere in a potential or actual harm
        b.  '''BALANCING NONMALEFICENCE:''' 
            Balance the above by putting the obligations in hierarchical order, and/or by indicating if one has a more compelling interest over the other. 

'''III.	BENEFICENCE'''
        a.	'''SPECIFYING BENEFICENCE:'''
                i.	What are the benefits of the various options for the subject and/or relevant parties?
                ii.	What personal and social rights need to be considered? 
                        1.	Positive rights: Obligations of others for providing a potential or actual benefit
                        2.	Negative rights: Obligations of others to not interfering in a potential or actual benefit
        b.  '''BALANCING BENEFICENCE:''' 
            Balance the above by putting the obligations in hierarchical order, and/or by indicating if one has a more compelling interest over the other.
 
'''IV.	JUSTICE''' 
        a.	'''SPECIFYING JUSTICE:''' 
                i.	What are the legal or [[social issues]] with regards to the subject and/or relevant parties? 
                        1.	[[Personal rights|Personal Rights]] and Liberties as provided by the State, Federal, or International social structures
                        2.	Social Rights and Liberties as provided by the State, Federal, or International social structures
                        3.	[[Political Rights]] and Liberties as provided by the State, Federal, or International social structures
                 ii.	How do the above issues relate to positive rights (obligations of others to provide) and negative rights (obligations of others to not interfere)?
        b.  '''BALANCING JUSTICE:''' 
            Balance the above by putting them in hierarchical order, and/or by indicating if one has a more compelling interest over the other.

'''BALANCING THE FOUR PRINCIPLES'''
        a.	     How many of the four principles are relevant for this case?
        b.	In this particular case, which principles are most influential and why?
        c.	Is it possible to maximize most or all of the four principles or do one or more of them override one or more of the others and why?

'''CONCLUSION'''

Summarize the specification and balancing within each of the four principles and then summarize the reasoning behind the balancing of the four principles and present the reasons why the chosen moral decision would have a higher probability of accomplishing the balancing end rather than some other decision.

==Plot==
{{main|List of Rosario + Vampire characters}}
[[File:Yokai Academy.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Yokai Academy, the main setting of ''Rosario + Vampire'']]
[[Tsukune Aono]] is an average teenager who is unable to get into any local high schools due to his poor grades. As a last ditch effort to secure his education, his parents enroll him in a private school called Yokai Academy, which he discovers is a boarding school for monsters. The school teaches monsters how to coexist with humans, including disguising as them, but any real humans found on campus are to be killed. Although he fears for his life, Tsukune befriends a beautiful vampire girl named [[Moka Akashiya]], who enjoys his company and especially the taste of his blood. During a fight with a school bully, Tsukune accidentally removes the [[rosary|rosario]] around Moka's neck, and discovers that she transforms into a powerful vampire with a completely different personality.

Because of Moka, Tsukune decides to stay at Yokai. He befriends formerly antagonistic students, including a succubus [[Kurumu Kurono]] and a child prodigy witch [[Yukari Sendo]]. They join the school's Newspaper Club and wind up fighting a variety of students and teachers, who use their monstrous powers to bully or to control one or more of the members for their own selfish or destructive ends. On a club trip to the human world, they meet a witch, [[Ruby Tojo]], who defends a field of sunflowers from being torn down by developers. They meet [[Mizore Shirayuki]], a [[yuki-onna|snow fairy]] student who becomes Tsukune's "stalker". A group of "[[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Monstrels|Monstrels]]" harass the club, causing Moka to transfuse blood into Tsukune to the point where he turns into a [[ghoul]]. Ruby, having recovered from injuries, joins the school's staff as the Headmaster's assistant. An evil group called the [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Anti-Schoolers|Anti-Schoolers]] threaten to break down the barrier between the human and monster worlds. When Tsukune's cousin manages to sneak onto the school grounds, the club has a hard time keeping the monster school a secret. When the school is temporary closed because of damage, Tsukune returns home to the human world only to have Moka, Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore follow him and hide in his room.

In ''Rosario+Vampire: Season II'', Moka's younger sister [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Koko Shuzen|Koko Shuzen]] enrolls. She, Ruby, and Mizore join the Newspaper Club. On an excursion to Mizore's homeland, they learn of a dangerous organization called [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Fairy Tale|Fairy Tale]], which seeks to destroy the human world. The Newspaper Club visits the human world where they meet [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#San Otonashi|San Otonashi]], a former club member, and run into trouble with adversaries from Fairy Tale's 7th Branch office. Chinese transfer student [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Fangfang Huang|Fangfang Huang]] tries to recruit Tsukune to join his mafia family. When Moka spends a school day as her inner personality, she is unable to return to the seal, so the Newspaper Club heads to China to get her rosario fixed.

At Hong Kong, Tsukune and the gang learn the truth about Moka's identity: she was infused with First Ancestor blood by her mother [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Akasha Bloodriver|Akasha Bloodriver]], who sacrificed herself to protect them from [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Alucard|Alucard]], the original First Ancestor vampire. Moka's eldest sister [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Aqua Shuzen|Aqua]] infiltrates the Huang manor and captures Moka to bring to Fairy Tale, which suspects that Moka is the key to reviving Alucard. While his friends train their powers, Tsukune has his body altered by [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Tohofuhai|Tohofuhai]] to handle the upcoming challenges.

Tsukune and the gang infiltrate the Hanging Garden: a sky fortress that serves as Fairy Tale's headquarters. They face opposition from their leader and matriarch of the Shuzen family [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Gyokuro Shuzen|Gyokuro Shuzen]], who sends the leaders of the Fairy Tale Branches after them for a series of fights. The group eventually reaches Moka, but must face her sisters Aqua and [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Kahlua Shuzen|Kalua]]. Gyokuro snatches Moka's rosario in order to control Alucard. A character called the [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Masked King|Masked King]] reveals himself to be a clone of Alucard's original vampire form. He reveals that he has manipulated both Fairy Tale and its opposition to determine whether the rosario could control him, and then merges with his monster self, who goes on a rampage in Tokyo.

Moka is mortally wounded, but Tsukune revives her by removing all his holy locks and transforming himself into a First Ancestor vampire. They beat down Alucard, but he revives and reveals that he has hatched eggs in Japan's major cities. Tsukune's friends and allies, along with the two other Dark Lords, band together to fight Alucard and his clones. Tsukune puts Moka's rosario on Alucard, which awakens Akasha inside his monster body. Akasha tells Alucard to give up the fight, and they cast a self-disintegration spell. Now that the existence of monsters is known in the human world, coexistence is now even harder to achieve, however, Tsukune is confident that he and his friends can do it.

== Conception ==
Ikeda drew inspiration from the monster manga series ''[[Kaibutsu-kun]]'' and has incorporated some references later into the first serialization of the ''Rosario+Vampire'' manga. In an interview at [[Lucca Comics &amp; Games|Lucca Comics]] 2012, Ikeda said he is a big fan of [[Tim Burton]] and was inspired by his works, including ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and particularly ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' because the monster has a sensitive soul. His first character design was Moka, a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix around her neck; he then created the school of monsters and Tsukune afterwards. He credits the beautiful girls for the series' popularity and added the fighting elements.

Carlo Santos of [[Anime News Network]] gave the first volume of ''Season II'' a C rating and the second volume a B- rating.&lt;ref name= Dororororosario&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2010-04-13| work=Right Turn Only!! | title= Dororororosario!! | publisher= [[Anime News Network]] |date= April 13, 2010 | accessdate= September 27, 2011 | last=Santos |first= Carlo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black Jack"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2010-08-03 | title=Paint it Black Jack | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | work=Right Turn Only!! | date= August 3, 2010 | accessdate= September 27, 2011 | last=Santos | first=Carlo}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he gave volume 1 a C, he stated that "you could do a lot worse".&lt;ref name= Dororororosario /&gt; He felt that ''Season II'' has all the things that made the series good, but the attempt to reboot the series for the new semester caused it to lack intense feeling, reintroducing all the characters and going against weak enemies once again.&lt;ref name= Dororororosario /&gt; For the second volume, Santos was more pleased with the introduction of a major villain and the fanservice artwork in the lighter story, but lamented the lack of any visually threatening monster.&lt;ref name="Black Jack" /&gt;

Matthew Warner of Mania.com gave volumes 1 through 3 of ''Season II'' ratings between B+ and A-. In his review for volume 1, he felt the first part was a bit weak with "predictable and bland stories," but remarked positively on the volume's cover art and artwork in general, especially the character artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-01_article_121263.html | title= Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #01 | publisher= Mania | date= June 28, 2010 | accessdate= September 28, 2011 | last= Warner | first= Matthew | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131215210125/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-01_article_121263.html | archivedate= December 15, 2013 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second volume, he said it was better focusing on two stories and while noting the second story with [[Kokoa Shuzen|Kokoa]] was weaker, it still delivers “quite a few solid laughs" and helps develop her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-02_article_123466.html | title= Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #02 | publisher= Mania | date= August 12, 2010 | accessdate= September 28, 2011 | last= Warner | first= Matthew | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121011075525/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-02_article_123466.html | archivedate= October 11, 2012 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for volume 3, he stated while it starts out slow, he really enjoyed the story with Mizore, specifically the character development and seeing the characters put aside their disagreements for a common goal: to save Mizore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-03_article_127579.html | title=Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #03 | publisher=Mania | date=March 11, 2011 | accessdate=September 28, 2011 | author=Warner, Matthew | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224050205/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-03_article_127579.html | archivedate=December 24, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave volumes of ''Season II'' an A- rating.  He opined the emphases on sexual innuendo, comparing it to ''[[Strawberry 100%]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/rosariovampireseasontwo003.html |title= Rosario+Vampire: Season II Volume 3 | work=Comic Book Bin |date=February 17, 2011 | accessdate= October 28, 2011 | last= Douresseaux|first=Leroy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/rosariovampire204.html |title= Rosario+Vampire: Season II Volume 4 | publisher=Comic Book Bin |date=April 1, 2011 | accessdate= October 28, 2011 | last=Douresseaux|first=Leroy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the series is like ''[[The Addams Family]]'' mixed with ''[[X-Men]]'': "cool, creepy folks at a secret school where they can live and learn in a place free of the prejudice against them." In volume 11, he changed his overall view and deemed it solidly a battle manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/rosariovampireseasontwo011.html |title= Rosario+Vampire: Season II Volume 11 manga review |work= Comic Book Bin |date= 2013-03-05 | first=Leroy | last= Douresseaux |accessdate= 2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''Semiotic democracy''' is a phrase first coined by [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], a [[media studies]] [[professor]], in his seminal media studies book ''Television Culture'' (1987).&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;John Fiske, ''Television Culture'' (Routledge, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Fiske defined the term as the "delegation of the production of meanings and pleasures to [television's] viewers."&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt;{{rp|236}} Fiske discussed how rather than being passive couch potatoes that absorbed information in an unmediated way, viewers actually gave their own meanings to the shows they watched that often differed substantially from the meaning intended by the show's producer.

Subsequently, this term was appropriated by the technical and legal community in the context of any re-working of [[cultural imagery]] by someone who is not the original author. Examples include [[fan fiction]] and [[slash fiction]].

Legal scholars are concerned that just as technology eases the process of cheaply making and distributing derivative works imbued with new cultural meanings available to wide public, [[copyright]] and [[right-to-publicity]] law is clamping down on and limiting these works, thus reducing their promulgation, and limiting semiotic democracy.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Siva Vaidhyanathan, 'Critical Information Studies: A Bibliographic Manifesto' (2006) 20 ''Cultural Studies'' 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. [[Terry Fisher]] of [[Harvard Law School]] has written about semiotic democracy in the context of the crisis facing the entertainment industry and in terms of the ability of people to use the Internet in creative new ways.&lt;ref&gt;William W Fisher, ''Promises to Keep: Technology, Law and the Future of Entertainment'' (Stanford University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3763">The {{Nihongo|'''Seventeen-article constitution'''|十七条憲法|jūshichijō kenpō||}} is, according to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' of 720, a document authored by [[Prince Shōtoku]] in 604.&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Aston, trans., Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697, 2 vols. in 1 (London: Keagan and Co., 1896), vol. 2, pp. 128–133.&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in the reign of [[Empress Suiko]]. The emphasis of the document is not so much on the basic laws by which the state was to be governed, such as one may expect from a modern [[constitution]], but rather it was a highly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] document that focused on the morals and virtues that were to be expected of government officials and the emperor's subjects to ensure a smooth running of the state, where the emperor was to be regarded as the highest authority.&lt;ref&gt;William Theodore de Bary, ed. ''Sources of Japanese Tradition, Volume One: From Earliest Times to 1600'' Columbia University Press; 2nd edition (2002), vol. 1, pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest constitutions in history.

==Excerpts from the articles==
*Harmony is to be valued, and the avoidance of wanton opposition to be honoured. 
*Sincerely revere the [[Three Jewels|three treasures]]: the Buddha, Dharma (his Teaching), and Sangha (Buddhist Community).
*When you receive the Imperial commands, fail not scrupulously to obey them. 
*The Ministers and functionaries should make decorous behaviour their leading principle, for the leading principle of the government of the people consists in decorous behaviour. 
*Chastise that which is evil and encourage that which is good. 
*To turn away from that which is private, and to turn towards that which is public 
*Let every man have his own charge, and let not the spheres of duty be confused. 
*Decisions on important matters should not be made by one person alone.

==Validity==
The degree to which the document matches the definition of a "[[constitution]]" is debated. While it introduces principles of governance much like the preamble of modern constitutions such as the [[United States Constitution]], it lacks other elements commonly expected. As William Theodore de Bary writes, “Prince Shotoku's ‘constitution’, placed more emphasis on basic moral and spiritual values than on the detailed codification of laws and their enforcement".&lt;ref&gt;William Theodore de Bary. “The Constitutional Tradition in China,” Journal of Chinese Law. Vol. 9, No. 7 (1995), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

This constitution remained valid until [[Ritsuryō]] went into effect in the late seventh century. It is frequently argued that those aspects not contradicted by any subsequent legislation were still considered valid in 1890, and remain so today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://veryasian.weebly.com/prince-shotoku.html Prince Shotoku on Simply Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-1182/604-The-Seventeen-Article-Constitution-of-Japan.aspx The 17 Article Constitution on Duhaime.org ]&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative commentator Kase Hideaki also argues that because it has never been explicitly abolished, it is still partially valid.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10860">Attitudes towards '''sexuality in the United States''' has had an assorted approach depending on both the region in the country and the specific time period.

==History==
The United States during the [[early modern period]] has a reputation for sexual impermissiveness, partyly due to influence from the Puritans. During the Victorian era romance was increasingly viewed as a key component of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/10/21/the-puritans-really-loved-having-sex/|title=The Puritans really loved having sex|date=21 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s are often viewed as the period wherein the US underwent a substantial change in perception of sexual norms, with a substantial increase in extramarital relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spielvogel|first1=Jackson|title=Western Civilization: Volume II: Since 1500|date=2016|page=897}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of the interwar period suggests that prudish attitudes were more pronounced among women than among men with 47% in a poll describing pre-marital sex as wicked while only 28% of men said the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bowmanmarsico/2018/01/03/is-premarital-sex-wicked-changing-attitudes-about-morality/|title=Is Premarital Sex Wicked? Changing Attitudes About Morality|first=Karlyn|last=Bowman|date=2018|website=www.forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Some scholars argue that American media is the most sexually suggestive in the world.&lt;ref name="Strasburger"&gt;Victor C. Strasburger, MD (2005). "Adolescents, Sex, and the Media: Ooooo, Baby, Baby – a Q &amp; A". Adolesc Med. 16 (2): 269–288.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, the sexual messages contained in film, television, and music are becoming more explicit in dialog, lyrics, and behavior. In addition, these messages may contain unrealistic, inaccurate, and misleading information. Some scholars argue that still developing teens may be particularly vulnerable to media effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gruber|first1=Enid|last2=Grube|first2=Joel|title=Adolescent Sexuality and the Media|journal=Western Journal of Medicine|date=March 2000|volume=172|series=3|pages=210–214|doi=10.1136/ewjm.172.3.210|pmc=1070813}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 report found that teens rank the media second only to school sex education programs as a leading source of information about sex,&lt;ref&gt;American Academy Of Pediatrics. Committee On Public Education, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (January 2001). "Sexuality, Contraception, and the Media". Pediatrics. 107 (1): 191–1994&lt;/ref&gt; but a 2004 report found that "the media far outranked parents or schools as the source of information about birth control."&lt;ref name="Strasburger" /&gt;

Media often portray emotional side-effects of sexuality such as guilt, and disappointment, but less often physical risks such as pregnancy or STDs.&lt;ref name="Roberts et al."&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Roberts| author2=Henriksen| author3=Foehr| last-author-amp=yes| title=Adolescence,adolescents, and media| journal=Handbook of Adolescent Sexuality| edition=3rd| year=2009| volume=2| pages=314–344| doi=10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy002010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One media analysis found that sex was usually between unmarried couples and examples of using condoms or other contraception were "extremely rare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/22/pressandpublishing.broadcasting|title=Media 'influence' adolescent sex|first=Sam|last=Jones|date=22 March 2006|website=the Guardian|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of programs or films do not depict consequence for sexual behavior. For example, only 10% programs that contain sexual scenes include any warnings to the potential risks or responsibilities of having sex such as sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/thmedia/view.cgi?section=medialiteracy&amp;page=fastfacts|title=Teen Health and the Media|author=|date=|website=depts.washington.edu|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In television programing aimed at teens, more than 90% of episodes had at least one sexual reference in it with an average of 7.9 references per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Stevens Aubrey (2004). "Sex and Punishment: An Examination of Sexual Consequences and the Sexual Double Standard in Teen Programming". Sex Roles. 50 (7–8): 505–514&lt;/ref&gt;

However, government statistics suggest that since 1991, both teen sex and teen pregnancy have declined dramatically despite the media generally becoming increasingly sexually explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childstats.gov/americaschildren/beh4.asp|title=Childstats.gov - America's Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 2017 - Sexual Activity|author=|date=|website=childstats.gov|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have said that this points to an inclination among latter millenials and Generation Z to have hyposexual and desexualized tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Twenge, Jean M., Ryne A. Sherman, and Brooke E. Wells. "Declines in sexual frequency among American adults, 1989–2014." Archives of sexual behavior 46.8 (2017): 2389-2401.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
In 2016, roughly 4.1% of American adults identified themselves as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.&lt;ref name=gallup&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/201731/lgbt-identification-rises.aspx|title=In US, More Adults Identifying as LGBT|date=11 January 2017|website=Gallup}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 99% of the adult U.S. population is allosexual (experiences sexual desires) while 1% is the opposite, asexual (experiences no sexual desires).&lt;ref&gt;Yule, Morag A., Lori A. Brotto, and Boris B. Gorzalka. "Sexual fantasy and masturbation among asexual individuals: An in-depth exploration." Archives of sexual behavior 46.1 (2017): 311-328.&lt;/ref&gt; One study has shown that there is no correlation between sexlessness and unhappiness, with sexually active and sexually inactive adult Americans showing roughly equal amounts of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10508-017-0968-7 |pmid=28275930 |title=Sociodemographic Correlates of Sexlessness Among American Adults and Associations with Self-Reported Happiness Levels: Evidence from the U.S. General Social Survey |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=46 |issue=8 |pages=2403–2415 |year=2017 |last1=Kim |first1=Jean H |last2=Tam |first2=Wilson S |last3=Muennig |first3=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vicenarian women are slightly more likely to engage in infidelity than vicenarian men at 11 to 10 per cent respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/millennial-women-are-cheating-more-than-millennial-men-a-new-survey-finds-7873841|title=Young Women Are Cheating More Than Young Men Today &amp; Here's The Reason Why|first=Natalia|last=Lusinski|date=|website=bustle.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Sexual relations are typically legal in the United States if there is no direct or unmediated exchange of money, if it is consensual, teleiophilic (between adults) and nonconsanguineous i.e. between people who are not related familially or by kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Pullman, Lesleigh E., et al. "Differences between biological and sociolegal incest offenders: A meta-analysis." Aggression and violent behavior 34 (2017): 228-237.&lt;/ref&gt; There are however exceptions, with for instance adult incestual relations being legal in states such as New jersey and Rhode island as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Peter. "Sibling sexual abuse: why don't we talk about it?." Journal of clinical nursing 26.15-16 (2017): 2482-2494&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the state of Nevada licenses several of its counties to operate brothels and permits sex workers to sell sex, and janes and johns to purchase sex.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, Cecilia, et al. "Prostitution Stigma and Its Effect on the Working Conditions, Personal Lives, and Health of Sex Workers." The Journal of Sex Research (2017): 1-15.
&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be exceptions to age of consent laws in age gap laws, with some states permitting an ephebophilic relationship if the two persons are close in age.&lt;ref&gt;Parra, Diana Carave. Prosecutorial Discretion and Punishment Motives in Ambiguous Juvenile Sex Offense Cases. Diss. Arizona State University, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern==
The 21st century saw increasingly permissive attitudes towards homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=David|title=21st-Century Gay Culture|date=2009|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; however many laws continued to be [[heteronormative]].&lt;ref&gt;Paredes, Audrey Darlene. "US Central Americans: reconstructing memories, struggles, and communities of resistance." InterActions: UCLA Journal of Education and Information Studies 14.1 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;  One survey has found that millennials, on average, have sex less frequently than previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pilotonline.com/life/tbd/americans-are-having-less-sex-than-they-once-did/article_d996a62b-705f-5911-9724-c5eed370e38e.html|title=Americans are having less sex than they once did|first=Tara Bahrampour  The Washington|last=Post|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to some analysts ruminating on a moral panic wherein young adults of the 2010s decade are uninterested in sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10508-016-0798-z |pmid=27480753 |title=Sexual Inactivity During Young Adulthood is More Common Among U.S. Millennials and iGen: Age, Period, and Cohort Effects on Having No Sexual Partners After Age 18 |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=433–440 |year=2016 |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M |last2=Sherman |first2=Ryne A |last3=Wells |first3=Brooke E }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to OKCupid, [[Portland, Oregon]] is the most promiscuous city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/top-10-most-promiscuous-cities-in-the-us/10/|title=Top 10 most promiscuous cities in the U.S.|date=6 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that Americans in general have more prudistic and coitophobic attitudes to sex than Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, Elaine, and Richard L. Rapson. "Historical and cross-cultural perspectives on passionate love and sexual desire." Annual Review of Sex Research 4.1 (1993): 67-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical data from some dating services show that black women and Asian men are the least desired categories of people.&lt;ref&gt;Strubel, Jessica, and Trent A. Petrie. "Love me Tinder: Body image and psychosocial functioning among men and women." Body image 21 (2017): 34-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Some data has shown that the most popular search terms on pornographic websites include fauxcestual themes such as ''step-mom'' and ''step-sister'', as well as ''teen'' and ''lesbian''.&lt;ref&gt;MacInnis, Cara C., and Gordon Hodson. "Do American states with more religious or conservative populations search more for sexual content on Google?." Archives of Sexual Behavior 44.1 (2015): 137-147&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2490">The '''Spool-shaped pxis''' (NAMA 5225) is a ceramic vessel from the [[bronze age]] [[Cycladic civilisation]]. The "dark on light" painted [[Pyxis_(vessel)|pyxis]] was found in grave 271 of the necropolis at [[Chalandriani]] on the [[Cycladic island]] of [[Syros]] and dates to the early Cycladic period (EC II, [[Keros-Syros culture]]). It was discovered in 1889/90 during excavations led by [[Christos Tsountas]] and as first published by Tsountas in 1899. It is displayed in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]] with the inventory number 5225.

== Description ==
[[File:Pyxis_ECII_NAMA_080763.jpg|thumb|Spool-shaped Pyxis (NAMA 5225)]]
The pyxis is a unique ceramic object with an unusual shape. It consists of two nearly identical parts which sit one inside the other. The red-brown clay is very fine with no coarse grains. On the upper side is a pattern in red and brown paint. Similar patterns are found at Chalandriani on contemporary pyxides, which are rounder and have double eyelet handles.

On the upperside of the pyxis is a geometrical pattern in "dark on light" paint. Both parts consist of a flat, circular sheet with an open cylinder rising from it. The upper part has a larger diameter which allows it to be placed over the lower part. The overlapping area of the upper and lower parts is perforated with a pair of holes.

The upper part has a height of 4.95 cm and a diameter of 12.6 cm. The sides and underside of the flat part are painted with a similar pattern to the top surface. The lower part has a height of 4.8 cm and a diameter which varies between 12. and 12.1 cm. The exterior surface of the lower part has a pattern similar to the upper part; inside there are three parallel curves, one inside the other.

The '''English Access Microscholarship Program''' is an international project that was created by the [[U.S Department of State]] aimed at helping teens (13–20 years-old) from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to have better opportunities in employment, education, and life in general. Access promotes skills and knowledge in the [[English language]], as well as giving students the ability to compete and participate in future exchanges and study in the [[United States]].

Each student receives 128 hours of instructions per year. It consists of 4 hours per week, for a total of 32 weeks, plus 72 hours of intensive two-week summer program each year. Approximately 95,000 students in more than 85 countries have participated in the Access Program since its founding in 2004.

== Objectives ==
The principal objective of Access is to change the life of the students, improving their social skills and leadership. It develops social awareness about the country's problems, and how they can solve them as well. Although learning a new language can be difficult, Access tries to improve the system of learning and makes it part of the student's life, not as an obligation.

Access seeks to help disadvantaged teens to improve their English language skills. To achieve this, the program is free of charge to participating students. Furthermore, materials (books, paper, markers, etc.) are provided by the American Embassy.

== Requirements ==
To apply to this scholarship, the students must live outside of the United States and be between the ages of 13 and 20.

"'''Two'''" is the season 3 premiere and 66th episode overall of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

The [[The Twilight Zone (radio series)|radio adaptation]] of this episode starred [[Don Johnson]] in the [[Charles Bronson]] role.

==Opening narration==

{{cquote |This is a jungle, a monument built by nature honoring disuse, commemorating a few years of nature being left to its own devices. But it's another kind of jungle, the kind that comes in the aftermath of man's battles against himself. Hardly an important battle, not a Gettysburg, or a Marne, or an Iwo Jima; more like one insignificant corner patch in the crazy quilt of combat. But it was enough to end the existence of this little city.

It's been five years since a human being walked these streets. This is the first day of the sixth year, as man used to measure time. The time: perhaps 100 years from now, or sooner—or perhaps it already happened 2 million years ago. The place: the signposts are in English so that we may read them more easily, but the place is the Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot==
A female soldier ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) wearing a tattered uniform stumbles into a deserted city. She looks into some of the shop windows before spying what was a restaurant. She finds a can of chicken in the kitchen, but before she can open it, a man ([[Charles Bronson]]) wearing a worn uniform tunic walks in. She attacks him. The man knocks her out and begins to ravenously eat the chicken. The man notices a [[dove]], which flies away.

He leaves the restaurant and goes to a newsstand. A copy of the newspaper reveals that the city was evacuated during the war. He returns to the kitchen and wakes the woman by dumping a pot of water on her face. He says there is no reason to fight anymore and that she can have the leftover chicken, but eventually realizes that she cannot understand [[English language|English]] and departs. The woman is wary, but eats the chicken. She then follows him into a barber shop and watches as he shaves. He tosses a bar of soap to her, then a towel, which she uses to wash her dirty face. They wander down the street, coming to a movie theater. He stares at a poster for a wartime romance film and turns to smile at her. They find the skeletal remains of soldiers at the theater entrance and suddenly grab the rifles of the dead owners, simultaneously aiming at each other.

After a tense moment, the man turns and walks away, slinging his weapon over his shoulder. The woman follows him, and the two walk along the city street. They stop in front of a store with a dress in the smashed display window and she mutters "''pryekrasnyy'' ''(прекрасный)'', the Russian word for "beautiful". He hands the dress to her and tells her to go and put it on. She enters the building, which turns out to be a recruiting office. As she prepares to change into the dress, she notices the [[jingoistic]] enlistment posters on the wall. She grabs her rifle, exits the office and angrily shoots at him twice, but misses. The man gets up, looks at her incredulously, and walks away. As night falls, she returns to the barber shop to sleep in the barber's chair, staring at the dress.

The next morning, the man has changed out of his uniform into a makeshift tuxedo and has found two jars of peaches. He sees the woman waiting, peeking at him from behind a truck in the street below. He yells at her to leave. She emerges from behind the truck wearing the dress. He tosses one of the jars to her and says "''pryekrasnyy''". She smiles, and they walk away together.

==Closing narration==

{{cquote |This has been ... a love story, about two lonely people who found each other ... in the Twilight Zone.}}

==Music==
An abbreviated version of the music for this episode, composed by [[Nathan Van Cleave]], served as the basis for the opening and closing music for the radio drama ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]''. The episode relies heavily on the music as there is very little dialogue throughout.

==Production notes==

This episode was filmed on the backlot of [[Hal Roach Studios]] in [[Culver City]], [[California]], which was falling apart due to mismanagement and disuse (the facilities were finally torn down in 1963). Very little set decoration was needed to create the illusion of an abandoned city. The interior bracing that holds up the facade is visible through the second story windows in the opening shots of the episode and the credits.

The sound for the "blaster" was taken from ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', where "Robbie the Robot" exclaims that a Earthman's weapon was "a simple blaster".{{cn|date=May 2017}}

The status of '''United States beef imports''' has been an issue in [[Taiwan–United States relations]]. Controversy has centered on cases of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE; commonly known as mad cow disease), and the use of [[ractopamine]] as an [[feed additive|additive]] in feeds.

The conflict has sometimes been called the "beef war" in the media,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/analysis/2012/02/15/331690/Mere-appearance.htm "Mere appearance of hurting farmers keeps US beef war alive"], ''[[China Post]]'', 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the UK–EU [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]] over BSE.

== Bans due to BSE ==
The discovery of a case of BSE in the United States in December 2003 caused the [[Council of Agriculture (Republic of China)|Council of Agriculture]] in Taiwan to ban the import of beef and lamb products from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvbs.com.tw/news/news_list.asp?no=jean20031224185641 |title=美狂牛症疑雲 即日禁止美國牛羊進口 (US mad cow disease confusion; beef, lamb imports banned as of today) |publisher=TVBS |date=24 December 2003 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was lifted in April 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.gov.tw/CHT2006/DM/DM2_p01.aspx?class_no=25&amp;now_fod_list_no=6830&amp;level_no=2&amp;doc_no=40731 |title=衛生署持續加強對美國進口牛肉輸入查驗 (DOH to continue strict inspection of beef imported from US) |publisher=Department of Health, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (Taiwan) |date=15 April 2005 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reapplied to beef in June 2005 when a second case of BSE was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20050626/1870638 |title=美國牛肉禁進口 不下架 (US beef: imports banned, sale still allowed) |work=Apple Daily |date=26 June 2005 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban was conditionally lifted in January 2006, with imports limited to deboned beef from cattle under 30 months old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.gov.tw/CHT2006/DM/DM2_p01.aspx?class_no=25&amp;now_fod_list_no=7940&amp;level_no=2&amp;doc_no=43606 |title=即日起有條件開放美國牛肉進口，相關單位加強查驗、積極管理 (US beef imports conditionally permitted as of today; relevant departments to employ strict inspection and proactive management) |publisher=Department of Health, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (Taiwan) |date=25 January 2006 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy over ractopamine ==
In October 2006, ractopamine was banned in Taiwan along with other [[beta-adrenergic agonist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gazette.nat.gov.tw/EG_FileManager/eguploadpub/eg012193/ch07/type1/gov62/num16/Eg.htm |title=行政院農業委員會公告 (Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan notice) |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, the [[Department of Health (Republic of China)|Department of Health]] announced that it was setting a limit on the level of residual ractopamine in meat products, effectively replacing the ban. This proved controversial, spurring protests from [[pig farming|pig farmers]] in Taiwan, and the ban was retained.&lt;ref name="cna"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://life.chinatimes.com/2009Cti/Channel/Life/life-article/0,5047,130518+132012020101533,00.html |title=瘦肉精解禁 美牛談判續集 (Ending ban on lean muscle growth-inducing drugs—sequel to US beef negotiations) |work=China Times |agency=Central News Agency |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the [[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Central News Agency]] reported that large quantities of beef imported from the US were being rejected every month due to residual ractopamine having been detected during inspection.&lt;ref name="cna" /&gt;

== Developments ==
In November 2009, limitations were relaxed to allow beef with bones still attached to be imported. The new rules also permitted the import of ground beef and internal organs, but it was intentionally made difficult or impossible through technical regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2009/new/nov/3/today-t1.htm |title=美帶骨牛肉開放 暫擋絞肉內臟 (US beef with bones allowed; ground meat, internal organs temporarily blocked) |work=Liberty Times |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change sparked a backlash in public opinion, and a bill was passed in the [[Legislative Yuan]] in January 2010 reinstating the ban on ground beef and internal organs.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/05/us-taiwan-usa-idUSTRE6041K220100105 |title=Taiwan blocks US beef imports, strains trade ties |agency=Reuters |date=5 January 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the Taiwanese government announced that it was moving toward conditionally unbanning ractopamine. While the drug would be granted a maximum residual level for beef, it would remain banned for pork, and the ban on the import of internal organs of cattle would remain in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E6%94%BF%E9%99%A2%E6%8F%90%E7%BE%8E%E7%89%9B16%E5%AD%97%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E6%96%B9%E5%90%91-%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E5%AE%B9%E8%A8%B1-%E7%89%9B%E8%B1%AC%E5%88%86%E9%9B%A2-%E5%BC%B7%E5%88%B6%E6%A8%99%E7%A4%BA-%E6%8E%92%E9%99%A4%E5%85%A7%E8%87%9F-145133588.html |title=政院提美牛16字政策方向 (Executive Yuan announces policy direction on US beef) |agency=Broadcasting Corporation of China |date=5 March 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2012, United States authorities reported that a dairy cow in California was found to be suffering from BSE, the first known case in the country in 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/26/us-usa-madcow-idUSBRE83N15B20120426 |title=Mad cow disease found in California; no human threat seen |agency=Reuters |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, on 27 April, legislators belonging to the opposition [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]], [[People First Party (Republic of China)|PFP]] and [[Taiwan Solidarity Union|TSU]] in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan raised a motion to vote on a proposal to temporarily ban the import of all beef from the United States, to remove US beef from store shelves, and to seal cases awaiting inspection at customs. The motion was narrowly defeated 44–45 when Legislative Yuan President [[Wang Jin-Pyng]] voted in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NATS1/7058018.shtml |title=全面禁美牛在野黨突襲 王金平1票逆轉 (Opposition parties propose blanket ban on US beef; Wang Jyn-Ping reverses situation with one vote) |publisher=United Daily News |date=28 April 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2012|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2012, the Legislative Yuan passed amendments to the Act Governing Food Sanitation, authorising government agencies to set safety standards for ractopamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/07/26/2003538652 |title=Legislature votes to allow ractopamine |work=Taipei Times |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this development, food safety and nutrition exports from the Department of Health agreed on a maximum residual level of 10&amp;nbsp;[[wikt:ppb|ppb]] for ractopamine in beef on 31 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/08/02/2003539254 |title=DOH experts choose ractopamine residue cap for beef imports |agency=CNA |work=Taiepei Times |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance to Taiwan–US relations ==
The United States government has made beef exports a key issue in bilateral trade with Taiwan. When the Taiwanese Legislative Yuan reinstated the ban on imports of ground beef and internal organs of cattle in January 2010, the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] (AIT) issued a statement saying that the action undermined Taiwan's credibility as a trading partner, and made future agreements on bilateral trade more difficult.&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt; On 27 June 2012, [[William Stanton (diplomat)|William Stanton]], director of the Taipei office of the AIT, said that the issue had become "the symbolic embodiment of Taiwan's protected markets", noting on the same occasion that "Taiwan must undertake very serious reform efforts" if it wanted to sign a [[free trade agreement]] with the United States or become a member of the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/06/28/2003536452 |title=US beef is political hostage: AIT boss |work=Taipei Times |date=28 June 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/business/2012/06/28/345831/End-to.htm |title=End to beef row vital to FTA with US: Stanton |work=China Post |date=28 June 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visionary art''' is [[art]] that purports to transcend the physical world and portray a wider vision of [[awareness]] including [[supernatural|spiritual]] or [[mystical]] [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]]s, or is based in such experiences.&lt;ref name="AlexGrey"&gt;[http://alexgrey.com/media/writing/essays/what-is-visionary-art/ What is Visionary Art? by Alex Grey]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alex Grey - COSM 4.jpg|thumb|[[The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors]] by [[Alex Grey]].]]

==History==
The [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]], first established in 1946, is considered to be an important technical and philosophical catalyst in its strong influence upon contemporary visionary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://academyofvisionaryart.com/information/visionary-art |title=Academy of Visionary Art |access-date=2014-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312142009/http://academyofvisionaryart.com/information/visionary-art |archive-date=2014-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://visionaryrevue.com/webtext/manifesto.contents.html ''Manifesto of Visionary Art'' by L. Caruana]&lt;/ref&gt; Its artists included [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]], [[Rudolf Hausner]] and [[Arik Brauer]] among others. Several artists who would later work in visionary art trained under Fuchs, including [[Mati Klarwein]], [[Robert Venosa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venosa.com/bio.html Robert Venosa biography]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Rubinov Jacobson]] and [[De Es Schwertberger]].

==Definition==
[[File:Laurence caruana in his Bastille studio.jpg|thumb|Visionary artist [[Laurence Caruana]] with visionary art paintings.]]
Visionary art often carries themes of spiritual, mystical or inner awareness.&lt;ref name=AlexGrey /&gt; Despite this broad definition, there does seem to be emerging some definition to what constitutes the contemporary visionary art 'scene' and which artists can be considered especially influential. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Psychedelic art]] are also direct precursors to contemporary visionary art. Notable visionary artists count [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], [[William Blake]], [[Morris Graves]] (of the Pacific Northwest School of Visionary Art), [[Emil Bisttram]], and [[Gustave Moreau]] amongst their antecedents.

==Schools and organizations==
The [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]], which includes [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]] and [[Arik Brauer]], is also a strong influence on visionary culture. It may also be considered the European version, with the names being interchangeable.

The [[Society for the Art of Imagination]], founded by [[Brigid Marlin]] serves as an important portal for visionary art events. More recently, a new wave of visionary artists collaborate to function as modern [[artist collectives|cooperatives]] involved in self-publishing and promotion of visionary artists through the internet and via festivals such as [[Burning Man]] and [[Boom Festival]], and exhibition/ritual spaces such as [[Temple of Visions]], Tribe 13, Psychedelic Dream Temple, Synergenesis and the [[Interdimensional art|Interdimensional Art]] Movement.

===Synopsis===

The film's introduction features animations, footage of war, explosions, and the [[September 11 attacks]] and audio quotes from [[Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] and [[George Carlin]].

Part I claims that the [[Christian religion]] is mainly derived from other religions, [[astronomical]] assertions, [[astrology|astrological]] myths, and other traditions. In furtherance of the [[Jesus myth theory|Jesus myth hypothesis]], this part disputes the [[historicity of Jesus]], who, it claims, is a literary and astrological hybrid, nurtured by political forces and opportunists. Part I was influenced by the work of [[Acharya S]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stellarhousepublishing.com/zeitgeistsourcebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FEMA - 4184 - Photograph by Michael Rieger taken on 09-25-2001 in New York.jpg|thumb|The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] are the subject of part II of ''Zeitgeist: the Movie''.]]

Part II alleges that the September 11 attacks were either orchestrated or allowed to happen by elements within the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] in order to generate mass fear, justify the [[War on Terror]], provide a pretext for the curtailment of [[civil liberties]], and produce economic gain. It asserts that the U.S. government had [[September 11 attacks advance-knowledge debate|advance knowledge]] of the attacks, that the military [[U.S. military response during the September 11 attacks|deliberately allowed]] the planes to reach their targets, and that [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] buildings 1, 2, and 7 underwent a [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories|controlled demolition]].

Part III states that the [[Federal Reserve System]] is controlled by a small [[cabal]] of [[international bankers]] who conspire to create global calamities to enrich themselves.&lt;ref name="Tossell" /&gt; Three wars involving the United States during the twentieth century are highlighted as part of this alleged agenda, started by specifically engineered events, including the [[RMS Lusitania#War|sinking of the RMS ''Lusitania'']], the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]]. The film asserts that such wars serve to sustain conflict in general and force the U.S. government to borrow money, thereby increasing the profits of the international bankers. The film also claims that the [[Tax protester statutory arguments|Federal Income Tax is illegal]].

[[Image:Federal Reserve.jpg|right|thumb|''Zeitgeist: the Movie'' claims that the U.S. Government's income tax is unconstitutional.]]
Part III also alleges a secret agreement to merge the United States, [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] into a [[North American Union]] as a step toward the creation of [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|a single world government]]. The film speculates that under such a government, every human could be implanted with an [[Microchip implant (human)|RFID chip]] to monitor individual activity and suppress dissent.

===Reception===
The first film received almost universal condemnation from the media, though it also "attracted massive interest" from the public.&lt;ref name=Tablet /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish" /&gt;

The newspaper ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' described ''Zeitgeist: The Movie'' as "a bramble of conspiracy theories involving Sept. 11, the international monetary system, and Christianity" saying also that the movie trailer states that "there are people guiding your life and you don't even know it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faherty|first1=John|title=Gabrielle Giffords shooter suspect: Moments from a life in spiral|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/01/16/20110116gabrielle-giffords-jared-loughner-profile.html|accessdate=1 October 2014|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' wrote that "these are surreal perversions of genuine issues and debates, and they tarnish all criticism of faith, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], and [[globalization]]—there are more than enough factual injustices in this world to be going around without having to invent fictional ones".&lt;ref name="Irish"&gt;{{Cite news|last=O'Dwyer|first=Davin|title=Zeitgeist: the nonsense|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2007/0825/1187332519087.html|accessdate=September 16, 2010|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivor Tossell in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' cited it as an example of how modern [[conspiracy theories]] are promulgated, though he praised its effectiveness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The film is an interesting object lesson on how conspiracy theories get to be so popular ... It's a driven, if uneven, piece of [[propaganda]], a marvel of tight editing and fuzzy thinking. Its on-[[camera]] sources are mostly conspiracy theorists, co-mingled with selective eyewitness accounts, drawn from [[archival footage]] and often taken out of context. It derides the [[News media|media]] as a pawn of the International Bankers, but produces media reports for credibility when convenient. The film ignores expert opinion, except the handful of experts who agree with it. And yet, it's compelling. It shamelessly ploughs forward, [[Connect the dots|connecting dots]] with an earnest certainty that makes you want to give it an A for effort.&lt;ref name=Tossell /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Filipe Feio, reflecting upon the film's Internet popularity in ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'', stated that "[f]iction or not, ''Zeitgeist: The Movie'' threatens to become the champion of conspiracy theories of today".&lt;ref name="Diario1"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Feio|first=Felipe|title=Teoria da conspiração no 'top' do Google Video (Conspiracy theory is the 'top' Google Video)|url=https://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/interior.aspx?content_id=1002811|accessdate=September 16, 2010|newspaper=[[Diário de Notícias]]|date=February 18, 2008|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of the [[Skeptics Society]], mentioned ''Zeitgeist'' in an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' on skepticism in the age of [[mass media]] and the [[postmodern]] belief in the [[relativism]] of truth. He argues that this belief, coupled with a "clicker culture of mass media," results in a multitude of various truth claims packaged in "[[infotainment]] units", in the form of films such as ''Zeitgeist'' and ''[[Loose Change (film series)|Loose Change]]''.&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What Skepticism Reveals about Science|last=Shermer|first=Michael|journal=Scientific American|date=July 2009|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-skepticism-reveals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Chapman]], a film producer and reader in [[media studies]] at the [[University of Lincoln]], called ''Zeitgeist'' "a fast-paced assemblage of [[agitprop]]," an example of "unethical film-making".&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Issues in Contemporary Documentary|publisher=Polity Press|last=Chapman|first=Jane|pages=171–173|year=2009|isbn= 978-0-7456-4009-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accused Peter Joseph of "implicit deception" through the use of standard film-making propaganda techniques. While parts of the film are, she says, "comically" self-defeating, the nature of "twisted evidence" and use of [[2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid bomb]] footage to imply it is of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]] amount to "ethical abuse in sourcing". She finishes her analysis with the comment: "Thus, legitimate questions about what happened on 9/11, and about corruption in religious and financial organizations, are all undermined by the film's determined effort to maximize an [[emotional response]] at the expense of reasoned argument."

[[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]], American [[radio]] host, conspiracy theorist and executive producer of ''[[Loose Change (film series)|Loose Change]]'', stated that film segments of ''Zeitgeist'' are taken directly from his documentary ''[[Terrorstorm]]'', and that he supports "90 percent" of the film.&lt;ref name=goldberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Michelle|title=The Cult Web Film that Inspired Loughner|publisher=The Daily Beast Company, LLC|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/01/13/zeitgeist-the-documentary-that-may-have-shaped-jared-loughners-worldview.html#|accessdate=August 17, 2014|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|''Skeptic'' magazine's]] Tim Callahan, criticizing the parts of the film on the origins of Christianity, wrote that "some of what it asserts is true. Unfortunately, this material is liberally—and sloppily—mixed with material that is only partially true and much that is plainly and simply bogus."&lt;ref name="callahan"&gt;{{Cite news|title= The Greatest Story Ever Garbled|last= Callahan|first= Tim|magazine= Skeptic|volume= 28| issue= 1|year= 2009|url= http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/09-02-25#feature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Forbes, Senior lecturer in [[Ancient History]] of [[Macquarie University]] and member of the [[Synod]] of the Diocese of Sydney, severely criticized Part I of the film, stating that it has no basis in serious scholarship or ancient sources, and that it relies on amateur sources that recycle frivolous ideas from one another, commenting that "[i]t is extraordinary how many claims it makes which are simply not true".&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicchristianity.org/search/edf06f5712adcabf75147cca7fda1cfa/|title=Zeitgeist: Time to discard the Christian story?|publisher=Interview at the Centre for Public Christianity, Sydney, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conclusions were reached by Dr. Mark Foreman of [[Liberty University]].&lt;ref name=foreman&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epsociety.org/library/authors.asp?mode=profile&amp;pid=75|title=Challenging the Zeitgeist Movie: Alleged Parallels between Jesus and Ancient Pagan Religions|year=2011|publisher=Evangelical Philosophical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Tablet Magazine]]'', journalist [[Michelle Goldberg]] criticized ''Zeitgeist: The Movie'' as being "steeped in [[Far-right politics|far-right]], isolationist, and covertly [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] conspiracy theories," claiming that the film borrowed from the work of [[Eustace Mullins]], [[Lyndon LaRouche]], and radio host Alex Jones, and that it portrays a [[cabal]] of international bankers purportedly ruling the world.&lt;ref name=Tablet&gt;{{Cite news| last = Goldberg | first = Michelle |date = February 2, 2011| url = http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/57732/brave-new-world|title=Brave New World|newspaper=[[Tablet Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[TheMarker]], Joseph said that while the film does mention bankers it does not seek to blame any individual or group of individuals. He argued they are merely a product of a [[socioeconomic]] system in need of change.&lt;ref name=TheMarkerTV&gt;{{YouTube|GbN86J-ihHE|Discussion of The Zeitgeist Movement with Peter Joseph}}, [[TheMarker|TheMarkerTV]] (Israel), Jan. 19, 2012. Interview conducted in English, following a brief introduction to Joseph and the Movement in Hebrew.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chip Berlet wrote that the 9/11 conspiracy theories "are bait used to attract viewers from the 9/11 truth movement and others who embrace conspiracist thinking to the [[idiosyncratic]] [[antireligion]] views of the [[videographer]] and the world of right-wing [[antisemitic]] theories of a global banking conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Loughner, "Zeitgeist - The Movie," and Right-Wing Antisemitic Conspiracism | accessdate = 2012-06-03 | url = http://www.talk2action.org/story/2011/1/14/92946/9451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jay Kinney]] questioned the accuracy of its claims and the quality of its arguments, describing it as [[agitprop]] and [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Kinney" /&gt; At times, according to Kinney, "Zeitgeist engages in willful confusion by showing TV screen shots of network or cable news with voice-overs from unidentified people not associated with the news programs. If one weren't paying close attention, the effect would be to confer the status and authority of TV news upon the words being spoken. Even when quotes or sound bites are attributed to a source, there's no way to tell if they are quoted correctly or in context."&lt;ref name="Kinney"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boingboing.net/2007/08/06/jay-kinney-reviews-z.html | title=Jay Kinney reviews Zeitgeist, the Movie | publisher=[[Boing Boing]] | date=6 August 2007 | accessdate=25 June 2015 |author1=Frauenfelder, Mark  |author2=Kinney, Jay |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Zeitgeist: Addendum'' is a 2008 film produced and directed by [[Peter Joseph]], and is a sequel to the 2007 film, ''Zeitgeist: The Movie''. It premiered at the 5th Annual [[Artivist Film Festival]] in Los Angeles, California on October 2, 2008.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Synopsis===

The film begins and ends with excerpts from a speech by [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]. The remainder of the film is narrated by Peter Joseph and divided into four parts, which are prefaced by on-screen quotations from Krishnamurti, [[John Adams]], [[Bernard Lietaer]], and [[Thomas Paine]], respectively.

''Part I'' covers the process of [[fractional-reserve banking]] as illustrated in [[wikisource:Modern Money Mechanics|Modern Money Mechanics]], by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]]. The film suggests that society is manipulated into economic slavery through [[Debt-based monetary system|debt-based monetary policies]] by requiring individuals to submit for employment in order to pay off their debt.

''Part II'' has an interview with [[John Perkins (author)|John Perkins]], author of ''[[Confessions of an Economic Hitman]]'', who says he was involved in the subjugation of [[Latin American]] economies by multinational corporations and the United States government, including involvement in the overthrow of Latin American heads-of-state. Perkins sees the US as a [[corporatocracy]], in which maximization of profits is the first priority.

''Part III'' introduces futurist [[Jacque Fresco]] and [[The Venus Project]] and asserts a need to move away from current socioeconomic paradigms. Fresco states that capitalism perpetuates the conditions it claims to address, as problems are only solved if there is money to be made. The film looks at Fresco's proposal of a resource-based economy, which puts environmental friendliness, sustainability and abundance as fundamental societal goals. He goes on to discuss [[technology]] which he sees as the primary driver of human advancement, and he describes [[politics]] as being unable to solve any problems.

''Part IV'' suggests that the primary reason for what the film sees as society's social values ("warfare, corruption, oppressive laws, social stratification, irrelevant superstitions, environmental destruction, and a despotic, socially indifferent, profit oriented ruling class") is a collective ignorance of "the emergent and [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] aspects of natural law". The film advocates the following actions for achieving social change: boycotting of the most powerful banks in the Federal Reserve System, the major news networks, the military, energy corporations, all political systems; and joining, and supporting The Zeitgeist Movement.

===Reception===
''Zeitgeist: Addendum'' won the 2008 [[Artivist Film Festival &amp; Awards|Artivist Film Festival]]'s award for ''best feature'' ("Artivist Spirit" category).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Artivist Awards|url=http://artivist.com/the-artivist-awards-3/|publisher=Artivist Film Festival|accessdate=2014-01-18|year=2008|quote=Best Feature – Artivist Spirit: "Zeitgeist: Addendum" directed by Peter Joseph|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628105142/http://artivist.com/the-artivist-awards-3/|archive-date=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the film was uploaded-released on [[Google Video]]. The current video posting on [[YouTube]] surpassed 5 million views by late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zeitgeist: Addendum|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EewGMBOB4Gg|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2014-01-19|author=TZMOfficialChannel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Feuer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that while the first film was famous for alleging that the attacks of September 11 were an inside job, the second, "was all but empty of such conspiratorial notions, directing its rhetoric and high production values toward posing a replacement for the evils of the banking system and a perilous economy of scarcity and debt".&lt;ref name="NYT20090317"&gt;{{Cite news|title=They've Seen the Future and Dislike the Present|author=Alan Feuer|date=March 17, 2009&lt;!--"A version of this article appeared in print on March 17, 2009, on page A24 of the New York edition." --&gt;|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/nyregion/17zeitgeist.html|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Zeitgeist: Moving Forward'' is the third installment in [[Peter Joseph]]'s ''Zeitgeist'' film series.

=== Synopsis ===

The film begins with an animated sequence narrated by [[Jacque Fresco]]. He describes his [[adolescent]] life and his discontinuation of [[public education]] at the age of 14 and describes his early life influences.

'''Part I: Human Nature'''

[[Human behavior]] and the [[Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture debate]] is discussed, which [[Robert Sapolsky]] refers to as a "[[false dichotomy]]." [[Disease]], [[criminal activity]], and [[addictions]] are also discussed. The overall conclusion of Part I is that [[social environment]] and [[cultural conditioning]] play a large part in shaping [[human behavior]].

'''Part II: Social Pathology'''

[[John Locke]] and [[Adam Smith]] are discussed in regard to [[modern economics]]. The film critically questions the [[economic theory|economic]] need for [[private property]], [[money]], and the inherent inequality between agents in the system. Also seen critically is the need for [[business cycle|cyclical]] consumption in order to maintain [[market share]], resulting in wasted resources and [[planned obsolescence]]. According to the movie, the current [[monetary system]] will result in [[Default (finance)|default]] or [[hyperinflation]] at some future time.

'''Part III: Project Earth'''

As with ''Zeitgeist: Addendum'', the film presents a "resource-based economy" as advocated by Jacque Fresco discussing how human civilization could start from a new beginning in relation to resource types, locations, quantities, to satisfy human demands; track the consumption and depletion of resources to regulate human demands and maintain the condition of the environment.

'''Part IV: Rise'''

The current worldwide situation is described as disastrous. A case is presented that [[pollution]], [[deforestation]], [[climate change]], [[overpopulation]], and [[warfare]] are all created and perpetuated by the socioeconomic system. Various [[poverty]] statistics are shown that suggest a progressive worsening of [[world culture]].

The final scene of the film shows a partial view of earth from space, followed by a sequence of superimposed statements; "This is your world", "This is our world", and "The revolution is now".

===Reception===
''Zeitgeist: Moving Forward'' received "Best Political Documentary" in 2011 from the [[Action on Film International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 ACTION ON FILM OFFICIAL FILM AND VIDEO AWARD NOMINEES|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/28ac82_bcae7973f1624374a492bb081e35a815.pdf|publisher=Action on Film|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Socialist Standard|The Socialist Standard]]'' review said the film's use of animation and humour gave it a "well rounded feel", though it criticized the "shaky economic analysis" in the second part of the film, saying "[[Karl Marx]] had already undertaken a more scientific analysis", adding, "the analysis is at least on the right track". Regarding transition to the new system proposed in the film, the reviewer noted "there is no mention of how to get from here to there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/mar11/film_review.html |title=Film Review &amp;#124; The Socialist Party of Great Britain |publisher=Worldsocialism.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article, in ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet Magazine]]'', Michelle Goldberg described the film as "silly enough that at times [she] suspected it was [a] sly satire about new-age techno-[[utopianism]] instead of an example of it".&lt;ref name=Tablet /&gt; She describes the 3 Zeitgeist movies as "a series of 3 apocalyptic cult documentaries.&lt;ref name=Tablet /&gt;

==Zeitgeist movement==
{{main|The Zeitgeist Movement}}

''Zeitgeist: The Movie'' (2007) started the chain of events leading to the formation of the Zeitgeist movement.&lt;ref name=Tablet /&gt; The group advocates transition from the global [[money]]-based [[economic system]] to a [[post-scarcity economy]] or [[resource]]-based economy. ''VC Reporter's'' Shane Cohn summarized the movement's charter as: "Our greatest social problems are the direct results of our economic system".&lt;ref name=VCreporter&gt;[http://www.vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/new_world_re_order/8838/ New world re-order: The Zeitgeist Movement spreads to Ventura County], Shane Cohn, VC Reporter (California), May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph created a [[political movement]] that, according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', dismisses historic religious concepts as misleading and embraces a version of sustainable [[Ecology|ecological]] concepts and scientific administration of society.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Danien. June 17, 2012. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/9337209/Forest-boy-inspired-by-Zeitgeist-movement.html Forest boy 'inspired by Zeitgeist movement']. ''The Telegraph.'' Retrieved: 29 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The group describes the current [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic system]] as structurally corrupt and inefficient in the use of resources.&lt;ref name="NYT20090317" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ws /&gt; Michelle Goldberg described the Zeitgeist movement as "the first Internet-based apocalyptic cult".&lt;ref name=Tablet /&gt;
