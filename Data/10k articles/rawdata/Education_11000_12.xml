      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16516">'''Ag-gag''' is a term used to describe a class of anti-[[whistleblower]] laws that apply within the [[agriculture]] industry. Popularized by [[Mark Bittman]] in an April 2011 ''[[New York Times]]'' column (but used long before then by advocates), the term "ag-gag" typically refers to state laws that forbid the act of undercover filming or photography of activity on [[farm]]s without the consent of their owner—particularly targeting whistleblowers of [[animal rights]] abuses at these facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bittman, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/who-protects-the-animals/ Who Protects the Animals?], ''New York Times'', April 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These laws originated in the [[United States]], but have also begun to appear elsewhere, such as in [[Australia]]. Some of these laws, such as the failed proposal in [[#Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], have a wider scope and could be used to criminalize actions by activists in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Chamberlain, [http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/05/09-10 Fracking Activists Could Face Felony Charges as "Ag-Gag" Laws Spread], ''Common Dreams'', May 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of ag-gag laws have argued that they serve to protect the agriculture industry from the negative repercussions of exposés by whistleblowers. The proliferation of ag-gag laws has been criticized by various groups, arguing that the laws are intended primarily to censor animal rights abuses by the agriculture industry from the public, create a [[chilling effect]] in reporting these violations, and violate the right to [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt McGrath, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22098224 US animal activist laws 'may impact globally'], ''BBC News'', 12 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ag-gag laws emerged in the early 1990s in response to underground activists with the [[Animal Liberation Front]] movement. In Kansas, Montana and North Dakota, state legislators made it a crime to take pictures or shoot video in an animal facility without the consent of the facility's owner.&lt;ref name=Ag-gag-laws&gt;{{cite web|title="Ag-Gag" Laws: Evolution, Resurgence, and Public Health Implications|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1048291118808788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the conservative organization [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) drafted the "Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act", a model law for distribution to lobbyists and state lawmakers. The model law proposed to prohibit "entering an animal or research facility to take pictures by photograph, video camera, or other means with the intent to commit criminal activities or defame the facility or its owner". It also created a "terrorist registry" for those convicted under the law.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Leighton Akio (July 31, 2013). [http://www.thenation.com/article/175506/charged-crime-filming-slaughterhouse#ixzz2agibYZ00 "Charged With the Crime of Filming a Slaughterhouse"]. ''[[The Nation]]''. Retrieved August 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The whistleblower advocacy project [[Food Integrity Campaign]] (FIC), a [[Advocacy|campaign]] of the non-profit organization the [[Government Accountability Project]] calls undercover video of livestock facilities by whistleblowers essential:

{{quote|When it comes to bringing horrific truths to the public eye, undercover footage and images are often an effective outlet for whistleblowers who otherwise risk retaliation when speaking up. Going through "proper channels" to report abuse often results in supervisors intimidating those employees who have made complaints to keep quiet. Statements by Ag Gag bill sponsors imply that "real" whistleblowers have a safe and effectual means for speaking up, when history shows that's often not the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodwhistleblower.org/the-lifecycle-of-food/life-on-the-farm/ag-gag "Ag Gag: Safeguarding Industry Secrets by Punishing the Messenger"], Food Integrity Campaign, Retrieved June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ag-gag laws have also drawn criticism on constitutional grounds by eminent legal scholars such as [[Erwin Chemerinsky]], as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] for restricting unpopular forms of speech.&lt;ref name="AP Ag-Gag Lawsuit"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/utah-ag-gag_n_3636036.html Animal Welfare Activists File Lawsuit To Overturn Utah 'Ag Gag' Law], ''Associated Press'', July 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, a U.S. district court ruled such a law passed by the state of Idaho to be unconstitutional as a violation of the First Amendment; Judge [[B. Lynn Winmill]] stated that "Although the State may not agree with the message certain groups seek to convey about Idaho's agricultural production facilities, such as releasing secretly recorded videos of animal abuse to the Internet and calling for boycotts, it cannot deny such groups equal protection of the laws in their exercise of their right to free speech."&lt;ref name=npr-unconstitutional/&gt;

==Laws==

===United States===

====Idaho====
In February 2014, Idaho Governor [[Butch Otter]] signed Idaho's "ag-gag" bill, the "Agricultural Security Act", into law, which imposed fines and jail time on activists who secretly film abuse on Idaho's commercial farms. It came about as the result of the animal rights organization [[Mercy for Animals]] releasing a video of animal abuse by workers on Bettencourt Dairy farms.&lt;ref name=npr-unconstitutional/&gt;

On August 3, 2015, the Agricultural Security Act was struck down as unconstitutional by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho]] as a violation of the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=npr-unconstitutional&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Strikes Down Idaho 'Ag-Gag' Law, Raising Questions For Other States|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/04/429345939/idaho-strikes-down-ag-gag-law-raising-questions-for-other-states|accessdate=4 August 2015|work=NPR|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=acluidaho-aggag&gt;{{cite web|title=Idaho "Ag-Gag" Law Ruled Unconstitutional in Federal Court|url=https://acluidaho.org/idaho-ag-gag-law-ruled-unconstitutional-in-federal-court/|website=ACLU Idaho|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was appealed, and parts of Idaho’s law were struck down by the Ninth Circuit Court on First Amendment grounds in early 2018.&lt;ref name=Ag-gag-laws&gt;{{cite web|title="Ag-Gag" Laws: Evolution, Resurgence, and Public Health Implications|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1048291118808788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In February 2015, Western Australia Senator [[Chris Back]] introduced [http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/s994_first-senate/toc_pdf/1500520.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22legislation/bills/s994_first-senate/0000%22 Criminal Code Amendment (Animal Protection) Bill 2015] to the [[Australian Senate]] which would add a new section creating an offense if a person created a "record" of animal abuse and then failed to hand it in within 5 days to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/senator-backs-activist-filming-crackdown/story-fn3dxiwe-1227224658703|title=Senator backs activist filming crackdown|date=18 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/australias-new-bill-to-protect-animals-will-do-anything-but-38103|title=Australia's new bill to protect animals will do anything but|first=Jed|last=Goodfellow|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Proponents of the laws note that public documentation of [[Intensive animal farming|factory farming]] practices will result in negative consequences for the industry. "State Sen. David Hinkins (R), who sponsored Utah's law, said it was aimed at the 'vegetarian people who are trying to kill the animal industry.'" &lt;ref name="DN price"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bollard|first=Lewis|title=The terrible price of ag-gag laws|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/terrible-price-ag-gag-laws-article-1.1346292|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When investigators publicize documentation of [[factory farms]], the company generally loses business.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn T. Tonsor and Nicole J. Olynk, 
[http://www.agmanager.info/livestock/marketing/animalwelfare/MF2951.pdf U.S. Meat Demand: The Influence of Animal Welfare Media Coverage], Kansas State University, September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 2007, an undercover investigator from [[The Humane Society of the United States]] visited the Hallmark/Westland slaughterhouse in Chino, California and filmed downed cows, too sick to stand up, being "dragged by chains and pushed by forklifts to the kill floor". A large amount of the meat from this slaughterhouse had been consumed through the [[National School Lunch Program]], and the footage compelled "the U.S. Department of Agriculture to announce what was at the time the largest meat recall in U.S. history".&lt;ref name="DN price" /&gt; Similarly, a [[Mercy for Animals]] investigation at Sparboe Farms resulted in McDonald's, Target, Sam's Club, and Supervalu all dropping Sparboe as an egg supplier. The investigation revealed cages full of dead hens rotting alongside living hens who were still laying eggs for human consumption. The investigator documented standard practices such as painful debeaking without painkillers and tossing live birds into plastic bags to suffocate, along with other behaviour deemed "sadistic" and "malicious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undercover Investigations: Exposing Animal Abuse|url=http://www.mercyforanimals.org/investigations.aspx|publisher=Mercy for Animals|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC Sparboe"&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's, Target Dump Egg Supplier After Investigation|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/mcdonalds-dumps-mcmuffin-egg-factory-health-concerns/story?id=14976054#.UbTjNvbTUjV|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=ABC News|author=Galli, Cynthia|author2=Hill, Angela|author3=Momtaz, Rym}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
Fifty-nine groups, including a wide variety of welfare, civil liberties, environmental, food safety and First Amendment organizations have publicly stated opposition to ag-gag laws. Some of these groups include the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] (ALDF), [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), [[Amnesty International USA]], [[Farm Sanctuary]], [[Food and Water Watch]], [[Food Chain Workers Alliance]], [[Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association]], [[International Labor Rights Forum]], [[National Consumers League]], and [[United Farm Workers]], among many others. The statement of opposition explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt; These bills represent a wholesale assault on many fundamental values shared by all people across the United States. Not only would these bills perpetuate animal abuse on industrial farms, they would also threaten workers' rights, consumer health and safety, law enforcement investigations and the freedom of journalists, employees and the public at large to share information about something as fundamental as our food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Opposition to Proposed "Ag-Gag" Laws from Broad Spectrum of Interest Groups|url=http://www.aspca.org/Fight-Animal-Cruelty/Advocacy-Center/ag-gag/ag-gag-statement-of-opposition|accessdate=
June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Individuals and groups such as the ones listed above are concerned that the bills are written to hide welfare and safety violations in the animal agriculture industry from the public view. While laws aimed at restricting documentation or employee applications directly restrict documentation, the third type of law (e.g. [[Missouri]]'s) is said to be intended to promote the rapid prosecution of any business displaying such practices. However, critics of the bills contend that when all material must be turned over to authorities in such a short amount of time (generally within twenty-four hours), establishments can easily cover up or change their practices or fire the employee before further documentation can occur, making a thorough investigation of any farm virtually impossible.

==Legal challenges==
On July 22, 2013, the ALDF, PETA ([[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]) and others filed a lawsuit challenging Utah's ag-gag law on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref name="SLCT Ag-Gag"&gt;Brooke Adams, [http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56626204-78/law-animal-utah-lawsuit.html.csp Animals rights activists say Utah ag gag law unconstitutional], ''Salt Lake City Tribune'', July 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the ALDF and PETA filed a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of "ag gag" laws under the [[First Amendment]]. Utah's law makes it illegal to obtain access to an agricultural operation under false pretenses, such as providing inaccurate information on a job application, which is one of the ways that investigative reporters document violations and abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/cases-campaigns/features/taking-ag-gag-to-court/|title=Taking Ag-Gag to Court - Animal Legal Defense Fund|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, a coalition of organizations dedicated to civil liberties, animal protection, food safety, labor rights, and the environment, along with journalists, filed a federal lawsuit to overturn Idaho's newly passed "ag gag" statute, signed into law by Idaho governor C.L. "Butch" Otter on February 28. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of Idaho's ag gag law (Idaho Code sec. 18-7042), and was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho by national nonprofits [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] (ALDF), [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho (ACLU), and the Center for Food Safety (CFS). Idaho is the seventh state to pass an ag gag law, and the first to do so since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/press-room/press-releases/coalition-of-civil-liberties-animal-consumer-groups-head-to-court-over-controversial-idaho-ag-gag-law/Coalition|title=Coalition Calls for a Moratorium on Federal Loans for Chicken CAFOs in Arkansas Pending Careful Environmental Review - Animal Legal Defense Fund|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, 2015, Idaho's law was declared unconstitutional by a Federal Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-idahos-anti-dairy-spying-law-unconstitutional-32861512|title=U.S. News - National News|first=ABC|last=News|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Utah's law was declared unconstitutional in July, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/08/536186914/judge-overturns-utahs-ag-gag-ban-on-undercover-filming-at-farms Judge Overturns Utah's 'Ag-Gag' Ban On Undercover Filming At Farms]&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods of study are interdisciplinary, and students and researchers come from many fields, including [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[film studies]], [[gender studies]] and [[economics]].

American Studies in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] is closely related to the discipline in America, and many degree programmes also involve a period of study in the U.S. or [[Canada]], ranging in time from a month to an academic year. However, an 'outsider's' view of a foreign culture, a variety of intellectual trends, such as the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham school]] of cultural studies, and institutional arrangements often lead to a different approach to that pursued in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, P, "Virtual Americas: The Internationalization of American Studies and the Ideology of Exchange," ''American Quarterly'' 50:3 (1998): 523–547&lt;/ref&gt; The support of the [[Embassy of the United States, London|U.S. Embassy]] and other official U.S. bodies and awards also shows that American Studies has also been used to promote closer ties and greater understanding between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson-Peebles, R, "Dean Acheson and the Potato Head Blues, or British Academic Attitudes to America and its Literature,", Gutman, H. ''As Others Read Us: International Perspectives on American Literature,'' [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001, pp. 30–1. {{ISBN|0-87023-629-6}} and Laville, H., "The Importance of Being (In) Earnest", in ''The US Government, Citizen Groups And the Cold War: The State-Private Network,'' Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of American Studies in Britain ==
Because of Britain's involvement in [[North America]], [[American Studies]] has a long history as an activity in British Higher Education.  This history has given American Studies in Britain a different flavour to that pursued in the U.S. The earliest accounts of the British colonisation and exploration of North America may be considered as the first contributions to this field, which now incorporates the output of the work of many university departments, scholarly journals and [[independent scholar]]s. Many libraries, museums and archives in the United Kingdom also support such work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asrp.info/ accessed 2006-12-06&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The British Association for American Studies ===
{{Main|British Association for American Studies}}
American Studies as an academic course of study is generally considered to have begun in the U.S. in the late 1930s, at a time when little research or study was undertaken in Britain. During [[World War II]], the [[British government]] encouraged the study of America and the American government began to see the need to support American Studies abroad during the [[Cold War]], in the belief that "the more people knew about the United States, the more they would come to admire its political and economic values, and its foreign policy".&lt;ref&gt;D. Reynolds, ''From World War to Cold War: Churchill, Roosevelt, and the International History of the 1940s'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2006, 3 and Ch. 10; R. Pells, ''Not Like Us: How Europeans have Loved, Hated, and Transformed American Culture since World War II'', New York: [[Basic Books]], 1997, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1950s, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[United States Education Commission]] (USEC) organised a series of Anglo-American conferences, which became known as the '[[Fulbright]] Conferences' after the [[Fulbright Act]] of 1946. The [[British Association for American Studies]] (BAAS) was founded at the fourth conference in 1955; many of its members were influenced by the experiences of exchange programmes with the United States, such as the Commonwealth Fellowships, and contacts with [[Rhodes Scholars]], and realised that much American culture and literature was unknown or misunderstood.  The impetus to form the Association came from the Cultural Attaché at the [[U.S. Embassy in London]], Dick Taylor, who wrote to the members of the eventual founding committee that he knew of "concrete interest" from an unnamed American foundation that wished to support the founding of an American Studies association.  Taylor also proposed the founding of a centre for American Studies at [[Ditchley Park]], with an American school and conference centre along the lines of the [[British School at Athens]]. The fledging Association was unable to support this venture and, concerned with their independence from the [[U.S. State Department]], unsuccessfully sought funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Taylor's successor at the Embassy, Myron Koenig, offered a $20,000 grant to survey British library resources and $100,000 to establish the society.  Membership fees provided a small income, and although BAAS accepted the grant for the library survey, they were able to decline the larger sum in the interests of intellectual and political independence. In 1956, the society received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation.  BAAS has continued to provide a focus for American Studies in Britain, organising a series of conferences and administrating various awards and funds for research.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fisher "Double Vision, Double Analysis", in H. Laville and H. Wilford, ''The US Government, Citizen Groups and the Cold War. The State-Private Network'', London &amp; New York: [[Routledge]], 2006, 145–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political influence ===
American Studies has always been influenced to some degree by contemporary politics. For example, the purported [[Special relationship]] between the two countries has contributed to a long tradition of scholarly exchange and support from U.S. organisations, such as the [[United States Department of State]] for the study of America in Britain. During World War II, The British Government also sought to "counter the Hollywood image of America as a land of violence and corruption by a vigorous campaign to develop American studies".  As noted above, the development of the British university system and interest in the U.S. as a result of the Cold War and increasingly dominant U.S. popular culture led to the development of several American Studies courses at institutions including the universities of Keele and East Anglia.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D., ''From World War to Cold War: Churchill, Roosevelt, and the International History of the 1940s'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 3 and Ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in 2004 the Guardian columnist, [[Polly Toynbee]] suggested in an article revealingly called "A degree in bullying and self-interest? No thanks" that the Iraq war and the so-called "War on Terror" had led to a positive resistance to American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, P, [https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1290021,00.html "A degree in bullying and self-interest? No thanks"], Guardian, 25 August 2004 (Accessed 2006-12-06)&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Shelley Fisher Fishkin]] argued that American Studies needs more transnational perspectives and that the U.S.'s engagement with the world demands more, not less, study.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher Fishkin, S., "Crossroads of Cultures: The Transnational Turn in American Studies—Presidential Address to the American Studies Association, November 12, 2004," ''American Quarterly'', 57:1 (2005): 17–57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion, contraction and consolidation ===
University growth allowed the expansion of American Studies in Britain during the 1960s and 1970s.  By the 1980s, the [[European Association for American Studies]] estimated that there were at least two thousand Americanists employed in Britain and the Continent. Most major [[British universities]] could boast a historian of the U.S. or a literature specialist.  American Studies also began to extend its range, incorporating [[Film Studies]] and the newer fields of [[Cultural studies|Cultural]] and [[Gender Studies]]. Americanists also became to seek the 'meaning of America' outside of the traditional areas of political institutions and dominant social class, but in marginalized groups. During the 1980s, as Pells comments, the canon became 'contemporary, ethnic, and feminist'. The decade also witnessed a tranche of retirements from the profession, which, because of financial constraints on universities, were not replaced.  Several key figures, such as [[Marcus Cunliffe]], left Britain for American university posts. By the early 1990s, some American Studies departments were closed.

The end of the Cold War in the late 1980s marked a revival in interest in the remaining superpower, and student numbers rose, along with numbers of professors.&lt;ref&gt;Pells, ''Not Like Us'', 123-29. Guardian article&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable was the Rothermere Centre at Oxford (established 2001.) This revival was generally maintained until the controversial [[United States presidential election, 2000|election of Bush in 2000]], then [[9/11]], the subsequent "[[War on Terror]]" and the [[invasion of Iraq]] which put together encouraged a [[Criticism of American foreign policy|critical attitude to the United States]] in the public sphere which eventually had a negative effect on recruitment and caused a number of programmes to close (for instance at [[University of Reading|Reading]]) or amalgamate with English, History or other departments (see above reference to [[Polly Toynbee]].)

With the election of Barack Obama in 2008 sparking renewed interest in the United States and its history and culture, the [[British Association for American Studies]] reported increasing demand for American-themed modules in many undergraduate degree programmes and a steady rise in applications to American Studies courses.&lt;ref&gt;American Studies in the UK, 2000–2010  http://www.baas.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/american%20studies%20in%20the%20uk%202000-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; That trend was exemplified when, in 2012, the announcement was made by [[Northumbria University]] of the most ambitious new initiative in American Studies for more than a generation, spearheaded by Brian Ward, former professor of American Studies at the University of Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;David Whestone, "An American Adventure," The Journal (Newcastle upon Tyne), October 4, 2012 http://www.thefreelibrary.com/An+American+adventure%3B+The+race+for+the+White+House+is+intensifying...-a0308567153, "United Studies of America": http://www.northumbria.ac.uk/browse/ne/uninews/archive/2012news/AmericanStudies?view=Standard&amp;news=archive&lt;/ref&gt; The first cohort of American Studies undergraduates was admitted to Northumbria in September 2013.

==Schools and movements==
As a heterodox discipline, American Studies incorporates many fields, from literature to international relations.  Various schools, such as that of the [[American Studies|Myth and Symbol approach]] have strongly influenced research.  Although these approaches can be seen in [American Studies] in the U.S. and elsewhere, there have been distinctive British contributions.

=== Birmingham School ===
The [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] was a research centre at the [[University of Birmingham]]. It was founded in 1964 by [[Richard Hoggart]], its first director. Its object of study was the then new field of [[Cultural Studies]] and it soon became known as the Birmingham School.  Although no clear method emerged, the influence of [[Marxism]] and other theories, such as [[post-structuralism]] informed a politically engaged, sophisticated analysis of contemporary society.  Its members included Jorge Larrain, the [[Chilean people|Chilean]] sociologist and cultural historian, author of ''Identity and Modernity in Latin America''. The School has influenced many Area Studies scholars, including American Studies specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Janet, "Symposia; Sociology and Border Disciplines: Cultural Studies and the Sociology of Culture", ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]'' 28: 5 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

== American Studies at GCSE and A-Level ==
O-levels and A-levels (AS/A2) in American studies have not been offered since the introduction of GCSEs and the UK National Curriculum however, American Studies is a component of history and politics A-level curricula whilst, the civil rights movement is studied as a unit as part of GCSE History.&lt;ref&gt;How well is American Studies doing in Britain today?, http://www.americansc.org.uk/Online/question.htm Retrieved 2006 12 06&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anki''' is a [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[spaced repetition]] [[flashcard]] program. "Anki" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:暗記|暗記]]}}) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for "memorization".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:暗記]]&lt;/ref&gt; The SM2 algorithm, created for [[SuperMemo]] in the late 1980s, forms the basis of the spaced repetition methods employed in the program. Anki's implementation of the [[algorithm]] has been modified to allow priorities on cards and to show cards in order of their urgency. The cards are presented using [[HTML]] and may include text, images, sounds, videos,&lt;ref&gt;Played in a separate [[MPlayer]] window.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[LaTeX]] equations. The decks of cards, along with the user's statistics, are stored in the open [[SQLite]] format.

==Features==

===Notes===
Cards are generated from information stored as "notes". Notes are analogous to database entries and can have an arbitrary number of fields. For example, with respect to learning a language, a note may have the following fields and example entries:
* Field 1: Expression in target language – {{lang|fr|"gâteau"}}
* Field 2: Pronunciation – [sound file with the word {{lang|fr|"gâteau"}} pronounced]
* Field 3: Meaning of expression in familiar language – "cake"
This example illustrates what some programs call a [[three-sided flashcard]], but Anki's model is more general and allows any number of fields to be combined in various cards.

The user can design cards that test the information contained in each note. One card may have a question (expression) and an answer (pronunciation, meaning).

By keeping the separate cards linked to the same fact, spelling mistakes can be adjusted against all cards at the same time and Anki can ensure that related cards are not shown in too short a spacing.

A special note type allows for generation of [[cloze deletion]] cards (in Anki 1.2.x, those were ordinary cards with cloze markup added using a tool in the fact editor).

===Syncing===
Anki supports synchronization with a free (but proprietary) online server called AnkiWeb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ankiweb.net|title=Anki - friendly, intelligent flashcards|work=ankiweb.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows users to keep decks synchronized across multiple computers, and to study online or on a cell phone.

There is a third-party open source ([[Affero General Public License|AGPLv3]]) AnkiServer software which users can run on their own local computers or servers, though it is not compatible with recent Anki versions. It also provides a RESTful API for manipulating Anki collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server|title=dsnopek/anki-sync-server|work=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese and Chinese reading generation===
Anki can automatically fill in the reading of Japanese and Chinese text. Since version 0.9.9.8.2, these features are in separate plug-ins.

===Add-ons===
More than 500 [[plug-in (computing)|add-ons]] for Anki are available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/|title=Add-ons for Anki 2.0|work=ankiweb.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; often written by third-party [[software developer|developers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons.html|title=Writing Anki 2.0.x Add-ons|work=ankiweb.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide support for [[speech synthesis]], enhanced user statistics, image occlusion, [[incremental reading]], allow for more efficient editing and creation of cards through batch editing, modify the GUI (such as through intermittent display of puppies), simplify import of flashcards from other digital sources, etc.

=== Shared Decks ===
While Anki's user manual encourages the creation of one's own decks for most material, there is still a large and active database of Shared Decks that users can download and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#downloading-shared-decks|title=Anki Manual|website=apps.ankiweb.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available decks range from foreign language decks (often constructed with frequency tables) to geography, physics, biology, chemistry and more. Various medical science decks, often made by multiple users in collaboration, are also available. 

==Comparisons==
Anki's scheduling algorithm is based on an older version of the SuperMemo algorithm (SM2). The Anki author states that versions 3–5 of the SuperMemo algorithm are more susceptible to incorrect scheduling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#what-algorithm|title=Anki Manual|work=ankisrs.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ankisrs/7X7iELcP7f4/8KRIfbLJSDgJ|title=Google Groups|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest SuperMemo algorithm in 2017 is SM17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo_timeline|title=Three Decades: From SuperMemo 1.0 to SuperMemo 17.0|date=27 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* AnkiMobile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html|title=Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards|work=ankisrs.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; for iPhone, iPod touch or iPad (paid)

The flashcards and learning progress can be synchronized both ways with Anki using AnkiWeb. With AnkiDroid it is possible to have the flashcards read in several languages using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS). If a language does not exist in the Android TTS engine (e.g. Russian in the Android version Ice Cream Sandwich), a different TTS engine  such as SVOX TTS Classic can be used.

==History==
The oldest mention of Anki that the developer, Damien Elmes, could find in 2011 was dated October 5, 2006&lt;!-- (which may be &lt;span title="* initial import from forcer's last version"&gt;the first entry in the ChangeLog file for an [[Emacs]]-based spaced repetition program, [http://ichi2.net/flashcard/index.html Flashcard])--&gt;, which was thus declared Anki's birthdate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/anki-users/M8mDFN7-H-I/discussion Happy birthday, Anki!], a thread started by Damien Elmes in the ankisrs Google Group on 2011-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copera Inc.'s Anki for Palm OS==
An unrelated flashcard program called Anki for Palm OS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eichert.com/copera.com/anki.com/index.html|title=About Anki for Palm OS|work=Mirror of old anki.com website}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by Copera, Inc. (formerly known as Cooperative Computers, Inc.) and released at the PalmSource conference in February 2002.  Anki for Palm OS was sold from 2002 to 2006 as a commercial product.  In late 2007, Copera, Inc. decided to release Anki for Palm OS as freeware.

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
An '''Asian quota''' is a type of [[racial quota]] limiting the number of [[Asian people|people of Asian descent]] in an establishment, a special case of '''''[[Numerus clausus]]'''''. In particular, it refers to alleged [[educational quotas]] in United States [[higher education]] [[College admissions in the United States|admissions]], specifically [[Ivy League]] universities, targeting [[Asian American]]s, specifically persons of [[East Asian people|East Asian]] and [[South Asian people|South Asian]] descent, starting in the late 1980s and ongoing, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}; such allegations are denied by the universities in question. Asian quotas are compared to the earlier [[Jewish quota]]s, which limited admissions of a [[model minority]] from the 1910s to the 1950s, and was denied at the time, but whose existence is now not disputed;&lt;ref name=lemann&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jews in Second Place |date=June 25, 1996 |first=Nicholas |last=Lemann |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/articles/1996/06/jews_in_second_place.html |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |quote=Just at the moment when Harvard, Yale, and Princeton have presidents named Rudenstine, Levin, and Shapiro, those institutions are widely suspected of having informal ceilings on Asian admissions, of the kind that were imposed on Jews two generations ago. |accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=english/&gt;&lt;ref name=unz2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Asian Quotas in the Ivy League?

More generally, by various measures admissions have a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] against Asian applicants, though not necessarily a strict quota: for example, successful Asian applicants have on average higher test scores than the overall average.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21669595-asian-americans-are-united-states-most-successful-minority-they-are-complaining-ever |title=The model minority is losing patience |date=Oct 3, 2015 |publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived bias against applicants of Asian descent has been termed a "[[bamboo ceiling]]" or "Asian penalty".&lt;ref name=english&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bella |last=English |journal=[[Boston Globe]] |date=June 1, 2015 |title=To get into elite colleges, some advised to ‘appear less Asian’ |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2015/06/01/college-counselors-advise-some-asian-students-appear-less-asian/Ew7g4JiQMiqYNQlIwqEIuO/story.html |quote=The groups say that they are facing the kind of quotas that limited the number of Jews in the nation’s best schools through the middle of the 20th century. |accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alleged Asian quotas have been the subject of government investigations and lawsuits, with some minor conclusions of their existence, though no major judgements, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=frontline&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting System]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sats/race/summary.html |title=Challenging Race Sensitive Admission Policies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
The primary evidence in favor of the existence of an Asian quota in United States universities admissions is statistical: over the 1990s and 2000s, when the college-age population of Asian-American roughly doubled (and the overall college-age population increased much less), the percentage of admitted Asian-Americans at Ivy League schools not only declined, but converged to a narrow range across different schools, and has stayed relatively constant from year to year.&lt;ref name=unz2014/&gt; By comparison, at schools that had race-blind policies, such as in the [[University of California]] system (notably its prestigious campuses at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[UCLA]], [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego]], [[University of California, Davis|Davis]], and [[University of California, Irvine|Irvine]]) and the [[California Institute of Technology]], Asian-American admissions increased in line with population, and at academic contests, such as [[International Science Olympiad]]s, Asian representation increased substantially over this period.&lt;ref name=unz2012/&gt; Regarding Harvard admissions, [[Ron Unz]] writes:&lt;ref name=unz2012/&gt;

{{quote|Harvard had always had a significant Asian-American enrollment, generally running around 5 percent when I had attended in the early 1980s. But during the following decade, the size of America's Asian middle class grew rapidly, leading to a sharp rise in applications and admissions, with Asians exceeding 10 percent of undergraduates by the late 1980s and crossing the 20 percent threshold by 1993. However, from that year forward, the Asian numbers went into reverse, generally stagnating or declining during the two decades which followed, with the official 2011 figure being 17.2 percent.

Even more surprising has been the sheer constancy of these percentages, with almost every year from 1995–2011 showing an Asian enrollment within a single point of the 16.5 percent average, despite huge fluctuations in the number of applications and the inevitable uncertainty surrounding which students will accept admission. By contrast, prior to 1993 Asian enrollment had often changed quite substantially from year to year. It is interesting to note that this exactly replicates the historical pattern observed by [[Jerome Karabel|Karabel]], in which Jewish enrollment rose very rapidly, leading to imposition of an informal quota system, after which the number of Jews fell substantially, and thereafter remained roughly constant for decades. On the face of it, ethnic enrollment levels which widely diverge from academic performance data or application rates and which remain remarkably static over time provide obvious circumstantial evidence for at least a de facto ethnic quota system.}}

While California is more Asian than other regions of the United States, it admits students nationally and internationally, and thus the above numbers are not solely reflective of regional demographics. By contrast, in [[New York City]], which has the country's largest urban Asian population, the prestigious [[Specialized high schools in New York City|specialized high schools]] of [[Stuyvesant High School]] and [[Bronx Science]] have majority Asian student bodies, which increased over the 1990s and 2000s, but at [[Columbia University]], which is in the Ivy League, the Asian undergraduate population fell from 22.7% in 1993 to 15.6% in 2011.&lt;ref name=unz2012/&gt;

== Denial ==

Ivy League universities deny that there is an Asian quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |first=Jeff |last=Neal |date=December 19, 2012 |title=Harvard Shuns Quotas and Narrow Criteria |url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/12/19/fears-of-an-asian-quota-in-the-ivy-league/harvard-shuns-quotas-and-narrow-criteria |quote=The admissions committee does not use quotas of any kind.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sensitivity of college admissions and racial preferences generally, and legal concerns (government investigations, court decisions, and ongoing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some historians&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Karabel, ''The Chosen'' (2005), pp. 524-525.&lt;/ref&gt; and former admissions officers&lt;ref&gt;''What It Really Takes to Get into the Ivy League'' (2003) Chuck Hughes, pp. 86, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise deny that there is an Asian quota or a bias against Asian applicants, or conclude as much.

More generally, the bias in test scores (the fact that successful Asian applicants have higher test scores than successful applicants overall) is ascribed to applicants being judged on more than test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|author=Rod M. Bugarin Jr.

|date=December 19, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stated formally, rather than higher test scores among successful Asian applicants meaning that an individual Asian applicant must meet a higher bar than an otherwise identical non-Asian applicant, it may simply be a reflection that Asians have ''relatively'' higher test scores: compared to the overall applicant pool, Asians have higher test scores, and a borderline Asian applicant will have higher test scores, but be lower on all other non-academic measures, than the average borderline applicant.

=== Lawsuits ===
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
Racial quotas are illegal in United States college admissions, but race can be used as a factor in admissions decisions ([[affirmative action]]), as decided in ''[[Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke]]'' (1978) and re-affirmed in ''[[Fisher v. University of Texas (2013)|Fisher v. University of Texas]]'' (2013). Lawsuits have been filed on this basis, including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25018">'''Autocomplete''', or '''word completion''', is a feature in which an [[application software|application]] predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. In [[graphical user interface]]s, users can typically press the [[tab key]] to accept a suggestion or the down [[arrow key]] to accept one of several.

Autocomplete speeds up [[human-computer interaction]]s when it correctly predicts the word a user intends to enter after only a few characters have been typed into a text input field. It works best in domains with a limited number of possible words (such as in [[command line interpreter]]s), when some words are much more common (such as when addressing an [[e-mail]]), or writing structured and predictable text (as in [[source code editor]]s).

Many autocomplete [[algorithm]]s learn new words after the user has written them a few times, and can suggest alternatives based on the learned habits of the individual user.

== Definition ==

=== Original purpose ===
The original purpose of word prediction software was to help people with [[physical disabilities]] increase their typing speed,&lt;ref name=tam2009&gt;Tam, C. &amp; Wells, D. (2009). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400430903175473 Evaluating the Benefits of Displaying Word Prediction Lists on a Personal Digital Assistant at the Keyboard Level]. Assistive Technology, 21, 105-114.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to help them decrease the number of keystrokes needed in order to complete a word or a sentence.&lt;ref name =anson&gt;Anson, D., Moist, P., Przywara, M., Wells, H., Saylor, H. &amp; Maxime, H. (2006). The Effects of Word Completion and Word Prediction on Typing Rates Using On-Screen Keyboards. Assistive Technology, 18, 146-154.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to increase speed is noted by the fact that people who use [[speech-generating device]]s generally produce speech at a rate that is less than 10% as fast as people who use oral speech.&lt;ref name =trnka&gt;Trnka, K., Yarrington, J.M. &amp; McCoy, K.F. (2007). The Effects of Word Prediction on Communication Rate for AAC. Proceedings of NAACL HLT 2007, Companion Volume, 173-176.&lt;/ref&gt; But the function is also very useful for anybody who writes text, and especially useful for people who often use long and hard to spell technical or medical terms, like medical doctors.

=== Description ===
Autocomplete or word completion works so that when the writer writes the first letter or letters of a word, the program predicts one or more possible words as choices.  If the word he intends to write is included in the list he can select it, for example by using the number keys. If the word that the user wants is not predicted, the writer must enter the next letter of the word. At this time, the word choice(s) is altered so that the words provided begin with the same letters as those that have been selected. When the word that the user wants appears it is selected, and the word is inserted into the text.&lt;ref name=b77&gt;Beukelman, D.R. &amp; Mirenda, P. (2008). Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Supporting Children and Adults with Complex Communication Needs. (3rd Ed.) Baltimore, MD: Brookes Publishing, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="witten"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Witten, I. H. |author2=Darragh, John J. |title=The reactive keyboard |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1992 |pages=43–44 |isbn=0-521-40375-8 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obxCY0wcaTgC&amp;pg=PA44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another form of word prediction, words most likely to follow the just written one are predicted, based on recent word pairs used.&lt;ref name="witten"/&gt;  Word prediction uses language modeling, where within a set vocabulary the words are most likely to occur are calculated.&lt;ref&gt;Jelinek, F. (1990). Self-Organized Language Modeling for Speech Recognition. In Waibel, A. &amp; Kai-Fulee, Ed. Morgan, M.B. Readings in Speech Recognition (pp. 450). San Mateo, California: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with language modeling, basic word prediction on [[Augmentative and alternative communication|AAC]] devices is often coupled with a [[serial position effect#Recency effect|recency]] model, where words that are used more frequently by the AAC user are more likely to be predicted.&lt;ref name =trnka/&gt;  Word prediction software often also allows the user to enter their own words into the word prediction dictionaries either directly, or by "learning" words that have been written.&lt;ref name=b77/&gt;&lt;ref name="witten"/&gt; Some search returns related to genitals or other vulgar terms are often omitted from autocompletion technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Oster, Jan. "Communication, defamation and liability of intermediaries." Legal Studies 35.2 (2015): 348-368&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standalone tools ==
There are standalone tools that add autocomplete functionality to existing applications. These programs monitor user keystrokes and suggests a list of words based on first typed letter(s). Examples are Typingaid and Letmetype.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autohotkey.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=53630 TypingAid&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clasohm.com/lmt/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527195205/http://www.clasohm.com/lmt/en/ |archivedate=2012-05-27 |df= }} LetMeType&lt;/ref&gt; LetMeType, freeware, is no longer developed, the author has published the source code and allows anybody to continue development. Typingaid, also freeware, is actively developed. Intellicomplete, both a freeware and payware version, works only in certain programs which hook into the intellicomplete server program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intellicomplete.com/ Autocomplete program with wordlist for medicine&lt;/ref&gt; Many Autocomplete programs can also be used to create a [[Shorthand]] list.  The original autocomplete software was Smartype, which dates back to the late 1980s and is still available today.  It was initially developed for medical transcriptionists working in WordPerfect for MS/DOS, but it now functions for any application in any Windows or Web-based program.

=== Shorthand ===
[[Autocorrect|Shorthand]], also called Autoreplace, is a related feature that involves automatic replacement of a particular string with another one, usually one that is longer and harder to type, as "myname" with "Lee John Nikolai François Al Rahman". This can also quietly fix simple typing errors, such as turning "[[teh]]" into "the". Several Autocomplete programs, standalone or integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a shorthand function for often used phrases.

=== Context completion ===
'''Context completion''' is a text editor feature, similar to word completion, which completes words (or entire phrases) based on the current context and context of other similar words within the same document, or within some training data set. The main advantage of context completion is the ability to predict anticipated words more precisely and even with no initial letters. The main disadvantage is the need of a training data set, which is typically larger for context completion than for simpler word completion. Most common use of context completion is seen in advanced programming language editors and [[Integrated development environment|IDEs]], where training data set is inherently available and context completion makes more sense to the user than broad word completion would.

'''Line completion''' is a type of context completion, first introduced by Juraj Simlovic in [[TED Notepad]], in July 2006. The context in line completion is the current line, while current document poses as training data set. When user begins a line which starts with a frequently used phrase, the editor automatically completes it, up to the position where similar lines differ, or proposes a list of common continuations.

'''Action completion''' in applications are standalone tools that add autocomplete functionality to an existing applications or all existing applications of a OS, based on the current context. The main advantage of Action completion is the ability to predict anticipated actions. The main disadvantage is the need of a  data set. Most common use of Action completion is seen in advanced programming language editors and [[Integrated development environment|IDEs]]. But there are also action completion tools that work globally, in parallel, across all applications of the entire PC without (very) hindering the action completion of the respective applications.

== Usage by software ==

=== In web browsers ===
[[File:Autocomplete Mozilla Firefox 23 - Wikipedia de search.png|thumb|Autocomplete of the search box in [[Mozilla Firefox]]]]
In [[web browser]]s, autocomplete is done in the address bar (using items from the browser's history) and in text boxes on frequently used pages, such as a [[search engine]]'s search box. Autocomplete for web addresses is particularly convenient because the full addresses are often long and difficult to type correctly. [[HTML5]] has an autocomplete form attribute.

=== In e-mail programs ===
In [[e-mail program]]s autocomplete is typically used to fill in the e-mail addresses of the intended recipients. Generally, there are a small number of frequently used e-mail addresses, hence it is relatively easy to use autocomplete to select among them. Like web addresses, e-mail addresses are often long, hence typing them completely is inconvenient.

For instance, [[Microsoft]] [[Outlook Express]] will find addresses based on the name that is used in the address book.  [[Google]]'s [[Gmail]] will find addresses by any string that occurs in the address or stored name.

=== In search engines ===
In search engines, autocomplete user interface features provide users with suggested queries or results as they type their query in the search box.  This is also commonly called ''autosuggest'' or ''[[incremental search]]''.  This type of search often relies on matching algorithms that forgive entry errors such as phonetic [[Soundex]] algorithms or the language independent [[Levenshtein algorithm]].  The challenge remains to search large indices or popular query lists in under a few milliseconds so that the user sees results pop up while typing.

Autocomplete can have an adverse effect on individuals and businesses when negative search terms are suggested when a search takes place. Autocomplete has now become a part of [[reputation management]] as companies linked to negative search terms such as scam, complaints and fraud seek to alter the results. Google in particular have listed some of the aspects that affect how their algorithm works, but this is an area that is open to manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davids|first1=Neil|title=Changing Autocomplete Search Suggestions|url=http://www.reputationstation.com.au/changing-autocomplete-suggested-terms-in-google-searches/|website=Reputation Station|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In source code editors ===
[[File:Qt Creator 5.0-Autocomplete.png|thumb|Code completion in [[Qt Creator]] 5.0: The programmer types some code, and when the software detects a recognizable string such as a variable identifier or class name it presents a menu to the programmer which contains the complete name of the identified variable or the methods applicable to the detected class, and the programmer makes a choice with her or his mouse or with the keyboard arrow keys. If the programmer continues typing without making a choice, then the menu disappears]]
Autocomplete of source code is also known as '''code completion'''. In a [[source code editor]] autocomplete is greatly simplified by the regular structure of the [[programming language]]s. There are usually only a limited number of words meaningful in the current context or [[namespace]], such as names of variables and functions. An example of code completion is [[Microsoft]]'s [[IntelliSense]] design. It involves showing a pop-up list of possible completions for the current input prefix to allow the user to choose the right one. This is particularly useful in [[object-oriented programming]] because often the programmer will not know exactly what members a particular [[class (computer science)|class]] has. Therefore, autocomplete then serves as a form of convenient documentation as well as an input method. Another beneficial feature of autocomplete for source code is that it encourages the programmers to use longer, more descriptive variable names incorporating both lower and upper case letters ([[CamelCase]]), hence making the [[source code]] more readable. Typing large words with many mixed cases like "numberOfWordsPerParagraph" can be difficult, but Autocomplete allows one to complete typing the word using a fraction of the keystrokes.

=== In database query tools ===
Autocompletion in [[database query]] tools allows the user to autocomplete the table names in an [[SQL]] statement and column names of the tables referenced in the SQL statement. As text is typed into the [[Source code editor|editor]], the context of the cursor within the SQL statement provides an indication of whether the user needs a table completion or a table column completion.  The table completion provides a list of tables available in the [[database server]] the user is connected to. The column completion provides a list of columns for only tables referenced in the SQL statement. [[SQL Server Management Studio]] provides autocomplete in query tools.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== In word processors ===
In many [[word processing]] programs, autocompletion decreases the amount of time spent typing repetitive words and phrases. The source material for autocompletion is either gathered from the rest of the current document or from a list of common words defined by the user. Currently [[Apache OpenOffice]], [[Calligra Suite]], [[KOffice]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[Microsoft Office]] include support for this kind of autocompletion, as do advanced text editors such as [[Emacs]] and [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]].
* [[Apache OpenOffice Writer]] and [[LibreOffice Writer]] have a working word completion program that proposes words previously typed in the text, rather than from the whole dictionary
* [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheet application has a working word completion program that proposes words previously typed in upper cells

=== In command-line interpreters ===
{{main|Command-line completion}}

In a [[command-line interpreter]], such as [[Unix]]'s [[Bourne shell|sh]] or [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], or [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]'s [[cmd.exe]] or [[PowerShell]], or in similar [[command line interface]]s, autocomplete of command names and file names may be accomplished by keeping track of all the possible names of things the user may access. Here autocomplete is usually done by pressing the [[Tab key|{{keypress|Tab}}]] key after typing the first several letters of the word. For example, if the only file in the current directory that starts with x is xLongFileName, the user may prefer to type x and autocomplete to the complete name. If there were another file name or command starting with x in the same scope, the user would type more letters or press the Tab key repeatedly to select the appropriate text.

== Efficiency ==

=== Parameters for efficiency ===
The efficiency of word completion is based on the average length of the words typed. If, for example, the text consists of programming languages which often have longNamesForSpecialFunctions(), completion is both useful and generally applied in editors specially geared towards programmer such as [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]].

In different languages, word lengths can differ dramatically. Picking up on the above example, a soccer player in [[German language|German]] is translated as a "Fussballspieler", with a length of 15 characters. This example illustrates that [[English language|English]] is not the most efficient language for WC; this study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb16-3/tb48soj2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; shows an average length for English words in a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of over 100,000 words to be 8.93, for [[Czech language|Czech]] to be 10.55 and for German to be 13.24.  In addition, in some languages like German called [[fusional language]]s as well as [[agglutinative language]]s, words can be combined, creating even longer words.

Authors who often use very long words, like medical doctors and chemists, obviously have even more use for Autocomplete (Word completion) software than other authors.

=== Research ===
Although research has shown that word prediction software does decrease the number of keystrokes needed and improves the written productivity of children with disabilities,&lt;ref name=tam2009/&gt; there are mixed results as to whether or not word prediction actually increases speed of output.&lt;ref&gt;Dabbagh, H. H. &amp; Damper, R. I. (1985). Average Selection Length and Time as Predictors of Communication Rate. Proceedings of the RESNA 1985 Annual Conference, RESNA Press, 104-106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodenough-Trepagnier, C., &amp; Rosen, M.J. (1988). Predictive Assessment for Communication Aid Prescription: Motor-Determined Maximum Communication Rate. In L.E. Bernstein (Ed.), The vocally impaired: Clinical Practice and Research (pp. 165-185).Philadelphia: Grune &amp; Stratton.; as cited in Tam &amp; Wells (2009), pp. 105-114.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that the reason why word prediction does not always increase the rate of text entry is because of the increased [[cognitive load]] and requirement to move eye gaze from the keyboard to the monitor.&lt;ref name=tam2009/&gt;

In order to reduce this cognitive load, parameters such as reducing the list to five likely words, and having a vertical layout of those words may be used.&lt;ref name=tam2009/&gt;  The vertical layout is meant to keep head and eye movements to a minimum, and also gives additional visual cues because the word length becomes apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Swiffin, A. L., Arnott, J. L., Pickering, J. A., &amp; Newell, A. F. (1987). Adaptive and predictive techniques in a communication prosthesis. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 3, 181–191; as cited in Tam &amp; Wells (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many software developers believe that if the word prediction list follows the [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]], that this will reduce eye movements,&lt;ref name=tam2009/&gt; in a study of children with [[Spina Bifida]] by Tam, Reid, O'Keefe &amp; Nauman (2002) it was shown that typing was more accurate, and that the children also preferred when the list appeared at the bottom edge of the screen, at the midline. Several studies have found that word prediction performance and satisfaction increases when the word list is closer to the keyboard, because of the decreased amount of eye-movements needed.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, C., Reid, D., Naumann, S., &amp; O’ Keefe, B. (2002). Perceived benefits of word prediction intervention on written productivity in children with Spina Bifida and hydrocephalus. Occupational Therapy International, 9, 237–255; as cited in Tam &amp; Wells (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Software with word prediction is produced by multiple manufacturers. The software can be bought as an add-on to common programs such as [[Microsoft Word]] (for example, [[WordQ+SpeakQ]], Typing Assistant,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prlog.org/10519217-typing-assistant-new-generation-of-word-prediction-software.html Typing Assistant&lt;/ref&gt; Co:Writer,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Wivik,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Ghotit Dyslexia),{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} or as one of many features on an AAC device (PRC's Pathfinder,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Dynavox Systems,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Saltillo’s ChatPC products{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}). Some well known programs: Intellicomplete,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} which is available in both a freeware and a payware version, but works only with programs which are made to work with it. Letmetype{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and Typingaid{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} are both freeware programs which work in any text editor.

An early version of autocompletion was described in 1967 by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins]] in his Computer-Assisted Typewriter (CAT),&lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, H.C., Ortony, A., The Adaptive Memorization of Sequences, In Machine Intelligence 3, Proceedings of the Third Annual Machine Intelligence Workshop, University of Edinburgh, September 1967. 311-322, Publisher: Edinburgh University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; “such words as ‘BEGIN’ or ‘PROCEDURE’ or identifiers introduced by the programmer, would be automatically completed by the CAT after the programmer had typed only one or two symbols.”

== Academic writing ==
In 2016, New Zealand academic Christoph Bartneck was invited to provide a presentation at a [[ConferenceSeries]] [[predatory meeting]],&lt;ref name=BeallPM&gt;{{cite web|title = OMICS Goes from "Predatory Publishing" to "Predatory Meetings"|first1 = Jeffrey|last1 = Beall|first2 = Richard|last2 = Levine|authorlink1 = Jeffrey Beall|url = https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/|date = 25 January 2013|accessdate = 22 October 2016|publisher = [[Scholarly Open Access]]|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160605042104/https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/|archivedate = 5 June 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bogus British Company "Accredits" OMICS Conferences|first = Jeffrey|last = Beall|authorlink = Jeffrey Beall|url = https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|date = 13 October 2016|accessdate = 22 October 2016|publisher = [[Scholarly Open Access]]|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161106003123/https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|archivedate = 6 November 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2016 International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics.

'''Basil Thompson''' (1937–2004) was a [[ballet]] dancer, master, and teacher.

He was trained by the [[Sadler's Wells]] Ballet School, now the [[Royal Ballet]] in London, and began his career with the [[Covent Garden]] Opera Ballet. He became a soloist with the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in New York City in 1960, was a ballet master with the [[Joffrey Ballet]], then became a ballet master and artistic director of the [[Milwaukee Ballet]] from 1981 to 2000. During his early career in the USA he was married to Alaine Haubert and they had a son, Edward Thompson, in 1969.

He later married Kitty Carrol. They had two children, Audrey and Colin.

Thompson died November 2, 2004 in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] of sudden [[cardiac arrest]]. He was on sabbatical from teaching at the [[University of Iowa]]. He was 67.

"Basil brought joy, vigor and dedication to his work as a ballet master, teacher and coach," Gerald Arpino, founder and artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, stated after Thompson's demise. "He knew the art of ballet thoroughly and lovingly shared it with all of us."

'''Blue Dragon Children's Foundation''' (Blue Dragon) is a charitably funded [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]]. Its mission is to help children escape from crisis by offering a range of services including rescue from slavery, shelter, education and employment.

==History==
The foundation was begun by an Australian school teacher, [[Michael Brosowski]]. He came to Vietnam in 2002 to teach English at the [[National Economics University (Vietnam)|University of Economics]]. While there he met many street children, and began to teach free classes with one of his students, Pham Sy Chung. They taught maths, English, yoga, and art. They also formed a football team to promote a sense of sportsmanship and teamwork, while also getting to know new children living on the street. Initially 3 teenage boys turned up for these games, but soon over 40 came each weekend. In 2016 their team, Blue Dragon United, will play its 2000th game.

By early 2003, Brosowski had quit his university job to concentrate full-time on the needs of the street children. Word spread and more kept arriving to seek help, coming with medical problems, educational needs, and often needing a place to sleep. As the number grew, it became clear that many of the children coming for help would need long-term support. On June 2, 2003, The Big Room was opened, a residence for six former street kids. It was funded for its first year by a $5000 donation from two expatriate women, Chantelle and Danielle.&lt;ref&gt; [http://vietnamstreets.blogspot.jp/2008/06/big-room-turns-5.html Monday, The Big Room turns 5 June 02, 2008] ''Street Kids in Vietnam blog'' Retrieved May 27, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt; In August 2004 in [[Bắc Ninh Province|Bac Ninh province]] the "Stay in School" program was launched to try to help keep poor rural children in school&lt;ref name="report"&gt; [http://www.bluedragon.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Blue-Dragon-Annual-Report-2011-2012.pdf Blue Dragon Foundation's Annual Report 2011-2012 page 5] Retrieved May 27, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bluedragon.org/what-we-do/our-work/stay-in-school/ Stay in School] Blue Dragon Children's Foundation website Retrieved May 27, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bluedragon.org/about/our-story/ Blue Dragon's story] Blue Dragon Children's Foundation website Retrieved May 27, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt; and the group continued to reach out to other children in the Hanoi area.

In March 2004 Blue Dragon Children's Foundation was registered as an Incorporated Association in [[New South Wales]] in Australia and in September 2004, it was registered as an Independent Non-Government Organisation in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; In early 2005 Chung left Vietnam to study in the US, and Brosowski hired two full-time staff to replace him. With these two staff, a combined office and drop-in centre was opened in March of that year.

Blue Dragon Children's Foundation now supports over 1500 children and youth around Vietnam, particularly in [[Hanoi]], [[Bắc Ninh|Bac Ninh]], [[Huế|Hue]] and [[Điện Biên Province|Dien Bien]].

==Activities==

Blue Dragon's main aim is to rescue children from crisis situations in the short term and then get them into school, training and ultimately employment in the long term. To achieve this, the organisation offers a range of direct services. Accommodation is provided, or repair/refurbishment of their existing home if living conditions simply aren't suitable. Out-of-school tuition is provided to help children study. Books and stationery are given to those who can't afford them, and scholarships are provided both for children and tertiary students. Medical care and nutritional support are provided to those who need it. 

Child trafficking is a major issue in SE Asia, and Blue Dragon tackles this both within Vietnam and internationally. From 2005 to January 2016, Blue Dragon rescued over 500 children and young adults from forced labour, forced marriages, and brothels.

Blue Dragon operates a drop-in centre for street children in Hanoi, where they can play, shower, study and take part in social activities.

In addition to these direct services, Blue Dragon staff offer training opportunities to government officials on issues such as human trafficking and child abuse; and work with legislators to revise and improve the country's legal framework for children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3289">The '''Braunau Contemporary History Days''' are a series of conferences organised by the ''association for contemporary history''.  Scientifically guided by [[Andreas Maislinger]], it has annually taken place in [[Braunau am Inn]] since 1992.

== History ==
During those conferences several topics have been discussed, for example: coping with the past, resistance in dictatorships and other issues related to contemporary history. Since 2004 the association for [[contemporary history]] aims to involve more topics related to the [[Innviertel]]-region and the bordering [[Bavaria]]. In 2004, the conference dealt with the "Small Border Traffic" alongside the [[Salzach]]-river and the [[Inn River|Inn]]-river from 1933 to 1938, the "Great Politics" as well as the daily life along the interface of two political systems, whose differences and similarities were pointed out. 
Between 23 and 25 September 2005, the historical background of the [[Braunau Parliament]] of 1705 was analyzed, which united nobility, clergy, bourgeois and farmers under the slogan "Rather die Bavarian-like, than decaying in the Austrian way" (in German: "Lieber bayrisch sterben als österreichisch verderben") for a short period of time. 
In 2006, the conference was devoted to [[Johann Philipp Palm]], a bookseller from [[Nuremberg]] who was shot in [[Braunau am Inn|Braunau]] on [[Napoleon]]'s order in August 1806.

In 2007, [[Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer Award]] (*1894 in Ranshofen; †1957 in New York) was commemorated. He was a prominent state scientist and a diplomat in the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]]. Despite his commitment for [[Austria]], he is widely forgotten. During the conference, the Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer Award was awarded to the [[Trapp Family]] for their work performed and establishing the [[Trapp Family Austrian Relief]]. The laudation was held by the Austrian ambassador [[Emil Brix]].

On the occasion of the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in Austria and [[Switzerland]], the 17th Braunau Contemporary History Days discussed the topic "Fascination Football" in 2008.

==Biography==
She was educated at [[Pomona College]], and received her M.F.A. at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].  She is the Olivia Filippi Professor of Poetry at [[Saint Mary's College of California|Saint Mary's College]] in Moraga, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueflowerarts.com/bhillman.html Brenda Hillman, blueflowerarts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101050152/http://www.blueflowerarts.com/bhillman.html |date=January 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also taught during a residency at the [[Atlantic Center for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticcenterforthearts.org/artresprog/resschedule/may/b_hillman.html ''Residency Schedule'', atlanticcenterforthearts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121075544/http://www.atlanticcenterforthearts.org/artresprog/resschedule/may/b_hillman.html |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillman met the writer [[Leonard Michaels]] (1933-2003) in Iowa City in 1975, they were married in Berkeley in 1976, which ended in divorce in the late 1980s. They had a daughter together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/leonardmichaels.htm |title=Leonard Michaels |publisher=Senate.universityofcalifornia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203030258/http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/leonardmichaels.htm |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/leonard-michaels |title=Leonard Michaels Biography |publisher=eNotes.com |date=1933-01-02 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, she is married to the poet [[Robert Hass]].

==Work==
One of contemporary poetry's most eclectic and formally innovative writers, Brenda Hillman is known for poems that draw on elements of found texts and document, personal meditation, observation, and literary theory. Often described as “sensuous” and “luminescent,” Hillman's poetry investigates and pushes at the possibilities of form and voice, while remaining grounded in topics such as geology, the environment, politics, family, and spirituality. In an interview with Sarah Rosenthal, Hillman described her own understanding of form: “It is the artist’s job to make form. Not even to make it, but to allow it. Allow form. And all artists have a different relationship to it, and a different philosophy of it… I think that when you are trying to open up a territory—in this case I was working with a desire to open the lyric—you have to be greedy, in that you want more than you can do. And you’re always bound to fail.”

Brenda Hillman has published nine collections of poetry, all from Wesleyan University Press: ''White Dress'' (1985), ''Fortress'' (1989), ''Death Tractates'' (1992), ''Bright Existence'' (1993), ''Loose Sugar'' (1997), ''Cascadia'' (2001), ''Pieces of Air in the Epic'' (2005), and ''Practical Water'' (2009), for which she won the LA Times Book Award for Poetry. Her ninth collection of poetry, the final volume in her tetralogy of books about the classical elements, ''Seasonal Works with Letters on Fire'' (2013), received the International Griffin Poetry Prize for 2014, as well as the Northern California Book Award for Poetry and the California Book Award Gold Medal in Poetry.

In her interview with Rosenthal, Hillman concluded by admitting: “I hope that whatever experiment and opening and wildness and exploration the poem has to go through—and I do mean the poem because I feel like I am in its hands when I’m writing—that it keeps human experience recognizable.”

Hillman is also the author of three chapbooks: ''Coffee, 3 A.M.'' (Penumbra Press, 1982), ''Autumn Sojourn'' (Em Press, 1995), and ''The Firecage'' (a+bend press, 2000).

She has edited an edition of Emily Dickinson's poetry for Shambhala Publications, and, with Patricia Dienstfrey, co-edited ''The Grand Permission: New Writings on Poetics and Motherhood'' (2003). With Paul Ebenkamp, she co-edited ''Writing the Silences, New California Poetry'' (2010). She co-translated, with Diallah Haidar, ''Poems from Above the Hill: Selected Poems of Ashur Etwebi'', one of Libya's most significant poets. In 2010 she co-translated Jeongrye Choi's book of poems, ''Instances'', released by Parlor Press.

Hillman has been increasingly interested in the innovative and experimental lyric traditions, particularly in how the Romantic concepts of nature and spirit have manifested in contemporary poetry. In her essay entitled “Split, Spark, and Space,” Hillman writes about the emergence of different kinds of lyric impulses in her writing: “The sense of a single ‘voice’ in poetry grew to include polyphonies, oddly collective dictations, and the process of writing itself. This happened in part because of a rediscovered interest in esoteric western tradition and in part because I came to a community of women who were writing in exploratory forms…A poetic method which had heretofore been based on waiting for insight suddenly had to accommodate process, and indeterminate physics, a philosophy of detached looking.”

== Critical reception ==
Hillman’s early poetry collections received critical praise for their transfiguration of experience. With the publication of ''Loose Sugar'', however, Hillman acquired a formidable reputation in the world of contemporary poetry. ''Cascadia'' and ''Pieces of Air in the Epic'' both use complicated structures to achieve what Forrest Gander has called “poetic architectures.” Hillman spoke to Poets and Writers about her process of composition in ''Cascadia'': “One of the ideas I got from André Breton when I read him in college is the use of chance as anchor. I would arbitrarily choose words and make myself use them to anchor the rest of the writing to the page…in the long poem, ‘A Geology,’ the corner words ‘anchor’ the rest of the poem to the page so it wouldn't float.”

Reviewing ''Practical Water'' for the ''Boston Review'', Craig Morgan Teicher spoke to Hillman’s process: “Hillman has charted her own unusual course, borrowing things—a mixture of conversational and high-lyric diction, an emphasis on language’s materiality, an interest in metaphysics and occult knowledge, and a passionate environmental and political consciousness—from pretty much every major poetic movement of the last century.” ''Practical Water'' even includes transcripts from congressional hearings, in which Hillman tries to “seek out the humanity behind policy and policymakers.”

The fourth volume in the series, ''Seasonal Works With Letters on Fire'', was a long-list finalist for the National Book Award and won a California Book Award Gold Medal; the Northern California Book Award for Poetry; and the International Griffin Poetry Prize. The Judges’ Citation for the Griffin hails Hillman's latest: “''Seasonal Works'' appears to be one of the most inclusive books a hyper-active imagination could wring out of the actual. The symbols of the alphabet come alive and perform acrobatic marvels. Phonetical bird calls join in on cue. The mighty challenges of now are fully engaged. The book performs an ‘anarchic music’ and stimulates a craving for undiluted love, and a rollicking fury for justice that only its widely variant forms can sustain. This is a unique work.”

Dean Rader also praised the work, writing “''Seasonal Works With Letters On Fire'' is a profoundly humane work. In language that moves from the chatty to the experimental to the heightened to the rhetorical, Hillman shows us once again that poetry is itself a tireless worker, always on our behalf.”

Praising Hillman’s deft handling of form and subject, Marjorie Welish has stated, “each poem that Hillman writes creates its own experimental configuration, within which the phrase swerves and discombobulates sense, as several registers of subject complicate the sampling of experiences and also as the experimental format throws the lyric into symbolic disarray one moment and naturalist scrutiny the next. And even more: she writes as if the lyric poem had a political calling.”

The '''Centre for Dialogue''' is an interdisciplinary [[research]] institution at [[La Trobe University]]. Professor Joseph Camilleri was the Director of the Centre from 2006 until 2013. The current Director is Professor Alberto Gomez. The research centre specialises in the ''philosophy, method'' and ''practice'' of [[dialogue]] between [[communities]], [[cultures]], [[religions]] and [[civilisations]]. The key aims of the Centre include:
* Educational projects designed to promote inter-cultural/inter-civilisational dialogue in schools and universities
* Research that addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by cultural, religious and political diversity and conflict
* Policy advice to governmental bodies, international agencies and non-governmental organisations
* Events, such as public forums, conferences, workshops, professional development days, courses, seminars consultations and media events
* Publications, such as working papers, books, articles, reports and media comment.

==Projects of the Centre==
[[Image:CfD Flyer Collage 2.JPG|200px|thumb]] 

The focus of the Centre is largely concentrated on inter-cultural, inter-religious conflict and inter-civilisational conflict, as well as the researching of practical methods of dialogue which may encourage [[peace]]ful [[resolution (policy debate)|resolutions]] to conflict and mechanisms for [[cooperation]].

The Centre for Dialogue has several current ongoing projects which act as the hallmark of the institutions' study. 

Examples of such ongoing projects are investigating the tensions relations to the role of religion and culture in international politics, particularly since the [[September 11 attacks|11 September terrorist attacks]]. Such projects continue to focus on how the [[government]], [[international non-governmental organisation|nongovernment]] and [[civil society]] sectors have responded, most notable in [[Europe]], the [[United States]], and [[Asia]] (including [[Australia]]). The projects investigate both domestic conflict (for example, strategies to curb escalating tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims) and international tensions (for example, the implications arising from the rise of [[Political Islam]] and the [[War on Terror]] in international politics).

Other projects include:
* The '''Education Dialogue Project''', which has investigated ways that dialogue can enhance intercultural awareness and understanding in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] schools.
* The '''Dialogue Diaspora Project''' which explores the nature of tensions between ethno-nationalist [[diaspora|diasporic]] communities in [[Australia]] whose homelands are in conflict (for example, the Sri Lankan, Iraqi and Cypriot communities). The project examines the formation and transformation of such conflicts in Australia and explores practical dialogical methods to reduce their impact.
* The '''Northern Interfaith Network''' which is developing a network of initiatives in [[Melbourne|Melbourne’s]] culturally-diverse northern suburbs with five municipalities and seven organisations. It aims to provide government agencies (federal and state), religious and ethnic groups and community organisations with tested guidelines to facilitate community based dialogue initiatives.

The Centre for Dialogue also runs several educational programmes, such as the '''Muslim Leadership Program for Young Muslims''' which aims to empower young Muslim men and women and help them to reach their full potential as citizens and future leaders.

==Publications==
[[Image:CfD Flyer Collage.JPG|250px|thumb|left]]

The Centre for Dialogue composes and distributes publications arising from their diverse research projects. This includes the publication of books, edited volumes and journal articles, as well as discussion papers that are distributed to relevant organisations and government departments. The Centre also distributes a bi-annual newsletter that reports on the Centre’s activities, as well as includes opinion pieces on issues that relate to the Centre’s interests.

The Centre for Dialogue also distributes several working papers each year that do not necessarily relate to the Centre’s projects. [[Monograph]]s are submitted to the Centre to be considered by the editorial committee for [[publication]]. The intention of the Working Papers is to provide the research community (including students and academics), policy-makers, journalists and community leaders with an opportunity to contribute to ongoing debates. Papers are preferred to focus on the dynamics of conflict (whether intrastate, inter-state, or trans-state). They generally must also identify ways in which the theory and/or practice of ''dialogue'' has contributed to coexistence, co-operation and mutual enrichment and highlight methods that may foster peaceful relations in the future.

The Centre for Dialogue and its staff provide the core of the editorial input of the scholarly journal, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061231062815/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/14781158.html ''Global Change, Peace and Security''], published by Routledge and edited from La Trobe University.

The previous Director; Professor Joseph Camilleri's most recent book, co-authored with Professor Jim Falk, was launched by UNDP head, the Hon Helen Clark, in Sydney, Australia in February 2010. The book "Worlds in Transition: Evolving Governance Across a Stressed Planet", Edward Elgar, UK, is a synoptic overview of the way in which humans have come to collectively seek to shape their futures, and the challenges posed to that in a time of rapid transition. 

The Centre for Dialogue hosts one major national or international conference and one major public lecture each year, such as an international conference titled ‘Europe and Asia: Between Islam and the United States’ in 2008, and a 2009 controversial keynote address by former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.

[[Image:Cheating.JPG|thumb|right|A cheat sheet that is used contrary to the rules of an exam may need to be small enough to conceal in the [[palm (hand)|palm of the hand]]]]
[[Image:Spicker trinkflasche.jpg|thumb|Cheat sheet in a [[juicebox (container)|juice box]]]]
A '''cheat sheet''' (also ''cheatsheet'') or '''crib sheet''' is a concise set of notes used for quick reference.

Cheat sheets are so named because they may be used by students without the instructor's knowledge to [[Cheating|cheat]] on a [[Test (assessment)|test]]. However, at higher levels of education where [[rote learning|rote memorization]] is not as important as in basic education, students may be permitted to consult their own notes during the exam (which is not considered cheating).  The act of preparing a crib sheet can be an educational exercise, and students are sometimes only allowed to use crib sheets they have written themselves. 

A cheat sheet is a physical piece of paper, often filled with equations and/or facts in compressed writing. Students often print cheat sheets in extremely small font, fitting an entire page of notes in the palm of their hands during the exam.

Crib sheets are also fully worked solutions for exams or work sheets normally handed out to university staff in order to ease marking.

==As reference cards==
{{Main|Reference card}}
In more general usage, a crib sheet is any short (one or two page) reference to terms, commands, or symbols where the user is expected to understand the use of such terms but not necessarily to have memorized all of them.  Many computer applications, for example, have crib sheets included in their documentation, which list keystrokes or menu commands needed to achieve specific tasks to save the user the effort of digging through an entire manual to find the keystroke needed to, for example, move between two windows.  An example of such a crib sheet is one for the [[GIMP]] photo editing software.&lt;ref name="Keys and Mouse Reference"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.gimp.org/en/key-reference.html |title=GIMP Keys and Mouse Reference |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include "Read Me First" and "Quick Reference Card" documents included with consumer electronics.

Some academic and technical publishers also publish crib sheets for software packages and technical topics.  In some cases these are also intended as display items in that they are colorful and visually appealing. Web-based crib sheets, such as references to terms, commands, or symbols, have become extremely common.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41078">'''Deaf Education in Kenya''' is a constantly changing section of the Kenyan education system that is focused on educating deaf, hard-of-hearing, and hearing-impaired Kenyan students. There are many organizations in [[Kenya]] made to protect the rights of Deaf Kenyans and promote progress in [[deaf education]]. The state of Kenyan deaf education is constantly changing and improving.

==Deaf Sign Language Use in Kenya==

===Kenyan Sign Language===
{{Main|Kenyan Sign Language}} 
[[Kenyan Sign Language]] (KSL) is the used by the [[deaf community]] of [[Kenya]], the population of which is estimated to be 600,000. With a population of around 340,000 speakers (based on a 2007 consensus), KSL acts as the primary mode of communication for over half of the deaf population. There are two known dialects- [[Kisumu]] in western Kenya and [[Mombasa]] in eastern Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/xki|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other sign languages, KSL evolved largely through the social interactions of the deaf. Vocabulary is enriched and constantly changing through the movement of unique signs originating in remote areas to other schools or communities. These regional differences can create dialects, just as in oral languages. Kenya, being a culturally diverse country, has around 42 ethnic groups and their local sign languages provided the basis for KSL and allow for its continued diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first dictionary for an African Sign Language was written in Kenya in 1988 by Rothenborg-Jensen and Yego on Kenyan Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmaling|first=C. H.|title=Dictionaries of African Sign Languages: An Overview|journal=Sign Language Studies|year=2012|volume=12|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenyan Sign Language Family====
KSL may has connections to [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and [[British Sign Language]] (BSL), and the manual alphabet is largely (omit) based on that of the American Sign Language, though the British one was used previously and still used in a Mombasa school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/xki|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
KSL has been largely influenced by ASL since the inception of formal education. Many Kenyan schools for the deaf were founded by churches such as the Presbyterian Church of East Africa and Catholic Church and were later influenced by deaf leaders such as [[Michael Ndurumo|Prof. Michael Ndurumo]], who advocated the use of sign language and the manual alphabet, as well as many interpreters and volunteers associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of many of the interpreter training programmes were influences by organizations associated with ASL-use, such as the [[Peace Corps]] in the foundation of the Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association (KSLIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KSL used to teach in schools may not be considered authentic KSL due to the substantial amount of ASL influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenyan Sign Language is the basis for [[Somali Sign Language]]. This is due to the fact that the first school for the deaf in Somalia along with its three teachers came from [[Annalena Tonelli]]’s Kenyan school for the deaf in [[Wajir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annalena Tonelli 1943 to 2003 Catholic Kenya / Somalia|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/kenya/tonelli_annalena.html|publisher=Dictionary of African Christian Biography|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though KSL is largely unrelated to other languages, but has similarities with Ugandan and Tanzanian sign languages. Nonetheless, Ugandan and Tanzanian deaf cannot often understand KSL very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/xki|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many deaf Ugandans know KSL due to the fact that they often travel to Kenya for secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lule|first=Dorothy|author2=Wallin Lars|title=Transmission of Sign Languages in Africa|journal=Sign Languages|year=2010|pages=113–130|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511712203.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Recognition===
Kenya’s official languages are English and Kiswahili,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/xki|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though KSLI is making efforts to give Kenyan Sign Language and Braille official status as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KSLIA|url=http://www.kslia.blogspot.ca/|publisher=KSLIA|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While not Kenya’s official languages, Braille and KSL are mentioned in the 2009 Constitution, Article 7, in which it is stated that the State will protect these two Kenyan languages along with Kenya’s indigenous languages.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution (2009) Art. 7 [National, official and other languages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KSL Use in Kenya===
The government of Kenya uses Kenya Signed English, which is parallel to American [[Signed Exact English]], in which the sign language does not have its own [[grammar]] and follows English grammar. Kenya Signed English is also used in all schools under the Kenya Institute of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/xki|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
KSL, on the other hand, is backed by the University of Nairobi. It is used at Nyangoma and Mumias, both of which are primary schools for the deaf in western Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/xki|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a noted negativity towards KSL on behalf of special education teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some schools are known to use other sign languages, including a Mombasa school uses British Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/xki|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more in-depth look into the use of KSL and SEE in Kenyan schools is presented in the next section.

==Kenyan Educational Structure and the Incorporation of Deaf Education==
In Kenya, deaf education makes up part of the ministry of education under the special education division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Educational Assessment and Resource Services (EARS) also plays a role in assisting deaf education opportunities. It hosts an Educational Assessment and Resource Centre (EARC) in every Kenyan district. Before a deaf child is entered into a school, he is assessed at his local EARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of Deaf Education in Kenya===

====Establishment of Deaf Schools and the Use of KSL====
Historically, many changes have been made to the policies in Kenya regarding language of instruction in deaf schools. 
Starting in the 1800s, missionaries from Europe began establishing schools for the deaf. However, these schools catered to the wealthier population and excluded poor families from the specialized education. At the time, there was a strong emphasis on the oral communication, lip reading, speech therapy, and hearing aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For quite a while, some publications and speakers have attributed and linked establishment of schools for the deaf in Kenya to Dr. Andrew Jackson Foster. Dr. Foster did not establish any schools or churches for the deaf in Kenya. Dr. Foster's work was mainly concentrated in West Africa.

In Kenya, Schools for the deaf were started by religious bodies, both Christian and Muslim.. The first school for the deaf in Kenya was Aga Khan in Mombasa started in 1958. Mumias School for the Deaf and Nyangoma School for the deaf were both established by the Catholic church in 1961, followed by Kambui School for the Deaf which was started by the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) in 1963. There then followed a number of schools established by churches, these included Tumu Tumu School for the Deaf in 1970 established by the PCEA, the Methodist Church also started Kaaga School for the Deaf, and the Anglican Church started Maseno School for the Deaf. Another school for the deaf - Kapsabet School for the Deaf was started by the African Inland Church.&lt;ref&gt;Ndurumo. Michael M. (1993) Exceptional Children: Developmental Consequences and Intervention. Longman&lt;/ref&gt; All these were pioneer schools by their respective churches long before Andrew Foster visited Kenya for the first time in the 1980s while on transit to Nigeria. Moreover, schools for the deaf in Kenya started using sign language when it was introduced to schools by Prof Michael Ndurumo in the early 1980s.

Other important facts to note are that the Kenya Society for Deaf Children (KSDC) was registered in 1958. Indeed, Prof Michael Ndurumo who later became instrumental in deaf education in Kenya was one of KSDC's first students at Dagoreti Children's Centre in 1961 to 1963.  Other pioneer deaf students in Kenya include Santina Mwarania, Rosemary Aloo(KALRO), Scholastica Majuma, Solomon Kayia, Florence Baseke (from Uganda), and Elkana Kimutai who were among the first batch of students at Mumias School for the Deaf; and Mr. Patrick Hagoi, Rev Daniel Njihia, and Rev Joseph Ondiek who were among the first students at Nyangoma School for the Deaf. Most of there pioneer students would later become very influential leaders of the deaf in many spheres of life in Kenya.

[[Simultaneous communication]], or sign supported speech, started to be used in 1986 and is still present. Simultaneous communication (SimCom) involves using both oral and manual coded languages- in this case English and Signed Exact English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in theory this method is effective, in practice it can become very confusing. Nonetheless, it is claimed that this communication mode has resulted in academic progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first instances of deaf education that used sign language as opposed to the oral method of the missionary schools starts with the inception of the Kenya Society for Deaf Children (KSDC) in 1958, which went on to build the first two schools made specifically for the deaf- [[Nyangoma]] and [[Mumias]]. Both primary schools were built in west Kenya by 1961. Secondary schools were built as the number of students attending has drastically increased. According to KSDC’s statistics, 1,710 students attended schools for the deaf in 1982, and by 2001 there were 6,000 students. There were reported 23 deaf schools were built from 1960-1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, even accounting for the impressive movement, it is estimated that around 30% of all deaf children in Kenya still do not go to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Ndurumo|Prof. Michael Ndurumo]] is a deaf Kenyan educated in the United States who advocated the use of SEE in 1985 while working for the [[Kenya Institute of Education]] (KIE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a supporter of the use of sign language in classrooms. This led to the Ministry of Education’s formation of [[Machakos School for the Deaf]] where Ndurumo incorporated the ASL manual alphabet and the total communication method. [[Total communication]] is a mixture of oralism and manualism, and incorporates the use of the individual’s specific vocabulary, sign language, [[fingerspelling]], speech and lip reading, [[manually coded language]] and other forms of communication to teach at an individual level for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1988 study conducted by the Ministry of Education showed that using total communication as a teaching method enabled faster learning and was more effective for cognitive growth when incorporated at earlier ages than later ages. After this study, the Kenyan government promoted the use of sign language and, more specifically, SEE alongside total communication in deaf schools and classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Structure of Deaf Education in Kenya===

====Language Instruction Policy====
As one of Kenya’s two official languages, high importance is placed on English in the Kenyan school system. 
Since the [[Gachathi Report]] took effect in 1976 and reformed Kenya’s school system, all Kenyan schools teach Kenyan school children to read and write English from pre-school until Standard 3. Starting in Standard 4, students are taught solely in English, with the exception of Kiswahili classes or other language classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W. Kang'ethe-Kamau|title=The concept of inclusive education: teacher training and acquisitiong of English language in the hearing impaired|journal=British Journal of Special Education|year=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00324.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
All national examinations in Kenya are written and conducted in English. These examinations are instrumental to students’ futures, as they determine what class level the student will be placed in, acceptance into college programmes, and even obtaining jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W.

Kenyan universities do not provide interpreters for their deaf students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the heavy emphasis placed on English skills, efforts to maximise deaf students’ exposure to English have ensued in the hopes that it will better prepare them for their examinations and subsequently ensure better futures and job opportunities. This centrality of English in Kenya is one major motive behind the implementation of inclusive education in Kenyan schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W. Kang'ethe-Kamau|title=The concept of inclusive education: teacher training and acquisitiong of English language in the hearing impaired|journal=British Journal of Special Education|year=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00324.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====English Language in the Kenyan School System and its Effects on the Use of KSL====
Schoolchildren must become proficient in English because of the emphasis on it in Kenyan education and examinations, meaning thorough knowledge of English grammar is essential. Since Kenyan Sign Language holds its own grammar, deaf students taught in KSL are considered to be at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W. Kang'ethe-Kamau|title=The concept of inclusive education: teacher training and acquisitiong of English language in the hearing impaired|journal=British Journal of Special Education|year=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00324.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bornstein|first=H|title=Manual communication: Implications for education|year=1990|publisher=Gallaudet University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an attempt to incorporate more exposure to English into deaf education, aid these students to become proficient in English grammar, and make learning to read and write in English more feasible, suggestions have been made to enforce the use of Signed Exact English. 
[[Signed Exact English]] (SEE) uses the sentence structure of English with the visual signs of sign language. It is a [[manually coded language]], also called a signed oral language, and thus is not a “[[natural language]]” due to the fact that it did not evolve naturally within a human population and instead was assembled by merging aspects of oral and sign languages. Signed Exact English is not considered its own language since it does not have a distinct grammatical structure; it is instead considered a manual sign system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W. Kang'ethe-Kamau|title=The concept of inclusive education: teacher training and acquisitiong of English language in the hearing impaired|journal=British Journal of Special Education|year=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00324.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bornstein|first=H|title=Manual communication: Implications for education|year=1990|publisher=Gallaudet University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SEE, however, does not take into account many subtle aspects of sign language, such as changes in facial expressions that affect meaning. Use of SEE can also stunt the development and use of KSL. Studies of SimComm and sign bilingualism show that the use of both oral communication and manually coded communication improves comprehension and understanding but can stunt the teacher’s linguistic complexity, making their language use simpler. When asked, many students preferred learning through KSL instead of SEE (or ASL) and stated that using both sign language and speech together was confusing. However, teachers are not as proficient in KSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiswahili is a compulsory subject in Kenyan schools, yet due to low results from deaf students there has been thought to replace it with teaching KSL, with the [[Kenya Society for Deaf Children]] (KSDC) on the forefront of the proposal. In fact, KSL is now an option for deaf students in some schools, though there is a lack of textbooks to facilitate the teaching of KSL as a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Various Strategies in Deaf Education===
{{Main|Deaf Education }}
Historically, many students, especially those with special needs such as the deaf, have been excluded from schools, particularly in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15183284|title=Disabled children excluded from education|last=Hicks|first=Bill|date=18 November 2011|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are now multiple approaches to deaf education that are present in Kenya as well as the rest of the world. There is considerable controversy surrounding which may be considered the best course of action, as they all have positive and negative aspects. Some of these strategies are: 
*''Inclusion'', in which deaf (and other special needs students) learn alongside hearing students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W. Kang'ethe-Kamau|title=The concept of inclusive education: teacher training and acquisitiong of English language in the hearing impaired|journal=British Journal of Special Education|year=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00324.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure of the class and the mode of teaching change to accommodate the special needs students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''Integration'', in which deaf students learn alongside hearing students. While similar to inclusion, special education kids are taught to adapt to the class rather than changing the structure of the class as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*''Mainstreaming'', in which deaf students learn with hearing students for part of the day, depending on their academic level, but part of the day is spent in special education classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for individualized attention along with social interaction with mainstream students. 
*''Segregation'', in which special needs students are taught separately from other students, or in entirely separate [[special schools]].

====Integration and Inclusive Education in Kenya====

=====Integration in Kenyan Schools=====
The instigation of integration into the Kenyan education system can be traced back to Britain due to the fact that most Kenyan developers of special education were trained in Britain, where integration was endorsed in 1981. Upon their return, policies were set into motion regarding the assimilation of deaf and other special education students into mainstream schools- though these students were still given particular attention. Because of the emphasis on normalization, deaf students were taught speech development, often compromising their exposure to other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the years that integration had been incorporated in the educational system, the rate of academic improvement has yet to reach expectations. There is a general negativity and disregard to the policy structures along with a lack of enforcement. Thus, the current suggestion to better deaf education is to embrace inclusive education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Rise of Inclusive Education=====
{{Main|Inclusion (education) }}
Though the concept of inclusive education is not very new, its implementation by Kenyan educators is. Strategies toward inclusion started when the [[University of Cambridge]] Faculty of Education, [[Kenyatta University]], and the Kenyan Ministry of Education Science and Technology’s special education section initiated a link programme in 2001 dedicated to educational inclusion. This initiated a widespread effort to promote inclusion in the country’s deaf schools in hopes that it would better prepare deaf students for the English-based Kenyan educational and examination systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W. Kang'ethe-Kamau|title=The concept of inclusive education: teacher training and acquisitiong of English language in the hearing impaired|journal=British Journal of Special Education|year=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00324.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Presently, the Kenyan government is incorporating inclusion into the policy of its educational system. Projections show that there will be a minimum of one special needs teacher in every institution by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Kingdom]]’s Cheshire International is supporting western Kenya’s Oriang Inclusive Project- the only inclusive programme for public schools. The Project currently manages five regular schools. Assessments of academic improvement on behalf of the Project are yet to ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Controversies Surrounding Inclusive Education======
Inclusion is one of the many methods to approaching the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students throughout the world and is considered by many the best approach. However, due to the linguistic barrier, the inclusion of students with hearing impairments into mainstream schools can have a significant negative effect on academic achievement if proper support and special attention is not sufficiently provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W. Kang'ethe-Kamau|title=The concept of inclusive education: teacher training and acquisitiong of English language in the hearing impaired|journal=British Journal of Special Education|year=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00324.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
It should be noted that the approach of inclusive education rejects the use of special schools or the separation of special needs students from the main student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wamae|first=Gertrude M. I.|author2=Rachel W. Kang'ethe-Kamau|title=The concept of inclusive education: teacher training and acquisitiong of English language in the hearing impaired|journal=British Journal of Special Education|year=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00324.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 1, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Since special schools are designed specifically to target the needs of a specific group of students, denying the separation of these students can sacrifice the quality of the education that’s needed to support certain students and keep them on track with the educational system. Additionally, merging these students with their mainstream counterparts can put them at considerable disadvantage when it comes to the competing for these facilities as well as the attention and guidance of their instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moses |first=Ingubu |author2=Kyalo |title=Widening Education Access: Its Implications and Challenges on School Facility Exploitation |journal=International Journal of Curriculum and Instruction |date=April 2011 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=63–76 |url=http://www.muk.ac.ke/ijci/ |accessdate=October 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601082706/http://www.muk.ac.ke/ijci/ |archivedate=June 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imposing inclusive education in developing countries such as Kenya ignores how issues such as insufficient funding, inadequate teacher training, large numbers of students in classrooms, and inflexible school systems may affect the effectiveness of these students’ education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that parents of deaf students prefer to send their children to special schools under the assumption that they will receive better, specialized education, interact with other hearing-impaired students, and use a common language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimani|first=Cecilia W.|title=Teaching deaf learners in Kenyan classrooms|journal=Diss. University of Sussex|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of Educators====
Deaf education teachers all hold either a (1) Diploma in Special Needs Education received from the Kenya Institute of Special Education (KISE) or (2) Degree in Special Needs Education received from Kenyatta or [[Maseno University]]. Because of the shortage in qualified teachers, some do not hold either of these qualifications. These teachers are trained in general education but generally have no received special education training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adoyo|first=Peter Oracha|title=Educating deaf Children in an Inclusive Setting in Kenya: Challenges and Considerations|journal=Electronic Journal for Inclusive Education|year=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–13|url=http://www.cehs.wright.edu/resources/publications/ejie/Winter_Spring_08/Inclusive_education_2_D.htm|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kenyan Sign Language Organizations==
Both the KSLIA and the KNAD are dedicated to protecting Deaf rights and education in Kenya.

===Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KSLIA|url=http://www.kslia.blogspot.ca/|publisher=KSLIA|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
The Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association (KSLIA) is an organisation that supports the creation and advancement of interpreter training and certification programmes. The KSLIA Official Blog &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KSLIA|url=http://www.kslia.blogspot.ca/|publisher=KSLIA|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; envisions a “three-pronged approach” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KSLIA|url=http://www.kslia.blogspot.ca/|publisher=KSLIA|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes the three C’s: 
#Certification of members 
#Continuing education for the practicing interpreters 
#Conflict resolution through enforcement of the Code of Ethics

====Formation of the KSLIA====
The Peace Corps programme had a strong need for trained interpreters for the pre-service training programme. The interpreters were needed to allow Deaf volunteers communication with the instructors. When it was evident that trained interpreters in Kenya were scarce, the Peace Corps supported a couple interpreters from the United States to work with local interpreters to be able to provide better future interpreter services to Deaf volunteers. 
There was a strong group of Deaf volunteers in 1999 who actively supported the allocation of funds to strengthen support for local interpreters. A one-week-long workshop was funded as a result of these volunteers’ lobbying. 15 interpreters attended the workshop which was held in September 2000. 
Kenyan interpreters were encouraged to start an association during this week-long workshop. The association was to be responsible for: 
#Becoming a way for interpreters to socially interact 
#Enforcing a mutually agreed-upon code of ethics and correcting interpreters 
#Acting as a medium for progress through peer education 
For the following couple of months, assemblies were held to form a constitution and code of ethics, and a list of trained interpreters throughout the country was created. 
This one-week programme is accredited with instigating what the “Kenyan Interpreter community” came to know as the Navisha Declaration. 
The Kenyan Sign Language Association adopted the Navisha Declaration’s objectives as its own once it became officially registered under the Societies Act in December 2000.

====Navisha Declaration====
The KSLI blog states the Navisha Declaration to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KSLIA|url=http://www.kslia.blogspot.ca/|publisher=KSLIA|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
: We the Kenyan Interpreters practicing in various fields agree to: 
:: a) To secure official recognition by the Government of Interpreters profession
::b) Encourage and promote initiatives in improving the standards of SL interpreting and interpreter training and pay scale of interpreters depending with their level and skills of interpretation through certification.
::c) Cooperation with other recognized bodies concerned in the welfare of the deaf and in provision of Interpreters throughout the world.

::d) Awareness creation on Deafness and SL. Interpreters through publication of information materials

::e) To collect and raise funds for the achievement of goals and objectives through membership fee, subscription, contribution, gifts or donations, commissions and payments, fund raising whether in money or otherwise from both members and non-members.

::f) To maintain and administer a register of S.L Interpreters in Kenya.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KSLIA|url=http://www.kslia.blogspot.ca/|publisher=KSLIA|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenyan National Association of the Deaf (KNAD)===
The Kenyan National Association of the Deaf is a Kenyan national [[non-governmental organisation]] that was founded and is run by Deaf Kenyans. KNAD was formed in 1987 through the Societies Act. KNAD cooperates with international NGOs and the Kenyan government regarding issues about deaf Kenyans. KNAD promotes [[human rights]] for the deaf and strives to offer research and training in sign language and sign language interpreting. It is also a member of the [[World Federation of the Deaf]].

==Important Figures in Kenyan Deaf Education==

===Annalena Tonelli===
[[Annalena Tonelli]] was a [[Roman Catholic]] volunteer who worked in eastern Africa for a significant portion of her life. Tonelli is known for building special schools of many sorts. She built a school for the deaf in 1980 in [[Wajir]], a Somali-Kenyan town in the northeastern part of Kenya. The school was known for using KSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annalena Tonelli 1943 to 2003 Catholic Kenya / Somalia|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/kenya/tonelli_annalena.html|publisher=Dictionary of African Christian Biography|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tonelli was awarded the [[Nansen Refugee Award]] in 2003 and died shortly after by assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&amp;docid=3e9c172d7&amp;query=annalena%20tonelli |title=Italian woman wins Nansen Refugee Award for work in Somalia |publisher=UNHCR |date=2003-04-15 |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Tonelli’s honour, three graduates from Wajir built the Annalena School for the Deaf in Borama, Somali. It was the first school for the deaf ever to be built in Somalia. It was in this school that [[Somali Sign Language]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Woodford |first=Doreen E. |title=The beginning and growth of a new language: Somali Sign Language |year=2006 |url=http://www.eenet.org.uk/resources/docs/somali_sign_language.php |publisher=Enabling Education Network |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatrice Anunda and the Demolition of the Humble Hearts School===
{{Main|Humble Hearts School}}
Beatrice Anunda established the [[Humble Hearts School]] in Kenya in September 2003. It used both KSL and English, making it the first [[bilingual]] deaf school in Kenya. 
Anunda learned KSL from the KSL Research Project of the [[University of Nairobi]]. 
Recently, the Kenyan Piping Company bulldozed the school, though the government claimed it was an accident due to construction of a pipe that was going through the city. No compensation was paid, but temporary classrooms were made until the Humble Hearts School was rebuilt through the help of philanthropists and volunteers, including an NGO called Angel Covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anunda |first=Beatrice |date=September 2011 |title= Humble Hearts: The Story of a Bilingual Kenyan School for the Deaf Demolished and Rebuilt|journal=Discovering Deaf Worlds |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tragic News from Humble Hearts |url=https://www.causes.com/causes/16135/updates/288191 |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112031251/https://www.causes.com/causes/16135/updates/288191 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialogue Education''' is a [[popular education]] approach to [[adult education]] first described by educator [http://www.globalearning.com/janevellaprofile.htm Jane Vella] in the 1980s. This approach to [[education]] draws on various adult learning theories, including those of [[Paulo Freire]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Malcolm Knowles]] and [[Benjamin Bloom]] (Global Learning Partners, 2006b; Vella, 2004). It is a synthesis of these theories into principles and practices that can be applied in a concrete way to learning design and facilitation. Dialogue Education is a form of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivism]] and can be a means for [[Transformative learning]], (Vella, 2004).

Dialogue Education shifts the focus of education from what the teacher says to what the learner does, from learner passivity to learners as active participants in the dialogue that leads to learning (Global Learning Partners, 2006c). A [[dialogue]] approach to education views learners as subjects in their own learning and honours central principles such as mutual respect and open communication (Vella, 2002). Learners are invited to actively engage with the content being learned rather than being dependent on the educator for learning. Ideas are presented to learners as open questions to be reflected on and integrated into the learner's own context (Vella, 2004). The intent is that this will result in more meaningful learning that affects behaviour.

==History==
In the Dialogue Education approach, the idea of [[dialogue]] is used in contrast to the [[monologue]] approach often seen in traditional [[adult education]], whereby teachers present information to learners who receive information without engaging with it. This was labelled the "banking" approach to education by [[Paulo Freire]] in his 1970 work [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]. According to Freire, the traditional monologue approach to adult education views learners as empty vessels ready for teachers to deposit information into (Vella, 2004). [[Paulo Freire|Freire]] and others recognized a need for [[reform]] in adult education practices, particularly with respect to equity in the relationship between adult learners and teachers (Vella, 2004).

Influenced by these theorists, Vella began to develop a structured set of principles and practices to translate the theory into action and results. She began using Dialogue Education practices in her teaching in the 1970s and these were further developed into a systematic approach while completing her [[Doctorate|doctoral dissertation]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. At this point, she named her approach [[popular education]] after [[Paulo Freire|Freire's]] model (Global Learning Partners, 2006a,b; Vella, 2004).

The Dialogue Education approach became even more advanced as Vella created her own training company Jubilee Popular Education Centre, now called [http://www.globalearning.com/ Global Learning Partners], in 1981. Through this organization, more than 3,500 learners from 60 countries have completed workshops about the dialogue approach to learning design and facilitation. The approach has also been used for conducting learning assessments, learning evaluations and designing and facilitating meetings ([http://www.globalearning.com/ Global Learning Partners, 2006d]).

The concepts of Dialogue Education are continually evolving as Vella, her partners and the learners of this approach gain greater understanding of how best to put adult learning theory into action for effective results.

==Structures of Dialogue Education==
The principles and practices of Dialogue Education represent a concrete way to integrate adult learning theory into the design and implementation of learning events (Global Learning Partners 2006c). While more than fifty of these have been noted (Vella 1995, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004; Global Learning Partners, 2006c), the primary structure was laid out in her most recent publication and is laid out and slightly expanded upon below (Vella, 2007).

===Key Principles===

*'''Dialogue''' - This primary principle of Dialogue Education positions dialogue as the means to the end result of learning, rather than as an end in itself. The principle assumes that any adult has enough life experience to converse with any teacher on any subject '''''and''''' that learners learn best when content relates to their experience. Thus, two way, open dialogue needs to be a part of all learning activities.
*'''Learners as Subjects or Decision makers''' - Learners must be seen as subjects acting upon content instead of objects to be acted upon or to receive content. This principle may be demonstrated by following the guideline:
:''"Don't ever do what the learner can do; don't ever decide what the learner can decide."'' (Vella, 2002:16).

*'''Achievement-Based Objectives''' - Objectives that are achievement-based, describe what learners will do with the content (''What'') in an observable way. The objectives are described using action verbs based on [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives|Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives]].
*'''Learning Tasks''' - Learning tasks are structured as open questions (i.e. questions with no set, "right" answer) asked of learners, inviting them to interact with the content in some way and leading to open dialogue between learner and teacher and amongst learners. These tasks determine how learners will achieve the objectives (''What for'') that help them to learn the necessary content (''What'') in order to arrive at the outlined purpose (''Why'').

To discover the present knowledge and skills of the learners and help develop further goals.

2. ''The Seven Steps of Design'' - In designing learning activities, educators seek to answer in as much detail as possible the questions:

##'''''Who''''' - are the learners, the educators, other participants?
##'''''Why''''' - the situation that calls for the learning, especially in terms of why the learners want to be there.
##'''''When''''' - will the learning take place (timing &amp; total length of time available)?
##'''''Where''''' - will learning take place (location, set up, etc.)?
##'''''What''''' - specific Content (Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes) will be covered to address the ''Why''?
##'''''What for''''' - Describes the Achievement-Based Objectives (ABOs) for each element of Content
##'''''How''''' - the Process (learning tasks) through which learners interact with the ''What'' to meet each ABO (''What For'').
:By answering these questions in detail and ensuring congruence throughout, a strong, accountable design can be prepared.

3. ''Learning Tasks (How?)'' - work by using active verbs to engage the learner and work at proficiency in knowledge, skills, and attitudes (both individuals and groups).  This leads to the development of the four '''I's'''.

*'''Four I's''' - One particularly helpful sequence for a learning task involves four parts:  '''''Inductive''''' work that allows the learner to reflect on their past experience, '''''Input''''' which provides some new information for the learner to consider, '''''Implementation''''' which invites the learner to apply this new information and finally, '''''Integration''''' to bring the new understanding back into the context of the learner.

4. ''The principles and practices'' at every level:

*'''Learning needs and resources assessment''' - Learners need to participate in the planning of what will be learned. Conducting an LNRA, allows the educator to begin to model  the dialogue with learners that will continue during the educational event. Additionally the design may be enhanced because it is informed by the themes of learners and an understanding of what is meaningful to them.
*'''Safety''' - Learners must feel safe in order to engage with other learners, teachers and the content. The atmosphere and design for learning must create a safe environment for learners. Challenge is still necessary for learning to take place, but with the promise of support, [[reinforcement]] and being provided with all of the tools (skills, knowledge and abilities) necessary to do the task, learners can feel prepared to undertake this challenge.
*'''Sound Relationships''' - This involves respect and interest in the views of all involved in the learning process and is established on an individual basis.  It is based on the soundness of the person who is in the position of teacher.
*'''Sequence and Reinforcement''' - Sequencing activities help to ensure learner safety and success in task completion by building from small to large, simple to complex, single to many and familiar to unfamiliar. When learners repeatedly interact with the content in diverse and engaging ways, learning is reinforced.
*'''Praxis''' - Learners must have opportunities to act upon content and then reflect on their actions in order to draw conclusions and then to have further opportunities to act again. This can be achieved through the use of [[Philosophical analysis|analysis]] and [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]]. Analysis - taking apart information or a situation and Synthesis - putting it back together are both necessary for learning to occur.
*'''Respect''' - Seen through the effort that is put into the learning endeavor by all participants.  The teacher in the preparation and structuring of the learning process and the learners in the engagement and effort exhibited back.
*'''Ideas, Feelings, Actions''' - In order for significant learning to occur, ideas (cognition), feelings (affection) and actions (psychomotor) all need to be involved in learning activities.
*'''Relevance and Immediacy''' - Content needs to be immediately applicable, useful and meaningful (relevant) to the context of the learner in order for learning to occur.
*'''Clear Roles''' - Learners must see the equality between teacher and learners and among learners. This can be supported by teachers through the demonstration of listening intently, showing interest in the learners and expressing humility.
*'''Teamwork and Small groups''' - The use of small group work is a central practice in Dialogue education because it creates a safe environment for learners to find their voice, reflects life situations of teamwork and allows for peer mentoring which can enhance learning.
*'''Engagement''' - Learners are engaged with making theory on any subject and educators must use cognitive, affective and psychomotor activities to engage learners in this process. When learners are engaged they are committed to the learning process.
*'''Accountability''' - Accountability is one of the most important principles in adult learning. Teachers must be accountable to learners through their learning design and facilitation and learners must be accountable to the teacher, each other and themselves through their actions.

5.''Evaluation Indicators''

* '''Learning''' - Is "the end of it all.  Learning is what occurs during the event, and achievement-based objectives are designed to ensure this" (Vella, 2007, 217).
* '''Transfer''' - Is use of the newly learned material "in a new context, after the learning event.  Indicators of transfer are behavioral evidence that cognitive, affective, or psychomotor (kinesthetic) learning has taken place" (219).
* '''Impact''' - Is "the difference or change that occurs in a person or an organization as a function of a learning event or a series of learning events" (216).

(This framework of the structure came out of Vella, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;2)

While none of these ideas are new to adult learning theory, the unique contribution of Dialogue Education is the highly structured system which has been devised to implement known adult learning theory in a concrete way (Global Learning Partners, 2006c). Adult learning theory is widely understood, however, it is used with much less frequency in practice. The Dialogue Education approach, because it offers well constructed, specific principles and practices, demands congruence between theory, design and implementation. Such congruence leads to improved learning and resulting behaviour change (Vella, 2004).

In [[academic publishing]], an '''embargo''' is a period during which access to academic journals is not allowed to users who have not paid for access (or have access through their institution). The purpose of this is to ensure publishers have revenue to support their activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Open Access: Springer tightens rules on self-archiving [Interview with Springer's Eric Merkel-Sobota] |url=http://poynder.blogspot.com/2013_06_01_archive.html |website=poynder.blogspot.com |accessdate=2015-12-10}}{{self-published inline|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Publication embargo  « SPARC Europe |url=http://sparceurope.org/embargoes/ |website=sparceurope.org |accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the impact of embargoes on publishers is hotly debated, with some studies finding no impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The evidence fails to justify publishers' demand for longer embargo periods on publicly-funded research. |url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/01/14/suber-embargoes-on-publicly-funded-research/ |website=Impact of Social Sciences |accessdate=2015-10-19 |date=2014-01-14T11:30:22+00:00 |publisher=2014&amp;#124;Academic publishing |last2=Comments |first2=Open Access&amp;#124;2 }}{{self-published inline|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while publisher experience suggests otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Free Affordable |journal=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/14.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7409.241 |title=Paying for bmj.com |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7409 |pages=241–242 |year=2003 |last1=Delamothe |first1=T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 survey of libraries by the Association of Learned, Professional, and Society Publishers on the likelihood of journal cancellations in cases where most of the content was made freely accessible after six months suggests there would be a major negative impact on subscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ALPSP Survey on Journal Cancelations |url=http://www.publishingresearch.net/documents/ALPSPPApo,tentialresultsofsixmonthembargofv.pdf |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this result has been debated.

Various types exist: 
* A 'moving wall' is a fixed period of months or years.
* A fixed date is a particular time point that does not change.
* A current year (or other period) is setting a time point on Jan. 1 of the current year, so that all material earlier than that is available. Although fixed during the year, it will change each year.

== Purpose ==
There are various purposes:
* For [[delayed open access journal]]s, the embargo separates the most recent period, for which a subscription is needed, from an older period, where a subscription is not needed and anyone may access the article. This can range from a few months to several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22856 |title=Delayed open access: An overlooked high-impact category of openly available scientific literature |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=1323–1329 |year=2013 |last1=Laakso |first1=Mikael |last2=Björk |first2=Bo-Christer }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* For [[self-archiving]], the embargo is a period of time set by the publisher in the [[copyright transfer agreement]] where access to the archived version of the article in a digital [[Repository (publishing)|repository]] is restricted until the embargo period expires. Typical embargo periods range from 6 to 24 months, though some publishers may require an embargo of up to 48 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SHERPA/RoMEO – Publisher copyright policies &amp; self-archiving|url = http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php?la=en&amp;fIDnum=%7C&amp;mode=simple|website = www.sherpa.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In full-text databases, such as those of [[EBSCO Publishing]] or [[ProQuest]], it separates the most recent period, where only a title or abstract is available, from an older one, which is openly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Support: What are Publication Embargoes?|url = http://support.ebscohost.com/knowledge_base/detail.php?id=866|website = support.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19|date = 2016-06-13T19:07:45Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moving wall ==
In academic publishing, a moving wall is the time period between the last issue of an [[academic journal]] available in a given [[online]] [[Bibliographic database|database]] and the most recently published print issue of a journal. It is specified by publishers in their [[license agreement]]s with databases (like [[JSTOR]]), and generally ranges from several months to several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What is a moving wall?|url = http://about.jstor.org/librarians-faq-archival-journals#What_is_a_moving_wall|work = JSTOR|accessdate = 19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Facila''' is a training program, in Southern Europe, for adults with short primary schooling. The objective is to prepare students for validation processes and secondary education. Many participants are [[entrepreneurs]], owners or employees of small and medium enterprises, [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]:s. In these cases the program provides opportunity for training in [[entrepreneurship]] and "[[continuous improvement]]" to enhance the participant's [[employability]].

The program started in 2007 as a cooperation between [[Sweden]] and [[Portugal]]. It is based on the Swedish program "Kunskapslyftet" and adapted to Southern European conditions on an initiative by Johan Frisk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evta.net/evta_tube/facila.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723122815/http://www.evta.net/evta_tube/facila.html |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }} Presentation, European Vocational Training Federation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/utbildning-ska-radda-portugal-1.1221990 Dagens Nyheter (Swedish Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3304&amp;artikel=3497424 Sveriges Radio (Swedish public radio)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww1.rtp.pt/multimedia/progVideo.php?tvprog=24786&amp;idpod=37314 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130202412/http://ww1.rtp.pt/multimedia/progVideo.php?tvprog=24786 |archivedate=2010-11-30 |df= }} "Iniciativa", min 37:30-41:30 RTP2 (Portuguese public television)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/en/enterprise-jobs/can-entrepreneurship-be-taught-news-494547 Interview "EuroActiv"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coaching World June 2010 p12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1599197 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809030549/http://tsf.sapo.pt/paginainicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1599197 |archivedate=2010-08-09 |df= }} "Qualificar a população adulta activa" TSF (Portuguese radio)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theopenmanager.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207234933/http://www.theopenmanager.com/ |date=2011-02-07 }} Blog "The Open Manager"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous improvement projects==
Apart from basic training, the main objective of the [http://www.facila.eu/english/ Facila] program is to teach students how to prepare  improvement projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810050714/http://tsf.sapo.pt/paginainicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }} radio program in Portuguese, "Mãos à Obra" (TSF) interview with the training coordinator&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projectos de melhoria contínua==
O ponto fulcral do processo formativo são os projectos de melhoria.&lt;ref&gt;https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 programa rádio, "Mãos à Obra" (TSF) entrevista com a coordenadora da formação&lt;/ref&gt; Cada formando é convidado an analisar o seu posto de trabalho,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iefp.pt/iefp/publicacoes/Formar/Paginas/Formar2008.aspx Formar-revista para formadores nº65, p11-14 (IEFP)&lt;/ref&gt; aplicar componentes da Matemática para a Vida, procurar padrões e traduzi-los para a linguagem matemática. O procedimento permite aumento de produtividade e assim o aumento da [[empregabilidade]] do formando. Se a mesma metodologia é aplicada por donos de pequenas empresas, o resultado do processo leva an aumentos do [[empreendedorismo]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Método formativo==
A metodologia contempla duas vertentes fundamentais, individual e social. O processo de orientar adultos, a [[Andragogia|andragogia]], serve de base para depois construir sobre os conhecimentos existentes de cada participante. O processo social constitui a pedra angular na [[Capacitação|capacitação]] de formandos adultos, a convicção de ser capaz, o [[Teoria da atribuição#Locus de causalidade|"locus interno"]], an inter-ajuda inspirada na pesquisa do Professor [[Sugata Mitra]], são todos componentes do importante "coaching de grupos" que caracteriza o programa Facila.

==Financiamento==
Este projecto é apoiado pelo [http://www.poph.qren.pt/ Programa Operacional de Potencial Humano (POPH)] na medida 2.3, formações modulares certificadas. Como em muitos programas comunitários, o POPH é financiado com verbas oriundas do [[Fundo Social Europeu]] (75%) e o Orçamento do Estado Português (25%).

==Quadro Nacional de Qualificações==
Como consequência da [[Estratégia de Lisboa]] há uma nova visão sobre conhecimento, uma visão mais preocupada com as evidências do que propriamente com o percurso da sua obtenção. Em Portugal, o [http://www.catalogo.anq.gov.pt/Home/QNQ Quadro Nacional de Qualificações] pretende regularizar e valorizar os conhecimentos obtidos por vias não formais e informais.

O programa Facila, com a sua função na preparação de formandos para o processo de [[Rvcc|reconhecimento e validação]] da iniciativa [[Novas Oportunidades]], pretende contribuir para a qualificação de adultos europeus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2532">Some [[prison]]s have sought to limit inmates' abilities to communicate in [[foreign language]]s, such as send or receive correspondence in these languages, or receive printed publications in these languages. This is often justified on the grounds that it might enable inmates to plan escapes or other crimes, or may contain material encouraging disorder in the prison, but that prison officials would not recognise them due to their inability to understand what was written or said.

Inmates and [[human rights]] activists have argued that this policy is discriminatory against minority groups who speak a different language, especially when they do not have good command of the mainstream language, and hence have difficulty communicating in it, when they wish to correspond with family members who do not speak the mainstream or [[national language]] (especially with foreign national prisoners), and where their language is an important part of their cultural or religious identity. (For example, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is an important part of the religious identity of many [[Muslim]]s, and [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] is an important part of the religious identity of [[Jew]]s.)

==Foreign languages in prisons in the United States==

The US [[Court of Appeals]], Seventh Circuit, ruled in Kikumura v. Turner 28 F.3d 592 C.A.7(Ill).1994.  (see [http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=199462028F3d592_1526.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006]), that a blanket refusal to permit inmates to communicate or receive publications in a language other than English is unconstitutional. However, their ruling implies that the prison may still refuse to do so, if they have made a good faith effort to translate the materials or have they reviewed by a prison official who speaks the language, and found that such translation or review is not possible or too costly. But such an investigation of possibilities of review or translation must be made on a case-by-case basis, rather than a blanket prohibition without conducting such an analysis.

'''Fred D'Aguiar''' (born 2 February 1960) is a [[Guyanese in the United Kingdom|British-Guyanese]] poet, novelist and playwright. He is currently Professor of English at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].

== Life ==

Fred D'Aguiar was born in [[London]] in 1960 to Guyanese parents, Malcolm Frederick D'Aguiar and Kathleen Agatha Messiah.&lt;ref name="British Writers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stade|first=George|title=Encyclopaedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present (Vol. II)|year=2003|publisher=[[Facts on File]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|pages=127–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=fred+d'aguiar+mama+dot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nfCm79ZCRT&amp;sig=QI9nXSr3QeD4J30EATi4VP7phFU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rknTT_zQKou88AO8vumWAw&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=fred%20d'aguiar%20mama%20dot&amp;f=false|author2=Karen Karbiener}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 he was taken to [[Guyana]] where he lived with his grandmother until 1972 when he returned, at the age of twelve, to England.&lt;ref name= "British Writers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyppolite Interview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyppolite|first=Joanne|title=Interview with Fred D'Aguiar|journal=Anthurium|year=2004|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/anthurium/vol2/iss1/6/|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birbalsingh Interview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birbalsingh|first=Frank|title=An Interview with Fred D'Aguiar|journal=ARIEL|year=1993|volume=24|issue=1|pages=133–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fred D'Aguiar|url=http://literature.britishcouncil.org/fred-daguiar|work=British Council Writers Profiles|publisher=[[British Council]]|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Aguiar trained as a [[psychiatric nurse]] before reading African and Caribbean Studies at the [[University of Kent]], [[Canterbury]], graduating in 1985.&lt;ref name="British Council"/&gt; On graduating he applied for a [[PhD]] on the Guyanese author [[Wilson Harris]] at the [[University of Warwick]], but - after winning two writers-in-residency positions, at [[Birmingham University]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] (where he was the Judith E. Wilson Fellow from 1989 to 1990) - his PhD studies "recededed from [his] mind" and he began to focus all of his energies on creative writing.&lt;ref name="Hyppolite Interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Birbalsingh Interview" /&gt;

In 1994, D'Aguiar moved to the United States to take up a Visiting Writer position at [[Amherst College]], [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] (1992–94).&lt;ref name="Hyppolite Interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Council" /&gt; Since then, he has taught at [[Bates College]], [[Lewiston, Maine]] (Assistant Professor, 1994–95) and the [[University of Miami]] where he held the position of Professor of English and [[Creative Writing]].&lt;ref name="Hyppolite Interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Council" /&gt; In 2003 he took up the position of Professor of English and Co-Director of the [[Master of Fine Arts]] in [[Creative Writing]] at [[Virginia Tech]]. In Fall 2015, he became a Professor of English and Director of Creative Writing at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dailybruin.com/2015/04/22/english-department-hires-two-new-creative-writing-professors/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry, novels and plays ==

=== Poetry ===

D'Aguiar's first collection of poetry, ''Mama Dot'' (1985), was published to much acclaim.&lt;ref name="British Writers"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "British Council" /&gt; It centres on an "[[archetype|archetypal]]" grandmother figure, Mama Dot, and was notable for its fusion of standard English and [[Nation language]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Sean|title=A Necessary Gospel|journal=[[London Review of Books]]|year=1996|volume=11|issue=6|pages=24–5|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v18/n11/sean-obrien/a-necessary-gospel|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his 1989 collection ''Airy Hall'' (named after the village in Guyana where D'Aguiar spent his childhood), ''Mama Dot'' won the [[Literature of Guyana|Guyana Poetry Prize]]. Where D'Aguiar's first two poetry collections were set in Guyana, his third - ''British Subjects'' (1989) - explores the experiences of peoples of the West Indian diaspora in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salkey|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Salkey|title=British Subjects by Fred D'Aguiar|journal=[[World Literature Today]]|year=1994|volume=68|issue=4|pages=864–5|doi=10.2307/40150782}}&lt;/ref&gt; London was also the focus of another long poem, ''Sweet Thames'', which was broadcast as part of the [[BBC]] "Worlds on Film" series on 3 July 1992 and won the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] Race in the Media Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barfield|first=Stephen|title='Post-Face': Reflections on the Literary Thames|journal=The Literary London Journal|date=March 2007|volume=5|issue=1|url=http://www.literarylondon.org/london-journal/march2007/Barfield.html|accessdate=8 June 2012|issn=1744-0807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After turning to writing novels rather than poetry for a period of time, D'Aguiar returned to the poetic mode in 1998, publishing ''Bill of Rights'' (1998): a long narrative poem about the [[Jonestown]] massacre in Guyana in 1979, which is told in Guyanese versions of English, fusing patois, Creole and nation language with the standard vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maes-Jelinek|first=Hena|authorlink=Hena Maes-Jelinek|title=The Labyrinth of Universality: Wilson Harris's Visionary Art of Fiction|year=2006|publisher=Rodopi|location=Amsterdam|pages=419–437 [421]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCoknaliOUMC&amp;pg=PA421&amp;lpg=PA421&amp;dq=fred+d'aguiar+bill+of+rights+jonestown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PfShFRdiY3&amp;sig=-juJ_j9uCNMbeCKpOtesObg5jUw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eWjTT6nQE8rB8gOfxfSdAw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=fred%20d'aguiar%20bill%20of%20rights%20jonestown&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 June 2012|chapter=Chapter 22: "Tricksters of Heaven" Visions of Holocaust in ''Jonestown'' and Fred D'Aguiar's ''Bill of Rights''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shortlisted for the 1998 [[T. S. Eliot Prize]]. ''Bill of Rights'' was followed by another narrative poem, ''Bloodlines'' (2000), which tells the story of a black slave and her white lover.&lt;ref name="British Council"/&gt; His 2009 collection of poetry, ''Continental Shelf'', centres on a response to the [[Virginia Tech Massacre]] in which 32 people were killed by a student in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bainbridge|first=Charles|title=Continental Shelf by Fred D'Aguiar|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/19/continental-shelf-fred-daguiar|accessdate=10 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] (Review Section)|date=19 September 2009|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a finalist for the 2009 [[T. S. Eliot Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=T. S.

=== Novels ===

D'Aguiar's first novel, ''The Longest Memory'' (1994), tells the story of Whitechapel, a slave on an eighteenth-century Virginia plantation. The book won both the [[David Higham Prize for Fiction]] and the [[Whitbread Awards|Whitbread First Novel Award]].&lt;ref name="Bethany Review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Edemariam|first=Aida|title=A Child Out of Time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview15|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frias|first=Maria|title=The Erotics of Slavery (A Review of Bloodlines)|journal=[[Callaloo (journal)|Callaloo]]|year=2002|volume=25|issue=2|pages=679–685, p. 684 (n.4)|doi=10.1353/cal.2002.0069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurnah|first=Abdulrazak|authorlink=Abdulrazak Gurnah|title=Resisting Ignorance|newspaper=[[Times Literary Supplement]]|date=15 July 1994|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted for television and televised by [[Channel 4]] in the UK. Returning to themes he had earlier developed in ''British Subjects'', D'Aguiar's 1996 novel, ''Dear Future'', explores the history of the West Indian diaspora through a fictional account of the lives of one extended family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Bruce|title=Dear Future by Fred D'Aguiar|journal=World Literature Today|year=1997|volume=71|issue=1|pages=206|doi=10.2307/40152753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hathaway|first=Heather|title=Dear Future by Fred D'Aguiar|journal=[[African American Review]]|year=1998|volume=32|issue=3|pages=506–8|doi=10.2307/3042256}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 June 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; D'Aguiar's third novel, ''Feeding the Ghosts'' (1997), was inspired by a visit D'Aguiar made to the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] in Liverpool and is based on the true story of the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]] in which 132 slaves were thrown from a [[slave ship]] into the Atlantic for insurance purposes.&lt;ref name="British Council" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frias Interview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frias|first=Maria|title=Building Bridges Back to the Past: An Interview with Fred D'Aguiar|journal=Callaloo|year=2002|volume=25|issue=2|pages=418–425 [421]|doi=10.1353/cal.2002.0068}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to historical accounts, one slave survived and climbed back onto the ship; and in D'Aguiar's narrative this slave - about whom there is next to no historical information - is developed as the fictional character Mintah.&lt;ref name="Frias Interview" /&gt; His fourth novel, ''Bethany Bettany'' (2003), centres on a five-year-old Guyanese girl, Bethany, whose suffering has been read by some as symbolising that of a nation (Guyana) seeking to make itself whole again.&lt;ref name="Bethany Review" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jays|first=David|title=You can take the boy out of Guyana...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/05/fiction.features5|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=5 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2014 novel ''Children of Paradise'' is a fictional reimagining of the [[Jonestown]] massacre told through the perspective of a mother and child living at the commune.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/books/review/children-of-paradise-by-fred-daguiar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plays ===

D'Aguiar's plays include ''High Life'', which was first produced at the [[Albany Theatre|Albany Empire]] in London in 1987, and ''A Jamaican Airman Foresees His Death'', performed at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London, in 1991. His radio play ''Mr Reasonable'' – about a freed black slave, a skilled silk weaver, who is engaged by [[Shakespeare]] to make theatreical costumes – was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 10 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05prkhb "Mr Reasonable by Fred D'Aguiar"], BBC Radio 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

'''Helen Lewis''' [[MBE]] (''née'' Katz, [[Trutnov]], [[Bohemia]], 22 June 1916&amp;nbsp;– [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland, 31 December 2009) was a pioneer of [[modern dance]] in [[Northern Ireland]], and made her name as a dance teacher and [[Choreography (dance)|choreographer]]. A [[List of Holocaust survivors|survivor of the Holocaust]], she was also known for her [[memoir]] of her experiences during the [[Second World War]].

==Early life==
Helena Katz was born in 1916 into a [[German language|German-speaking]] Jewish family in [[Trutnov]] in [[Bohemia]] (later in [[Czechoslovakia]], now in the [[Czech Republic]]). After she completed study at the [[Realgymnasium]] of Trutnov in 1935, she and her mother moved to [[Prague]]; her father had died in the previous year.{{r|jstor}} There she studied [[ballet|dance]] with {{Interlanguage link multi|Milča Mayerová|cz}}, who had trained with [[Rudolf Laban]]. Katz also studied philosophy at the [[German University of Prague]], and took private lessons in French. In about 1936 she met Paul Hermann, a [[Czech people|Czech]] from a Jewish family, and in 1938, after she had finished her dance training and her university exams, they were married. She taught as an assistant at Mayerová's dance school, and experimented with [[choreography]].{{r|jstor}}

==War years==

Following the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1939, [[deportation]]s of Jewish families began in August 1941. The Hermanns were sent in 1942 to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]]; in 1944 they were transferred to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and separated. Paul Hermann died in 1945 on a [[forced march]], not long before the end of the Second World War.{{r|jstor}} Helen, who survived two "selections" by Dr [[Josef Mengele]],&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/survivor-of-auschwitz-death-camp-helen-lewis-dies-at-93-28509130.html | title=Survivor of Auschwitz death camp Helen Lewis dies at 93 | work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] | date=2 January 2010 | accessdate=7 January 2016 | author=Henry, Lesley-Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; was later sent to [[Stutthof concentration camp]] in northern [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;

When the war ended, she returned to Prague, where she learnt of her husband's death; her mother, who had been deported early in 1942,{{r|jstor}} had died at [[Sobibór extermination camp]].&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt; Helen began to correspond with Harry Lewis, a Czech with British nationality whom she had known at school and with whom she had had a brief romance before she met Hermann.{{r|jstor}} She married Lewis in Prague in the summer of 1947&lt;ref name= "Culture NI"/&gt; and in October moved to [[Belfast]].

==Belfast==

After the birth of her two sons, Michael and Robin, in 1949 and 1954,{{r|jstor}} Lewis began to work as a choreographer.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt; In 1956, she created the choreography for the productions ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'' of [[Smetana]] at [[Grosvenor High School]] in Belfast, for a performance of [[Dvořák]]'s ''[[The Golden Spinning Wheel (Dvořák)|The Golden Spinning Wheel]]'' at the [[Belfast Ballet Club]], and for a ''[[Macbeth]]'' at the [[Lyric Theatre, Belfast]].&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt; Lewis also taught modern dance, and in 1962 started the Belfast Modern Dance Group.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/mar/17/helen-lewis-obituary | title=Helen Lewis obituary | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=17 March 2010 | accessdate=22 April 2015 | author=Johnston, Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and research ==
In 1945, Bruner returned to Harvard as a psychology professor and was heavily involved in research relating to cognitive psychology and educational psychology. In 1970, Bruner left Harvard to teach at the [[University of Oxford]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. He returned to the United States in 1980, to continue his research in developmental psychology. In 1991, Bruner joined the faculty at New York University (NYU), where he taught primarily in the School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|date=Winter 2004|title=A Short History of Psychological Theories of Learning|jstor=20027892|journal=Daedalus|publisher=[[MIT Press]] on behalf of American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences|volume=133| issue =  1|pages=13–20S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, Bruner studied how psychology affects legal practice. During his career, Bruner was awarded honorary doctorates from [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]], [[The New School]], the [[Sorbonne]], the ISPA Instituto Universitário, as well as colleges and universities in such locations as [[Berlin]] and [[Rome]], and was a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=officialwebsite /&gt; He [[centenarian|turned 100]] in October 2015&lt;ref name="Centenary"&gt;{{cite web|last = Popova|first = Maria|authorlink = Maria Popova|title = Pioneering Psychologist Jerome Bruner on the Act of Discovery and the Key to True Learning|website = BrainPickings.org|date = 2015-10-01|url = https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/01/jerome-bruner-act-of-discovery/|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died on June 5, 2016.&lt;ref name=natureobit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Carey.

=== Cognitive psychology ===
{{Main|Cognitive psychology}}

Bruner is one of the pioneers of [[Cognitive revolution|cognitive psychology]] in the United States, which began through his own early research on [[sense|sensation]] and [[perception]] as being active, rather than passive processes.

In 1947, Bruner published his study ''Value and Need as Organizing Factors in Perception'', in which poor and rich children were asked to estimate the size of coins or wooden disks the size of American [[penny (United States coin)|pennies]], [[nickel (United States coin)|nickels]], [[dime (United States coin)|dimes]], [[quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] and [[half dollar (United States coin)|half-dollars]]. The results showed that the value and need the poor and rich children associated with coins caused them to significantly overestimate the size of the coins, especially when compared to their more accurate estimations of the same size disks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|author2=Goodman, Cecile|title=Value and Need as Organizing Factors in Percepton|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1947|volume=42|pages=33–44|doi=10.1037/h0058484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, another study conducted by Bruner and Leo Postman showed slower [[reaction time]]s and less accurate answers when a deck of [[playing cards]] reversed the color of the [[Suit (cards)|suit]] symbol for some cards (e.g. red spades and black hearts).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Bruner/Cards/ On the Perception of Incongruity: A Paradigm]" by Jerome S. Bruner and Leo Postman. ''Journal of Personality'', 18, pp. 206–223.  1949.&lt;/ref&gt; These series of [[experiments]] issued in what some called the 'New Look' psychology, which challenged psychologists to study not just an organism's response to a stimulus, but also its internal interpretation.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt;  After these experiments on perception, Bruner turned his attention to the actual cognitions that he had indirectly studied in his perception studies.

In 1956, Bruner published the book ''A Study of Thinking'', which formally initiated the study of cognitive psychology. Soon afterward Bruner helped found the Harvard Center of Cognitive Studies. After a time, Bruner began to research other topics in psychology, but in 1990 he returned to the subject and gave a series of lectures, later compiled into the book ''Acts of Meaning''. In these lectures, Bruner refuted the computer model for studying the [[mind]], advocating a more [[holistic]] understanding of the mind and its cognitions.

=== Developmental psychology ===
{{Main|Developmental psychology}}

Beginning around 1967, Bruner turned his attention to the subject of developmental psychology and studied the way children learn. He coined the term "scaffolding" to describe the way children often build on the information they have already mastered. In his research on the development of children (1966) Bruner proposed three modes of representation: enactive representation (action-based), iconic representation (image-based), and symbolic representation (language-based). Rather than neatly delineated stages, the modes of representation are integrated and only loosely sequential as they "translate" into each other. Symbolic representation remains the ultimate mode, for it "is clearly the most mysterious of the three."

Bruner's theory suggests it is efficacious, when faced with new material, to follow a progression from enactive to iconic to symbolic representation; this holds true even for adult learners. A true [[instructional design]]er, Bruner's work also suggests that a learner (even of a very young age) is capable of learning any material so long as the instruction is organized appropriately, in sharp contrast to the beliefs of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and other stage theorists. (Driscoll, Marcy). Like [[Bloom's Taxonomy]], Bruner suggests a system of coding in which people form a [[hierarchical]] arrangement of related categories. Each successively higher level of categories becomes more specific, echoing [[Benjamin Bloom]]'s understanding of knowledge acquisition as well as the related idea of [[instructional scaffolding]].

In accordance with this understanding of learning, Bruner proposed the [[spiral curriculum]], a teaching approach in which each subject or skill area is revisited at intervals, at a more sophisticated level each time. First there is basic knowledge of a subject, then more sophistication is added, reinforcing principles that were first discussed. This system is used in China and India. Bruner's spiral curriculum, however, draws heavily from evolution to explain how to learn better and thus it drew criticism from conservatives. In the United States classes are split by grade—life sciences in 9th grade, chemistry in 10th, physics in 11th. The spiral teaches life sciences, chemistry, physics all in one year, then two subjects, then one, then all three again to understand how they mold together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gearup.ous.edu/sites/default/files/Research-Briefs/ResearchBriefSpiralCurriculum.pdf|title=The Spiral Curriculum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223911/http://gearup.ous.edu/sites/default/files/Research-Briefs/ResearchBriefSpiralCurriculum.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruner also believes learning should be spurred by interest in the material rather than tests or punishment, since one learns best when one finds the acquired knowledge appealing.

=== Educational psychology ===
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
While Bruner was at Harvard he published a series of works about his assessment of current educational systems and ways that education could be improved. In 1961, he published the book ''Process of Education''. Bruner also served as a member of the Educational Panel of the President's Science Advisory Committee during the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Referencing his overall view that education should not focus merely on memorizing facts, Bruner wrote in ''Process of Education'' that "knowing how something is put together is worth a thousand facts about it." From 1964–1996 Bruner sought to develop a complete curriculum for the educational system that would meet the needs of students in three main areas which he called [[Man: A Course of Study]]. Bruner wanted to create an educational environment that would focus on (1) what was uniquely human about human beings, (2) how humans got that way and (3) how humans could become more so.&lt;ref name=Fifty /&gt; In 1966, Bruner published another book relevant to education, ''Towards a Theory of Instruction,'' and then in 1973, another book, ''The Relevance of Education.'' Finally, in 1996, in ''The Culture of Education,'' Bruner reassessed the state of educational practices three decades after he had begun his educational research. Bruner was also credited with helping found the Head Start early childcare program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=NYU Faculty Page|url=https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?section=bio&amp;personID=19807|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruner was deeply impressed by his 1995 visit to the preschools of [[Reggio Emilia]] and has established a collaborative relationship with them to improve educational systems internationally. Equally important was the relationship with the Italian Ministry of Education which officially recognized the value of this innovative experience.

=== Language development ===
{{Main|Language development}}
In 1972, Bruner was appointed Watts Professor of Experimental Psychology at the [[University of Oxford]], where he remained until 1980. In his Oxford years, Bruner focused on early [[language development]]. Rejecting the [[Universal grammar|nativist]] account of [[language acquisition]] proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]], Bruner offered an alternative in the form of an [[interactionist]] or [[social interactionist theory]] of language development. In this approach, the social and interpersonal nature of language was emphasized, appealing to the work of philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[John L. Austin]] and [[John Searle]] for theoretical grounding.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Following [[Lev Vygotsky]] the Russian theoretician of socio-cultural development, Bruner proposed that social interaction plays a fundamental role in the development of cognition in general and of language in particular. He emphasized that children learn language in order to communicate, and, at the same time, they also learn the linguistic code. Meaningful language is acquired in the context of meaningful parent-infant interaction, learning "scaffolded" or supported by the child's language acquisition support system (LASS).

At Oxford Bruner worked with a large group of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to understand how young children manage to crack the linguistic code, among them Alison Garton, [[Alison Gopnik]], Magda Kalmar ([[:hu:Kalmár Magda (pszichológus)|Kalmár Magda]]), [[Alan Leslie]], [[Andrew Meltzoff]], [[Anat Ninio]], [[Roy Pea]], Susan Sugarman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/sugarman/cv.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107055216/http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/sugarman/cv.php |archivedate=2013-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Scaife, Marian Sigman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.ctrl.ucla.edu/npi/institution/personnel?personnel_id=9737|title=Faculty Database – David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121215032055/http://portal.ctrl.ucla.edu/npi/institution/personnel?personnel_id=9737|archivedate=2012-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathy Sylva and many others. Much emphasis was placed on employing the then-revolutionary method of videotaped home-observations, Bruner showing the way to a new wave of researchers to get out of the laboratory and take on the complexities of naturally occurring events in a child's life. This work was published in a large number of journal articles, and in 1983 Bruner published a summary in the book ''Child's talk: Learning to Use Language''.

This decade of research established Bruner at the helm of the interactionist approach to language development, exploring such themes as the acquisition of communicative intents and the development of their linguistic expression, the interactive context of language use in early childhood, and the role of parental input and scaffolding behavior in the acquisition of linguistic forms. This work rests on the assumptions of a [[social constructivist]] theory of meaning according to which meaningful participation in the social life of a group as well as meaningful use of language involve an interpersonal, intersubjective, collaborative process of creating shared meaning. The elucidation of this process became the focus of Bruner's next period of work.

=== Narrative construction of reality ===
In 1980, Bruner returned to the United States, taking up the position of professor at the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]] in 1981. For the next decade, he worked on the development of a theory of the narrative construction of reality, culminating in several seminal publications. His book ''Actual Minds, Possible Worlds'' has been cited by over 16,100 scholarly publications, making it one of the most influential works of the 20th century.

=== Legal psychology ===
{{Main|Legal psychology}}
In 1991, Bruner arrived at NYU as a visiting professor to do research and to found the Colloquium on the Theory of Legal Practice. The goal of this institution is to "study how law is practiced and how its practice can be understood by using tools developed in anthropology, psychology, linguistics, and literary theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=Jerome Bruner:Biography|url=https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?section=bio&amp;personID=19807|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Ward received her A.B. from [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1923 and her Ph.D from Bryn Mawr College in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brynmawr.edu/cs/history|title=History {{!}} Bryn Mawr College|website=www.brynmawr.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== [[World War II]] ==
Dr. Ward joined the cryptologic service during WWII and worked for the Signal Security Agency (the Army's cryptologic organization). She also worked as a librarian and eventually built a collection of classified and unclassified materials for use by analysts. In 1945 she became the deputy chief of the reference section. Within a few years, she turned the section into one that was known as poorly organized, into a section that was widely recognized and highly respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFYRDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT430&amp;lpg=PT430&amp;dq=Julia+Ward+NSA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5XAGS2slBJ&amp;sig=kKUze03HNpORwObn2MZbXMAUbls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyxI6w3evcAhWPFXwKHa06BP84ChDoATAEegQIBhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Julia%20Ward%20&amp;f=false|title=Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II|last=Mundy|first=Liza|date=2017-10-10|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=9780316352550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1949, Dr. Ward was named head of the Collateral Branch, thereby becoming the only female branch head in the Office of Operations. 

Later, in 1955 Dr. Ward, was promoted to deputy chief of NSA's Liaison and Foreign Operations Section.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Cryptologic Hall of Honor ==
Dr. Julia Ward was inducted into the NSA's Cryptologic Hall of Honor in June 2002 at the National Cryptologic Museum in Baltimore, MD. Bryn Mawr College has a plague in Dr. Ward's honor to commemorate her placement in the Hall of Honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/hall-of-honor/2002/|title=Hall of Honor|last=|first=|date=|website=NSA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/search/site/warded?page=3|title=FOIA {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teachers' Day''' is a special day for the appreciation of [[teachers]], and may include celebrations to honor them for their special contributions in a particular field area, or the community in general.

The idea of celebrating Teachers' Day took root in many countries during the 19th century; in most cases, they celebrate a local educator or an important milestone in education. This is the primary reason why countries celebrate this day on different dates, unlike many other International Days. For example, Argentina has commemorated [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]'s death on 11 September) since 1915;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jardindeinfantesdfs.com.ar/historia.htm#El%20Maestro%20Argentino:%20Domingo%20F.%20Sarmiento|title=Historia|publisher=Jardindeinfantesdfs.com.ar|accessdate=2 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820105920/http://www.jardindeinfantesdfs.com.ar/historia.htm#El%20Maestro%20Argentino:%20Domingo%20F.%20Sarmiento|archivedate=20 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in India [[Guru Purnima]] is traditionally observed as a day to venerate teachers, the birthday of the second president [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] (5 September) is also celebrated as Teacher's Day since 1962.

Many countries celebrate [[World Teachers' Day]], established by [[UNESCO]] in 1994, on 5 October as their Teachers' Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/teachers/world-teachers-day|title=World Teachers' Day - 5 October 2017|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government first proclaimed Teachers' Day in 1985, but has never clearly explained why it should fall on 10 September. Some believe it is due to the similar pronunciation between the word "teacher" (教师 jiao shi) and the two digits 9 (九jiu), 10 (十shi) in the date. Some people believe it was an arbitrary choice and have proposed to change it to 28 September, believed to be the birthdate of [[Confucius]]. On 5 September 2013, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] announced a legislative draft endorsing the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-09/06/c_132697316.htm|title=China mulls changing Teachers' Day to birthday of Confucius|work=Xinhua News Agency|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality some schools operate as usual and others take the day off. The first Teacher's Day was celebrated on 15 May 1918. The date of 15 May was proposed at the Mexican Congress on 27 September 1917, approved on 29 October 1917 and published on 5 December 1917. There are several possible origins for choosing this date. The first one mentions that in the city of [[San Luis Potosí]] every 15 May, a group of students gathered to celebrate the birthday of their old teacher Isidore, named after Saint [[Isidore the Laborer]], following the Mexican tradition of naming children according to the Saint celebrated the day they were born. The second origin considers the celebration of a historic event in the city of [[Querétaro]] on 15 May 1867.&lt;ref name="Portes1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis Tinajero Portes|title=Días conmemorativos en la historia de México|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FnxIVh-A60YC&amp;pg=PA90|date=1 January 1994|publisher=UASLP|language=es|isbn=978-968-6194-65-4|page=90|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of students representing various grade levels perform short skits or song and dance numbers, or read poetry for their teachers in front of fellow schoolmates in school-wide activities. These activities are planned by senior students in the Student Council who coordinate the activities well in advance.&lt;br&gt;For [[Chinese Filipino|Filipino-Chinese]] schools, a program is usually organized by students for teachers on 27 September while 28 September, considered as the actual Teachers' Day, is a school holiday where both teachers and students are allowed to rest. 28 September was selected as it is thought to be the birthdate of [[Confucius]].

|Taiwan uses this day to honor teachers' contributions to their own students and to society in general. People often make use of the day to express their gratitude to their teachers, such as paying them a visit or sending them a card. This date was chosen to commemorate the birth of [[Confucius]], believed to be the model master educator. In 1939, the Ministry of Education established the national holiday as 27 August, the attributed birthday of [[Confucius]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1952, the [[Executive Yuan]] changed it to September, stating that it was calculated to be the precise date in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The festival celebration occurs in the temples of Confucius around the island, known as the "Grand Ceremony Dedicated to Confucius" (祭孔大典). The ceremony begins at 6am with drum beats. 54 musicians are dressed in robes with blue belts, and 36 (or 64) dancers dressed in yellow with green belts. They are led by Confucius's chief descendant (currently [[Kung Tsui-chang]]) and followed by ceremonial officers. Three animals are sacrificed: a cow, a goat, and a pig. The hairs plucked from these sacrificed animals are called the Hairs of Wisdom. In addition, local education institutes and civil offices award certain teachers for their excellence and positive influence.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

|{{Hs|05-00}}National Teacher Day is on Tuesday during Teacher Appreciation Week, which takes place in the first full week of May.
|The [[National Education Association]] (NEA) describes National Teacher Day as "a day for honoring teachers and recognizing the lasting contributions they make to our lives".&lt;ref name="nea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/teacherday|title=National Teacher Day|publisher=NEA.org|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NEA gives a history of National Teacher Day:&lt;ref name="nea" /&gt; The origins of Teacher Day are murky. Around 1944, a Wisconsin teacher named Ryan Krug began corresponding with political and education leaders about the need for a national day to honor teachers. Woodbridge wrote to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who in 1953 persuaded the [[Eighty-first United States Congress|81st Congress]] to proclaim a National Teacher Day. NEA along with its Kansas and Indiana state affiliates and the [[Dodge City, Kansas]] local NEA branch lobbied Congress to create a national day celebrating teachers. Congress declared 7 March 1980 as National Teacher Day for that year only. The NEA and its affiliates continued to observe Teacher Day on the first Tuesday in March until 1985, when the National PTA established Teacher Appreciation Week in the first full week of May. The NEA Representative Assembly then voted to make the Tuesday of that week National Teacher Day. As of 4 November 1976, 6 November was adopted as Teachers' Day in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Massachusetts]]. Currently, Massachusetts sets the first Sunday of June as its own Teachers' Day annually.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

|This holiday allows students to express their respect to their teacher. Students begin preparing a week in advance. Many classes prepare literature and art to welcome Teachers' Day, while other students prepare foods and flowers for the parties held at their schools. Students usually visit their teachers at their homes to offer flowers and small gifts, or organize trips with their teachers and classmates. Former students also pay respect to their former teachers on this day. The holiday has its origins in a meeting between educators in [[communist bloc]] nations in [[Warsaw]] in 1957. It was first celebrated in 1958 as the Day of the International Manifest of Educators; in 1982 the day was renamed Vietnamese Educators' Day.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Lloyd Allayre Loar''' (1886 – 1943) was a designer for the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co. Ltd.]] and sound engineer in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=frettednews&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=In Memoriam, Lloyd A. Loar |url= https://www.mandolincafe.com/forum/showthread.php?133382-Lloyd-Loar-s-Obituary-from-Fretted-Instrument-News|work=Fretted Instrument News |publisher= The Rhode Island Music Company|location=Providence, Rhode Island |date=November–December 1943|access-date=May 17, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   He is most famous for his [[Gibson F-5|F-5 model]] [[mandolin]] and [[Gibson L-5|L-5]] [[guitar]]. In his later years he worked on [[Instrument amplifier|electric amplification]] of stringed instruments, and demonstrated them around the country.&lt;ref name=electviola&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= There's No Back On This Viola, But It's Got Power |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20009876/lloyd_loar_electric_cello |work=The Courier |location=Waterloo, Iowa |date=10 January 1938 |access-date=17 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example, played in public in 1938 was an electric viola that used electric coils beneath the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]], with no back, able to "drown out the loudest trumpet."&lt;ref name=electviola/&gt;

In 1898 [[Orville Gibson]] had patented a new kind of mandolin that followed violin design, with its curved top and bottom carved into shape, rather than pressed.&lt;ref name=Sparks129-130&gt;{{harvnb|Sparks|2003|page=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sides too were carved out of a single block of wood, rather than being made of bent wood strips.&lt;ref name=Sparks129-130/&gt; The instruments were already unique before Lloyd Loar came to work for Gibson. However, it is the Loar-designed instruments that became especially desirable. First made famous by [[Bill Monroe]], Loar's signed mandolins today can cost as much as 200,000 dollars. The L-5 guitar owned by [[Maybelle Carter]], which was made after he left Gibson, sold for 575,000 dollars.&lt;ref name=span&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prewargibsonl-5.com/85558/4578092585|title= 85558- Gibson L-5|last= Alcantara |first= Paul|date= |website= prewargibsonl-5.com |publisher= |access-date= 20 May 2018 |quote=Joe Span...Spain's Guide to Gibson...I conclude that Maybelle's guitar was shipped in January of 1930.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the changes that Loar introduced was the [[f-hole]] instead of a round or oval [[sound-hole]], another violin-family feature imported to the mandolin.&lt;ref name=Sparks129-130/&gt; He also "tuned" the tops of the instrument and the sound chamber (by removing bits of wood from sound bars and from the edges of the sound holes) so that the instrument's sound chamber was resonant to a particular note. Another change that Loar introduced to the Gibson line was a tone-producer, a circle of wood inside the instrument on the underside of the [[Sound board (music)|sound board]] that produced "overtones." His idea was to have a more complete set of these overtones with the carved top instruments. The result was an instrument that, like [[Stradivarius]]’ violins, has presented challenges to duplicate. [[Luthier]]-researchers such as Roger Siminoff have worked to understand the fine details.  Gibsons' and Loar's mandolins were instrumental in displacing the round-backed instrument from the American market and influenced mandolins worldwide.

He also developed keyboard-stringed instruments. According to Roger Siminoff, he developed unique mechanisms to create sound. One plucked strings, the other struck metal reeds.

Loar was also a well-regarded musician on mandolin, viola, and [[musical saw]]. He traveled the United States and Europe in several musical groups. In one group, he performed with his future wife, Fisher Shipp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm4/results.php?CISOOP1=exact&amp;CISOFIELD1=corpor&amp;CISOROOT=all&amp;CISOBOX1=Fisher+Shipp+Concert+Company|title=University of Iowa Digital Library|last=digital.lib.uiowa.edu|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A surviving playbill shows that Loar performed in a [[chatauqua]] that also included a speech by [[William Jennings Bryan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tc&amp;CISOPTR=57050&amp;REC=5|title=University of Iowa Digital Libraries|last=digital.lib.uiowa.edu|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loar performed in many other groups that promoted the Gibson company, whose products Loar endorses in early Gibson catalogs.

Lloyd also taught at [[Northwestern University]] from 1930 to 1943, teaching vocal composition, advanced [[music theory]] and "''The Physics of Music''".&lt;ref name=chicobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siminoff.net/loar-at-northwestern/ |title=Loar’s Classes at Northwestern |last=Siminoff |first=Roger |date= |website=siminoff.net |publisher= |access-date=20 May 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Loar worked for Gibson from 1919 to 1924.  His contributions include building the instrument top with F-shaped holes, like a violin; introducing a longer [[Neck (music)|neck]], thus moving the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] closer to the center of the body; and floating the [[fingerboard]] over the top, a change from prior Gibson instruments that had fingerboards fused to the top.  He also pioneered the use of the Virzi Tone Producer, a spruce disc suspended from the instrument top that acts as a supplemental soundboard.

According to [[A. R. Duchossoir]], Loar designed experimental electric instruments while at Gibson. Loar's views on the importance of the development of electric instruments were supported by Lewis A Williams, one of the founders and major stockholders of Gibson as well as its secretary and general manager.

None of Loar's original electric instruments appear to have been preserved—but Walter A Fuller, who joined Gibson in 1933 and later became Gibson's chief electronic engineer, found some of Loar's original devices when he first set up his R&amp;D lab in the mid-1930s. He claimed that Loar's electrics had electrostatic pickups, but because they exhibited very high impedance they were extremely susceptible to humidity. According to Fuller, the pickups were round, about the size of a silver dollar and had a piece of cork on the back, by which they were glued to the underside of the top of the instrument.

Duchossior's book, ''Gibson Electrics, The Classic Years'', features a photo of a Gibson L5, serial number 88258 of 1929 (after Loar left Gibson), one of the original Loar-designed L5s, with fitted electrostatic pickup and factory-fitted jack socket in the tailpiece.

Duchossoir also claims that Loar spent time at Gibson working on a 'quasi-solid body' electric double bass, and that according to this instrument and several patents filed by Loar between the mid-1920s and the mid-1930s, he worked on pickups that were electromagnetic in nature.

According to Duchossoir, Lewis Williams was replaced as general manager, and a lack of amicable relations with the new manager—an accountant named Guy Hart—led to the termination of Loar's contract. After leaving Gibson, Loar created and patented an electric instrument with a coil pickup, and co-founded the Acousti-Lectric company with Lewis Williams in 1934. The company was renamed the [[Vivi-Tone]] company in 1936. Loar died in 1943.

The F5 model was made famous by the founder of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[Bill Monroe]]. Monroe played a [http://www.mandolinarchive.com/gibson/serial/73987 Gibson F5 model serial number 73987]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandolinarchive.com/gibson/serial/73987|title=F5 Journal record for Gibson F5 #73987|last=www.mandolinarchive.com|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by Loar on July 9, 1923 for most of his career. This mandolin can be viewed in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee, where it now resides in their collections.

Loar also signed a rare subset of F5 mandolins called ''Ferns'', of which approximately twenty are known to exist. The name refers to the distinctive fern inlay design of the peghead. The earliest documented Fern bears the serial number 73755, dated July 9, 1923, the same signing date as Bill Monroe's famous Loar [http://www.mandolinarchive.com/gibson/serial/73755]. This is the only known Fern built without the ''"Virzi" Tone Producer'', a secondary sound board suspended underneath the mandolin's top inside the sound chamber. This particular instrument is the only known Fern dated on 9 July.
 
In 2007, mandolinist [[Chris Thile]] acquired [http://www.mandolinarchive.com/perl/show_mando.pl?3630 1924 Loar-signed F5] serial # 75316 that was an exceedingly rare find, as it was in virtually new condition. It reportedly cost him around $200,000. Other well-known musicians who have owned Loar-signed F5's include [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] serial # 75317, [[Mike Marshall (musician)|Mike Marshall]], David McLaughlin, Herschel Sizemore, Alan Bibey, Tony Williamson, [[David Grisman]], John Reischman, [[Tom Rozum]], [[Frank Wakefield]], and the late [[Joe Val]] serial #72207.

Only one A-style mandolin, a Gibson A5, is known to have been signed by Loar. It has been widely copied, originally by mandolin maker Bob Givens. The [http://www.mandolinarchive.com/perl/show_mando.pl?51 Loar A5] was found by [https://web.archive.org/web/20100108045341/http://www.mandozine.com/resources/CGOW/tuttaylor.php Tut Taylor] and sold to a Southern California bluegrass musician in 1974.

=== Collectability ===

As of January 2010, Loar-signed mandolins in fine condition are valued in the $175,000 to $200,000 range, and are highly sought after by musicians and collectors.  The average value reached a 2008 peak of around $225,000, then backed off somewhat from 2008 to 2010.

Loar expert Darryl Wolfe maintains an F5 historical journal. As of January, 2010 he has documented 228 Loar-signed F5 mandolins of the 326 that are believed to have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandolinarchive.com/signature_dates.html|title=Loar Signed Instruments|last=www.mandolinarchive.com|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==L-5 Guitar==

| width1   = 150
| caption1 = [[Gibson L-5]] guitar {{smaller|(played by [[Maybelle Carter]])}}, "the most important single guitar in the entire history of country music," according to [[George Gruhn]]. There is controversy about its date. Commonly said to be a 1928 instrument, but researcher Joe Span concluded, it couldn't have left the factory earlier than April 1929, and was shipped January, 1930.&lt;ref name=span/&gt;}}
The [[Gibson L-5]] [[guitar]] was first produced in 1922 by the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]], then of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], under the direction of master [[luthier]] Lloyd Loar, and has been in production ever since. It was considered the premier guitar of the company during the [[big band]] era. It was originally offered as an [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] instrument, with [[electric guitar|electric]] models not made available until the 1940s.

===Design and construction===

Worldwide, the L-5 was the first guitar to feature [[f-hole]]s. Then as well as today, the construction of the L-5 is similar in construction, carving, bracing and tap-tuning, to building a cello. This guitar as well as the cello are similarly designed in order to amplify and project the acoustic vibration of strings throughout carved and tuned woods, using f-holes as the projection points. From 1922 to 1934 the L-5 was produced with a 16" lower bout width. In 1934 the lower bout was increased to 17" - and this width is still used today. Also released in 1934 was the one-inch larger 18" archtop guitar named the "L5 Super" which a couple of years later was renamed the [[Gibson Super 400]]. These two master-built acoustic guitars are Gibson's top-of-the-line carved wood and highly ornate archtop instruments. These guitars cannot be constructed quickly and require unusual attention to detail, resulting in a higher price. The time, skilled workmanship and materials used in these builds has been delivered non-stop for the past 90+ years. Since the 1930s there have been several other 17" archtops designed by Gibson, including variations introduced as more affordable, less ornately decorated models - these were introduced to consider the budgets of musicians.&lt;ref&gt;''Gruhn's Guide To Vintage Guitars'', 2nd Edition, pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2975">'''Magic sand''' or '''hydrophobic sand''' is a [[toy]] made from [[sand]] coated with a [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] compound. The presence of this hydrophobic compound causes the grains of sand to adhere to one another and form [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s (to minimize [[surface area]]) when exposed to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to make Magic Sand|url=http://www.thegeekpub.com/1382/how-to-make-magic-water-proof-sand/|website=The Geek Pub|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the sand is removed from water, it is completely dry and free flowing. Magic sand is also known as Aqua Sand.

[[File:Trimethylsilanol-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|[[Trimethylsilanol]]]]
These properties are achieved with ordinary beach sand, which contains tiny particles of pure [[silica]], and exposing it to vapors of [[trimethylsilanol]] ([[Methyl|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]])&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[silicon|Si]][[hydroxyl|OH]], an [[organosilicon]] compound. Upon exposure, the trimethylsilane compound bonds to the silica particles while forming water. The exteriors of the sand grains are thus coated with [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] groups.

Magic sand was originally developed to trap ocean [[oil spill]]s near the shore. This would be done by sprinkling magic sand on floating petroleum, which would then mix with the oil and make it heavy enough to sink. Due to the expense of production, it is not being used for this purpose. It has also been tested by utility companies in Arctic regions as a foundation for [[junction box]]es, as it never freezes. It can be also used as an aerating medium for potted plants.

Magic sand is made in blue, green, or red in colors but appears silvery in water because of a layer of air that forms around the sand, making it unable to get wet.

The earliest reference to waterproof sand is in the 1915 book ''The Boy Mechanic Book 2'' published by ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''. The Boy Mechanic states waterproof sand was invented by East Indian [[magic (illusion)|magicians]]. The sand was made by mixing heated sand with melted [[wax]]. The wax would repel water when the sand was exposed to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''National Wind Tunnel Facility''' (NWTF), is an initiative in which 17 [[wind tunnels]] distributed across seven UK universities (host institutions) are made open access (for up to 25% of time) to external researchers in the UK and abroad, from both university and industry based.&lt;ref&gt;The proposal funding details on the EPSRC website: http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPanel.aspx?PanelId=1-1O6B32&lt;/ref&gt; 

NWTF is intended to be as inclusive as possible while still  supporting the best science. The scheme was announced on 9 January 2014 by [[David Willetts]], Minister for Science and Universities.&lt;ref&gt;News of the opening by the minister David Willetts: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-25668025&lt;/ref&gt; The total funding for the Facility is £13.3 million, £10.7 million coming from [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]] and £2.6 million from the UK Aerospace Technology Institute.&lt;ref&gt; News of the opening on the ATI website: http://www.ati.org.uk/news/uk-aerodynamics-epsrc-fund-national-wind-tunnel-facility-nwtf/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The EPSRC and ATI decided to fund the NWTF in order to match the UK talent base to world-class wind tunnel facilities. The enhanced UK capability in experimental [[aerodynamics]] is available to all UK-based researchers.  The stated aim was to create nodes of excellence attracting young researchers. Another aim was to establish a closer tie with industry, creating a pull-through environment and an intended spill-over of the collaboration and benefits to other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the project: http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/L024888/1&lt;/ref&gt;

The NWTF programme was to have a duration of five years. A mid-term review was to review the progress made during the first two and a half years. The current end date is December 2018,

'''The Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut''' is situated at the heart of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. [[Naumburg Cathedral]] and the landscpae has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the [[World Heritage List|List of World Heritage]]. On July 1, 2018, only Naumburg Cathedral was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-naumburg-cathedral-wins-world-heritage-designation/a-44481701|title=Germany's Naumburg Cathedral wins World Heritage designation|work=[[DW-TV|DW]]|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landscape arount the World Heritage nomination "Naumburg Cathedral" is representative for processes at the [[High Middle Ages]] that shaped the whole continent: [[Christianization]], settlement and [[Cultivation (agriculture)|cultivation]] processes, the so-called [[Landesausbau]], that took place between 1000 and 1300. This borderland region also bears witness of the intercultural exchange of different cultures in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The highest-ranking buildings and works of art, most of all Naumburg Cathedral with its globally unique artistic and iconographic founder figures, provides testimony to the claims to power and the self-confidence of the worldly and spiritual rulers as well as to the region’s crucial role as a place of interchange between Western and Eastern realms.

== Nomination as World Heritage ==
[[File:Steinmeister vineyard.jpg|thumb|Steinmeister vineyard]]
In 1998, Naumburg Cathedral was inscribed into the Tentative List for World Heritage nominations and extended seven years later by its surrounding cultural [[landscape]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Tentative Lists are prepared by States Parties to the Convention on the Protection of Cultural and Natural World Heritage. They contain a number of nominiation proposals to be submitted in the future.

=== Component: Naumburg ===
==== Naumburg Cathedral ====
Naumburg Cathedral is known for its [[architecture]], [[sculpture]]s and images: ″The harmonic connection between architecture, sculpture and stained glass windows in the west choir of the cathedral counts among the most impressive creations of human creativity in the Middle Ages at large.″&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Université de Paris-Sorbonne,  Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen a.o.(2017).{{cite book|title=The outstanding significance of the Naumburg Cathedral and the cultural landscape on the rivers Saale and Unstrut.|publisher= Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut|pages=1–2|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] core structure is flanked by two [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[Rood screen|choirs]] in the east and in the west, built in the transitional style between [[Romanesque architecture|Late Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]].&lt;ref name="″Wixom"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin v. 46, no. 3|title=Medieval Sculpture at the Cloisters.|last=Wixom|first=William D.|chapter=Medieval Sculpture.|year=1988|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The Naumburg Masters =====
[[File:Naumburg Masters.jpg|thumb|Naumburg Masters]]
The worldwide known workshop of [[Sculpture|sculptors]] and [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]], which was likely established in the early [[13th century]], known as the [[Naumburg Master]]s, was headed by a sculptor-architect, who has been described by scholars as ″an artist of real genius″.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Janson|editor-first=Horst W.|editor2-last=Janson|editor2-first=Anthony F.|title=History of Art: The Western Tradition.|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415929356|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the work of the Naumburg Masters, marked by an extraordinary realism and individualism of sculptures and a detailed representation of the environment such as plants or ornaments, has justified Naumburg’s reputation beyond its region. The Naumburg Masters were conveyors and pioneers of the innovations in architecture and sculpture of the Late [[Hohenstaufen]] period in the [[13th century]].&lt;ref name="Willamson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Paul|title=Gothic Sculpture, 1140—1300.|date=October 1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300074522|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their building workshop has left traces of its work all the way from Northern [[France]] over the Middle [[Rhine]] area up to the eastern boundaries of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Empire]] and further on the southwestern [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Skulptur, Architektur und Bautechnik des Naumburger Westchors|trans-title=Sculpture, Architecture and Building Techniques of the West Choir of Naumburg.|page=383|author=Dominik Jelschewski|publisher=Pustet, Friedrich GmbH|date=2015|language=German|isbn=3791726005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects the cultural artistic exchange during the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Naumburger Dom St. Peter and Paul - Ein Kleinod der europäischen Kulturgete.

===== Choir screens – Passion of Christ =====
[[File:West choir.jpg|thumb|West choir]]
One feature of the Naumburg Cathedral is its two almost completely preserved [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] screen structures from the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Matthew M.|title=Reading Gothic Architecture|date=2008|publisher=l'Université du Michigan|isbn=9782503525365|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the east choir, the only late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] hall choir screen has survived. In the west choir, there is a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] partition-type screen: ″Even within the tiny corpus of medieval churches whose original configurations of architecture and sculpture remain intact, the arrangement at Naumburg is unique.″&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Jacqueline E.|title=The gothic screen.

The western mural choir screen shows artistic quality in terms of architecture, ornamentation and figural sculptures: ″The mid-thirteenth-century west choir of Naumburg Cathedral has long been admired both for its unified architectural design″.″&lt;ref name="Jung2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Jacqueline E.|title=The gothic screen.

The conceptually sophisticated arrangement of the [[Passion of Jesus|passion of Christ]] is one of the most outstanding among the preserved sculptural ensembles from the 13th century, providing i.a. detailed information on contemporary clothing. The [[Naumburg Master]] achieved a degree of dramatic expressiveness and natural vibrancy that conveys the suffering of [[Christ]] and the deep grief of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and St. John.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L´Arte Medievale nel contesto 300-1300.

===== Glass painting =====
[[File:West choir Naumburg.jpg|thumb|West choir Naumburg]]
The window paintings of the west choir were created from an unknown glass painting workshop in close consultation with the building workshop of the [[Naumburg Master]], together creating unity and harmony. This becomes evident by the designs of the images of the saints that correspond with the founders’ sculptures in many aspects like positions, gestures and weapons. The portrayal of ten [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|bishops of Naumburg]] at the bottom of the window rows creates the impression as if the statues of the founders were standing on the same level as the medals. The glass paintings count among the most significant glass paintings of their style from the [[13th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Naumburger Dom St. Peter and Paul - Ein Kleinod der europäischen Kulturgeschichte.

===== Old Town of Naumburg =====
[[File:Old city of Naumburg.jpg|thumb|Old city of Naumburg]]
Naumburg was a [[Episcopal see|bishop’s seat]] and an important [[Market (place)|market place]] founded at the beginning of the [[11th century]] on the place of the former [[Slavs|Slav]] fortress of [[Wethau]]. The development of the town is closely connected with one of the most powerful and noble Ekkehardine dynasty of that time, [[Emperor Conrad II]] and [[Bishop of Zeitz|Bishop Hildeward of Zeitz]]. 
With the consent of the [[pope John XIX]] and the [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Konrad II]], as well as citing the danger of Slav incursions, [[margrave]] Ekkerhard I relocated the [[Episcopal see|Episcopal See]] of Zeitz to Naumburg. Along with the bishop’s seat he transferred his own family seat from Kleinjena to their own estate at the new castle ″Nuwemburch″ in Naumburg around 1028. Furthermore, he assigned the protection of the See to the ″new castle″, an event hitherto unparalleled in the history of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vereinigte-domstifter.de/en/foundation/the-combined-cathedral-chapters/domstift-naumburg|title=

[[File:Certificate Naumburg.jpg|thumb|left|Certificate Naumburg]]
In 1033, another highly unusual event for this time took place: On the initiative of the bishop Kadeloh of Memleben, Emperor Conrad II granted the merchants of Kleinjena, who moved to Naumburg free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile.&lt;ref name="Reuter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuter|first=Timothy|title=Germany in the Early Middle Ages c.800 – 1056 (Longman History of Germany)|date= 2013|publisher=Lucent Books|isbn=9780582081567|pages=42–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest dated written document from 13 July 1033, that marked the Nuvemburg to the powerful market and merchant settlement in Naumburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urkundenbuch des Hochstifts Naumburg: Teil 1 (967-1207)|trans-title=The book of documents of the Bishopric Naumburg: Part1 |page=26|author=Rosenfeld, Felix|publisher=Magdeburg|date=1925|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Margraves Ekkehard II and Hermann also established two monasteries, the [[Benedictine monastery|Benedictine Monastery]] of St. George and the St Moritz Monastery. When the Ekkehardine dynasty died out by 1046, the bishops became the rulers of the town. By that time, Naumburg had already developed into a political, economic and religious center for the entirety of this border region. The trade routes in the region were relocated to Naumburg, which was strategically situated at the crossing of the [[Via Regia]] and the Regensburg Road.&lt;ref name="Jeep3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia|date=October 2001|publisher=Garland|isbn=9781135575069|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nowadays, the roads as well as parcel structures reflect the structure of the medieval civil town. The earliest stone buildings in Naumburg are situated in the cathedral precincts with the oldest residential tower of Naumburg with two Romanesque floors constructed probably in the mid-12th century at the cathedral precincts.

=== Component: Freyburg ===
[[File:Church of Freyburg.jpg|thumb|Church of Freyburg]]
The old town of Freyburg is situated 9 kilometers north of Naumburg on the left bank of the Unstrut River. This component contains Neuenburg Castle above the river valley.

==== Neuenburg Castle ====
[[File:Neuenburg Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|Neuenburg Chapel]]
Around 1090, it was most probably [[Louis the Springer]]  who built the vast and impressive complex of Neuenburg Castle. Situated in the border region, this fortified castle served military purposes and reflected ambitions, self-confidence and sophistication of the [[Ludovingians|Ludowingians]]. Already in 1100, Neuenburg Castle was the largest and most important fortification in central Germany and remained of outstanding political and military significance until the [[13th century]]. It was designed as a border castle for the powerful Ludowinger dynasty and was part of a network of the landgraves’ castles, which also included [[Wartburg Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die romanische Neuenburg bei Freyburg (Unstrut) und ihre Stellung im hochmittelalterlichen Burgenbau.

[[File:Neuenburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Neuenburg at night]]
Built around 1090, Neuenburg Castle was extended and modernized on a large scale several times. With its 30 000 square meters, the [[castle]] was amongst the strongest architectural representations of military power in all of the empire. It has survived to a remarkable extend: Major sections of the curtain walls in the north and east, part of the gate, the bottom part of the cattle, the castle keep, trenches in the east and in the south are conserved until today. The [[landmark]] big William (Dicker Wilhelm) is situated in the north-eastern part of the complex and visible from far away as a symbol of power. The castle keep III is classified as an independent development next to the French residential towers (donjons) which produced similar examples in the [[Rhineland]] region. Around 1225, a residential tower (residential tower II) was built probably for the landgrave’s family outside the southern curtain wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schloß Neuenburg bei Freyburg/Unstrut.

The court culture of the [[Count palatine|Count Palatine]] at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire at the end of the [[12th century in Germany|12th]] and beginning of the [[13th century]]. The most important poets of the 13th century, namely [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]  and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]  stayed at Neuenburg Castle. Heinrich von Weldecke completed here the [[Eneas]] novel which was the foundation of the [[German language]] secular epic. ″When Veldeke was called to the court of Thuringia [..], he joined the entourage of a great patron and became the esteemed center of the most important literary circle that existed in Germany at the time″.&lt;ref name="Bunke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunke|first=Joachim|title=Courtly Culture: Literature and Society in the High Middle Ages|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520066342|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Neuenburg view.jpg|thumb|left|Neuenburg view]]
The Double Chapel of Neuenburg was developed around 1220 and is one of the best preserved [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque buildings]] of Neuenburg Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkmäler.Band I.

==== Old town of Freyburg ====
[[File:Neuenburg view from Freyburg.jpg|thumb|Neuenburg view from Freyburg]]
In the last quarter of the 12th, [[Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia|Herman I]] from the [[Ludowinger]] dynasty founded the town of Freyburg. The town was built at the food of Neuenburg Castle around a rectangular market place to meet the demands of the increased population, to provide the Neuenburg Castle with merchandise and to secure the passage and revenues of the [[Unstrut|Unstrut River]]. The [[Landgrave of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] controlled the road in the valley by erecting this fortified town. The determinative ″frey″ (free) referred to the royal freedom granted to it when it was founded and to the baronial privilege of a nearly royal rank, which primarily reveals the self-image of its rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Freyburg an der Unstrut – Ein Beispiel landesherrlicher Städtepolitik.

The landgraves were not directly present in the town but resided in Neuenburg Castle. [[Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgrove Ludwig IV]] and his wife, the later Saint [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], built the town parish church of St Mary’s to emphasize the baronial need for representation.&lt;ref name="Heinemeyer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brekle|editor-first=Herbert E.|editor2-last=Dobnig-Jiilich|editor2-first=Edeltraud a.o.|title=New German Biography (NDB)|last=Barrera|first=Magdalena|chapter=Ludwig IV the Saint, Landgrave of Thuringia and Count Palatine of Saxony. |year=1987|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|isbn= 3428001826|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital ornamentation in the entrance area with its diamond-shaped net and the Romanesque sculpting of the compact [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is of outstanding quality in the way of the curves of the bodies and the graphic lines of the figures were sculptured. 
Freyburg’s regular layout is a grid of roads crossing each other in right angles, a distinct transverse axis and its nearly exact subdivision in blocks. After the extinction of the [[Ludovingians|Ludowinger dynasty]] in 1247, the city lost its significance but continued its [[viticulture]] for which it is still known in the [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beziehungen zwischen Kulturlandschaften und Tourismus.

==== Zscheiplitz Monastery ====
[[File:Church in Zscheiplitz.jpg|thumb|Church in Zscheiplitz]]
The [[Benedictine]] convent of nuns, the Zscheiplitz Monastery, was first mentioned in 1203 and is situated two kilometers west of Freyburg. The name of Zscheiplitz has its roots in the Slavic name ″ciplic″ (small). Around 1085, after the murder of [[Friedrich III, Landgraf of Thuringia|landgrave Friedrich III]], his widow Adelheid donated the estate of Zscheiplitz to the church. It was then turned into a Benedictine monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Zscheiplitz. Sühnekirche, Kloster, Rittergut, Dorfkirche, Weingut.

The church of Zscheiplitz was built as a one-nave church in the 12th century and extended by a gallery to the west and in the north during the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zscheiplitz.com/history/|title=Official Website of the Zscheiplitz Monastery|publisher=zscheiplitz monastery|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vineyard of Schweigenberg ====
The [[vineyard]] of Schweigenberg is located west of Freyburg and was probably created by citizens of Freyburg upon the initiative of the [[List of rulers of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] and / or the monasteries of Goseck and Zscheiplitz in the 13th century. It benefitted from favorable climatic conditions and agrarian innovations for a diversified subsistence economy in the region. This vineyard is still recognized in Germany as a prime example of [[Wine-growing in Germany|terraced winegrowing]] by way of hoe-farming as a monument of this traditional form of cultivation.

=== Component: Pforta ===
[[File:Pforta from air.jpg|thumb|left|Pforta from air]]
The [[Pforta|monastery of Pforta]]  was created by the [[Cistercian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kloster-pforta.de/#/#4/|title=Official Website of Pforta Monastery|publisher=Pforta monastery|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premises include functional buildings, the Romanesque House ([[Monastic grange|grange]]), the Kleine Saale [[canal]], as well as the vineyards of Köppelberg and Saalhäuser. The ensemble of Cistercian monuments attests to the order’s life and work and embodies the significant influence exerted in the wider [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]] and beyond the boundaries of the region.

==== History ====
[[File:Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|Monastery Pforta]]
Pforta Monastery was founded around 1132 on the initiative of [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|bishop Udo I of Naumburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Sankt Marien zur Pforte.''In: Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V.:''Macht.Glaube.Glanz: Auf dem Weg zum Welterbe.|trans-title= The Cistercian monastery Sankt Marien to Pforta.

Gesammelte Beiträge 1977 – 1999 zur Geschichte der Zisterzienser und der ″Germania Slavica″.|trans-title=Economy and cultural landscape.

The name of Porta, meaning Porta Coeli – i.e. Pearly Gates – , refers to the architecture of the richly ornamented western façade of the minster with its Roman triumphal arch portal and a gallery underneath the crucifixion group that did not at all correspond to the strict stipulations of the order.

==== Architecture ====
[[File:Facade of Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of Monastery Pforta]]
The [[minster (church)|minster]] was built in the 1130s in the plain character of the [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercians monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Jeep"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Germany. An Encyclopedia.|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203801765|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1251, the Cistercians decided on an ambitious building project. Even though the new church building with its west façade was still ascetic in the interior decor, it clearly reflected the significant economic and political power of the monastery. The Gothic [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the minster is the architectural example of the regional [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] reception with French roots, transferring the latest shapes and forms inspired by French Gothic design and adapting them to local conditions. The glass paintings of the church, including in Europe’s oldest Cistercian tracery rose window preserved almost completely together with its glazing, are an extraordinary treasure of medieval paintings.
[[File:Chapel of Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|Chapel of Monastery Pforta]]
The so-called Abbot’s Chapel (Abtskapelle) is considered to be an outstanding architectural example of the medieval infirmaries and nursing wards of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]]. Before its conversion into an [[abbot]]’s home, it had been part of the infirmary wing, allowing people to participate in the mass from there. Rare elements were found in the structure such as the latrine and the chamber of the [[Hospital|infirmary]].

==== Hydraulic system ====
In 1180, the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] created the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] mill race called ″Kleine Saale″ (Little Saale), a [[canal]] of 10 kilometers length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Kulturlandschaft um Schulpforta.

The Benedictine monks of St George, the canons of St Moritz in Naumburg, and the Naumburg cathedral chapter participated in the costs and maintenance of the Kleine Saale in return for rights of utilization. Maintenance work was managed by a water expert from Pforta Monastery and the highest-ranking fisherman from the Naumburg. The Kleine Saale shows the Cistercian [[hydraulic engineering]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Wirtschaftstätigkeit der Zisterzienser im Mittelalter, Agrarwirtschaft.''In:'' Wirtschaft und Kulturlandschaft.|pages=84–112|trans-title=The economy of the Cisterciansin the Middle-Ages.

==== Grange ====
The Romanesque House is an impressive piece of evidence of a former [[Monastic grange|grange]] of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], Naumburg, [[Jena]] and [[Erfurt]]. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As a result of its aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the [[Margravate of Meissen|margraviates of Meissen]] and [[Lower Lusatia]] – and thus to [[Silesia]] – without being charged [[tax]]es or dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Pforte: die Urkundenfälschungen und die frühe Geschichte bis 1236.|trans-title=The Cistercian monastery Pforta: Document fraud and early history until 1236.|author=Kunde, Holger|publisher=Böhlau Verlag|date=2003|language=German.|isbn=9783412146016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winemaking ====
The Cistercian monks set about profitably using the land they had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and versatile way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting of vines on the slopes of the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of [[orchard]]s, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe-making, the setting-up of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, grain growing, timber rafting and fishing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the Köppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep [[Vineyard|slope vineyards]] between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad Kösen and Roßbach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in wine making, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (country wine, around 1340).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Zisterzienser und ihre Weinberge in Brandenburg.Studien zur Geschichte, Kunst und Kultur der Zisterzienser.|trans-title=The Cistercians and their vineyards in Brandenburg.

== History ==
[[File:Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut.jpg|thumb|Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut]]
The area provided moderate climate, fertile soils, rich water sources and wood supply through forests and was populated by [[Stone Age]] hunters 380 000 years ago . From the [[Neolithic Age]]  onwards throughout all [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], the area was settled.&lt;ref name="Bogucki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogucki|first=Peter|title=Forest Farmers and Stockherders.

=== The Early Middle Ages ===
[[File:Ebersorda.jpg|thumb|Ebersorda]]
The [[Migration Period]]  brought decisive changes from 375 AD onwards and also had an influence on the [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]]. The local population, consisting of migrating [[Germanic peoples|Germanic Varini]] and Angles, merged to form the [[Thuringians]]. Following the defeat of the Thuringian army by Frankish troops in 531, the [[Merovingians]] as Frankish rulers settled groups of [[Frisians]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and probably also [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessians]] to the south and north of the Unstrut in exchange for payment of [[Lay Tithes|tithes]].&lt;ref name="Steuer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Fries-Knoblach|editor-first=Janine|editor2-last=Steuer|editor2-first=Heiko|title=The Baiuvarii and Thuring|last=Steuer|first=Heiko|chapter=Thuringians and Bavarians – Location in Space and Time and Social Relations|year=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn= 9781843839156|pages=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dumminger"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wood|editor-first=Ian|title=Franks and Alamanni in the Merovingian Period: An Ethnographic Perspective|last=Dumminger|first=Areas F.|chapter=Dwellings, settlements and settlement patterns of the sixth and seventh centuries in southwest Germany and adjacent areas.|year=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn= 9781843830351|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These settlers were met by [[Sorbs (tribe)|Slav Sorb tribes]] originating from the region of the [[Dnieper]], who came westward as far as the [[Saale|River Saale]], crossed it repeatedly and beginning to settle on its western banks. The [[Sorbs]]  had more than 50 civitates, meaning central strongholds with relating settlements. Such a fortified district or “Gau” developed on the site of today’s town of Naumburg and was called “Wethau”; the centre was a Sorb castle complex in Wettaburg (now an urban district of Naumburg) .
The region by the Saale and Unstrut rivers had thus become a sensitive border area because it marked the border between the peoples of Germanic and [[Slavs|Slav]] origin and also the north-eastern border of [[Christianity]] in continental [[Europe]].
&lt;ref name="Stone2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Gerald|title=The smallest slavonic nation.

A sourcebook.|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781441106261|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 766, a successful Frankish attack was launched against Wettaburg Castle, that was the headquarters of the [[Sorbs]] in the Saale-Unstrut region. The [[Frankish empire|Frankish Empire]] was at its largest during the reign of [[Pepin the Short|Pippin]]’s son [[Charlemagne]] (768 – 814).
&lt;ref name="Reuther"&gt;{{cite book|last=Story|first=Johanna|title=Charlemagne: Empire and Society.|date=2005|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719070891|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a very bloody war lasting almost thirty years (772 – 804), the pagan [[Saxons]] were conquered and their territory was fully integrated into the [[Frankish empire|Frankish Empire]]. As elsewhere, Christianization ran parallel to military subjugation in the Saxon area.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard A.|title=The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity.|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Saale]] remained the lasting natural border with the Slavic territories. In conjunction with the hinterland, the Saale was protected from possible attacks from the east by a chain of closely neighboring strongholds and fortifications,including the ″[[Limes Sorabicus]]″. &lt;br /&gt;
The territory of the [[Frankish Empire]] extended in the first quarter of the [[9th century]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the Elbe and Saale in the east, from the [[North Sea]] in the north to [[Central Italy]] in the south.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Michael E.|title=A Sacred Kingdom: Bishops and the Rise of Frankish Kingship|date=2011|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|isbn=9780813218779|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus most of Christian Europe was united in [[Charlemagne]]’s hands.  However, Charlemagne’s successors were not able to maintain Imperial unity.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Charlemagne.|date=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780333650554|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 919, Heinrich, the duke of Saxony, also known as [[Henry the Fowler]], became king of the Franks and the Saxons. As a result, the Saale-Unstrut region moved from a peripheral position in the Frankish empire to the focus of political interest. Heinrich expanded his power along the eastern border of the Empire by conquering the Slav tribes (928/929) and defeating the [[Hungarians]] by the Unstrut in 933.&lt;ref name="Emmerson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmerson|first=Richard K.|title=Key Figures in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedi.|date=2013|publisher=Routeledge|isbn=9780415973854|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Heinrich I’s expansion policy and the conquest of the Slav tribes, the character of the area east of the Saale and Unstrut changed from a direct border area to a connecting region between the old settlement land to the west and the newly conquered regions by the Elbe.&lt;ref name="Leyser"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leyser|first=Karl|title=Medieval Germany and its Neighbours, 900-1250.|date=1982|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
With the consent of the Pope and the German Imperial bishops, the Emperor arranged for [[diocese]]s and bishop’s churches to be established in [[Merseburg Cathedral|Merseburg]], [[Zeitz]] and [[Meissen]] in 968, forming a new church province for the eastern part of the Empire within the equally newly founded [[archbishopric of Magdeburg]].

==== The High Middle Ages ====
[[File:Schleberoda.jpg|thumb|Schleberoda]]
From the [[10th century]] onwards, the Ekkehardine dynasty gained influence in the Empire. Contemporaneous Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] described the first prominent representative of this house, [[Ekkehard I]], as a person with an outstanding lack of humility ″He was an ornament to the Empire, a treasure of the land, a hope for his subjects and a terror to his enemies and he would have been completely perfect if he had only been able to remain humble″.&lt;ref name="Merseburg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Merseburg|first=Thietmar of|title=Chronicles V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the murder of the margrave Ekkehard I on 30 April 1002, Ekkehard’s sons, Margrave Hermann (1009 – 1038) and [[Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen|Margrave Ekkehard II]] (1009 – 1046), assumed power in 1009. They became the most powerful rulers in the eastern part of the Empire and moved their family seat from Kleinjena to the ″Neue Burg″ (New Castle, Naumburg). The rise of Naumburg as ecclesiastical, political, cultural and economic centre of the Saale-Unstrut region had begun.&lt;ref name="Bagge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagge|first=Sverre|title=Kings, Politics, and the Right Order of the World in German Historiography: C. 950-1150.|date=2002|publisher=Brill|isbn=9780415973854|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it has to be emphasized that Sorb ″Smurds″ and German residents lived largely peacefully alongside each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Slaven und Deutsche.

The [[bishops of Naumburg]], the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] and the [[margraves of Meissen]] as lords of the town of Naumburg promoted a systematic development of the city into the most important town in the Saale-Unstrut region. In March 1131, Bishop Udo I met the Cistercian abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] at the Imperial Diet in Liège in March 1131, a meeting of central significance for the propagation of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian order]] in the Empire. As a result, a delegation of monks from the Walkenried Cistercian monastery moved to a location next to Naumburg in 1137/1138. The founding of the Cistercian Pforta Monastery contributed to the propagation of the Order on to Eastern Europe. One of the greatest achievements of Pforta Monastery was furthermore the settlement of peasants in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Mittelalter.|trans-title=Middle Ages. |author=Müller, Harald|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co|date=2008|language=German|isbn=9783050043661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called ″Landesausbau″ in the High Middle Ages was supplemented by military protection of the positions already achieved.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Due to increase of population, new public assignments of protection and administration for the diocese of Naumburg led to crucial changes in social structure. The prestige attained by the Naumburg bishop’s seat is expressed by the construction of a new cathedral around 1210 during the period of office of Bishop Engelhard (1206 – 1242).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
For the Saale-Unstrut region, the Ludowingers were, together with the Wettin dynasty, the most influential aristocratic dynasty during the 12th and the 13th century. The Ludowingers created a princely court culture modeled to equal royal forms. The magnificent court of Count Palatine Hermann of Saxony (1181 – 1217) at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Im Schatten der Landgrafen: Studien zur adeligen Herrschaftsbildung im hochmittelalterlichen Thüringen.|trans-title=In the shadow of the margraves.

The [[Wettin, Saxony-Anhalt|Wettins]], with Margrave Heinrich the Illustrious (1221 – 1288), were appointed as margraves to the east of the Saale. They were able to expand their territories and achieved political dominance in the whole Central German region during the [[13th century in Germany|13th century]], creating most favorable conditions for their homelands in the Saale-Unstrut region. The cooperation of the Cistercians with the Wettin and [[Ludovingians|Ludowinger]] dynasties contributed to the transfer of spiritual, cultural and technological knowledge into the areas intended for colonization. Nevertheless, the economic emphasis moved gradually towards the east during the [[Late Middle Ages]], when the importance of the relatively young [[Leipzig|town of Leipzig]] outdid that of the old trade fair town of Naumburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Bedeutung der Zisterzienser für die Ostsiedlung, besonders in Ostschlesien.|trans-title=The importance of the Cistercians for the Eastern Settlement|page=68|author=Gottschalck, Joseph|publisher=Zeitschrift für Ostforschung|date=1966|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From the late Middle Ages to the Present ===
Following the [[Reformation]] instigated by [[Martin Luther]](1485 – 1546) in nearby [[Wittenberg]], the Wettins and the region’s nobility turned to [[Protestantism]], promoting and funding the reformers. As a result of the alliance of Protestant rulers and spiritual leaders, the monasteries and religious establishments in Naumburg, Goseck, Zscheiplitz and Pforta were closed between 1533 and 1540 and their endowments and properties confiscated. Only the property rights held by the Naumburg Cathedral chapter remained untouched.&lt;ref name="Ocker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ocker|first=Christopher|title=Church Robbers and Reformers in Germany, 1525-1547: Confiscation and Religious Purpose in the Holy Roman Empire.|date=2006|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=9789004152069|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

From the [[18th century]] on, the castles along the Saale and Unstrut amidst their cultural landscape became prime subjects of [[Romanticism|romantic]] admiration. As a result of the [[First Congress of Vienna|Congress of Vienna]], the [[kingdom of Saxony]] was forced to cede territories to the Prussian king in 1815. The landscape by the [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]] now became part of the [[Prussian state]] until the end of the [[Second World War]]. Unlike many other regions, no drastic changes due to [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] altered this landscape.
It was due to Walter Hege’s photographs published in 1925, that the founder figure of [[Uta of Schauenburg|Uta]] became enormously popular but was exploited during the [[National Socialists]]’ regime. The regime turned Neuenburg Castle into a training centre for senior leaders of the German Girls’ Association (BDM) and the school at Pforta Monastery into a National Political Education Centre (NAPOLA) until the end of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Forschungen zum Kloster Schulpforta: Ergebnisse eines Arbeitsprojektes im Rahmen des Graduiertenkollegs "Kunstwissenschaft-Bauforschung-Denkmalpflege" der Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg und der Technischen Universität Berlin.|trans-title=Research on Monastery Pforta: Results of a working project and the Technical University Berlin. |author=Hubel, Achim; Cramer, Johannes|publisher=Janos Stekovics|date=2003|language=German|isbn=9783899230253}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The Saale-Unstrut region was spared destruction during the [[Second World War]]. The liberation by American troops in the spring of 1945 was followed in the summer of the same year by hand-over of the area to the [[Red Army]] and the Saale-Unstrut region thus became part of [[East Germany]] (GDR). There was no attempt in the Saale-Unstrut area to demolish old town quarters. After the [[Reunification of Germany|reunification of the two German states]] in 1990 the well-preserved cultural landscape of the Saale-Unstrut region became part of the [[Saxony-Anhalt|Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt]].

'''Országos Középiskolai Tanulmányi Verseny''' ('''OKTV''') in [[Hungary|Hungarian]] (rough translation: "National Secondary School Academic Competition"), is the most famous high leveled competition of Hungary (after qualification for Olympiads), whose winners usually are selected for ISOs, and they often receive gold medals or become Over All Winners. Students 15–18 years old (grades 9-12) complete in various subjects, such as natural sciences, IT, mathematics, history, philosophy, Hungarian literature and foreign languages. The top competitors have a significant advantage when they are applying for Hungarian universities. Usually, the ten best students are awarded exemption, but the number of awardees is determined for each subject at the beginning of each school year by the Ministry of Education.

The competition requirements are increasingly higher than IB's or Hungarian matura's, because the solution of these tasks need not only eminent knowledge of facts, but also creativity.

Students in 10th or 11th grade who were granted exemption from taking entrance exams were eligible for a scholarship in one of the [[United World Colleges]]. However, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, these scholarships are open for other applicants, the grade requirements remaining the same.

'''Otto Frederick Hunziker''' (25 December 1873 – 16 November 1959) was a pioneer in the American and international [[dairy]] industry, as both an educator and a technical innovator.  Hunziker was born and raised in Switzerland, emigrated to the U.S., and studied at [[Cornell University]].  He started and developed the dairy program at [[Purdue University]] when such programs were at their infancy.  At this same time, Hunziker was heavily involved with the development of the [[American Dairy Science Association]] (ADSA) and the standardization and improvement of many dairy tests and processes.  Hunziker wrote several of the leading dairy processing texts, which continue to be cited.  After leaving Purdue University, Hunziker managed research and operations at a large, national condensary, continued to drive ADSA's standardization and publishing efforts, represented the U.S. at international dairy congresses, and facilitated dairy industry improvements across the globe.

==Early years==
Otto Frederick Hunziker was born in [[Zürich]], Switzerland, on 25&amp;nbsp;December 1873 to [[Karl Otto Hunziker|Karl Otto]] and Luise (Pupikofer) Hunziker.&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(54)91238-2 | title = People and Events in the Dairy Science World | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–108 | publisher = American Dairy Science Association | url = http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/37/1/107.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-23 | year = 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(56)91183-3 | title = The Remaining Charter Members of A.D.S.A. | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 621 | publisher = American Dairy Science Association | url = http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/39/6/621.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-23 | year = 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Otto Frederick Hunziker Memorial | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 3–4 | publisher = American Dairy Science Association | url = http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/43/4/3.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-23 | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(60)90184-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Otto's siblings were Karl Rudolf (born 5 February 1870, Zürich), Barbara Luise (17&amp;nbsp;June 1871&amp;nbsp;– 16&amp;nbsp;October 1871), and Marie Julie (23&amp;nbsp;July 1872&amp;nbsp;– 30&amp;nbsp;June 1938).  Hunziker spent many early years in [[Goldbach, Zurich|Goldbach]], Switzerland, where his father was a pastor, professor, and member of the canton parliament.&lt;ref name="matrikel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/pages/597.htm#2247 |title= Matrikeledition der Universität Zürich |accessdate= 2008-05-28 |publisher= Universität Zürich |date= 2007-11-07 |language= German |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707004720/http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/pages/597.htm#2247 |archivedate= 2011-07-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Otto attended the two-year course of studies at Strickhof Agricultural College in Zürich, graduating at age 19.  In 1893, Otto Frederick Hunziker [[Emigration|emigrated]] to the United States.&lt;ref name="mastermind"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fitch | first = J. B. |editor1-first= E.

During this time period, significant new development in dairy processing technology was occurring on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.  In 1890, [[Stephen Babcock]] published specifications for the [[Babcock test]] for milk fat content.  In 1892, Dr. [[Niklaus Gerber]] acquired a Swiss [[patent]] on the [[Gerber method]] for analyzing fat content in milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerber-instruments.ch/en/geschichte.htm |title=Gerber Instruments History |accessdate=2008-08-28 |publisher=Gerber Instruments AG |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314152713/http://www.gerber-instruments.ch/en/geschichte.htm |archivedate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Gerber was based in Zürich, had studied at the [[University of Zurich|University of Zürich]], and worked for two years at the Swiss-American Milk Company in [[Little Falls (town), New York|Little Falls, New York]].  Hunziker would spend a substantial amount of time studying and improving these analytic methods.

In the United States, Hunziker worked for two years as a laborer on a dairy farm near [[Attleboro, Massachusetts]].  To improve his English and commercial skills, he studied at [[Bryant &amp; Stratton College|Bryant and Stratton]] Business College (now [[Bryant University]]), [[Providence, Rhode Island]] in 1896.  He returned to Switzerland briefly in 1898 before returning to receive a [[B.S.]] Agriculture in 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Bachelors of the Science of Agriculture | newspaper = Cornell Alumni News Vol. 02, No. 36 | pages = 248 | date = 1900-06-23 | url = http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3164/36/002_36.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Master of Science|M.S.A.]] in 1901 from Cornell University.&lt;ref name="memorial" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Liberty Hyde |authorlink=Liberty_Hyde_Bailey |title=A Register of the Rural Leadership in the United States and Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLgaAAAAMAAJ |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-29 |date=September 1920 |location=Ithaca, New York |oclc=7696533 |pages=234–235 |quote=Hunziker, Otto Frederick, manag. manufacturing dept. and dir. research lab., Blue Valley Creamery Co., Chicago, Ill.

Hunziker, dairy science and technology evolved at Purdue University.  In 1905 Purdue experienced a sharp growth in its agricultural programs.  Hunziker seized upon the opportunities to serve this growing agricultural sector.  He identified needs for developing educational programs to better educate dairymen and needs for instituting adequate dairy laws for the protection of the dairy industry.  His scientific treatises dealt with the solution of problems on dairy farms and in dairy plants.  His research established accuracy of glassware and provided standard methods for the Babcock fat test of milk and cream.  He planned Smith Hall and adjacent creamery which was built in 1913.  A champion for the dairy industry, he won recognition in the fields of butter making, condensed milk and dried milk.  He incorporated scientific principles into every step of the butter-making process.  His textbooks were used by agricultural universities in dairy courses throughout the United States and in other dairy countries.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074129/http://www.adsa.org/centennial/posters/17684_purdue.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-27|df=}} From the abstract: "During the organizational year of the American Dairy Science Association, Otto F. Hunziker led the dairy program at Purdue University.  A charter member of ADSA and its third president, Dr. Hunziker's brilliant career as a scientist, teacher and author is recognized throughout the world.  At Purdue he provided leadership in developing educational programs to better educate dairymen.  His research programs established the accuracy of glassware and provided standard methods for the Babcock fat test of milk and cream.  He planned Smith Hall, which was built in 1913 to provide facilities for teaching, research and extension work."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1906 Purdue yearbook (the ''Debris'' Vol 18) lists: "Otto Fred Hunziker, Instructor in Dairying; B.S.A., Cornell University, 1900; M.S.A., 1901; Sigma Xi".{{cite book |title=Debris |url=http://earchives.lib.purdue.edu/u?/debris,9107 |format=JP2 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |volume=18 |year=1906 |publisher=Purdue University |location=West Lafayette, Indiana |pages=54}}  The only other "dairying" faculty listed is one Hubert Everett Van Norman who is listed as "Resigned".  The 1907 ''Debris'' indicates Hunziker was promoted to associate professor; the only other "dairying" faculty is one John deMoss Jarvis, assistant in dairying.  The following year, Hunziker is listed as a full professor.  In 1910, Hunziker's position is listed as professor of dairy husbandry and as a member of the Official Dairy Instructors' Association (ODIA).  John deMoss Jarvis remains the only other dairy faculty, but became an instructor in 1909.  In the 1911–1914 yearbooks, Hunziker is listed as president of ODIA as well as a member of the Indiana Academy of Science, Indiana State Dairy Association, and Indiana Jersey Cattle Club.  The 1911 ''Debris'' also lists two dairy instructors and one assistant.  In the new "Experiment Station" section, Hunziker is listed "Chief of Dairy Husbandry".  The 1914 ''Debris'' lists Alpha Zeta and the Purdue Dairy Club for the first time; apart from Hunziker, two associates and an assistant are listed as faculty members of the dairy club.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1906, Hunziker was among 18 teachers and investigators meeting at the University of Illinois, Urbana, to found what was then known as National Association of Dairy Instructors and Investigators.

For many years he was the dedicated member of the Journal Management Committee, nurturing the newly founded journal as if it were his very own.  As an administrator, author, and researcher, his presence at a meeting assured its success.  There was authority in his deliberate, well-chosen words.  He represented the dairy manufacturers of America five times at the world's dairy congresses—London, 1928; Copenhagen, 1931; Berlin, 1937; Stockholm, 1949; den Hague, 1953—a record that stood for many years.  For his sustained enthusiasm for the American Dairy Science Association at home or abroad, he might well have been named 'Mr. ADSA'.

==Professional life==
[[File:OF Hunziker.jpg|left|thumb|O. F. Hunziker]]Hunziker wrote dairy articles and textbooks used throughout the world, developed dairy curricula, advocated for dairy laws, and developed standard testing methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Condensed Milk Standards |format=PDF |newspaper=The Ranch |publisher= |location=Seattle |date=15 Aug 1908 |page=10 |quote=During the past few months, Prof. O. F. Hunziker, of the Dairy Department of the Purdue School of Agriculture has been investigating the national and state standards of condensed milk. As a result of his study of the subject, he finds the present standards are not practical, as no milk condensary can, under all conditions and at all seasons of the year, put into its product the per cent of solids called for in the requirements for unsweetened condensed milk. These findings are the outcome of Prof. Hunziker's professional and business experiences, and therefore have great weight. Reports from every reputable milk condensing company in the country have been thoroughly examined and careful experiments carried on by Professor Hunziker in Indiana at the plant of the Condensed Milk Company of Sheridan before any announcement as to this unsatisfactory standard was made. The question of revising the present standard for condensed milk was taken up by the committee on food standards of the National Association of Dairy Instructors and Investigators, at its meeting at Mackinac Island, Mich., Aug. 4-7, and it is hoped that every effort will be put forth, through the proper channels, to induce the government to modify the standard now in use. This standard calls for not less than 28 per cent of milk solids of which not less than 27.5 per cent must be fat. There is no doubt but that a more specific attainable requirement than this will be welcomed by both producer and consumer. Pacific Coast milk producers are especially interested in this question, and a government expert has given it a thorough investigation. |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn98047754/1908-08-15/ed-1/seq-10.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21827319 |title=Visit of Professor Hunziker |department=DAIRY PRODUCTS. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=16 May 1927 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia |quote=His visit is looked forward to by those interested in dairying with very much interest as the professor is the recognised leading dairy scientist of to-day, and his text books are read and used by all those engaged in the manufacture of dairy products throughout the world, and the knowledge that he has been able to impart has been responsible for many of the improvement in the quality of those products.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Hunziker authored ''The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory'', a well-known text in the industry that enjoyed at least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.toronto.ca/health/tfpc_regulatory.pdf | title= The Canadian Regulatory Process for Evaluating Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone in the Dairy Industry: A Critical Review | accessdate= 2008-05-23 | author= Toronto Food Policy Council | date= September 2000 | format= PDF | publisher= The City of [[Toronto]] | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074123/http://www.toronto.ca/health/tfpc_regulatory.pdf | archivedate= 2009-03-27 | df=  }} ''The Butter Industry'' (or its author) was "recognized by the Ontario Department of Agriculture as an expert on butter quality".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20908493 |title=FOR THE MAN ON THE LAND. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |location=Qld, Australia |date=30 January 1925 |accessdate=3 April 2012 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}The [[Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock]] officially recommended ''The Butter Industry'' with only 4 other texts for those studying to test dairy products.&lt;/ref&gt;  A book that Hunziker originally self-published in 1914, "Condensed Milk and Milk Powder: Prepared for the Use of Milk Condenseries, Dairy Students and Pure Food Departments", was republished in a seventh edition in October 2007 by Cartwright Press.

[[File:Städtische Realschule an der Blutenburg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Realschule'' an der Blutenburg, Germany]]
'''''Realschule''''' ({{IPA-de|ʁeˈaːlʃuːlə|lang}}) is a type of [[secondary school]] in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. It has also existed in [[Croatia]] (''realna gimnazija''), [[Austrian Empire]], [[German Empire]], [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] (''realskole''), [[Sweden]] (''realskola''), [[Hungary]] (''reáliskola''), [[Slovenia]] (''realka'') and in the [[Russian Empire]] (реальное училище).

==Germany==

===History===

For [[Johann Joachim Becher]], education also had a mandate to support the replacement of [[the Holy Roman Empire]] with a more [[republic]]an [[commonwealth]]. His school would have had the task of creating education and teaching an organized state structure. His ideal was the artisan, the educated scholar, the universal scientist.

===Situation of the school===
In the German [[secondary school]] system, ''Realschule'' is ranked between [[Hauptschule]] (lowest) and [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (highest). After completing the ''Realschule'', good students are allowed to attend a professional Gymnasium or a general-education Gymnasium. They can also attend a ''Berufsschule'' or do an [[apprenticeship]].

In most states of Germany, students start the ''Realschule'' at the age of ten or eleven and typically finish school at the age of 16–17. In some states, ''Realschulen'' have recently been replaced by ''[[Oberschule]]n'' or ''[[Sekundarschule]]n''.
In 2006 1.32 million German students attended a ''Realschule''.

At ''Realschule'', a student gets an extended education and learns at least one foreign language, usually [[English language|English]]. In the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], after the sixth grade, the student has to choose among [[technology]], [[home economics]], and a second foreign language, usually [[French language|French]]. The new subject becomes the student's fifth main subject, after German, maths, science and English; and it is also possible to learn other foreign languages in free workshops.
Other subjects are [[geography]], [[social sciences]], [[economics]], [[history]], religious education, and physical education. After the 8th grade a student has to choose between [[arts]] and [[music]].

High school diplomas obtained in [[Canada]] or the [[United States]] are usually acknowledged as a ''[[Mittlere Reife]]'' (graduation from a ''Realschule'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719070047/http://www.nymphenburger-schulen.de/project/pdf/ausland/laender_usa.pdf USA] at nymphenburger-schulen.de&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases however students may apply for certain subjects at a university. All students holding an American high school diploma may apply for the ''[[Studienkolleg]]'', and after successfully graduating from this they may attend a German university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-cgi.uni-regensburg.de/Einrichtungen/Auslandsamt/neu1/ew-cms/html/dokumente/USA-Info.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005347/http://www-cgi.uni-regensburg.de/Einrichtungen/Auslandsamt/neu1/ew-cms/html/dokumente/USA-Info.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those holding a high school diploma can choose from a wider range of possible major subjects at a German university if they did well on the [[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)|ACT]]. Those who scored higher than 1300 on the SAT or higher than 28 on the ACT may apply for any subject at a German university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nymphenburger-schulen.de/project/pdf/ausland/laender_usa.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gymnasia and Realgymnasia|Gymnasia and ''Realgymnasia'']] are the classical higher or secondary schools of [[Germany]].

===Abolition of the ''Realschule'' in Berlin and Hamburg===

Starting in 2010/2011, ''Realschulen'' were formally abolished in [[Berlin]] and merged with ''[[Hauptschule]]n'' and the old ''[[Gesamtschule]]n'' to form a new type of comprehensive school, called ''Stadtteilschule'' in Hamburg and ''Sekundarschule'' in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Education in Berlin]], [[Education in Hamburg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance of students attending the ''Realschule'' ===

According to the PISA examination the students attending a ''Realschule'' were outperformed by those attending a Gymnasium. However, they did better than those attending a ''Hauptschule'' or a Gesamtschule school.

===Criticism: class-ism===
The German tripartite system of education has been widely criticized for separating children along class lines at a very early age. For instance, in some German states, a decision is made in the sixth or even the fourth grade about whether a child is to continue in the Gymnasium, the ''Realschule'', or the ''Hauptschule''. Only the Gymnasium is a [[university-preparatory school]], so critics argue essentially a decision is made as early as the fourth grade about whether a child will be allowed to attend college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/ifoHome/B-politik/05stp/_stp?item_link=stp073.htm |title=CESifo Group Munich - Home |publisher=Cesifo-group.de |access-date=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The system is considered so onerous outside Germany that the [[OECD]] even sent a special envoy&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Vernor Muñoz]]&lt;/ref&gt; to Germany to condemn current German practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/Germany/Forums/Education/German-school-system-reflects-nineteenth-century |title=German school system reflects nineteenth century |publisher=Justlanded.com |date=2007-06-19 |access-date=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Brazilian expert found that German schools basically separate children according to [[social class]], with children of academics and professionals more often being sent on to a Gymnasium, and working-class children being sent to a ''Realschule'' or a ''Hauptschule''.

According to critics, the system is widely considered within Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Chancengleichheit-dreigliedrigen-Schulsystem-Benachteiligung-schulischer/dp/3640223802 |title=Chancengleichheit im dreigliedrigen Schulsystem?: Soziale Benachteiligung auf Grund schulischer Selektion am Beispiel Hauptschule: Amazon.de: Luisa Liebold: Bücher |publisher=Amazon.de |date= |access-date=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be socially useful in the sense that the upper class is able to reserve the best schools for itself without having to resort to private schools. Finally, no democratic society outside the German-speaking world has tripartite school systems that separate children largely according to background; indeed, this finding was the main complaint about Germany in the recent PISA study.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Auswertung der PISA-Studien: Einfluss des sozialen Hintergrunds#Ergebnisse Deutschland-spezifischer Auswertungen]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the tripartite system consider the arguments brought forward by the critics to be invalid. They point to the fact that not only Gymnasium, but also comprehensive schools and schools serving mature students such as the ''[[Kolleg]]'' or the ''[[Berufsoberschule]]'' offer the possibility for the ''Abitur''. Also it is possible to attend college without holding the ''Abitur''. They also hold the opinion that state-funded ''Realschulen'' and Gymnasiums&lt;!---disagrees with Latin plural. This is common in English however--&gt; offered many working-class children the possibility to move up the social ladder. Also, proponents of the tripartite system fear the abolishing Gymnasia and ''Realschulen'' will lead to the growth of a private school sector.

Proponents of the ''Realschule'' also hold the opinion that it aids students' personality development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vo-saar.de/dokumente/Umgang%20mit%20Heterogenitaet.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study those attending a ''Realschule'' became more altruistic and more likely to care for others over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elternverein-nrw.de/stellungnahmen/gesamtschule_ungeschminkt.htm |title=Elternverein Nordrhein-Westfalen e. V. - Gesamtschule ungeschminkt - Alarm! |publisher=Elternverein-nrw.de |date= |access-date=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Erweiterte Realschule" and "Realschule Plus"===

The "Erweiterte Realschule" (expanded ''Realschule'') is a school that exists in the German State of the [[Saarland]]. It is not to be confused with the ''Realschule''. While the ''Realschule'' is a [[selective school]], the ''Erweiterte Realschule'' is a school that does not select its students on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude. It streams students by perceived ability after 7th grade. The "''Realschule Plus''" is a non-selective school that exists in the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It offers general education classes (that resemble normal ''Realschule'' classes) as well as remedial classes.
The ''Erweiterte Realschule'' and the ''Realschule Plus'' are not the school of first choice for many students and often are attended by students who have been turned down by or have been expelled from other schools.

==Norway==
The ''realskole'' existed in [[Norway]] between 1935 and 1970. It replaced the former ''middelskole'', and was the level between ''folkeskole'' (primary school) and [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The majority historically left school after ''folkeskole'', and the ''realskole'' was meant as preparation for the ''gymnasium'', itself a preparation for university studies. Only a small minority attended ''gymnasium'' in those times.

Within theories of education, '''retroactive learning'''&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. Nuxoll: Enhancing Intelligent Agents with Episodic Memory. Dissertation, 2007. http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/57720/2/anuxoll_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a delay in understanding an experience, or review of learning experiences when resources become available.

Often, it is not possible to learn while an event is occurring because the [[Intelligent agent|agent]] lacks the specific information or resources that it needs to learn. For example, an agent in a realtime environment may not have time to apply an [[iterative learning]] algorithm while it is performing a task. However, when a resource like time becomes available, the agent can replay the events and learn from them. [[Episodic memory]] allows previous experiences to be relived or rehearsed once resources are available so it can be reanalyzed with new knowledge or additional experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3878">'''SilverPlatter Information, Inc.''' was one of the first companies to produce commercial reference databases on [[CD-ROM]]s. It was founded in 1983 in the United Kingdom by [[Béla Hatvany]] and Walt Winshall with the explicit intention of using [[CD]] technology to publish data, and thus provide an alternative to searching databases in [[magnetic tape]] format. Ron Rietdyk was the company's first President. The firm was started in 1986 from a small building in Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts.

The company began experimenting with four databases: [[ERIC]], LISA, [[PsycLIT]], and [[EMBASE]]. In 1987 the company had 12 databases and revenues of approximately $6m. Competing with CD Plus (now [[Ovid Technologies]]), Aries, [[Cambridge Scientific Abstracts]] and [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]], the company offered libraries a wide range of CD-ROMs. Over the next few year the company expanded from its academic base into medical, business and health and safety CD publishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/SilverPlatter-Information-Inc-Company-History.html] SilverPlatter company history from ''International Directory of Company Histories''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the firm launched MultiPlatter, a system for networking CD-ROMs across [[local area network]]. In 1991, it introduced searching the data held at the company's site by ERL (the [[Electronic Reference Library|electronic reference library]]), a system for providing hard disk access to its databases via the DXP protocol. This last proved successful with more than 500 sites using the firm's technology by 1997. In that year the company had grown to $75m in revenues and had over 250 databases.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2001, SilverPlatter was sold to [[Wolters Kluwer]] at a reputed price of $113m, and now forms part of [[Ovid Technologies]], the [[Wolters Kluwer]] subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/NewsBreaks/Wolters-Kluwer-Adds-SilverPlatter-Information-to-Its-Collection-17613.asp|title=Wolters Kluwer Adds SilverPlatter Information to Its Collection|last=Quint|first=Barbara|date=2001-04-16|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Starfish Country Home School Foundation''' was registered as a [[non-profit organization]] in [[Thailand]] in March 2005. The foundation’s principal offices are located outside the [[Mae Taeng District]], about 45 km (27 miles) north of [[Chiang Mai Province]] in northern Thailand.

The use of [[Starfish]] in the name of the Starfish Country Home School Foundation originates from the famous [[parable]] of [[Loren Eisley]], [[The Star Thrower]]. That story reflects the philosophy of the Starfish Country Home School Foundation of trying to give significant assistance to a relatively small number of beneficiaries so as to have a large impact on their lives.

The Starfish Country Home School Foundation is not affiliated with any religious or political organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us: The Starfish Country Home School Foundation | url =   http://www.schsf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Starfish Country Home School (Creativity Center)==
In April 2005 the Starfish Country Home School Foundation completed purchase of the site of a former resort on the Ping River and remodeled this for use as a home and free [[bilingual school]] for needy [[hill tribe]] children. The Starfish Country Home School (Creativity Center) opened in June 2005 with 10 students. It was registered with the Thailand Education Ministry as a [[kindergarten]] (anubaan) in 2006 and as a [[primary school]] (prathom) in 2008. Teaching is in a combination of English and Thai plus the hill tribe languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Starfish Country Home School | url =   http://www.schsf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2016 the Starfish Country Home School had 97 resident children, almost all of whom are either [[Hmong people|Hmong]] or [[Lisu people|Lisu]], and 69 [[Thai (ethnic group)|Thai]] day students. The school has two kindergarten classes and six primary school classes. The school uses a curriculum that it calls Thaiglish to teach English. Thaiglish is a picture-based curriculum that uses a combination of Thai and English script to more accurately represent the sound of [[American English]] words. The school has also developed its own curriculum for teaching mathematics. Most of the primary school students at the Starfish Country Home School study Western [[ballet]], jazz and Thai classical dancing.

The five grade six graduating at the Starfish Country Home School in Maetaeng have had higher average scores on [https://www.facebook.com/145621685804281/photos/a.218993655133750.1073741897.145621685804281/218993685133747/?type=3&amp;theater Thailand’s ONET-6 final examinations] than all 120! schools in the city of Chiangmai.

== Starfish Homes in Chiangmai and Chiangrai ==
In May 2006 the Starfish Country Home School Foundation purchased a new 80-room apartment house in the city of Chiangmai and remodeled it for use as a residence and daycare facility for needy or abused hill tribe children. In May 2016 the Starfish Home had 110 resident children and a free daycare program for 37 additional children aged three to six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Chiang Mai Branch | url =   http://www.starfishhome-cm.org/new-page/about-the-chiang-mai-branch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2014 the Starfish Country Home School Foundation opened the Chiangmai Starfish Learning Center at a site adjacent to the Starfish Home in the city of Chiangmai. In May 2016 that program had 120 preschool students. The Chiangmai Starfish Learning Center uses the same preschool curricula as the Starfish Country Home School in Maetaeng.

In May 2005, the Starfish Country Home School Foundation also started the Wildflower Home, a residential and training program for pregnant girls and single mothers. That program relocated to the Starfish Home Chiangmai in May 2006 and has since become an independent Thai foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wildflower Home History | url =   http://www.wildflowerhome.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109&amp;Itemid=161&amp;lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the Starfish Country Home School Foundation opened the Starfish Home Chiangrai. The Starfish Country Home School Foundation built a new residence for the Starfish Home Chiangrai that opened in May 2010. In May 2016 there were 31 hill tribe girls living at that site. An Akha woman lawyer in Starfish Home Chiangrai provides free [[legal aid]] for hill tribe people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Starfish Home in Chiangrai | url =   http://www.schsf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the resident children at the two Starfish Homes come from broken families with no father and often no mother present. About 20% of the residents have one or both parents in prison.&lt;ref name="schsf1"&gt;{{cite web | title = Starfish Home School Foundation Prison Program | url =   http://www.schsf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starfish Homes are not orphanages and children regularly visit their families whenever possible. Parents are invited to visit the Boarding schools.

==Funding External Programs in Asia==
The Starfish Country Home School Foundation so far has awarded more than 300 three- or four-year scholarships to needy but talented students in northern Thailand who have finished either grade three or grade six so they can continue to attend a school near their homes.

Since July 2007, the Starfish Country Home School Foundation has funded the complete cost of a program for basic education of inmates at the Chiangmai Women’s Prison. It also supports the costs of a room for babies of inmates within the prison. Additionally, the Starfish Country Home School Foundation provides scholarships for the children of women prisoners.&lt;ref name="schsf1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16461">'''Thanaweya Amma''' (Arabic: ثانوية عامة ) is series of [[standardized tests]] in [[Egypt]] that lead to the General [[Secondary Education]] Certificate for public secondary schools and serves as the [[entrance examination]] for Egyptian public universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1qdV2CkcwMC&amp;pg=PA146 |title=Reviews of National Policies for Education Reviews of National Policies for Education: Higher Education in Egypt 2010|publisher=The World Bank, OECD |year=2010|isbn=9264084347 |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thanaweya Amma'' means 'General Secondary' in [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. In the context of Egypt's education system, it refers to the general (as opposed to technical or vocational) secondary education track, the completion exams at the end of the track, and the diploma  a student earns by passing the exams. This article is about the exams.

==Overview==

At the end of the final year of secondary school, students sit for comprehensive examinations for each of the 5 core subjects they took that year. The content of the exams and their relative weight in scoring depends on the students' curricular concentration, either literature, science, or science/mathematics. These scores are turned into a composite and ranked within each track. The top scores are published online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tansik.egypt.gov.eg/application/defaultThanwy.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thanaweya Amma'' is one of several examinations that public school students take that serves a dual purpose of completion certificate and entrance examination, determining what education pathways students will follow. Students at the end of primary school sit for the ''qabuul'' examination, which determines their admittance into general preparatory school.&lt;ref&gt;Heargraves, Eleanor. (2001). "Assessment in Egypt," in Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice.  8:2  p.254-5&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of preparatory school, students sit for the ''Adaadiya Amma'' (General Preparatory) examination which serves as the completion certificate for preparatory school.&lt;ref&gt;Heargraves, Eleanor. (2001). "Assessment in Egypt," in Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice.  8:2  p.254-5&lt;/ref&gt; High scores admit students to the General Secondary track, while low scores will track students to technical or vocational secondary school. More students enroll in technical school than general secondary school; in 2005/6 approximately 38.7% of secondary students were in the general secondary track.&lt;ref&gt;Amer, Mona. (2007) “Transition from Education to Work: Egypt Country Report,” EFT Working Document, European Training Foundation. p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Thanaweya Amma'' examination is taken by students who have completed the General Secondary track; students who are tracked into vocational or technical schools do not sit for the exam and have little chance of attending university.&lt;ref&gt;Heargraves, Eleanor. (2001). "Assessment in Egypt," in Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice.  8:2  p.254-5&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thanaweya Amma'' can also be taken by private school students in national curriculum schools accredited by the Ministry of Education. Additionally, private language schools can teach students the national curriculum but with certain core subjects taught in languages other than Arabic. The Ministry of Education has translated the exams to accommodate.

''Thanaweya Amma'' has historically tested acquired knowledge, though reforms beginning in the 1990s introduced aptitude assessment as well.&lt;ref&gt;Heargraves, Eleanor. (2001). "Assessment in Egypt," in Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice.  8:2  p.254-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==University Entrance==

The admissions process to Egyptian public universities is managed by the Coordination Office of the Ministry of Higher Education (usually referred to as ''Tansiq''). Each year, the office publishes a list of colleges and institutes and the minimum test scores required for each. Students who have completed their exam submit their preferences and the Coordination Office places them in a program.

For 2012, the most demanding programs in terms of ''Thanaweya Amma'' scores were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tansik.egypt.gov.eg/application/defaultThanwy.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Tradition of Assessment during Ottoman and British Rule===
Eleanor Hargreaves argues that the ''Thanaweya Amma'' draws on assessment traditions  grounded in the introduction of European education in Egypt through colonial structures.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p.248.&lt;/ref&gt; During 19th and first half of the 20th centuries, assessment served the function of selecting elites for military or civil service. The earliest predecessor to the exam dates back to the [[French occupation of Egypt]] from 1798 to 1801, during which the French initiated an assessment system to screen for elite candidates for military college.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p.248.&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the occupation, [[Mohammed Ali Pasha|Mohammed Ali]] assumed power and undertook large-scale efforts to modernize the Egyptian state, including expanding the education system. Subsequent reforms set up a [[Baccalauréat|Baccalaureate]] system in which elite [[Mamluks]] attended secondary school and sat for exams to attend higher education and gain admittance to Egypt's military or civil service.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p.248.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[British occupation of Egypt|British occupation]] from 1882 to 1952, the assessment system continued to serve this function. This period saw the advent of elementary schools which, though exclusive and fee-based, helped prepare students for secondary school. Because the overall function of the education system was still to train elite Egyptians for service in British colonial bureaucracy, the number of positions available upon completion were limited. Thus, a primary school assessment system was implemented to screen for elite candidates to compete for bureaucratic positions in secondary school. Primary school enrollment remained low.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1952 Revolution and the Nasser Period===

The [[1952 Revolution]] and the eventual ascension of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] to the presidency marked a significant change in the function of education in Egypt, as it was transformed from a system of recruiting and training elites, to a system of instilling national unity and promoting national development. Enrollment rates exploded as primary school was made mandatory in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Judith. (2008) Educational Roots of Political Crisis in Egypt. Lexington Books: Lenham, MD. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p. 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nasser government's changes to the education system created the ''Thanaweya Amma'' exam in its modern form. Education was [[Arabized]] and standardized, and with abolition of most private schools, became almost entirely under the purview of the state. Testing itself became a point of national unity – students around the country sat for the same exams at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p. 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The great importance placed on the ''Thanawey Amma'' sprung not only from changes to the test itself, but also the way the new government recast education's role in Egyptian society. On a rhetorical level, education was exalted as a means of national development; it was enshrined as a citizen's right and played a key role in Arab nationalist discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, p.67-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, achievement in education, and in turn, achievement on assessments, increasingly became a means of social mobility for low and middle class Egyptians historically excluded from the system.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, p.249-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rhetorical appeal of education was augmented by specific policies which made social mobility through education more feasible for many Egyptians. The 1952 Revolution led to the expulsion or exclusion of the historical class of elite or foreign civil servants, opening many government positions previously accessed only class privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p. 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, formal assessment (at least ostensibly) became the primary means of achieving government posts.

Moreover, in 1957, the Egyptian Parliament extended free public school education all the way through the university level (primary education had been free since 1930; and secondary education had been free since 1950), meaning that any student who passed the Thanaweya Amma exam would be granted a spot in a public university.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Alan et al. (2013) A Political Economy of the Middle East: Third Edition. Westview Press: Boulder, C.O., p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, beginning in 1961-2, the government began extending public sector employment guarantees to graduates of public tertiary institutions, beginning with universities, and then extending to vocation secondary and technical institutes in 1946 (under Law 14) and finally all military conscripts under Law 85 of 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Assaad, Ragui. (1997) “The Effects of Public Sector Hiring and Compensation Policies on the Egyptian Labor Market,” The World Bank Economic Review, Vol. 11, No. 1: p. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the ''Thanaweya Amma'' test became a crucial step for many Egyptians to access what became government entitlements (university education and subsequent employment). Its importance was compounded by the fact that social mobility depended in part on a student's score on the exam. Hargreaves argues that because education was structured as a means of national development, and not necessarily personal economic or social gain, students were allocated to universities based on the government's needs.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p.249-250.&lt;/ref&gt; The government used ''Thanaweya Amma'' scores as a means of students who would attend elite programs versus those who would attend less prestigious institutions. Thus, students generally enrolled in the programs for which their scores qualified them.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p.249-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sadat and Mubarak Eras===

Education during the [[Sadat]] and [[Mubarak]] eras was marked by a number of government policies to incrementally scale back the entitlements extended during Nasser era.

The government's gradual repeal of the employment guarantee, through extending the wait period for government employment after university graduation, decreased the employment prospects for public school students. Throughout the course of the 1980s, the wait period was extended from two years to five years.&lt;ref&gt;Assad 1997, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it guarantee was completely abolished in the 1990s the wait period has reached 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;Assad 1997, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with this policy (and in fact, extending all the way back to Sadat's [[Infitah]]), the government encouraged the private sector to drive  employment growth.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran 2008, p.76-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

While this change would have ostensibly decreased the stakes of the ''Thanaweya Amma'' test, it should be noted that Sadat's education policies also encouraged the growth of private, fee-based education;&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves 2001, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; these policies continued through the Mubarak era, especially in the late 1980s under Education Minister [[Ahmad Fathi Sorour|Fathi Sorour]].&lt;ref&gt;Hargraves 2001, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, those with means migrated to a parallel private school system which became the feeder for private sector labor, while success in public school and on the Thanaweya Amma remained the incredibly important for the social mobility of those from lower classes.

A second policy was to decrease the percentage of students in the General Secondary track, and therefore the number of students sitting for the ''Thanaweya Amma'' exam. Throughout the 1980s, the government expand secondary technical education such that by the end of the decade, the percentage of technical secondary students outnumbered those in general secondary.&lt;ref&gt;Assad 1997, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; This continues to be the case today. Thus, students are tracked away from university earlier, at the end of primary school.

==Criticism and Controversy==
Securing the contents of the exam becomes an issue each year.&lt;ref name="security  2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Security concerns overshadow thanaweya amma anxiety |url=https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2011/06/12/security-concerns-overshadow-thanaweya-amma-anxiety/ |accessdate=14 September 2018 |date=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hargreaves argues that the structure and importance of the ''Thanaweya Amma'' exam results in what [[Ronald Dore]] called the ‘Diploma Disease,’ in which ‘selection for higher education and employment become the driving force behind schools.’&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, Eleanore. (1997) "The Diploma Disease in Egypt: learning, teaching, and the monster of the secondary leaving certificate" Assessment in Education. Vol. 4 No. 1, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that classrooms in Egypt become oriented around examination and memorization from the earliest levels.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, Eleanore. (1997) "The Diploma Disease in Egypt: learning, teaching, and the monster of the secondary leaving certificate" Assessment in Education. Vol. 4 No. 1, p. 164-5.&lt;/ref&gt; During their final year of schooling, students face immense time and examination pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, Eleanore. (1997) "The Diploma Disease in Egypt: learning, teaching, and the monster of the secondary leaving certificate" Assessment in Education. Vol. 4 No. 1, p. 167-8.&lt;/ref&gt; She also argues that Egypt's explosion in private tutoring has to do with the enormous importance placed on examination results.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, Eleanore. (1997) "The Diploma Disease in Egypt: learning, teaching, and the monster of the secondary leaving certificate" Assessment in Education. Vol. 4 No. 1, p. 168-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in music education''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women musicians, conductors, teachers and educational administrators]] in [[music education]] at the [[elementary school]] and [[secondary education]] levels. While [[music critic]]s argued in the 1880s that "...women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860–1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

'''Young Social Innovators''' ('''YSI''') is [[Ireland]]'s largest [[social awareness]] and active citizenship and education programme for 15- to 18-year-old teens. Its main goal is to get young people (15-18yrs) involved in action which helps improve the lives of others in their community. YSI involves thousands of young people in Ireland each year in hundreds of projects and social enterprises which are youth-led, team-based and action-focused. Each year, each YSI team is invited to present their project at the YSI Speak Out Regional fora. A national Showcase of Young Social Innovators takes place in May each year where thousands of young social innovators come together and showcase their projects. 
Set up by Rachel Collier and Stansilaus Kennedy in 2001

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== How YSI works ==
Young people come up with and develop ideas to change the world for good. They work in a team, decide what they want to do and how they can respond in new ways to problems of importance to them.
YSI has a well tested social innovation education framework which is in brief: CARE, CO-OPERATE, CHANGE AND COMMUNICATE! An effective way to work on any social innovation. 
YSI believes that the more you practice social innovation, the better you are at it! Once you make a difference by doing a YSI project, you can put your skills to action and take on many other social issues. 
Young Social Innovators is based on human rights.

== Main Initiatives ==
The YSI framework can be used on youthled projects concerned with any social issue! Projects on topics such as the following have been done -
*Public Health
*Personal well-being (Bullying, Mental Health etc.)
*Road safety
*Anti-social Behaviour
*[[Suicide]] prevention
*Animal Cruelty (Fur Farming)
