'''A Mathematical Programming Language''' ('''AMPL''') is an [[algebraic modeling language]] to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing (i.e., large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems).&lt;ref name="ampl-book"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David Gay, and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].
AMPL supports dozens of [[solver]]s, both [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[commercial software]], including CBC, [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[Gurobi]], [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and LGO. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl]] files.
AMPL is used by more than 100 corporate clients, and by government agencies and academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web
  | title=Position Available
  | url=http://www.ampl.com/OPENINGS/2011July.html#Product
  | accessdate=2011-07-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of AMPL is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of [[mathematical programming|optimization]]. Many modern solvers available on the [[NEOS Server]] (formerly hosted at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], currently hosted at the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]&lt;ref name="neos-uwm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neos-guide.org/About/|title=About|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accept AMPL input. According to the NEOS statistics AMPL is the most popular format for representing mathematical programming problems.

==Features==
AMPL features a mix of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulating optimization models occurs via declarative language elements such as sets, scalar and multidimensional parameters, decision variables, objectives and constraints, which allow for concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AMPL for
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available.

To support re-use and simplify construction of large-scale optimization problems, AMPL allows separation of model and data.

AMPL supports a wide range of problem types, among them:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Second-order cone programming]]
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities
* [[Complementarity theory]] problems (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables
* [[Constraint programming]]&lt;ref name="cp-support"&gt;

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL invokes a solver in a separate process which has these advantages:
* User can interrupt the solution process at any time
* Solver errors do not affect the interpreter
* 32-bit version of AMPL can be used with a 64-bit solver and vice versa
Interaction with the solver is done through a well-defined [[nl (format)|nl interface]].

==Availability==
[[File:Neos-stats-2011-01.png|right|thumb|352px|[[Argonne National Laboratory#User facilities|NEOS]] input statistics for January 2011.]]
AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit [[operating system]]s including [[Linux]], Mac [[OS X]], some [[Unix]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ampl.com/products/ampl/ AMPL page at AMPL Optimization Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The translator is proprietary software maintained by AMPL Optimization LLC. However, several online services exist, providing free modeling and solving facilities using AMPL.&lt;ref name="neos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neos-server.org/neos/|title=NEOS Server for Optimization|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/TRYAMPL/|title=Try AMPL!|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A free student version with limited functionality and a free full-featured version for academic courses are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|title=AMPL Downloads|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526013237/http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|archive-date=26 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL can be used from within [[Microsoft Excel]] via the [[SolverStudio]] Excel add-in.

The AMPL Solver Library (ASL), which allows reading nl files and provides the automatic differentiation, is open-source. It is used in many solvers to implement AMPL connection.

'''Apophenia''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|p|oʊ-|ˈ|f|iː|n|i|ə}}) is the tendency to mistakenly perceive connections and meaning between unrelated things.&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web|title=apophenia|author=Carroll, Robert T.|url=http://skepdic.com/apophenia.html|website=The Skeptic's Dictionary|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term (German: ''{{lang|de|Apophänie}}'') was coined by psychiatrist [[Klaus Conrad]] in his 1958 publication on the [[Prodrome#In schizophrenia|beginning stages of schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=Klaus&gt;{{cite book |first=Klaus |last=Conrad |title=Die beginnende Schizophrenie.

Pareidolia usually occurs as a result of the [[fusiform face area]], which is the part of the human brain that is responsible in seeing faces, mistakenly interpreting an object, shape or configuration with some kind of perceived "face-like" features as being a face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Vox|title=Why you're seeing a face in this purse|date=2015-08-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1dMloUfN1o|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambler's fallacy ===
Apophenia is well documented as a [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]] for gambling. Gamblers may imagine that they see patterns in the numbers that appear in [[Lottery|lotteries]], [[card game]]s, or [[roulette wheel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=May 28, 2007 at 9:49 pm |url=http://waterstone.wordpress.com/2007/05/24/apophenia-illusory-correlation/ |title=Apophenia &amp; Illusory Correlation « Paul Xavier Waterstone |publisher=Waterstone.wordpress.com |date=2007-05-24 |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One variation of this is known as the "[[gambler's fallacy]]".

=== Statistics ===

In statistics, apophenia is an example of a [[Type I error]] – the identification of false patterns in data.&lt;ref name="skepdic"/&gt; It may be compared with a so-called ''false positive'' in other test situations.

== Related terms ==

In contrast to an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], an apophany (i.e., an instance of apophenia) does not provide insight into the nature of [[reality]] nor its interconnectedness, but is a "process of repetitively and monotonously experiencing abnormal meanings in the entire surrounding experiential field". Such meanings are entirely self-referential, solipsistic, and paranoid—"being observed, spoken about, the object of eavesdropping, followed by strangers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Conrad |first=Klaus |title=Gestaltanalyse und Daseinsanalytik |periodical=Nervenarzt |year=1959 |number=30 |pages=405–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the English term "apophenia" has a somewhat different meaning than that which Conrad defined when he coined the term "Apophänie".

=== "Patternicity" ===
In 2008, [[Michael Shermer]] coined the word "patternicity", defining it as "the tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shermer |first=Michael |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=patternicity-finding-meaningful-patterns |title=Patternicity: Finding Meaningful Patterns in Meaningless Noise |publisher=Scientificamerican.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=GrrlScientist |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2010/sep/25/michael-shermer-belief-self-deception |title=Michael Shermer: The pattern behind self-deception |publisher=Guardian |date= 29 September 2010|accessdate=2011-06-29 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Agenticity" ===
In ''The Believing Brain'' (2011), Shermer wrote that humans have "the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning, intention, and agency", which he called "agenticity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQO4y2bueAM&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PLCD25E214FF0BCD3B&amp;index=2|title=Why Do We Need a Belief in God with Michael Shermer|date=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clustering illusion ===
A [[clustering illusion]] is a type of cognitive bias in which a person sees a pattern in a random sequence of numbers or events. Many theories have been disproved as a result of this bias being brought up.

In 1985, a study of the "[[hot-hand fallacy]]" by Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallon and Amos Tversky found that the idea of basketball players possessing a "hot hand" (tending to shoot better in streaks) was false, their analysis provided "no evidence for a positive correlation between the outcomes of successive shots."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas|last2=Vallone|first2=Robert|last3=Tversky|first3=Amos|date=1985-07-01|title=The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028585900106|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–314|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case, during the early 2000s, involved the occurrence of breast cancer amongst the female employees at ABC Studios in Queensland. A study found that the incidence of breast cancer at the studios was six times higher than the rate in the rest of Queensland. However, an examination found no correlation between the heightened incidence and any factors related to the site, genetic or lifestyle factors of the employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nbcf.org.au/research/our-research/search-our-research/pathologic-and-molecular-investigations-of-the-abc-breast-cancer-cluster/|title=Pathologic and molecular investigations of the ABC breast cancer 'cluster' – National Breast Cancer Foundation|date=2015-11-13|work=National Breast Cancer Foundation|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Apophenia is commonly referred to as an error in perception. Although there is no confirmed reason as to why it occurs, there are some respected theories.

=== Models of pattern recognition ===
[[Pattern recognition (psychology)|Pattern recognition]] is a cognitive process that involves retrieving information either from long-term, short-term or working memory and matching it with information from stimuli. However, there are three different ways in which this may happen and go wrong, resulting in apophenia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.psychology24.org/pattern-recognition-and-your-brain/|title=Pattern Recognition and Your Brain {{!}} psychology24.org|date=2016-03-21|work=psychology24.org|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Template matching ===
The stimulus is compared to templates or copies in the long-term memory. These templates are often stored as a result of past learning or educational experiences.

E.g. D d ''D '''d''' are all recognized as the letter D but not any other letter.''

These detection routines, when applied on more complex data sets (such, for example, a painting or clusters of data) can result in the wrong template being matched. A false positive detection will result in apophenia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prototype matching ===
This is similar to template matching, except for the fact that an exact match is not needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of this would be to look at an animal such as a tiger and instead of recognizing that it was a tiger (template matching) knowing that it was a cat (prototype matching) based on the known information about the characteristics of a cat.

This type of [[Pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] can result in apophenia based on the fact that since the brain is not looking for exact matches, it can pick up some characteristics of a match and assume it fits. This is more common with pareidolia than data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-12-15|title=Pattern recognition (psychology)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pattern_recognition_(psychology)&amp;oldid=755046888|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feature analysis ===
The stimulus is broken down into its features and allowed to process the information. This model of [[Pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] comes from the result of 4 stages, which are: Detection, Pattern dissection, Feature comparison in memory &amp; finally Recognition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===
One of the explanations put forth by evolutionary psychologists for apophenia is that it is not a flaw in the cognition of human brains but rather something that has come about through years of need. The study of this topic is referred to as [[error management theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/webdocs/EMT.html|title=Error Management Theory|last=Haselton|first=Martie|date=January 2000|website=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most accredited studies in this field is [[Skinner's box]] and superstition.

This experiment involved taking a hungry pigeon, placing it in a [[Operant conditioning chamber|box]] and releasing a food pellet at a random time. The pigeon received a food pellet while performing some action; and so, rather than attributing the arrival of the pellet to randomness, it repeated its action, and continued to do so until another pellet fell. As the pigeon increased the number of times it performed the action, it gained the impression that it also increased the times it was "rewarded" with a pellet, although the release in fact remained entirely random.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5746904/how-pigeons-get-to-be-superstitious |title=How pigeons get to be superstitious|last=Inglis-Arkell|first=Esther|work=io9|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashtamangala.jpg|thumb|Ashtamangala: first row (left to right): parasol, pair of golden fish, conch; second row: treasure vase, lotus; Last row: infinite knot, victory banner and wheel.]]

The '''Ashtamangala''' are a sacred suite of ''Eight Auspicious Signs'' endemic to a number of [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]]. The symbols or "symbolic attributes" ({{bo|t=ཕྱག་མཚན་|s=chaktsen}}) are [[yidam]] and teaching tools. Not only do these attributes (or energetic signatures) point to qualities of enlightened [[mindstream]], but they are the investiture that ornaments these enlightened "qualities" (Sanskrit: ''[[guṇa]]''; {{bo|t=ཡོན་ཏན་|s=yönten}}). Many cultural enumerations and variations of the Ashtamangala are extant.
{{quote|Groupings of eight auspicious symbols were originally used in India at ceremonies such as an investiture or coronation of a king. An early grouping of symbols included: [[throne]], [[swastika]], handprint, hooked [[knot]], [[bumpa|vase of jewels]], water libation flask, pair of fishes, lidded bowl. In Buddhism, these eight symbols of good fortune represent the offerings made by the gods to [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni Buddha]] immediately after he gained enlightenment.&lt;ref name="buddhistinformation.com"&gt;Source: [http://www.buddhistinformation.com/about_the_eight_auspicious_symbo.htm] (accessed: January 18, 2008) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113213231/http://www.buddhistinformation.com/about_the_eight_auspicious_symbo.htm |date=13 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Buddhism ==
[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] make use of a particular set of eight auspicious symbols, ''ashtamangala'', in household and public art. Some common interpretations are given along with each symbol although different teachers may give different interpretations:

=== Conch ===
[[File:Ashtamangala right whorl conch.svg|thumb|150px|[[shankha|Śaṅkha]]]]
The right-turning white [[conch]] shell (Sanskrit: [[shankha|{{IAST|śaṅkha}}]]; {{bo|t=དུང་དཀར་གཡས་འཁྱིལ་|s=dungkar yénkhyil}}) represents the beautiful, deep, melodious, interpenetrating and pervasive sound of the [[dharma]], which awakens disciples from the deep slumber of ignorance and urges them to accomplish their own welfare and the welfare of others.
{{quote|The conch shell is thought to have been the original horn-trumpet; ancient Indian mythical epics relate heroes carrying conch shells. The Indian god Vishnu is also described as having a conch shell as one of his main emblems; his shell bore the name Panchajanya meaning "having control over the five classes of beings".&lt;ref name="buddhistinformation.com"/&gt;}}
In Hinduism, the conch is an attribute of [[Vishnu]] along with the [[Sudarshana Chakra]]. [[Vaishnavism]] holds that Gautama Buddha is an [[avatar]] of Vishnu.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Endless knot ===
[[File:8signs-PELBEU.svg|thumb|left |150px|[[Endless knot]]]]
The [[endless knot]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Srivatsa|śrīvatsa]]''; {{bo|t=དཔལ་བེའུ་|s=pelbeu}})&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/dpal_be'u Dpal be'u]&lt;/ref&gt; denotes "the auspicious mark represented by a curled noose emblematic of love".&lt;ref name="Sarat Chandra Das 1902 p.69"&gt;Sarat Chandra Das (1902). ''Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms''. Calcutta, India: mainly used in buddhismBengal Secretariat Book Depot, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; It is a symbol of the ultimate unity of everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyytiäinen |first=Tiina |editor-last=Saloniemi |editor-first=Marjo-Riitta |title=Tibet: A Culture in Transition |publisher=Vapriikki |pages=198 |chapter=The Eight Auspicious Symbols |isbn=978-951-609-377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it represents the intertwining of wisdom and compassion, the mutual dependence of religious doctrine and secular affairs, the union of wisdom and method, the inseparability of [[śūnyatā]] "emptiness" and [[pratītyasamutpāda]] "interdependent origination", and the union of [[prajñā (Buddhism)|wisdom]] and [[Karuṇā|compassion]] in enlightenment (see [[namkha]]). This knot, net or web metaphor also conveys the Buddhist teaching of [[Buddhist philosophy#Interpenetration|interpenetration]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Fish ===
[[File:8signs-SERNYA.svg|thumb|150px|Pair of golden fish]]
The two golden fish (Sanskrit: [[matsya|gaurmatsya]]; {{bo|t=གསེར་ཉ་|s=sernya}}&lt;ref&gt;Source: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/gser_nya gser nya]''&lt;/ref&gt;) symbolise the auspiciousness of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] in a state of fearlessness without danger of drowning in saṃsāra.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The two golden fishes are linked with the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] [[nadi (yoga)|nadi,]]  [[prana]] and [[carp]]: {{quote|The two fishes originally represented the two main sacred rivers of India - the Ganges and Yamuna. These rivers are associated with the lunar and solar channels, which originate in the nostrils and carry the alternating rhythms of breath or prana. They have religious significance in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions but also in Christianity (the sign of the fish, the feeding of the five thousand). In Buddhism, the fish symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of movement in the water. They represent fertility and abundance. Often drawn in the form of carp, which are regarded in the Orient as sacred on account of their elegant beauty, size, and life-span.&lt;ref name="buddhistinformation.com"/&gt;}}In Islam the (alive) fish has a significant role in the meeting between [[Moses_in_Islam#Meeting_with_Khidr|Moses]] and [[Khidr]].

=== Lotus ===
[[File:8-Signs PADMA.svg|thumb|160px|left|The lotus flower, or [[padma (attribute)|padma]].]]

The [[sacred lotus|lotus flower]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Padma (attribute)|padma]]''; {{bo|t=པད་མ་|s=péma}}), represent the primordial purity of [[Three Vajras|body, speech, and mind]], floating above the muddy waters of [[Upādāna|attachment]] and desire. The lotus symbolizes purity and renunciation. Although the lotus has its roots in the mud at the bottom of a pond, its flower lies immaculate above the water. The Buddhist lotus bloom has 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, 100, or 1,000 petals. The same figures can refer to the body's 'internal lotuses', that is to say, its energy centres ([[chakra]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyytiäinen |first=Tiina |editor-last=Saloniemi |editor-first=Marjo-Riitta |title=Tibet: A Culture in Transition |publisher=Vapriikki |pages=197 |chapter=The Eight Auspicious Symbols |isbn=978-951-609-377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Powers |first=John |title=Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism: revised edition |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |pages=23 |isbn=978-1-55939-282-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parasol ===
[[File:8signs-DUK.svg|thumb|200px|Jewelled parasol]]
The jewelled parasol (Sanskrit: ''[[Chhatra|chatraratna]]''; {{bo|t=རིན་ཆེན་གདུགས་|s=rinchenduk}}&lt;ref name="Sarat Chandra Das 1902 p.69"/&gt;), which is similar in ritual function to the [[baldachin]] or [[wikt:canopy|canopy]]: represents the protection of beings from harmful forces and illness. It represents the canopy or [[firmament]] of the sky and therefore the expansiveness and unfolding of [[space]] and the element [[Aether (classical element)|æther]]. It represents the expansiveness, unfolding and protective quality of the [[sahasrara]]: all take [[refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the dharma under the auspiciousness of the parasol.

=== Vase ===

[[File:8-Signs BUMPA.svg|thumb|160px|left|Treasure vase]]

The [[Bumpa|treasure vase]]  ({{bo|t=གཏེར་ཆེན་པོའི་བུམ་པ་|s=terchenpo'i bumpa}}) represents health, longevity, wealth, prosperity, wisdom and the phenomenon of space. The treasure vase, or pot, symbolizes the Buddha's infinite quality of teaching the dharma: no matter how many teachings he shared, the treasure never lessened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyytiäinen |first=Tiina |editor-last=Saloniemi |editor-first=Marjo-Riitta |title=Tibet: A Culture in Transition |publisher=Vapriikki |pages=196 |chapter=The Eight Auspicious Symbols |isbn=978-951-609-377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconography representation of the treasure vase is often very similar to the [[kumbha]], one of the few possessions permitted a [[bhikkhu]] or [[bhikkhuni]] in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]. The wisdom urn or treasure vase is used in many [[empowerment (Vajrayana)]] and initiations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Dharmachakra ===
[[File:8-Signs KHORLO.svg|thumb|130px|The [[dharmachakra]]]]
The [[dharmachakra]] or "Wheel of the Law" (Sanskrit; {{bo|t=ཆོས་ཀྱི་འཁོར་ལོ་|s=chö kyi khorlo}}) represents [[Gautama Buddha]] and the Dharma teaching. This symbol is commonly used by Tibetan Buddhists, where it sometimes also includes an inner wheel of the [[Gankyil]] (Tibetan). [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepalese Buddhists]] don't use the Wheel of Law in the eight auspicious symbols.

Instead of the dharmachakra, a [[fly-whisk]] may be used as one of the ashtamangala to symbolize Tantric manifestations. It is made of a [[yak]]'s tail attached to a silver staff, and used in ritual recitation and during fanning the deities in [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]]s. [[Prayer wheel]]s take the form of a dharmachakra guise. The [[Sudarshana Chakra]] is a Hindu wheel-symbol.

=== Victory Banner ===
[[File:8signs-GYALTSEN.svg|thumb|130px|[[Dhvaja]]]]
The [[dhvaja]] (Sanskrit; {{bo|t=རྒྱལ་མཚན་|s=gyeltsen}}) "banner, flag" was a military standard of ancient Indian warfare. The symbol represents the Buddha's victory over the four māras, or hindrances in the path of enlightenment. These hindrances are pride, desire, disturbing emotions, and the fear of death. Within the Tibetan tradition, a list of eleven different forms of the victory banner is given to represent eleven specific methods for overcoming defilement. Many variations of the dhvaja's design can be seen on the roofs of Tibetan monasteries to symbolise the Buddha's victory over four māras. Banners are placed at the four corners of monastery and temple roofs. The cylindrical banners placed on monastery roofs are often made of beaten copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyytiäinen |first=Tiina |editor-last=Saloniemi |editor-first=Marjo-Riitta |title=Tibet: A Culture in Transition |publisher=Vapriikki |pages=198–199 |chapter=The Eight Auspicious Symbols |isbn=978-951-609-377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequences of symbols ==
Different traditions order the eight symbols differently.

Here is the sequential order of the Eight Auspicious Symbols of [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepali Buddhism]]:
# Endless knot
# Lotus flower
# Dhvaja
# Dharmachakra (fly-whisk in Nepali Buddhism)
# Bumpa
# Golden Fish
# Parasol
# Conch

The sequential order for [[Buddhism in China|Chinese Buddhism]] was defined&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Lili. "A Summary of Porcelains' Religious and Auspicious Designs." ''The Bulletin of the Shanghai Museum 7'' (1996), p.133&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Qing dynasty]] as:
# Dharmachakra
# Conch
# Dhvaja
# Parasol
# Lotus flower
# Bumpa
# Golden Fish
# Endless knot

== Hindu symbols ==
In [[India]]n and Hindu tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend ({{ISBN|0-500-51088-1}}) by Anna Dallapiccola&lt;/ref&gt; the Ashtamangala may be used during certain occasions including: [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s, [[wedding]]s (of Hindus), and [[coronation]]s. The ashtamangala finds wide mention in the texts associated with [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. They have been depicted in decorative [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] and cultural artifacts.

* The [[Hindu]] tradition lists them as:
** [[lion]] called ''raja''
** [[bull]] called ''vrishaba''
** [[snake|serpent]] called ''naga''
** [[Pitcher (container)|pitcher]] called ''kalasa''
** [[necklace]] called ''vijayanti''
** [[kettle]] called ''bher''
** [[Hand fan|fan]] called ''vyajana''
** [[oil lamp|lamp]] called ''deepa''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 70|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hindu]] tradition lists them as:
** [[fly-whisk]]
** full [[vase]]
** [[mirror]]
** [[elephant goad]]
** [[drum]]
** [[Oil lamp|lamp]]
** [[flag]]
** a pair of fish.
* The list also differs depending on the place, region, and the social groups.

==Jain symbols==
[[File:Adinath bilahri ashta.jpg|thumb|Adinath image with Ashtamangala placed in front of it, according to Digambara tradition]]
[[File:A Jain Manuscript Cover LACMA M.72.53.22 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|Ashtamangala, according to Svetambara tradition, on Jain manuscript cover, [[LACMA]] M.72.53.22&lt;br/&gt;(from left) : [[Swastika]], Vardhmanaka (food vessel), Pair of fish, [[Kalasha]] (pot), Bhadrasana (seat), [[Srivatsa]], [[Nandavarta]], Darpan (mirror)
]]
In [[Jainism]] too, the '''Ashtamangala''' are a set of eight auspicious symbols. There is some variation among different traditions concerning the eight symbols.{{Sfn|Titze|Bruhn|1998|p=234}}

In the [[Digambara]] tradition, the eight symbols are:
# Parasol
# Dhvaja
# [[Kalasha]]
# Fly-whisk
# [[Mirror]]
# Chair
# [[Hand fan]]
# Vessel

In the [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition, the eight symbols are:
# [[Swastika]]
# [[Srivatsa]]
# [[Nandavarta]]
# Vardhmanaka (food vessel)
# Bhadrasana (seat)
# [[Kalasha]] (pot)
# Darpan (mirror)
# Pair of fish

'''Benjamin Earl Franklin "Ben" Davidson, Jr.''' (June 14, 1940 – July 2, 2012) was an [[American football]] player, a defensive end best known for his play with the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the [[American Football League]]. Earlier in his career, he was with the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[Washington Redskins]] of the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref name=nytob&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/sports/football/ben-davidson-defensive-end-dies-at-72.html |newspaper=New York Times |agency=Associated Press |title=Ben Davidson, defensive end, dies at 72 |date=July 3, 2012 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latob&gt;{{cite news|last=Dillman |first=Lisa |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-ben-davidson-20120704,0,7541335.story |title=Ben Davidson dies at 72; Oakland Raider, fixture in beer commercials |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=July 4, 2012 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=quessrdr&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/25/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100726 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |last=Crowe |first=Jerry |title=For Ben Davidson, the quintessential Raider, football was the ticket to a great life |date=July 25, 2015 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Davidson was the son of Avis (née Wheat) and Benjamin Earl Franklin, Senior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/w/i/l/Tracy-Lynne-Williamson/GENE7-0004.html |title=Family Tree Maker's Genealogy Site: Genealogy Report: Descendants of Benjamin (Frank) Franklin Davidson |publisher=Familytreemaker.genealogy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Los Angeles)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in the [[El Sereno, Los Angeles|El Sereno]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, but did not play [[High school football|football in high school]]; because of his height ({{height|ft=6|in=8}}), [[High school basketball|basketball]] and track were more to his liking.&lt;ref name=dshhlsd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2VxWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NPADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6566%2C1114081 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |last=Weaver |first=Dan |title=Davidson shows his Liter side |date=April 23, 1992 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending junior college at [[East Los Angeles College]], he was spotted by the football coach and asked to join the team. He was subsequently recruited to play at the [[Washington Huskies football|University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] in [[1959 Washington Huskies football team|1959]], where he flourished as a member of [[1960 Rose Bowl|consecutive]] [[1961 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]]-winning teams under head coach [[Jim Owens]] and gained entry into professional football.

==Professional career==
===NFL===
Davidson was selected in the [[1961 NFL draft#Round four|fourth round]] of the [[1961 NFL draft]] by the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], but was traded in training camp to the [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref name=dbsltgl&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/packerinsider/brief-stay-leads-to-glory-131560758.html |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |last=Hendricks |first=Martin |title=Davidson's brief stay leads to glory |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rookie, he played mostly special teams for the Packers in [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|1961]], who beat the Giants 37–0 in the [[1961 NFL Championship Game|championship game]], the first of five NFL titles for head coach [[Vince Lombardi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/09000d5d8060ece8/1961-NFL-Championship-Game 1961 NFL Championship Game at NFL.Com]&lt;/ref&gt; During training camp in 1962, Davidson was traded to the [[1962 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] for a fifth round draft choice.&lt;ref name=dttred62&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ysEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1hAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6889%2C1177522 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Lea |first=Bud |title=Davidson traded to Redskins |date=August 21, 1962 |page=2, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played there in [[1962 Washington Redskins season|1962]] and [[1963 Washington Redskins season|1963]], until he was waived in September [[1964 Washington Redskins season|1964]] final cuts after not meeting the team's strict weight guidelines.&lt;ref name=dbsltgl/&gt;&lt;ref name=ppbfoc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jNhaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hWwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5196%2C1765022 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated  |title=Barnes, five other cut by Redskins |date=September 10, 1964 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFL===
Davidson is best remembered his play with the [[American Football League]] [[Oakland Raiders]].  [[Al Davis]] signed him as a free agent shortly after his release from the Redskins and he thrived as a pass rusher under head coaches Davis, [[John Rauch]], and [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]]. Davidson played in Oakland from [[1964 Oakland Raiders season|1964]] through [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|1972]], and was part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|league merger]] in {{nfly|1970}}. He was an [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] in 1966, 1967, and 1968.

The Raiders won the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|AFL championship]] in [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967]] and played in [[Super Bowl II]], but were overmatched by the [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. Oakland advanced to the AFL title games the next two seasons but lost to the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in [[1968 American Football League Championship Game|1968]] and the [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] in [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969]], the league's last game. A stretched [[Achilles tendon]] in 1972 kept him on the sidelines that entire season.&lt;ref name=dsbhim&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r6dYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3217%2C1680242 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Davidson style belies his image |date=February 6, 1973 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dawson-Taylor incident====
On November 1, [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|1970]], the [[Super Bowl IV|defending world champion]] [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] led the Raiders 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, and a long run for a first-down by Chiefs quarterback [[Len Dawson]] apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson, as he lay on the ground, was speared by Davidson, who dove into Dawson with his helmet, provoking Chiefs' receiver [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play. Davidson's play not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the [[AFC West]] with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609052751/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DtchMastr |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SdzXsUJF98#t=35s |title="Big" Ben Davidson - Oakland Raiders |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, the NFL changed its rules regarding personal fouls, separating those called during a play from those called after it.

===WFL===
Three years out of football, Davidson signed with the [[Portland Storm#1974 regular season|Portland Storm]] in early September 1974, already midway through the [[World Football League]]'s inaugural [[1974 World Football League season|1974]] season.&lt;ref name=dssct&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bDRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1274%2C818676 |newspaper=Eugene Register Guard |location=Oregon |title=Davidson signs Storm contract |date=September 4, 1974 |page=1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbrrst&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bzRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1733%2C1707243|newspaper=Eugene Register Guard |location=Oregon |last=Cawood |first=Neil |title=Big Ben, Roadrunner stir the Storm, 15-8 |date=September 7, 1974 |page=1B }}&lt;/ref&gt; While with the Storm, he lived in his motor home that he drove up from California.&lt;ref name=dshhlsd/&gt; A late season knee injury in early November ended his season and playing career.&lt;ref name=swhtmi&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AJ8gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jGgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1020%2C1655789 |newspaper=Lewiston Evening Journal |location=Maine |title=Storm will have to make it without Ben Davidson |date=November 9, 1974 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment career==
Davidson appeared in a few films including ''[[The Black Six]]'', ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'', and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. He portrayed Porter the Bouncer in ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' in [[1972 in film|1972]] and a convict football player in ''[[Necessary Roughness (film)|Necessary Roughness]]'' in [[1991 in film|1991]].  Davidson played himself in [[Miller Lite]] ads featuring [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. He also appeared in the short lived 1976 show ''[[Ball Four (TV series)|Ball Four]]'', the 1977 pilot for ''[[Lucan (TV series)|Lucan]]'' and the 1984 TV series Goldie and the Bears. Davidson also appeared in an episode of the 1970's TV series [[Happy Days]] as a lumberjack.

==Personal life==
Following his rookie season with Green Bay, Davidson took his winner's check ($5,195) from the 1961 NFL title game and bought rental property in San Diego.&lt;ref name=dbsltgl/&gt; He began 1961 with a [[1961 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] win on January 2 and ended it with an NFL championship on December 31, and was married in between.&lt;ref name=dbsltgl/&gt;

Davidson and fellow Oakland Raider teammate [[Tom Keating (American football)|Tom Keating]] were avid motorcycle riders and completed both a ride from California to the [[Panama Canal]] and a four-month, {{convert|14000|mi|adj=on}} trip across the United States while with the Raiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/25/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100726 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Jerry | last=Crowe | title=For Ben Davidson, the quintessential Raider, football was the ticket to a great life | date=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson died of [[prostate cancer]] at age 72.&lt;ref name=nytob/&gt;&lt;ref name=latob/&gt;  He was retired and living in San Diego and was survived by his wife Kathy, and daughters Janella, Dana, and Vicki.

The [[Sanskrit]] word, '''[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]]''', means 'consciousness' or 'spirit' or 'intelligence' or 'sensation'. It is the pure [[Consciousness]] or  the cosmic intelligence, the consciousness that knows itself and also knows others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaitanya Gurukul|url=http://www.chaitanyagurukul.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also means energy or enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|url= http://dictionary.tamilcube.com/sanskrit-dictionary.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rig Veda (R.V.IV.XL.5) ''Nrishad'' is the dweller amongst men; ''Nrishad'' is explained as ''Chaitanya'' or 'Consciousness' or ''[[Prana]]'' or 'vitality' because both dwell in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig veda Samhita Vol. 3. III Ashtaka VII Adhyaya Sukta XIII (XL) .5|publisher=Wm. H. Allen and Company|page=200|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxwYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=Chaitanya+in+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XE0sUqPfK8GUrgfYw4HQDw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Chaitanya%20in%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Upanishads]], it is explained that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the Self, represents itself differently in the seven-fold movement of [[Prakrti]] according to the dominant principle of the consciousness in the individual being. These seven folds of consciousness are – 1) Physical consciousness, 2) Vital consciousness, 3) Mental consciousness, 4) Supra-intellectual consciousness, 5) Consciousness proper to the universal Beatitude or Blissful consciousness, 6) Consciousness proper to the infinite divine self-awareness, and 7) Consciousness proper to the state of pure divine existence. [[Sri Aurobindo]] calls the consciousness proper to the infinite self-awareness as the ''Chaitanya Purusha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads: Texts, Translations and Commentaries|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=45|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=F0IJMaMTf0cC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=chaitanya+in+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V2UsUnHQmogH15yAkAI&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chaitanya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential nature of [[Brahman]] as revealed in deep sleep and Yoga is Chaitanya (pure consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mystical Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=S.C.Sen|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=178|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xnhNZQJ07DYC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=chaitanya+in+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=imssUtWXLJHRrQfL64CoDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chaitanya%20in%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedantists also speak about the Consciousness or ''Mayaopahita-chaitanya'' that is associated with the indescribable [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] which is responsible for the functions of creation, preservation and dissolution of entire Existence, and about the Consciousness or ''Avidyaopahita-chaitanya'' that is associated with [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]] which causes the wrong identification of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] with the body etc.; after negating both Maya and Avidya, that is, after all distinctions are obliterated, what remains is Pure Consciousness or Chaitanya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani |author=Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan|page=494|url= https://www.amazon.com/Sri-Samkaras-VIVEKACUDAMANI-Chandrasekharendra-Bharati/dp/8172764200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of an object that the mind assumes, after coming into contact with that object or enveloping it, is called ''[[Vritti]]''. The process of enveloping is called ''Vritti-Vyapti''. ''[[Vyapti]]'' is pervasion and the pervasion by the mind of a certain location called the object is ''Vritti-Vyapti''. The awareness that the object is there illuminates the object due to the presence in this moving process called the mind and is called ''phala-vyapti''. It is only because of the consciousness attending on the mind that the object is perceived. [[Vedanta]] says that the object cannot be wholly material and there is no qualitative difference between the object and consciousness which consciousness by coming into contact with the object knows that the object is there which fact implies that consciousness is inherent in the object. This is the ''Vishaya- chaitanya'' or the 'object-consciousness' which does not mean consciousness of the object but the object which is a phase of consciousness which prevails everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from Rig Veda – When Science was Religion|author=Choudur Satyanarayana Murthy|publisher=AuthorHouse|pages=66–67|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kv86C_pd5-YC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Chaitanya+in+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f0YsUpzUD8T_rAemwICgDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chaitanya%20in%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11249">'''Compelled speech''' is a transmission of expression required by law. A related legal concept is ''[[protected speech]]''.   In the [[United States]], compelled speech is governed by  the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendments]] to the Constitution. In the same way that the First Amendment protects free expression, in many cases it similarly protects an individual from being required to utter or otherwise express a thought with which they disagree.

==Canada==
In Canada, the concept of "compelled speech" became controversial following the [[Government of Canada|Canadian federal government]]'s [[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Bill C-16]], which would add "gender identity or expression" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]]. [[University of Toronto]] Psychology professor and [[Clinical psychology#Professional practice|clinical psychologist]], [[Jordan Peterson]], used the term "compelled speech" to describe the bill on September 27, 2016, in his lecture video series on his [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref name="dimanno"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rosie|last=DiManno|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/19/new-words-trigger-an-abstract-clash-on-campus-dimanno.html|title=New words trigger an abstract clash on campus|date=November 19, 2016|work=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he denounced [[political correctness]], in general because of [[free speech]], and compelled speech, in particular.

==United Kingdom==

[[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] protects the right of freedom of expression, and [[Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998|section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998]], requires that as far as possible all legislation is given effect in a way which is compatible with this. In ''[[LGBT_rights_in_Northern_Ireland#Ashers_Bakery_case|Lee vs Ashers Baking Company Ltd]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] considered whether a bakery in [[Northern Ireland]] had violated anti-discrimination law by refusing to decorate a cake with a message in support of [[gay marriage]], with which the bakers disagreed on religious grounds. They held that although the bakery may have discriminated on the basis of the customer's political beliefs, which would in itself contravene the [[Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2017-0020-judgment.pdf Judgment], part III&lt;/ref&gt;, the legislation had to be "read down" in a way which would not violate the defendants' Article 10 rights, taken to include the right ''not'' to express a particular opinion. The right in Article 9 is a limited right because it permits restrictions on free speech that are necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of a legitimate aim, but the Supreme Court found that no such justification existed in this case.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', part IV&lt;/ref&gt; (The court also considered whether the defendants had discriminated based on sexual orientation, but because they concluded that they had not done, the court did not need to consider whether the relevant legislation should be similarly read down.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;)

During [[The Killing Time]] of the 1680s an [[Abjuration Oath]] could be put to suspects where they were given the option to [[Abjuration|abjure]] or renounce their allegiances.

'''Construction''', also referred as construction/reconstruction is a widely used, yet vaguely defined topic of modern [[psychoanalysis]]. According to its proponents, [[Freud]] in his later writings had already distinguished between construction and interpretation, hence construction/reconstruction is being a kind of "upgrade" of interpretation. There is a strong difference between simple interpretation and construction concerning how to see the past. In the interpretations the past is discovered as a preexisting phenomenon, while in the construction the past is not just simply found, but it is also created.

In the therapeutical setting a simple interpretation of the patient's claims is usually leading to a conterproductive debate about who is more correct, the patient or the [[psychoanalyst|analyst]]. The construction is attended to overcome this debate by using only the patient´s material, without the invasions from the analsyst's side (a resemblance to methods of Malan and Davanloo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.sk/books?id=9zcEXiuo8E8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=malan+davanloo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cZ4vvE0t_r&amp;sig=8E3ZM2UMglBX0kzasZnWWZoFL58&amp;hl=sk&amp;ei=mCT_TdOeOsOcOui56d4I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=malan%20davanloo&amp;f=false Malan and Davanloo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The patient, unable to avoid the truth (the situation that his/her truth is discovered), is either producing a confession (hence validating the construction), or producing further [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] and [[association (psychology)|associations]].

A professionally led construction is inescapable, as it does not use persuasion, paradoxical intentions, etc. 
Elements of construction are traceable e.g. in the [[intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy]], in the [[Reid technique|Reid's interrogation technique]], or in diplomatic/political discourses (e.g. [[William Ury]]'s approach in ''[[Getting to Yes]]'').{{cn|date=December 2016}}

== Criticism ==

Although construction is claimed to be a nondirective approach (it uses no contamination of the revealed [[psyche (psychology)|psychic]] material), the main criticism targets the effect of construction on human [[freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] and [[human dignity|dignity]]. 
Some critics state that the construction is especially attractive for those therapists who themselves are missing some parts of their own personality, and who by "depatterning" and "reassembling" the patient (see. [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Donald E. Cameron]]) are repeating their own personal losses.

[[File:White-tailed_deer.jpg|thumb|350px|Due to the deer's prevalence across different types of terrain, importance as a game animal and free and unrestricted nature the animal is a popular component of country symbolism.]]

'''Country''', as an [[Self-concept| identity]] or descriptive quality, is the state or character of being rural regardless of environment. It can be at direct odds with  quantitative measures of ruralness such as [[Rural area| those used by governments for statistical analysis]]. Country is [[Subjectivity| subjective]] and often [[intuitive]]. It encompasses a broad base of ideas and perceptions that may differ at local, regional or national levels. The term country can be used to refer to individuals both in singular and plural, while the term '''countryfolk''' is exclusively used collectively.

==Social development==
Identity has the tendency to be more localized within relatively isolated populations. Such populations, having distinct traditions of their own, can often be viewed as an [[Ingroups_and_outgroups| outgroup]] and marginalized by the dominant culture. Accordingly, contrast between rural and urban realities not only produces measurable differences politically and economically, but also affects populations in terms of social identification.&lt;ref name="knowingyourplace"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Country conceptualization shifts the focus away from the prevailing forces in society (usually centered in larger, metropolitan regions) and towards those on the periphery of society (remote areas and small towns). Consequently, this transition causes rural populations to feel less ignored, better connected with rural [[diaspora]] and significantly more empowered. By extension this transition highlights that rural culture is pervasive and does not necessarily depend on residing in a rural area. As a result country conceptualization  often assists in reversing the psychological consequences of frequent marginalization.
[[File:Town_mouse_country_mouse.png|left|{{largethumb}}|An illustration of [[The_Town_Mouse_and_the_Country_Mouse| "The Town Mouse and Country Mouse"]] of  ''Aesop's Fables'' an early parable of urban and rural equality/divide.]]
==Cognitive definitions== 
Country is a [[Subjectively| subjective state]] that perceives the [[rural area| rural]] [[experience]] as focal and inseparable to ones [[collective identity| identity]], regardless of location. This is often expressed in the [[social exclusion| demarginalization]] of ideas, values or lifestyles held as being representative of such a character. A concise understanding of Country as an overarching concept is difficult due to the tendency by observers to equate it with frequently  associated elements. As well, by individuals and groups denoting Country with classification that limits in such terms (IE "rural working-class culture" or "southern culture").  However it is perhaps best epitomized not in objective elements, as place, class or [[Natural environment|environment]], but rather in its subjective symbolism and by the perception that individuals can continue to retain a sense of ''ruralness'' even in urbanized areas. As there is no definitive, scholarly consensus on precisely what constitutes as Country, much of its discourse can be attributed to the artistic community who describe it in [[Romanticism| romanticized]] ways. In her master thesis, ''Manifestations of Collective Identity in Country Music - Cultural, Regional, National'', Stephanie Schäfer denotes that [[country music]] is important tool for reinforcing this collective identity.
&lt;ref name="schafer"&gt;{{ cite thesis | last=Schäfer | first=Stephanie | authorlink=  | ISBN=978-3-8428-2301-3 | publisher=Diplomica Verlag GmbH | title=Manifestations of Collective Identity in Country Music - Cultural, Regional, National | url= | year=2011 | degree=MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Schäfer's analysis of country music as losing much of its "ground" in recent years through commercialization, even modern songs such as ''[[How Country Feels]]'' (Randy Houser), ''[[A Little More Country Than That]]'' (Easton Corbin), ''I'm Country'' (Craig Morgan), ''[[She's Country]]'' (Jason Aldean), etc. continue to, directly or indirectly, address the topic of Country conceptualization.  For example, Luke Bryan in ''[[Doin'_My_Thing| What Country Is]]'' illustrates Country by contrasting it with what it is not. He elaborates that:

{{quotation|"It [Country] ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture,

It's cars pulling over for a no cap tractor,

It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips, 

No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with, 

That's what country is."}}

This emphasis of non-material culture over material resonates with the rural experience as being represented through material elements rather than solely consisting of them.  Within the United States country frequently transcends a close relationship with the [[Culture of the Southern United States]] as a source of unity and empowerment of local, marginalized peoples who feel left out from the dominant culture. The preference to identify as country before more tradition means of classification, such as race or class, is reflected of [[self-determination theory]]. As human beings have an inherent drive to better their association with others they consistently try to do so more effectively. Country identification is one way in that an individual strives for this realization by identifying in ways that are more advantageous to rural populations and not necessarily in ways dictated by mainstream society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12015">A '''crime against peace''', in [[international law]], is "planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of [[War of aggression|wars of aggression]], or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing".&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of crimes against peace was first incorporated into the [[Nuremberg Principles]] and later included in the [[United Nations Charter]]. This definition would play a part in defining [[Aggression (war crime)|aggression as a crime against peace]]. It can also refer to the core international crimes set out in [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], ([[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]]) which adopted crimes negotiated previously in the Draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind.

An important exception to the foregoing are defensive military actions taken under [[Article 51]] of the UN Charter. Such defensive actions are subject to immediate [[Security Council]] review, but do not require UN permission to be legal within international law. "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations." (UN Charter, Article 51) The Security Council will determine if the action is legally the "right of individual or collective self-defence", or it may appoint another UN organ to do this.

==Definition==

{{Original research section|date=June 2008}}
No legal authority exists for the definition of the terms ''"[[territorial integrity]]"'', ''"[[independence|political independence]]"'' and ''"[[sovereignty]]"''. However, their [[face value]] would seem to disclose the following:

* The ''"territorial integrity"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent permanently to deprive a state of any part or parts of its territory, not excluding territories for the foreign affairs of which it is responsible;
* The ''"political independence"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent to deprive a state of the entirety of one or more of the prerequisites of statehood, namely: defined territory, permanent population, constitutionally independent government and the means of conducting relations with other States;
* The ''"sovereignty"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent to overthrow the government of a state or to impede its freedom to act unhindered, as it sees fit, throughout its jurisdiction.

This definition of the crime of aggression belongs to ''[[jus cogens]]'', which is supreme in the hierarchy of [[international law]] and, therefore, it cannot be modified by, or give way to, any rule of international law but one of the same rank. An arguable example is any rule imposing a conflicting obligation to prevent, interdict or vindicate crimes which also belong to ''jus cogens'', namely [[aggression]] itself, [[crimes against humanity]], [[genocide]], [[war crimes]], [[slavery]], [[torture]] and [[piracy]], so that a war waged consistent with the aim of repressing any of these crimes might not be illegal where the crime comes within the limit of [[Proportionality (political maxim)|proportionality]] relative to [[war]] and its characteristic effects.

==Kellogg-Briand Pact==
In 1928, the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], known as the ''General Treaty for the Renunciation of War'', said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a nation does not register with the UN as recognizing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, even if the nation had signed it, the UN cannot hold a claimed violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to be a violation of international law (according to its own Charter, Article 102). The interpretation of Article 102 is reserved to the Security Council, so it is possible that a "crime against peace" might be found by the Security Council, regardless.

==Nuremberg Principles==

In 1945, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] defined three categories of crimes, including ''crimes against peace''. This definition was first used in [[Finland]] to prosecute the political leadership in the [[War-responsibility trials in Finland]]. The principles were later known as the [[Nuremberg Principles]].

In 1950, the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Tribunal]] defined Crimes against Peace (in Principle VI.a, submitted to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]) as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances; 
(ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council, which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939"

For committing this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced a number of persons responsible for starting [[World War II]].  One consequence of this is that nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or - it seems - the enforcement of the [[criminal law]] of ''[[jus cogens]]''. It has made formal [[declaration of war]] uncommon after 1945.

During the trial, the chief American prosecutor, [[Robert H. Jackson]], stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Associate Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]] charged that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were guilty of "substituting power for principle" at Nuremberg. "I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled.", he wrote. "Law was created [[ex post facto]] to suit the passion and clamor of the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson, Jr |first1=H. K.|last2=Strutz |first2=Henry|date= |title=Dönitz at Nuremberg: A Reappraisal |url= |location= |publisher=Torrance|page= |isbn=978-0939484058  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations Charter==
The first article of the [[United Nations Charter]] says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Purposes of the [[United Nations]] are:

#To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the [[peace]], and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of [[justice]] and [[international law]], adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a [[breach of the peace]];
#To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of [[Civil rights|equal rights]] and [[self-determination]] of [[peoples]], and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The interdiction of [[War of Aggression|aggressive war]] was confirmed and broadened by the United Nations' Charter, which states in article 2, paragraph 4 that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 33===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.

The [[Security Council]] shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to settle their dispute by such means. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 39===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Security Council]] shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 51===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the [[United Nations]], until the [[Security Council]] has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==U.S. laws of war==

The [[U.S. Army]]'s ''Law of Land Warfare'' (Field Manual 27-10) states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
498. [[Crimes Under International Law]]

Any person, whether a member of the armed forces or a civilian, who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment. Such offenses in connection with war comprise:

:a. '''Crimes against peace.'''
:b. Crimes against humanity.
:c. War crimes.

Although this manual recognizes the criminal responsibility of individuals for those offenses which may comprise any of the foregoing types of crimes, members of the armed forces will normally be concerned, only with those offenses constituting "war crimes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/27-10/Ch8.htm#s2 FM 27-10 Chptr 8 Remedies for Violation of International Law; War Crimes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (emphasis added)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vietnam's Criminal Code==

[[Vietnam]]'s Criminal Code calls this crime as the crime of "Undermining peace, provoking aggressive wars".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chapter XXIV: CRIMES OF UNDERMINING PEACE, AGAINST HUMANITY AND WAR CRIMES

:Article 341. Undermining peace, provoking aggressive wars

::Those who propagate and/or incite wars of aggression, or prepare, carry out or participate in wars of aggression against the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country, shall be sentenced to between twelve years and twenty years of imprisonment, life imprisonment or capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/en/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=610 Vietnam's PENAL CODE]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3187">'''Curtis V. Cooper''' was an American [[health care]] and [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] leader from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Early background==

He was born in 1932 in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and had [[African-American|Black]] heritage.  He graduated from [[Savannah State University|Savannah State College]], but his lack of financial resources prevented him from achieving his dream of becoming a physician.

==Civil rights leader==

Cooper took part in the civil rights movement.  He was a leader in the local Youth Council of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]] and later became president of the NAACP Savannah Branch.

==Health care provider==

Cooper is credited with reshaping health care for the poor in his native city.  In 1972, he secured funds for the establishment of a comprehensive health center for the city's indigent and served as its executive director. Under his management, it grew into the Westside-Urban Health Center, a major medical resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savstate.edu/alumni/comm/Curtis%20V%20Cooper%20Health%20Fair%20-%20March.pdf Curtis V. Cooper Health Fair to Students, Community, Loretta Heyward, Savannah State University, March 30, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140208/http://www.savstate.edu/alumni/comm/Curtis%20V%20Cooper%20Health%20Fair%20-%20March.pdf |date=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Cooper became one of the first black members of [[Memorial Medical Center, Savannah|Memorial Medical Center]]'s board of directors.  In 1995, he became chairman of that same board.  He also was the chairman of the Chatham County Hospital Authority twice and he served on the Georgia State Access to Health Care Commission and the Georgia State Health Strategies Council.

There are currently three ''Curtis V. Cooper Primary Health Care'' facilities.  They are located at:

* 106 East Broad Street (near Broughton Street in Savannah's Historic District);
* 840 Hitch Drive;
* 2 Roberts Street (on the corner of West Bay Street near [[Garden City, Georgia]]).

==Death==

Cooper died in January 2000.  Soon after, the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] passed a resolution to express their regret at the passing of Curtis V. Cooper and convey their sincerest sympathy to the members of his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/1999_00/fulltext/hr806.htm House Resolution 806 - Curtis V. Cooper; condolences, Georgia House of Representatives, January 13, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804011823/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/1999_00/fulltext/hr806.htm |date=August 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor==

The following landmark was named to honor Curtis Cooper:

* The ''Curtis V. Cooper Garden'', a terrasse from the ''Savannah International Trade &amp; Convention Center''

[[File:Oscar II, Svensk porträttgalleri.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in a pre-1900 photograph.]]
'''Dissenter Acts''' ({{lang-sv|Dissenterlagarna}}) were laws, enacted by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]] with the consent of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]], which gave [[nonconformism|nonconformist]]s who wanted to leave the then established [[Church of Sweden]] the right to do so, provided that the [[dissenter]]s then joined one of the state-approved denominations. The first such edict was decreed in 1860 by [[Charles XV of Sweden|Karl XV]] and the ''[[Riksdag of the Estates|Ståndsriksdag]]''; the second one in 1873 by [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] and the reorganized bicameral ''[[History of the Riksdag|Riksdag]]''. Neither the ''Ståndsriksdag'', divided into four Estates, nor the newer ''Riksdag'' could be said to be truly democratic, though, as the [[suffrage]] was restricted to males who owned property. The 1873 edict remained in force until the 1951 Religious Freedom Act (''religionsfrihetslag''); the Church of Sweden remained the established state church until 2000.

Despite the enactment of the Dissenter Acts, nonconformists were still required to financially support the then established Church of Sweden:

:The state religion is the Evangelical Lutheran doctrine, in the sense that the churches which have concurred in this creed are described as a state church, placed under the king's (government's) "supervision, care and defence," for which the state so defines its constitution and economy that the King and his Cabinet Council determines the religion. This religion is taught in state schools and has special constitutional protection; furthermore, its clergy constitute an Estate of the realm. There shall be a Board of Education to which the king will appoint church officials. '''Holidays of the state church shall be respected even by adherents of foreign creeds, who also must contribute to its expenses.''' The king and parliament participate in the establishment of canon law; the king establishes the church bylaws. It has even happened that His Royal Majesty has contributed government funds to reward preachers who have countered heterodox dissenters. The king is ''summus episcopus'' (archbishop), the Church's head and governor (''cujus est regio, illius est religio'', "The religion of a country is that of its ruler"), with a territorial system as opposed to hierarchical and self-governing systems.&lt;ref name="hagman"&gt;"''Statsreligion är den ev.-lutherska läran så till vida, att det kyrkosamfund, som anslutit sig till denna trosbekännelse, betecknas såsom statskyrka, d. v. s. står under konungens (statens) »uppsikt, vård och försvar», hvarför staten ordnar dess författning och ekonomi. Jfr best:na om konungens och statsrådens religion. Denna religion läres i statens skolor samt är genom grundlag särskildt skyddad, hvarförutom dess präster utgjort ett riksstånd; ett ecklesiastikdepartement skall finnas; konungen tillsätter en del kyrkliga ämbetsmän; statskyrkans helgdagar skola respekteras äfven af främmande trosbekännare, som ock måste bidraga till dess utgifter; konung och riksdag deltaga i kyrkolags stiftande, konungen gifver kyrkostadgar. Det har till och med händt, att k. m:t lämnat bidrag af statsmedel till aflönande af extra predikant med uppgift att motverka vissa dissenters villomeningar. Konungen är ''summus episcopus'' (summ-episkopat), kyrkans hufvud- och styresman (''cujus est regio, illius est religio''): territorialsystem i motsats till hierarkiakt och associationssystem.''"

[[Image:Le droit du Seigneur by Vasiliy Polenov.jpg|right|thumb|350px|[[Vasily Polenov]]: ''Le droit du Seigneur'' (1874); a nineteenth-century artist's painting of an old man bringing his young daughters to their feudal lord.]]

'''''Droit du seigneur''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|ɑː|_|d|ə|_|s|eɪ|ˈ|n|j|ɜr}}; {{IPA-fr|dʁwa dy sɛɲœʁ|lang}}, 'lord's right'), also known as '''''jus primae noctis''''' ({{IPAc-en|ʒ|ʌ|s|_|ˈ|p|r|aɪ|m|i|_|ˈ|n|ɒ|k|t|ɪ|s}}; {{IPA-la|ju:s ˈpri:mae̯ 'nɔktɪs|lang}}, 'right of the first night'), refers to a supposed [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] in medieval Europe, allowing [[Feudalism|feudal lords]] to have sexual relations with subordinate women, in particular, on their wedding nights.

Some scholars believe the "right" might have existed in medieval Europe.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}}{{sfn|McKechnie|1930|pages=310–311}} Others say that it is a myth, and that all references to it are from later periods.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=311–312}}

Similar customs have been recorded elsewhere.

==Terminology==
The French expression ''droit du seigneur'' translates as "right of the lord", but native French prefer the terms ''droit de jambage'' ({{IPA-fr|dʁwa d(ə) ʒɑ̃baʒ|lang}}, from ''jambe'', 'leg') or ''droit de cuissage'' ({{IPA-fr|dʁwa d(ə) kɥisaʒ|lang}}, from ''cuisse'', 'thigh').

The term is often used synonymously with ''jus primae noctis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|jus primæ noctis}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "right of the first night".

==Ancient era==

In the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', [[Gilgamesh]] is described as having practiced a similar custom:  "He is king, he does whatever he wants... takes the girl from her mother and uses her, the warrior's daughter, the young man's bride."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gilgamesh: A New English Version|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|publisher=Free Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7432-6164-7|location=New York, USA|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentions a similar custom among the [[Marmarica|Adyrmachidae]] in [[ancient Libya]]: "They are also the only tribe with whom the custom obtains of bringing all women about to become brides before the king, that he may choose such as are agreeable to him."&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, iv.168 ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.htm on-line text]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the plebians of the Etruscan city of [[Volsinii]] rebelled against the aristocrats in 280 BC, "They took their wives for themselves and placed the daughters of the nobles under the ''jus primae noctis'', while all their former masters on whom they could lay hands were tortured to death."&lt;ref&gt;Von Vacano, Otto-Wilhelm, ''The Etruscans in the Ancient World'', at 164 (Indiana University Press)({{ISBN|0253200814}}). &lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
[[File:Ivrea Carnevale Mugnaia 03.JPG|thumb|287px|The [[Battle of the Oranges#Miller's daughter|Mugnaia]] in [[Ivrea]], Italy, taking part in a festival that supposedly commemorates a revolt against the ''droit du seigneur'']]
The medieval marriage fine or [[merchet]] has been interpreted as a payment for the ''droit du seigneur'' to be waived.&lt;ref name="fibri.de"&gt;''[http://www.fibri.de/jus/arthbes.htm The jus primae noctis as a male power display: A review of historic sources with evolutionary interpretation]'' by Jörg Wettlaufer - Evolution and Human Behavior, Vol 21, Nr. 2 (2000): 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it has been interpreted as compensation to the lord for the young women leaving his lands.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}} 

A similar payment to church authorities has also been interpreted as relating the ''droit du seigneur''. However, according to British scholar WD Howarth, the church at some times prohibited consummation of a marriage on the first night. The payment was for an indulgence from the church to waive this prohibition.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=301–302}}

The life of [[Gerald of Aurillac]] written by [[Odo of Cluny]] (879-942) gives an account of the young nobleman demanding sex with one of his serfs, only to have the act averted by a miracle, sending Gerald on the road to sainthood. American historian [[Vern Bullough]] suggested that this illustrates that such behaviour was commonplace in the period, and that the "legend [of ''droit du seigneur''] reflected the reality".{{sfn|Bullough|1991|pp=164–165}}

In the fourteenth-century French epic poem ''[[Baudouin de Sebourc]]'', a tyrannical lord claims the ''jus primae noctis'' unless he receives part of the bride's dowry.&lt;ref name="fibri.de"/&gt;

The supposed right was abolished by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in Article 9 of the ''[[Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe]]'' in 1486.{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=239}}

==Later European references==
[[File:HectorBoece.jpg|left|thumb|Hector Boece, the first historian to record the ''droit due seigneur'', in 1527]]
In 1527, Scottish historian [[Hector Boece]] wrote that the "right" had existed in Scotland until abolished by [[Malcolm III]] (r. 1058-93) under the influence of his wife, Margaret (later [[St Margaret of Scotland]]). The payment of [[merchet]] was instituted in its place.{{sfn|Boureau|1998|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}} Boece attributed the law to a legendary [[King Ewen]] (Evenus) III.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=298}} Modern French scholar Alain Boureau says that Boece probably invented King Ewen, but he was mythologising not polemicising.{{sfn|Boureau|1998|pp=17–18}}

Other Scottish scholars of his era quoted Boece with approval, including [[John Lesley]] (1578),  [[George Buchanan]] (1582), and [[Habbakuk Bisset]] (1626).{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}}{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=17}} The historical existence of the custom in Scotland was also accepted in Scottish legal works such as [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich|James Balfour]]'s ''Practicks'' (c 1579), [[John Skene, Lord Curriehill|John Skene]]'s ''De Verborum'' (1597), and [[Thomas Craig (jurist)|Thomas Craig]]'s ''Jus Feudale'' (1603).{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}} English scholar [[Henry Spelman]] stated in his ''Glossary'' (1664) that the custom had existed in Scotland, but not in England.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}} English jurist [[William Blackstone]] cited Boece's statement in his [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] (1765–1769), while similarly noting that the custom had never existed in England.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/blackstone-commentaries-on-the-laws-of-england-in-four-books-2-vols Commentaries on the Laws of England]'', volume 1, book 1, chapter 6, p. [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2140#lf1387-01_mnt_537 83].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, Scottish jurist [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] disputed the existence of the custom, arguing Boece's account was purely legendary, but his position was often seen as based on Scottish patriotism.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=305–306, 310}} However, according to Scottish legal scholar [[David Maxwell Walker]], there have been instances recorded of the ''jus'' being claimed up to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}}{{sfn|McKechnie|1930|pp=309–310}} Walker concluded that it is possible that the ''jus'' existed as a custom in Scotland, dependent on the attitude of the king, and survived longer in remote regions.{{sfn|Walker|1988|p=328}}

The right was mentioned in 1556 in the ''Recueil d'arrêts notables des cours souveraines de France'' of French lawyer and author [[Jean Papon]].{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=203}} French writer [[Antoine du Verdier]] also commented on it in 1577.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=301}}

In Shakespeare's play, ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' (c 1591), the rebel [[Jack Cade]] proclaimed, "there shall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|first=William|last=Shakespeare|title=Henry VI, Part 2|page=Act IV, Scene VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to French scholar Alain Boureau, Cade was demanding the payment of merchet, not the right of first night,{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=266}} but others disagree.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=299–300}}

The Spanish novel [[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]] (1617) by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] contains an episode where a bride and groom escape a barbaric marriage custom in Ireland. According to British scholar WD Howarth, Cervantes was inspired by Peruvian marriage ceremonies and what is described is different from the classic version of the ''droit du seigneur'' as it involves multiple virgins. However, Cervantes' story was a source for the English play [[The Custom of the Country (play)|The Custom of the Country]], written by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and [[Philip Massinger]] and published in 1647. The play has the classic version of the "right of first night" with money payment as an alternative. According to Howarth, this suggests that ''droit du seigneur'' was a familiar notion to people at that time, which he traces back to Boece.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=296–298}}

The [[Jesuit]] hagiographical work [[Acta Sanctorum]] (Acts of the Saints), published from 1643 onwards, recorded the existence of ''jus primae noctis'' in its biographies of St Margaret and [[St Forannan]].{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=19–20}}

English lexicographer [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]] recorded the "right" as a medieval custom of some English manors in ''Fragmenta Antiquitatis'' in 1679.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=300}}

French philosopher [[Montesquieu]] referred to the practice in [[The Spirit of the Laws]] (1748), saying that it had been enforced in France over three nights.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=302}}

[[File:Maurice Quentin de La Tour, portrait de Voltaire (1735) avec agrandissement.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Voltaire, the first person to use the term ''droit du seigneur'', in 1762]]
[[Voltaire]] mentioned the practice in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', published in 1764.{{sfn|Boureau|1998|p=41}} He wrote the five-act comedy ''Le droit du seigneur'' or ''L'écueil du sage''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|2-911825-04-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1762, although it was not performed until 1779, after his death. This play was the first time the term ''droit du seigneur'' was used.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=304}} In eighteenth-century France, a number of writers made other claims about the supposed power of the overlords during the [[Ancien Régime]], such as the ''droit de ravage'' (right of ravage; providing to the lord the right to devastate fields of his own domain), and the ''droit de prélassement'' (right of lounging; it was said that a lord had the right to disembowel his serfs to warm his feet in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Péricard-Méa|first=Denise|title=Le Moyen âge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRwi1yDx-H8C&amp;pg=PA90|year=2005|publisher=Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot|isbn=9782877478236|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their travels in Scotland in 1773, [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] documented the custom of the payment of [[merchet]], linking it with the "right of first night". They paralleled it with that custom of [[Borough English]], suggesting that the English custom favored the youngest son because the paternity of the eldest son was doubtful.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|p=299}}

In [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', which premiered in 1786 with a libretto by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], the comic plot revolves around the successful efforts of the young bride and groom, Figaro and Susanna, to block the efforts of the unfaithful Count Almaviva to seduce Susanna. To achieve his aim, the frustrated Count threatens to reinstitute ''droit du seigneur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMarriageOfFigaro|title=The Marriage of Figaro (Theatre) - TV Tropes|website=TV Tropes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on a play by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]].{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}}

British writer [[Isaac D'Israeli]] stated the practice had been widespread across Europe in his best-selling book, ''The Curiosities of Literature'' (1823).{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=302, 310}} Sir [[Walter Scott]] mentioned the custom in his historical Scottish novel, [[The Fair Maid of Perth]] (1828).{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}}

==Debate in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries==

Scholars in the nineteenth and twentieth century gave the historical basis of the "right of first night" a good deal of attention.{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}} Over time, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] and the [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] encyclopedias dramatically changed their opinion on the topic.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=292–293}} French writer [[Louis Veuillot]], a champion of Catholicism, wrote a book in 1854 disputing its existence.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=308–309}} After an historical exhaustive study, German jurist Karl Schmidt concluded in 1881 that it was a scholarly misconception.{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}} After Schmidt, many of those who believed in the existence of the custom based their opinions on anthropological studies of tribal societies, though according to WD Howarth this was a misguided argument because of the disparity between the tribal societies and medieval European society.{{sfn|Howarth|1971|pp=293–295}}

In ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' in 1884, socialist [[Friedrich Engels]] argued it was real and had an anthropological origin.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State''], 1884, pp 28, 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1930, Scottish legal scholar Hector McKechnie concluded, based on historical evidence, that the practice had existed in Scotland in early times.{{sfn|McKechnie|1930|pages=310–311}}

Italian scholar [[Paolo Mantegazza]], in his 1935 book ''The Sexual Relations of Mankind'', said that while not a law, it was most likely a binding custom.{{sfn|Bullough|1991|p=163}}

==Non-European examples==
As late as the nineteenth century, some [[Kurds|Kurdish]] chieftains in [[Anatolia]] raped [[Armenians|Armenian]] brides on their wedding night (part of what was then known as the ''khafir'' or ''hafir'' system).&lt;ref&gt;Barsoumian, Hagop.

In the Hawaiian Islands, marriage in the Western sense did not exist until the arrival of Christian missionaries; there was no word for husband or wife in the Hawaiian language. The privilege for chiefs was often observed, according to "''Sexual Behavior in Pre Contact Hawai‘i''" by [[Milton Diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;(Revista Española del Pacifico. 2004. 16: 37-58)&lt;/ref&gt;  A young girl's parents viewed the coupling with favor.&lt;ref&gt;(Pukui, Haertig, and Lee, 1972, p. 91; Sahlins, 1985, p. 24)&lt;/ref&gt; If she were lucky, she might conceive his offspring and be allowed to keep it. When western ships arrived, young girls and wives eagerly coupled with sailors who, given their weapons and large ships, were thought to be gods.&lt;ref&gt;(Pukui, Haertig, and Lee, 1972, p. 92)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used to describe the sexual exploitation of slaves in the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origin of Others|last=Morrison|first=Toni|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-674-97645-0|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5249">{{For|general notions of duality in mathematics|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''duality''' is a correspondence between the properties of a category ''C'' and the '''dual properties''' of the [[opposite category]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;. Given a statement regarding the category ''C'', by interchanging the [[Domain of a function|source]] and [[Codomain|target]] of each [[morphism]] as well as interchanging the order of [[Function composition|composing]] two morphisms, a corresponding dual statement is obtained regarding the opposite category ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;. '''Duality''', as such, is the assertion that truth is invariant under this operation on statements. In other words, if a statement is true about ''C'', then its dual statement is true about ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, if a statement is false about ''C'', then its dual has to be false about ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;.

Given a [[concrete category]] ''C'', it is often the case that the opposite category ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; per se is abstract. ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; need not be a category that arises from mathematical practice. In this case, another category ''D'' is also termed to be in '''duality''' with ''C'' if ''D'' and ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; are [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent as categories]].

In the case when ''C'' and its opposite ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; are equivalent, such a category is '''self-dual'''.&lt;ref name="AdamekRosicky1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jiří Adámek|author2=J. Rosicky|title=Locally Presentable and Accessible Categories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXh6rOd7of0C&amp;pg=PA62|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42261-1|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==

We define the elementary language of category theory as the two-sorted [[first order language]] with objects and morphisms as distinct sorts, together with the relations of an object being the source or target of a morphism and a symbol for composing two morphisms.

Let σ be any statement in this language. We form the dual σ&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; as follows: 
# Interchange each occurrence of "source" in σ with "target".
# Interchange the order of composing morphisms. That is, replace each occurrence of &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;
Informally, these conditions state that the dual of a statement is formed by reversing [[morphism|arrows]] and [[function composition|compositions]].

''Duality'' is the observation that σ is true for some category ''C'' if and only if σ&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; is true for ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Mac Lane|1978|p=33}}{{sfn|Awodey|2010|p=53-55}}

==Examples==

* A morphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monomorphism]] if &lt;math&gt;f \circ g = f \circ h&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;g=h&lt;/math&gt;. Performing the dual operation, we get the statement that &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = h \circ f&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;g=h.&lt;/math&gt; For a morphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon B \to A&lt;/math&gt;, this is precisely what it means for ''f'' to be an [[epimorphism]]. In short, the property of being a monomorphism is dual to the property of being an epimorphism.

Applying duality, this means that a morphism in some category ''C'' is a monomorphism if and only if the reverse morphism in the opposite category ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; is an epimorphism.

* An example comes from reversing the direction of inequalities in a [[partial order]]. So if ''X'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and ≤ a partial order relation, we can define a new partial order relation ≤&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt; by

:: ''x'' ≤&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'' if and only if ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

This example on orders is a special case, since partial orders correspond to a certain kind of category in which Hom(''A'',''B'') can have at most one element. In applications to logic, this then looks like a very general description of negation (that is, proofs run in the opposite direction). For example, if we take the opposite of a [[lattice theory|lattice]], we will find that ''meets'' and ''joins'' have their roles interchanged. This is an abstract form of [[De Morgan's laws]], or of [[Duality (order theory)|duality]] applied to lattices.

* [[limit (category theory)|Limits]] and [[limit (category theory)|colimits]] are dual notions.
* [[Fibration]]s and [[cofibration]]s are examples of dual notions in [[algebraic topology]] and [[homotopy theory]]. In this context, the duality is often called [[Eckmann–Hilton duality]].

'''Energy technology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[engineering]] [[science]] having to do with the efficient, safe, [[environmentally friendly]] and economical extraction, conversion, transportation, storage and use of [[energy]], targeted towards yielding high efficiency whilst skirting [[adverse effect|side effects]] on humans, nature and the environment.

For people, energy is an overwhelming need and as a scarce [[resource]] it has been an underlying cause of political conflicts and wars. The gathering and use of energy resources can be harmful to local ecosystems and may have global outcomes.

==Interdisciplinary fields==
As an interdisciplinary science Energy technology is linked with many interdisciplinary fields in sundry, overlapping ways.

* [[Physics]], for [[thermodynamics]] and [[nuclear physics]]
* [[Chemistry]] for [[fuel]], [[combustion]], [[air pollution]], [[flue gas]], [[battery (electricity)|battery]] technology and [[fuel cells]].
* [[Electrical engineering]]
* [[Engineering]], often for fluid energy machines such as [[combustion engines]], turbines, pumps and [[compressors]].
* [[Geography]], for [[geothermal]] energy and exploration for resources.
* [[Mining]], for [[petrochemical]] and [[fossil fuels]].
* [[Agriculture]] and [[forestry]], for sources of renewable energy.
* [[Meteorology]] for [[wind]] and [[solar energy]].
* [[Water]] and [[Waterways]], for [[hydropower]].
* [[Waste management]], for environmental impact.
* [[Transportation]], for energy-saving transportation systems.
* [[Environmental studies]], for studying the effect of energy use and production on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[nature]] and [[climate change]].
* (Lighting Technology), for Interior and Exterior Natural as well as Artificial Lighting Design, Installations, and Energy Savings
* (Energy Cost/Benefit Analysis), for Simple Payback and Life Cycle Costing of Energy Efficiency/Conservation Measures Recommended

==Electrical engineering==
[[Image:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|High-voltage lines for the long distance transportation of electrical energy]]

[[Electric power engineering]] deals with the production and use of [[electrical energy]], which can entail the study of machines such as [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[electric motor]]s and [[transformer]]s. [[Infrastructure]] involves [[Electrical substation|substations]] and [[transformer station]]s, [[power line]]s and [[Power cable|electrical cable]]. [[Load management]] and [[power management]] over networks have meaningful sway on overall energy efficiency. [[Electric heating]] is also widely used and researched.

==Thermodynamics==
{{Main article|Thermodynamics}}

[[Thermodynamics]] deals with the fundamental laws of energy conversion and is drawn from theoretical [[Physics]].

==Thermal and chemical energy==
[[Image:Wood-fired grate stoker.jpg|thumb|left|A [[wikt:grate|grate]] for a wood fire]]
Thermal and chemical energy are intertwined with [[chemistry]] and [[environmental studies]]. [[Combustion]] has to do with [[Gas burner|burner]]s and chemical [[engine]]s of all kinds, grates and [[incinerator]]s along with their energy efficiency, [[pollution]] and operational safety.

[[Exhaust gas]] purification technology aims to lessen [[air pollution]] through sundry mechanical, thermal and chemical cleaning methods. [[Emission control (disambiguation)|Emission control]] technology is a field of [[process engineering|process]] and [[chemical engineering]]. [[Boiler]] technology deals with the design, construction and operation of [[steam]] boilers and [[steam turbine|turbine]]s (also used in nuclear power generation, see below), drawn from [[applied mechanics]] and [[materials engineering]].

[[Energy conversion]] has to do with internal combustion engines, turbines, pumps, fans and so on, which are used for transportation, mechanical energy and power generation. High thermal and mechanical loads bring about operational safety worries which are dealt with through many branches of applied engineering science.
{{Clear}}

==Nuclear energy==
[[Image:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|A [[steam turbine]].]]
[[Nuclear technology]] deals with [[nuclear power]] production from [[nuclear reactor]]s, along with the processing of nuclear fuel and disposal of radioactive waste, drawing from applied [[nuclear physics]], [[nuclear chemistry]] and [[radiation]] science.

Nuclear power generation has been politically controversial in many countries for several decades but the electrical energy produced through [[nuclear fission]] is of worldwide importance. There are high hopes that [[Fusion power|fusion]] technologies will one day replace most fission reactors but this is still a research area of [[nuclear physics]].

==Renewable energy==
{{Main article|Renewable energy}}
[[Image:Nellis AFB Solar panels.jpg|thumb|Solar ([[photovoltaic]]) panels at a military base in the US.]]
[[Renewable energy]] has many branches.

===Solar power===
{{Main article|Solar power}}

* [[Photovoltaic]] power draws electricity from solar radiation through [[solar cells]], either locally or in large photovoltaic power plants and uses [[semiconductor]] technology.
* [[Solar heating]] uses [[solar panel]]s which gather heat from sunlight to heat buildings and water.
* [[Solar thermal power]] produces electricity by converting solar heat.

===Wind power===
[[Image:WindMills.jpg|right|thumb|[[Wind turbine]]s on [[Inner Mongolia]]n grassland]]
{{Main article|Wind power}}

[[Wind turbine]]s draw energy from atmospheric currents and are designed using [[aerodynamics]] along with knowledge taken from mechanical and electrical engineering.

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal}}

Where it can be had, [[geothermal]] energy is used for heating and electricity.

===Hydropower===
[[Image:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|Building of [[Pelton turbine|Pelton water turbine]]s in [[Germany]].]]
{{Main article|Hydropower}}

Hydropower draws mechanical energy from rivers, [[wave power plant|ocean waves]] and [[tidal power|tides]]. [[Civil engineering]] is used to study and build [[dam]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[waterways]] and manage coastal resources through [[hydrology]] and [[geology]]. A low speed [[water turbine]] spun by flowing water can power an [[electrical generator]] to produce electricity.

===Bioenergy===
{{Main article|Bioenergy}}
Bioenergy deals with the gathering, processing and use of biomasses grown in biological manufacturing, [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] from which [[power plant]]s can draw burning fuel. [[Ethanol]], [[methanol]] (both controversial) or hydrogen for [[fuel cells]] can be had from these technologies and used to generate electricity.

===Enabling technologies===

[[Heat pumps]] and [[Thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or [[waste heat]] from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|between opposing seasons]] (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]]. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called [[phase-change material]]s (PCMs).

[[File:Extermination of Evil Sendan Kendatsuba crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the five paintings of ''[[Extermination of Evil]]'' portrays Sendan Kendatsuba, one of the eight guardians of Buddhist law, banishing evil.]]

'''Evil''', in a general sense, is the opposite or absence of [[good]]. It can be an extremely broad concept, though in everyday usage is often used more narrowly to denote profound [[wickedness]]. It is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal [[moral evil]] commonly associated with the word, or impersonal [[natural evil]] (as in the case of natural disasters or illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the demonic or supernatural/eternal.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil can denote profound [[immorality]]&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |title=Evil |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but typically not without some basis in the understanding of the [[human condition]], where [[wikt:strife|strife]] and [[suffering]] (cf. [[Hinduism]]) are the true roots of evil.  In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a [[supernatural]] force.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"/&gt; As defined in [[philosophy]]{{fact|date=July 2018}} it can be the name for the [[psychology]] and [[instinct]] of individuals which [[selfish]]ly but often necessarily [[Defence mechanism|defends]] the personal boundary against deadly attacks and serious threats. Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''.

While the term is applied to events and conditions without agency, the forms of evil addressed in this article presume an evildoer or doers.

Some religions and philosophies deny evil's existence and usefulness in describing people.

==Etymology==
The [[modern English]] word ''evil'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|yfel}}) and its [[cognate]]s such as the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Übel}} and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|euvel}} are widely considered to come from a [[Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed form of ''*ubilaz'', comparable to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''huwapp-'' ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|''*wap-''}} and suffixed zero-grade form {{PIE|''*up-elo-''}}. Other later Germanic forms include [[Middle English]] {{lang|enm|evel}}, {{lang|enm|ifel}}, {{lang|enm|ufel}}, [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|evel}} (adjective and noun), [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|ubil}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ubil}}, and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got-Latn|ubils}}.

The root meaning of the word is of obscure origin though shown&lt;ref&gt;See 'Evil' entry in [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; to be akin to modern [[German language|German]] ''[[:de:Das Übel|Das Übel]]'' (although ''evil'' is normally translated as ''Das Böse'') with the basic idea of [[transgression (disambiguation)|transgressing]].&lt;ref name="Harper2001"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Harper, Douglas |year=2001 |title=Etymology for evil |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=evil|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese moral philosophy==
:''Main: [[Confucius#Ethics|Confucian Ethics]], [[Confucianism]] and ''[[Taoism#Ethics|Taoist Ethics]]''
As with Buddhism, in [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]] there is no direct analogue to the way ''good and evil'' are opposed although reference to ''demonic influence'' is common in [[Chinese folk religion]]. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Thus ''evil'' would correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in that system, but the opposite of the cardinal virtues of Taoism, compassion, moderation, and humility can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good&amp;evil.htm ''Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529010501/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good%26evil.htm |date=2006-05-29 }} C.W.

Ch. XIV Liu Chiu-Yuan, Wang Shou-Jen, and Ming Idealism. part 6 § 6 ''Origin of Evil''. Uses strikingly similar language to that in the etymology section of this article, in the context of Chinese Idealism.&lt;/ref&gt;

==European philosophy==
===Spinoza===
[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedict de Spinoza]] states
{{quote|1. By good, I understand that which we certainly know is useful to us. &lt;br /&gt; 2. By evil, on the contrary, I understand that which we certainly know hinders us from possessing anything that is good.&lt;ref name="ebgb"&gt;Benedict de Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Part IV ''Of Human Bondage or of the Strength of the Affects'' Definitions translated by W. H. White, Revised by A. H. Stirling, Great Books vol 31, Encyclopædia Britannica 1952 p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Spinoza assumes a [[formal system|quasi-mathematical]] style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' :&lt;ref name="ebgb"/&gt;
* Proposition 8 "''Knowledge of good or evil is nothing but affect of joy or sorrow in so far as we are conscious of it.''"
* Proposition 30 "''Nothing can be evil through that which it possesses in common with our nature, but in so far as a thing is evil to us it is contrary to us.''"
* Proposition 64 "''The knowledge of evil is inadequate knowledge.''"
** Corollary "''Hence it follows that if the human mind had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil.''"
* Proposition 65 "''According to the guidance of reason, of two things which are good, we shall follow the greater good, and of two evils, follow the less.''"
* Proposition 68 "''If men were born free, they would form no conception of good and evil so long as they were free.''"

===Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in a rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' where he essentially says that the natural, functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong).

== Psychology ==
===Carl Jung===
[[Carl Jung]], in his book ''[[Answer to Job]]'' and elsewhere, depicted evil as the ''dark side of God''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgjungpage.org/learn/articles/book-reviews/727-answer-to-job-revisited-jung-on-the-problem-of-evil&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] onto others. Jung interpreted the story of [[Jesus]] as an account of God facing his own shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ Dreams of Wholeness]: A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the book may have had a sudden birth, its gestation period in Jung's unconscious was long. The subject of God, and what Jung saw as the dark side of God, was a lifelong preoccupation. An emotional and theoretical struggle with the core nature of deity is evident in Jung's earliest fantasies and dreams, as well as in his complex relationships with his father (a traditional minister), his mother (who had a strong spiritual-mystical dimension), and the Christian church itself. Jung's account of his childhood in his quasi-autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (New York: Vintage, 1963; henceforth MDR), provides deep, personal background about his early religious roots and conflicts.

=== Philip Zimbardo ===
In 2007, [[Philip Zimbardo]] suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a [[collective identity]]. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the [[Stanford prison experiment]], was published in the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucifereffect.com/ Book website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==

===Problem of evil and source===

Most monotheistic religions posit that the singular God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and completely good.  The [[problem of evil]] asks how the apparent contradiction of these properties and the observed existence of evil in the world might be resolved.  Scholars have examined the question of suffering caused by and in both humans and animals, suffering caused by nature (like storms and disease). These religions tend to attribute the '''source of evil''' to something other than God, such as demonic beings or human disobedience.

Polytheistic and non-theistic religions do not have such an apparent contradiction, but many seek to explain or identify the source of evil or suffering. These include concepts of evil as a necessary balancing or enabling force, a consequence of past deeds ([[karma]]), or as an illusion, possibly produced by ignorance or failure to achieve enlightenment.

Non-religious atheism generally accepts evil acts as a feature of human actions arising from intelligent brains shaped by [[evolution]], and suffering from nature as a result of complex natural systems simply [[Naturalism (philosophy)|following physical laws]].

===Bahá'í Faith===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept reflecting lack of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coll |first='Abdu'l-Bahá |title=Some answered questions|year=1982|publisher=Bahá'í Publ. Trust|location=Wilmette, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87743-162-6 |edition=Repr. |translator=Barney, Laura Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, evil does not exist and is relative to man. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], son of the founder of the religion, in [[Some Answered Questions]] states:

"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind—that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves."&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

Thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

===Ancient Egyptian Religion===
Evil in the religion of [[Ancient Egypt]] is known as [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], "disorder/violence". It is the opposite of [[Maat]], "order", and embodied by the serpent god [[Apep]], who routinely attempts to kill the [[sun god]] [[Ra]] and is stopped by nearly every other deity. Isfet is not a primordial force, but the consequence of free will and an individual's struggle against the non-existence embodied by Apep, as evidenced by the fact that it was born from Ra's umbilical cord instead of being recorded in the religion's creation myths.&lt;ref&gt;Kemboly, Mpay. 2010. The Question of Evil in Ancient Egypt. London: Golden House Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[File:Extermination of Evil Tenkeisei crop.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Extermination of Evil]]'', The God of Heavenly Punishment, from the Chinese tradition of [[yin and yang]]. Late [[Heian period]] (12th-century Japan)]]
:''Main: [[Buddhism#Buddhist ethics|Buddhist Ethics]]''

The primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer from the general teachings of the Buddha that the [[Dukkha|catalogued causes]] of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 ''Philosophy of Religion''] Charles Taliaferro, Paul J. Griffiths, eds. Ch. 35, ''Buddhism and Evil'' Martin Southwold p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html ''Lay Outreach and the Meaning of 'Evil Person''' Taitetsu Unno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093156/http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html |date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions—desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. See ''ten unvirtuous actions in Buddhism''. Specifically, ''evil'' means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).

"What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil." Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, 563–483 BC.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, the concept of [[Dharma]] or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect Dharma, this war is called [[Dharmayuddha]]. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Sikhism===
In adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. Once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings [[Guru Arjan]] explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gopal|title=Sri guru-granth sahib [english version]|date=1967|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of "vices" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the [[Five Thieves]], called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Charan|title=Ethics and Business: Evidence from Sikh Religion|ssrn=2366249|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Jaswinder|title=The Sikh Model of the Person, Suffering, and Healing: Implications for Counselors|journal=International Journal for the Advancement of Counselling|date=February 2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moh]], or Attachment
* [[Lobh]], or Greed
* [[Krodh|Karodh]], or Wrath
* [[Kaam]], or Lust
* [[Hankaar|Ahankar]], or Egotism
One who gives in to the temptations of the [[Five Thieves]] is known as "[[Manmukh]]", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the "[[Gurmukh]], who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Arjan|title=The universal ideal of sikhism|journal=Global Dialogue|date=January 2000|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Selfless Service|Sewa]], or selfless service to others.
* [[Simran|Nam Simran]], or meditation upon the divine name.

===Islam===
{{see also|Islamic views on sin}}
There is no concept of absolute evil in [[Islam]], as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a dualistic sense.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Quran mentions the [[biblical]] forbidden tree, it never refers to it as the '[[tree of knowledge of good and evil]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from [[God in Islam|God]], whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as ''evil'' or ''bad'' are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will. Much more the behavior of beings with free will, then they disobey God's orders, harming others or putting themselves over God or others, is considered to be evil.&lt;ref&gt;B. Silverstein ''Islam and Modernity in Turkey'' Springer 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-230-11703-7}} p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Evil doesn't necessarily refer to evil as an ontological or moral category, but often to harm or as the intention and consequence of an action, but also to unlawfull actions.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;
Unproductive actions or those who do not produce benefits are also thought of as evil.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; 

A typical understanding of evil is reflected by [[Al-Ash`ari]] founder of [[Ashʿari|Asharism]]. Accordingly, qualifying something as evil depends on the circumstances of the observer. An event or an action itself is neutral, but it receives its qualification by God. Since God is omnipotent and nothing can exist outside of God's power, God's will determine, whether or not something is evil.&lt;ref&gt;P. Koslowski ''The Origin and the Overcoming of Evil and Suffering in the World Religions'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media 2013 {{ISBN|978-9-401-59789-0}} page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{see also|Satan#Judaism|label 1=Satan in Judaism}}
In [[Judaism]], evil is not real, it is [[Per se (terminology)|per se]] not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions. Human beings are responsible for their choices, and so have the [[Free will in theology#Judaism|free will]] to choose good (life in [[Jewish eschatology#"The world to come"|olam haba]]) or bad (death in heaven). ([[Deuteronomy]] 28:20) Judaism stresses obedience to God's [[mitzvah|613 commandments]] of the [[Written Torah]] (see also [[Tanakh]]) and the [[Halakha|collective body of Jewish religious laws]] expounded in the [[Oral Torah]] and [[Shulchan Aruch]] (see also [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]]). In Judaism, there is no prejudice in one's becoming good or evil at the time of birth, since full responsibility comes with [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]], when Jewish boys become 13, and girls become 12 years old.

===Christianity===
{{see also|Devil#Christianity|label 1=Devil in Christianity}}
Evil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought, or attitude that is contrary to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament. There is no moral action given in the Bible that is contrary to God's character or God's will.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Therefore, evil in a Christian worldview is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God.

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|The [[devil]], in opposition to the will of God, represents evil and tempts Christ, the personification of the character and will of God. [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]

[[Christian theology]] draws its concept of evil from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. The [[Christian Bible]] exercises "the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the [[fallen angel]]s [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]] &lt;ref&gt;Hans Schwarz, ''Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective'' (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''poneros'' is used to indicate unsuitability, while ''kakos'' is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''Evil'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[theologian]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], who in ''Summa Theologica'' defines evil as the absence or privation of good.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologica'', translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French-American]] theologian [[Henri Blocher]] describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an "unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in the experience that ''ought not to be''."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Blocher, ''Evil and the Cross'' (Downers Grove: [[InterVarsity Press]], 1994): 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mormonism]], mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See [[Agency (LDS Church)]]. Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God.

[[Christian Science]] believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most ''evil'' person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Zoroastrianism===
In the originally [[Iranian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]], the world is a battleground between the god [[Ahura Mazda]] (also called [[Ormazd]]) and the malignant spirit [[Angra Mainyu]] (also called [[Ahriman]]). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a [[Last Judgment|day of Judgement]], in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, [[angels]] and [[saints]] are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.

==Question of a universal definition==
A fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. [[C. S. Lewis]], in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as [[rape]] and [[murder]]. The numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question.  Up until the mid-19th century, the United States—along with many other countries—practiced forms of [[slavery]]. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but men with a motivation to transgress will justify that action.

[[File:Don't Kid Yourself...it's Up to You. Stop Him^ - NARA - 534297.jpg|right|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] is sometimes used as a modern definition of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2045995,00.html | title=Top 25 Political Icons - Adolf Hitler | website=Time | date=February 4, 2011 | accessdate=August 27, 2011 | author=Sanburn, Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's policies and orders resulted in the deaths of about [[World War II casualties|50 million people in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Del Testa, David W; Lemoine, Florence; Strickland, John (2003).

Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Thus, while the ideological leaders of Nazism and the Hutu Interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as ''fundamentally'' or ''universally'' evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil. Hitler considered it a moral duty to destroy Jews because he saw them as the root of all of Germany's ills and the violence associated with communism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007822&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama bin Laden]] found it moral to kill all Christians and Jews because he saw Islam as under attack by Western and US influence, accusing the US and Israel of forming a Crusader-Zionist alliance to destroy Islam, and considering US troops in Saudi Arabia infidels in the land of Islam's two holiest sites. He therefore considered non-Muslims and Shiite Muslims evil people intent on destroying Islamic purity and therefore heretic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/08/afghanistan.terrorism15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical questions==
===Approaches===
{{main article| Ethics}}
Views on the nature of evil belong to the branch of philosophy known as [[ethics]] - which in modern philosophy is subsumed into three major areas of study:
&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Meta-ethics]], that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. 
# [[Normative ethics]], investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. 
# [[Applied ethics]], concerned with the analysis of particular moral issues in private and public life.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

===Usefulness as a term===
One school of thought that holds that no ''person'' is evil and that only ''acts'' may be properly considered evil. Psychologist and mediator [[Marshall Rosenberg]] claims that the root of violence is the very concept of ''evil'' or ''badness''. When we label someone as bad or evil, Rosenberg claims, it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. It also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. He cites the use of language in Nazi Germany as being a key to how the German people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally would not do. He links the concept of evil to our judicial system, which seeks to create justice via punishment—''punitive justice''—punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}He contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures{{which|date=August 2013}} where the idea of evil was non-existent. In such cultures{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} when someone harms another person, they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community, are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and others.

Psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] agrees, in his school of psychology called [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], or REBT. He says the root of anger, and the desire to harm someone, is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely.

American psychiatrist [[M. Scott Peck]] on the other hand, describes evil as ''militant ignorance''.&lt;ref name="Liemult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1983, 1988). ''People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil''. Century Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Judeo-Christian concept of ''[[sin]]'' is as a process that leads one to ''miss the mark'' and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in [[Psychopathy|sociopaths]].

[[File:Genghis Khan.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Genghis Khan]] is considered by many people to be 'evil'.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/05/07/9-lessons-on-leadership-from-genghis-khan-yes-genghis-khan/ 9 Lessons on Power and Leadership from Genghis Khan]". ''Forbes.'' 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He is responsible for over 40 million deaths.]]
According to Peck, an evil person:&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1978, 1992), ''The Road Less Travelled''. Arrow.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and maintaining a [[self-image]] of [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]]
* Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception
* [[Psychological projection|Psychologically projects]] his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets, [[scapegoating]] those targets while treating everyone else normally ("their insensitivity toward him was selective") &lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1983/1988, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as the deception of others
* Abuses political or emotional power ("the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion") &lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1978/1992, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so
* Is consistent with his or her sins. Evil people are defined not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness)
* Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim
* Has a covert intolerance to [[criticism]] and other forms of [[narcissistic injury]]

He also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and its attempted coverup illustrate. By this definition, acts of [[terrorism|criminal]] and [[state terrorism]] would also be considered evil.

===Necessity===
{{Main|Necessary evil}}
[[File:Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther]] believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect]]
[[Martin Luther]] argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, "Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for [[the Devil]], so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings&amp;nbsp;... "&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Werke'', XX, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain{{which|date=August 2013}} schools of political philosophy, leaders should be indifferent to good or evil, taking actions based only upon practicality; this approach to politics was put forth by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], a 16th-century [[Florence, Italy|Florentine]] writer who advised politicians "...&amp;nbsp;it is far safer to be feared than loved."&lt;ref name = "erragh"&gt;Niccolo Machiavelli, ''The Prince'', Dante University of America Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-937832-38-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-937832-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international relations]] theories of [[Realism in international relations|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], sometimes called ''[[realpolitik]]'' advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and [[Ethics|ethical]] considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly [[amorality|amoral]] and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by laying claim to a ''higher moral duty'' specific to political leaders, under which the greatest evil is seen to be the failure of the state to protect itself and its citizens. Machiavelli wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the Prince."&lt;ref name = "erragh"/&gt;

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]], was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word ''evil'' is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.&lt;ref&gt;Anton LaVey, ''The Satanic Bible'', Avon, 1969, {{ISBN|0-380-01539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3242">In [[logic]], '''extensionality''', or '''extensional equality''', refers to principles that judge objects to be [[equality (mathematics)|equal]] if they have the same external properties. It stands in contrast to the concept of [[intensionality]], which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same.

==Example==

Consider the two functions ''f'' and ''g'' mapping from and to [[natural number]]s, defined as follows:
* To find ''f''(''n''), first add 5 to ''n'', then multiply by 2.
* To find ''g''(''n''), first multiply ''n'' by  2, then add 10. 

These functions are extensionally equal; given the same input, both functions always produce the same value. But the definitions of the functions are not equal, and in that intensional sense the functions are not the same. 

Similarly, in natural language there are many predicates (relations) that are intensionally different but are extensionally identical. For example, suppose that a town has one person named Joe, who is also the oldest person in the town. Then, the two argument predicates "has one person named", "is the oldest person in" are intensionally distinct, but extensionally equal for "Joe" in that "town" now.

==In mathematics==
The extensional definition of function equality, discussed above, is commonly used in mathematics. Sometimes additional information is attached to a function, such as an explicit [[codomain]], in which case two functions must not only agree on all values, but must also have the same codomain, in order to be equal. 

A similar extensional definition is usually employed for relations: two relations are said to be equal if they have the same [[Extension (predicate logic)|extensions]].

In set theory, the [[axiom of extensionality]] states that two sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.  In mathematics formalized in set theory, it is common to identify relations&amp;mdash;and, most importantly, [[function (mathematics)|functions]]&amp;mdash;with their extension as stated above, so that it is impossible for two relations or functions with the same extension to be distinguished.

Other mathematical objects are also constructed in such a way that the intuitive notion of "equality" agrees with set-level extensional equality; thus, equal [[ordered pair]]s have equal elements, and elements of a set which are related by an [[equivalence relation]] belong to the same [[equivalence class]].

[[Type theory|Type-theoretical]] foundations of mathematics are generally ''not'' extensional in this sense, and [[setoid]]s are commonly used to maintain a difference between intensional equality and a more general equivalence relation (which generally has poor [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructibility]] or [[Decidability (logic)|decidability]] properties).

'''Filial responsibility laws'''  ('''filial support laws''', '''filial piety laws''') are laws in the [[United States]] that impose a duty upon third parties, usually (but not always) adult children for the support of their impoverished parents or other relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Paying for Mom: Little-Known Laws Force Families to Fund Parents’ Care|publisher=American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)|url=http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving/info-01-2009/paying_for_momlittle_known_laws_force_families_to_fund_parents_care_.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231062247/http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving/info-01-2009/paying_for_momlittle_known_laws_force_families_to_fund_parents_care_.html|archivedate=31 December 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the duty is extended to other relatives. Such laws may be enforced by governmental or private entities and may be at the state or national level.  While most filial responsibility laws contemplate civil enforcement, some include criminal penalties for adult children or close relatives who fail to provide for family members when challenged to do so.  The key concept is ''impoverished'', as there is no requirement that the parent be aged.  For non-Western societies, the term "filial piety" has been applied to family responsibilities toward elders.
  
A “filial responsibility law” is not the same thing as the provision in United States federal law which requires a [[Medicaid#Five year "look-back"|“lookback” of five years]] in the financial records of anyone applying for [[Medicaid]] to ensure that the person did not give away assets in order to qualify for Medicaid.

==History==
Filial support laws were an outgrowth of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lopes, James L.|year=1975 |title=Filial Support and Family Solidarity|journal=Pacific Law Journal|volume=6|pages=508&amp;ndash;535|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mcglr6&amp;div=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Callahan, Daniel|year=1985 |title=What do children owe elderly parents?|journal=The Hastings Center Report|volume=15|issue=2|pages=32&amp;ndash;37, page 33|doi=10.2307/3560643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, as many as 45 U.S. states had statutes obligating an adult child to care for his or her parents. Some states repealed their filial support laws after Medicaid took a greater role in providing relief to elderly patients without means. Other states did not, and a large number of filial support laws remain dormant on the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/northwesternmutual/2014/02/03/who-will-pay-for-moms-or-dads-nursing-home-bill-filial-support-laws-and-long-term-care/|title=Northwestern MutualVoice: Who Will Pay For Mom's Or Dad's Nursing Home Bill? Filial Support Laws And Long-Term Care|first=Northwestern MutualVoice|last=Team|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Generally, the media has not covered filial responsibility laws much, and there has not been the political will to see that they are enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Callahan|1985|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012, twenty-nine states&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Katherine, [http://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=fac_works Family (filial) responsibility/support statutes in the United States], [[Penn State University, Dickinson School of Law]], 5 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Who pays for nursing home care?|publisher=American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)|url=http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/rights/info-09-2011/who-pays-nursing-home-costs-interactive-map.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; have such laws on the books, and a few states require the potential support of grandparents or even siblings.

==Support required==
Typically, these laws obligate adult children (or depending on the state, other family members) to pay for their indigent parents’/relatives' food, clothing, shelter and medical needs. Should the children fail to provide adequately, they allow nursing homes and government agencies to bring legal action to recover the cost of caring for the parents.  Adult children can even go to jail in some states if they fail to provide filial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.aarp.org/2013/10/28/more-filial-support-cases-ending-up-in-court/|title=More Filial Support Cases Ending Up in Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Four Dharmadhatu''' (Chinese: 四法界), is a philosophical concept propagated by Master [[Dushun|Tu-shun]] (Chinese: 杜順; 557-640 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Samanta Buddhist Glossary (2006). "Four Dharmadhātu". Source: [http://218.189.203.50/glossary/word_eng.php?word_id=168] (accessed: January 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of [[Huayan school|Hua-yan]] (Chinese: 華嚴) school. It builds upon and is a variant of the [[Dharmadhatu]] doctrine.   

==The Four Dharmadhatu==
The Four Dharmadhatu were outlined in Tu-shun's treatise which has been rendered into English as 'On the Meditation of Dharmadhātu'. The Four Dharmadhatu are:

*The Dharmadhātu of 'Shih' (Chinese: 事法界; "shi fajie"). 'Shih' is a rendering of the character 事 which holds the [[semantic field]]: "matter", "phenomenon", "event". It may be understood as the  'realm' (Sanskrit: dhātu) of all matters and phenomena. 
*The Dharmadhātu of 'Li'(Chinese: 理法界; "li fajie"). 'Li' is a rendering of the character 理 which holds the semantic field:  "principle", "law", "[[noumenon]]". This 'realm' (Sanskrit: dhātu) may be understood as that of principles. It has been referred to as "the realm of the one principle". The "one principle" being qualified as [[śūnyatā]] (Sanskrit).&lt;ref&gt;Samanta Buddhist Glossary (2006). "Four Dharmadhātu". Source: [http://218.189.203.50/glossary/word_eng.php?word_id=885] (accessed: January 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The Dharmadhātu of Non-obstruction of 'Li' against 'Shih' (Chinese: 理事無礙法界; "lishi wuai fajie"). This 'realm' (Sanskrit: dhātu) has been rendered into English as "the realm of non-obstruction between principle and phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Samanta Buddhist Glossary (2006). "Four Dharmadhātu".

'''Fourth Bottom Line''' is a concept extended from the [[Triple bottom line]]; instead of simply focusing on the 3 Ps: people, planet and profit, this concept involves extending to a fourth factor which not only has motivation for a business but also transcends to a humanistic value and beyond by factoring in terms such as "spirituality",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "ethics",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Environmental Ethics and Sustainability: A Casebook for Environmental Professionals|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jM7MBQAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2013-07-29|isbn = 9781466584211|language = en|first = Hal|last = Taback|first2 = Ram|last2 = Ramanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; "purpose",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "culture", "compassion".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Compassion as the fourth bottom line?|url = http://valuesbased.biz/2014/08/10/compassion/|website = The Values-Based Business|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triple Bottom Line==
{{main article|Triple bottom line}}

In traditional business accounting and common usage, the "[[bottom line]]" refers to either the "profit" or "loss", which is usually recorded at the very bottom line on a statement of revenue and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and "social justice" advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness by introducing [[full cost accounting]]. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from asbestosis, and their copper mine pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money on health care and river clean-up, how do we perform a full societal [[cost benefit analysis]]? The triple bottom line adds two more "bottom lines”: social and environmental (ecological) concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ges/umw/dos/nac/den/en3106180.htm Sustainability – From Principle To Practice] ''[[Goethe-Institut]]'', March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With the ratification of the [[United Nations]] and [[ICLEI]] TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/delc/Portals/119/industrryRoleOfIndclean.pdf Enhancing the role of industry through for example, private-public partnerships], May 2011. [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; this became the dominant approach to [[public sector]] full cost accounting.  Similar UN standards apply to [[natural capital]] and [[human capital]] measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting [[ecological footprint]]. The TBL seems to be fairly widespread in South African media, as found in a 1990-2008 study of worldwide national newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;What the Papers Say: Trends in Sustainability'' [[Ralf Barkemeyer et al]]'', Spring 2009, Greenleaf Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept of the Fourth Bottom Line==

On the whole, the multiple bottom lines are a concept that help clearly define parts in 
the ecosystem. In addition to the above-mentioned triple bottom line's people, planet, and profit, there is a fourth component, ''purpose''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term was first coined and introduced into mainstream usage by [[Ayman Sawaf]] in a bid to factor in the return to one's ''spiritual self'' as an additional, fourth bottom line. Spirituality, according to Sawaf, is defined as your own unique relationship and partnership with God or The Divine. It is great to make money, to have a positive impact on society/people and the environment. It is also important to have a positive impact on one’s own spiritual growth. The fourth bottom line lifts business activities to a sacred form. The fourth bottom line is measured by how much more loving, understanding, happy, joyful, in touch with their destiny, deeper relationship or partnership with god or higher powers the person has become, while performing their business responsibilities. And as these qualities are acquired they are infused back into one's own business activities&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sacred Commerce: A Blueprint for a New Humanity (2nd Edition)|last = Sawaf|first = Ayman|publisher = EQ Enterprises|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-9906987-0-8|location = |pages = 24–28|last2 = Gabrielle|first2 = Rowan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition, thus, identified spirituality as the fourth bottom line by businesses that relate it with happiness of stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Happiness-Spirituality as The Fourth Bottom Line {{!}} Triple Bottom Line Magazine|url = http://www.tbl.com.pk/happiness-spirituality-as-the-fourth-bottom-line/|website = www.tbl.com.pk|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = T02-Fourth Bottom Line|url = https://futuristguy.wordpress.com/tutorial-02/|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is when the question of ''why'' one is doing business becomes relevant. The first bottom line deals with the ''what''. "What do I get?" is usually measured by money. The second and third bottom lines deal with the ''how''. "How will I do this?" factors in that the means of doing business now matters. The question of whether one is doing business with honesty, trust, character, integrity, without hurting people and the environment. The Fourth Bottom Line has to do with ''why''. To ask oneself, "Why am I doing this?" involves a deeper sense of [[self]] being nurtured by such a choice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With the fourth bottom line, commerce/business becomes a spiritual path. The context of spirituality as a fourth factor is further elaborated upon by Dr. Sohail Inayatullah, a professor at [[Tamkang University]] and [[Queensland University of Technology]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spirituality as the fourth bottom line? {{!}} USC Research Bank - University of the Sunshine Coast|url = http://research.usc.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/usc:11504|website = research.usc.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SPIRITUALITY AS THE FOURTH BOTTOM LINE|url = http://www.metafuture.org/Articles/spirituality_bottom_line.htm|website = www.metafuture.org|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth bottom line is also conceptualized based on the fact that improving lives can be a factor valuable enough to rival other business objectives due to being a key motivating factor for any business to continue. The concept introduces the fourth bottom line as being a way to utilize core business principles to factor in compassion, for example by being compassionate to the customers and hence developing value for the business in an [[altruistic]] way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This is an index of articles related to the issue of [[feminism]], [[women's liberation]], the [[women's movement]], and [[women's rights]].

&lt;!--
EDITORS: For almost any entry longer than one word, consider adding a similar entry at the alphabetical position for another keyword in the article title. For example, [[Feminist archaeology]] is indexed under [[Index of feminism articles#F|"F"]] and also under [[Index of feminism articles#A|"A"]] for [[Feminist archaeology|Archaeology, feminist]]. Also consider more than one additional position for one article, if the title has enough words that users might look for. For example, [[Equal Rights Amendment]], also known by the abbreviation "ERA", is indexed under [[Index of feminism articles#E|"E"]] twice, [[Index of feminism articles#R|"R"]], and [[Index of feminism articles#A|"A"]].

If deleting from one position, delete from others, too.

If changing in one position, change in others, too.

In [[political science]], '''intergovernmentalism''' treats states, and national governments in particular, as the primary actors in the integration process.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergovernmentalist approaches claim to be able to explain both periods of radical change in the [[European Union]] because of converging governmental preferences and periods of inertia because of diverging national interests. Intergovernmentalism is distinguishable from [[realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] because of its recognition of the significance of [[institutionalisation]] in international politics and the impact of domestic politics upon governmental preferences.

==Regional integration==

===European Integration===
The best-known example of regional integration is the [[European Union]] (EU), an [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|economic]] and political intergovernmental organisation of 28 [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], all in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic information on the European Union|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/index_en.htm|work=European Union|publisher=europa.eu|accessdate=4 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929023300/http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/index_en.htm|archivedate=29 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |title=European |quote=5 b. spec.

The EU has developed a [[single market]] through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. Within the [[Schengen Area]] (which includes 22 EU and 4 non-EU European states) passport controls have been abolished.&lt;ref name="Internal borders"&gt;{{cite web |title=Schengen area|publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/borders/borders_schengen_en.htm|accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU policies favour the [[Internal market|free movement of people, goods, services, and capital]] within its boundaries,&lt;ref name="Europa Internal Market"&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU Single Market: Fewer barriers, more opportunities|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|title=Activities of the European Union: Internal Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm|accessdate=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on [[Common commercial policy (EU)|trade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common commercial policy |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/commercial_policy_en.htm |work=Europa Glossary |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=19 December 2016 |dead-url=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226160945/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/commercial_policy_en.htm |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Council of the European Union|title=Agriculture and Fisheries Council|url=http://www.consilium.eu.int/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=414&amp;lang=en&amp;mode=g|accessdate=6 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813045214/http://www.consilium.eu.int/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=414&amp;lang=en&amp;mode=g|archivedate=13 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]] and [[Regional policy of the European Union|regional development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the European Union activities: Regional Policy|url=http://europa.eu/pol/reg/overview_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monetary union, the [[eurozone]], was established in 1999 and is composed of 17 member states. Through the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] the EU has developed a role in [[Foreign relations of the European Union|external relations]] and [[Military of the European Union|defence]]. Permanent [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|diplomatic missions]] have been established around the world. The EU is represented at the [[European Union and the United Nations|United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[European Union and the G8|G8]] and the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]].

Intergovernmentalism represents a way for limiting the conferral of powers upon supranational institutions, halting the emergence of common policies. In the current institutional system of the EU, the European Council and the Council play the role of the institutions which have the last word about decisions and policies of the EU, institutionalizing a de facto intergovernmental control over the EU as a whole, with the possibility to give more power to a small group of states. This extreme consequence can create the condition of supremacy of someone over someone else violating the principle of a "Union of Equals".&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Laruffa, "The European Integration and National Interests: from an intergovernmental model to a Constitutional Agreement"(Hungarian Academy of Social Sciences, Budapest, 3 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===African Integration===

The '''[[African Union]]''' ('''AU''', or, in its other official languages, '''UA''') is a [[Continental union|continental intergovernmental union]], similar but less integrated to the EU, consisting of 54&amp;nbsp;[[Africa]]n [[Sovereign state|states]]. The AU was established on 26 May 2001 in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], and launched on 9 July 2002 in [[South Africa]] to replace the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU).&lt;ref name="African Union 2002"&gt;{{cite web

The '''International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance'''(also called the "Necessary and Proportionate Principles" or just "the Principles") is a document which attempts to "clarify how international human rights law applies in the current [[digital environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Preface, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Communications Surveillance([[Mass Surveillance]] of [[Communication]]) conflicts with a number of [[International Human Rights]], mainly that of [[Right to Privacy|Privacy]]. As a result,Communications Surveillance may only occur when prescribed by [[law]] necessary to achieve legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim used.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 29; General Comment No. 27, Adopted by The Human Rights Committee Under Article 40, Paragraph 4, Of The International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9, November 2, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism," 2009, A/HRC/17/34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank La Rue, "Report of the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council on the implications of States' surveillance of communications on the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and expression", 2013, A.HRC.23.40 EN&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The document consists of 13 principles developed to provide society groups, [[industry]], [[governments]], and others with a framework to assess whether current and proposed surveillance laws or statutes conflict with International Human Rights law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengovguide.com/standards-and-guidance/international-principles-application-human-rights-communications-surveillance|Open Government Guide on the International Principles on the application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The inception of the principles occurred as a result of a meeting between over 40 experts in [[privacy]] and [[security]] in [[Brussels]], October 2012. After the initial consultation, a second meeting in [[Rio de Janeiro]] took place in December 2012 with the participation of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, Frank La Rue, A/HRC/23/40, at para 10&lt;/ref&gt; Global consultation followed via conference calls every month between January and May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2013/09/22/surveillance-and-human-rights-principles-are-launched-at-the-24th-hrc&lt;/ref&gt;
The drafting process, led by [[Accessnow.org|Access Now]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] and [[Privacy International]], along with several [[Non-Governmental Organisations|NGO's]], Criminal [[Lawyers]], Human rights advocates and privacy advocates were finalized and published for the first time on 10 July 2013 online at www.necessaryandproportionate.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 at the 24th session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] in [[Geneva]], they were launched officially.

The principles have now been adopted globally by more than 400 [[organizations]]. The [[globe|global]] adoption necessitated a number of primarily superficial textual changes in the [[language]] of the document for the purposes of [[translation]]. This occurred between March and May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Insert, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect and intention of the principles remained the same, and the final and authoritative version of the document was then launched in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance] at Insert, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Support Prior to the Publication of the Principles==

The initial release followed a report from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on [[Freedom of Expression]] and [[Opinion]] in April 2013, which highlights the widespread practice of states surveying communications, stating that such surveillance severely undermines citizens' ability to enjoy a private life, freely express themselves and enjoy their other fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.40_EN.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression] 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], emphasized the importance of applying human right standards and democratic safeguards to surveillance and law enforcement activities:"While concerns about national security and criminal activity may justify the exceptional and narrowly-tailored use of surveillance programmes, surveillance without adequate safeguards to protect the right to privacy actually risk impacting negatively on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13534&amp;  Mass surveillance:Pillay urges respect for right to privacy and protection of individuals revealing human rights violations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The purpose of the principles was to provide civil society groups, [[Sovereign state|states]], the [[courts]], legislative and regulatory bodies, industry and others with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws comply with International Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern was that key protections to [[privacy]] had been eroded away with technological advancements, therefore needed robust support in some areas to raise international human rights to the standards which had developed in the pre-digital age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Principles==

The following is a summary of the document containing the principles. All below is source from the actual document itself, except where noted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preamble===

The preamble of the document recognizes that Communications Surveillance interferes with the [[Right to privacy]], therefore can only be used when it is prescribed by law, necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim pursued.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 29; General Comment No. 27, Adopted by The Human Rights Committee Under Article 40, Paragraph 4, Of The International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9, November 2, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism," 2009, A/HRC/17/34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank La Rue, "Report of the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council on the implications of States' surveillance of communications on the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and expression", 2013, A.HRC.23.40 EN&lt;/ref&gt; The view of the document is that existing human rights law has not kept up with the progression of [[technology]]. The preamble states that the threat to these rights combined with the increase in popularity of using communications content and [[metadata]] that states are not placing "sufficient restrictions on how they can be subsequently used by States".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#preamble International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], Preamble, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/2013-year-review-principled-fight-against-global-mass-surveillance |title=2013 Year in Review: A Principled Fight Against Global Mass Surveillance &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2013-12-30 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope of Application===

To get the correct scope and purpose of application for the document, it is required to be read and interpreted as part of a larger framework rather than as individual principles.
Application of this document is to apply both within states and extra territorially, regardless of purpose.

It is to apply for protection of the individual from the state, and also states there is an obligation of states to protect individuals from [[non-state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#scope-of-application International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Scope of Application, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The document states that unless the principles are applied this way, a State conducting Communications Surveillance may not meet International Human Rights obligations. The principles are stated to "articulate the duties and obligations of States when engaging in Communications Surveillance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#scope-of-application International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Scope of Application, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing Definitions and Technology===

This section of the document is dedicated to the interpretation of certain terms found throughout the document, and highlighting that some of the legal definitions used may not have effectively kept pace with technological change, and require reiteration. 
The principles state that the because of the increased ability of communications surveillance, the existing legal framework which currently distinguishes between 'content' and 'non-content' is no longer appropriate, and protection from all types of surveillance should be given a higher legal priority.

===The Principles===

====Legality====
Any limitation imposed on an International Human Rights must be prescribed by law. Sufficient notice should be given if a proposed law is going to limit one of these rights. The law should be clear, and given periodic review to ensure it remains effective given the speed of technological development.

====Legitimate Aim====
Communications surveillance should only be used by permitted [[State (polity)|state]] [[Authority|authorities]] where necessary in a [[democratic society]]. Any situation where discrimination arises should not be used.

====Necessity====
Surveillance laws should be limited to those which are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, or where there are multiple means but Communications Surveillance is the least intrusive method on International Human Rights. The onus of establishing necessity should remain with the state&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#the-principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Principle of Necessity, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adequacy====
Any communications surveillance authorized by law must be appropriate for the legitimate aim it is fulfilling.

====Proportionality====
Communications Surveillance is regarded as a highly intrusive act, and therefore must consider the sensitivity and severity of the situation. The state should establish the following prior to conducting communications surveillance:
*There is a high chance of serious crime or specific threat
*There is a high degree of probability that relevant evidence will be obtained. 
*Other less invasive techniques have been exhausted, such that communications surveillance is the least intrusive method
*[[Information]] collected will be confined to only which is relevant
*Excess information obtained will be returned or destroyed
*The information accesses will be used by the specific authority for the purpose the authority was given
*The requested authority to use communications surveillance does not undermine the purpose of the right to privacy or other fundamental freedoms.

====Competent Judicial Authority====
The authority determining the validity of the communications surveillance must be independent of those conducting the surveillance, and be competent when making these decisions.

====Due Process====
That everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by a competent judicial authority. Due process can be used interchangeably with "[[procedural fairness]]" and "[[natural justice]]"&lt;ref&gt;European Convention for Human Rights, Article 6(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The American Convention on Human Rights,Article 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====User Notification====
Those subjects of Communication Surveillance should be given the opportunity to challenge the decision when a decision authorizing Surveillance has been issued. The materials presented in support of the application should be available for those subjects. Delay in notification is acceptable where notification would frustrate the purpose of communication surveillance and authorization is granted by a competent judicial authority.

====Transparency====
Information about use and amount of Communication Surveillance should be available to those who request it. States should provide the requestor with information sufficient to ascertain the nature of the request and determine the size of both the request and those who will be affected by it. Records of requests for communications surveyed should also be published.

====Public Oversight====
States should establish an independent position to oversee the use of Communications Surveillance and to ensure transparency and accountability. The person(s) in this position would have sufficient authority to access all potentially relevant information, to assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities, to evaluate whether the State has met its transparency obligations, and to make public determinations as to the lawfulness of those actions. The document in this instance makes reference to the United Kingdom's [[Interception of Communications Commissioner]] as an example of such an independent oversight mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iocco-uk.info/sections.asp?sectionID=2&amp;type=top Interception of Communications Commissioner's Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity of communication and systems====
States should not require those service providers or software/hardware vendors to build surveillance/monitoring capability into their systems. People have a right to express themselves anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.40_EN.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression] 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safeguards for International Cooperation====
Where a state has entered into a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]](MLAT) or other multi-jurisdictional agreement where more than one legal jurisdiction overlaps, the laws that apply are those which have the higher level of protection for the individual. MLAT's should also be transparent, publicly available and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness

====Safeguards against illegitimate access and right to effective remedy====
Communications surveillance by third parties should be prohibited with sufficient penalties. Protection for [[whistle-blowers]] should be enacted. Any information obtained by means not consistent with these principles should be inadmissible as evidence. Once information collected by communications surveillance has been used for the purpose for which it was collected it should be promptly destroyed or returned.

==Response==

In October 2013, The Principles were promoted in a brief filed before the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. They claim that "In a world of ever more complex technology, it is increasingly unclear whether the distinction between "meta-data" and other information carries much weight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/01/24/verizon-report-bolsters-calls-to-reform-metadata-protections |title=Blog &amp;#124; Access |publisher=Accessnow.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/ReviewGroupReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] released a report noting overlap between the Principles and a December 9, 2013 proposal by tech groups such as [[AOL]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Linkedin]], [[Microsoft]], [[Twitter]], and [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdt.org/paper/common-ground-between-company-and-civil-society-surveillance-reform-principles |title=Common Ground Between Company and Civil Society Surveillance Reform Principles &amp;#124; Center for Democracy &amp; Technology |publisher=Cdt.org |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, the principles have over 400 organizations from across the world supporting the principles along with over 40 [[Experts]], [[Academics]] and prominent individuals from over 17 countries, and 6 [[elected officials]] or [[political parties]] from 5 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/sign List of Signatories]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles are now being used as model for reform of surveillance law and policy around the world and to provide a benchmark for measuring whether a State's surveillance practices comply with International Human Rights Law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/document/13-international-principles-application-human-rights-communication-surveillance 13 International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communication Surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interpretation of quantum mechanics''' is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of [[quantum mechanics]] corresponds to [[reality]]. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments, there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation.  These views differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is [[determinism|deterministic]] or random, which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered "real", and what is the nature of measurement, among other matters.

Despite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached amongst physicists and [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] concerning which interpretation best represents reality.

The definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as ''[[wave function]]s'' and ''[[matrix mechanics]]'', progressed through many stages. For instance, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] originally viewed the electron's wave function as its charge density smeared across the [[field (physics)#Waves as fields|field]], whereas [[Max Born]] reinterpreted the absolute square value of the wave function as the electron's [[probability density function|probability density]] distributed across the field.

Although the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] was originally most popular, [[quantum decoherence]] has gained popularity.  Thus the [[many-worlds interpretation]] has been gaining acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidman, L. (2002, March 24). Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Retrieved March 19, 2010, from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/#Teg98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tipler1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank J.

As a rough guide development of the mainstream view during the 1990s to 2000s, consider the "snapshot" of opinions collected in a  poll by Schlosshauer et al. at the 2011 "Quantum  Physics  and  the  Nature  of  Reality" conference of July 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=1301.1069

The authors reference a similarly informal poll carried out by [[Max Tegmark]] at the "Fundamental  Problems in Quantum Theory" conference in August 1997. The main conclusion of the authors is that "the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:
:"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll."

It is noteworthy that only Cramer's [[transactional interpretation]], published in 1986, assigns physical basis to [[Max Born]]'s assertion that the absolute square of the wave function is a probability density.&lt;ref&gt;The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, R.E.Kastner, Cambridge University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-521-76415-5}}, p35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature ==
More or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:
# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''—a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions
# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''—a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world
Two qualities vary among interpretations:
# [[Ontology]]—claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world
# [[Epistemology]]—claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world

In [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually "governs" outcomes—and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism—is a [[category mistake]].

In a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]—approximately true description or explanation of the natural world—or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.

{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], "Shut up and calculate", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase "shut up and calculate", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could feynman have said this?|journal=Physics Today|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N. David|bibcode=2004PhT....57e..10M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches to resolve conceptual problems introduce new mathematical formalism, and so propose alternative theories with their interpretations.  An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms—[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]]'s [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]—has been demonstrated.

== Challenges ==

# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.
# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. 
# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Bacciagaluppi, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].&lt;ref&gt;''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see "[[Quantum logic]]").  Like contextuality, the "origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators" that describe quantum objects (Omnès 1999).
# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.
# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibnitz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.

== Summaries ==

=== Classification adopted by Einstein ===
An interpretation (i.e. a [[semantics|semantic explanation]] of the formal mathematics of quantum mechanics) can be characterized by its treatment of certain matters addressed by Einstein, such as:
* Realism
* Completeness
* [[Principle of locality#Local realism|Local realism]]
* [[Determinism]]

To explain these properties, we need to be more explicit about the kind of picture an interpretation provides. To that end we will regard an interpretation as a correspondence between the elements of the mathematical formalism '''M''' and the elements of an interpreting structure '''I''', where:
* The ''mathematical formalism'' '''M''' consists of the Hilbert space machinery of [[bra–ket notation|ket-vectors]], [[self-adjoint operator]]s acting on the space of ket-vectors, unitary time dependence of the ket-vectors, and measurement operations. In this context a measurement operation is a transformation which turns a ket-vector into a probability distribution (for a formalization of this concept see [[quantum operation]]s).
* The ''interpreting structure'' '''I''' includes states, transitions between states, measurement operations, and possibly information about spatial extension of these elements. A measurement operation refers to an operation which returns a value and might result in a system state change. Spatial information would be exhibited by states represented as functions on configuration space. The transitions may be [[Quantum indeterminacy|non-deterministic]] or probabilistic or there may be infinitely many states.

The crucial aspect of an interpretation is whether the elements of '''I''' are regarded as physically real. Hence the bare instrumentalist view of quantum mechanics outlined in the previous section is not an interpretation at all, for it makes no claims about elements of physical reality.

The current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = [[EPR paradox|Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?]] | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 777–780 | doi=10.1103/physrev.47.777| bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that paper the authors proposed the concepts ''element of reality'' and the ''completeness of a physical theory''. They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.

Determinism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.

Local realism has two aspects:
* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;
* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.

A precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].

[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].

It should be noted that regardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.

=== Copenhagen interpretation ===
{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}

The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the "standard" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like "where was the particle before I measured its position?" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], "reality is in the observations, not in the electron".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.

=== Many worlds ===
{{Main|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a [[universal wavefunction]] obeys the same deterministic, [[CPT symmetry|reversible]] laws at all times; in particular there is no (indeterministic and [[irreversibility|irreversible]]) [[wavefunction collapse]] associated with measurement. The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly "splitting" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories—effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].

=== Consistent histories ===
{{Main|Consistent histories}}

The [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schrödinger equation]].

According to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).

=== Ensemble interpretation ===
{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}

The [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. Probably the most notable supporter of such an interpretation was Einstein:

{{Quote|The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems.|Einstein in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', ed. P.A. Schilpp (Harper &amp; Row, New York)}}

The most prominent current advocate of the ensemble interpretation is Leslie E. Ballentine, professor at [[Simon Fraser University]], author of the graduate level text book ''Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development''. An experiment illustrating the ensemble interpretation is provided in Akira Tonomura's Video clip 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A new version of the ensemble interpretation that relies on a reformulation of probability theory was introduced by Raed Shaiia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oalib.com/index/3138961#.V2dVs9J94dU|title=On the Measurement Problem|first=Raed M.|last=Shaiia|date=9 February 2015|publisher=|doi=10.5923/j.ijtmp.20140405.04|volume=4|journal=International Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|pages=202–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/physicsraedshaiia/publications&lt;/ref&gt;

=== De Broglie–Bohm theory ===
{{Main|De Broglie–Bohm theory}}

The [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]] of quantum mechanics (also known as the pilot wave theory) is a theory by [[Louis de Broglie]] and extended later by [[David Bohm]] to include measurements.  Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schrödinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Action at a distance (physics)|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality. The [[measurement problem]] is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maudlin | first1 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Why Bohm's Theory Solves the Measurement Problem | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 479–483 | doi=10.1086/289879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collapse is explained as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]].&lt;ref name="CushingFine2013"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Durr |first1=D. |last2=Zanghi |first2=N. |last3=Goldstein |first3=S.|arxiv=quant-ph/9511016 |title=''Bohmian Mechanics as the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics ''|date=Nov 14, 1995 }} Also published in {{cite book|author1=J.T.

=== Relational quantum mechanics ===
{{Main|Relational quantum mechanics}}
The essential idea behind [[relational quantum mechanics]], following the precedent of [[special relativity]], is that different observers may give different accounts of the same series of events: for example, to one observer at a given point in time, a system may be in a single, "collapsed" [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstate]], while to another observer at the same time, it may be in a superposition of two or more states.  Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of "state" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any "measurement event" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector. The inherent ambiguity associated with applying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is subsequently avoided.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.quantum-relativity.org/Quantum-Relativity.pdf relational approach to wave-particle duality].

=== Transactional interpretation ===
{{Main|Transactional interpretation}}
The [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by [[John G. Cramer]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function). Since the possibility wave is collapsed by interaction with the receiver, consciousness plays no role in the theory, eliminating [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox.  This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.

=== Stochastic mechanics ===
{{Main|Stochastic interpretation}}
An entirely classical derivation and interpretation of Schrödinger's wave equation by analogy with [[Brownian motion]] was suggested by [[Princeton University]] professor [[Edward Nelson]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = E | year = 1966 | title = Derivation of the Schrödinger Equation from Newtonian Mechanics | url = | journal = Phys.

Fürth (1933), [[I. Fényes]] (1952), and [[Walter Weizel]] (1953), and are referenced in Nelson's paper. More recent work on the stochastic interpretation has been done by M. Pavon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pavon | first1 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Stochastic mechanics and the Feynman integral | url = | journal = J. Math.

=== Objective collapse theories ===
{{Main|Objective collapse theory}}
Objective collapse theories differ from the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] by regarding both the wave function and the process of collapse as ontologically objective (meaning these exist and occur independent of the observer).  In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly ("spontaneous localization") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role.  Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension to QM means that objective collapse is more of a theory than an interpretation.  Examples include 
* the [[Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Consciousness causes collapse (von Neumann–Wigner interpretation) ===
{{Main|Consciousness causes collapse}}
In his treatise ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] deeply analyzed the so-called [[measurement problem]]. He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the Schrödinger equation (the universal wave function). He also described how measurement could cause a collapse of the wave function.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John. (1932/1955). ''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Translated by Robert T. Beyer.&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view was prominently expanded on by [[Eugene Wigner]], who argued that human experimenter consciousness (or maybe even dog consciousness) was critical for the collapse, but he later abandoned this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[Michael Esfeld, (1999), "Essay Review: Wigner's View of Physical Reality", published in ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/9501014|author1=Zvi Schreiber|title=The Nine Lives of Schrödinger's Cat|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of the consciousness causes collapse interpretation include:

: '''Subjective reduction research'''
::This principle, that consciousness causes the collapse, is the point of intersection between quantum mechanics and the mind/body problem; and researchers are working to detect conscious events correlated with physical events that, according to quantum theory, should involve a wave function collapse; but, thus far, results are inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Dick J. Bierman and Stephen Whitmarsh. (2006). ''Consciousness and Quantum Physics: Empirical Research on the Subjective Reduction of the State Vector''. in Jack A. Tuszynski (Ed). '''The Emerging Physics of Consciousness'''. p. 27-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nunn | first1 = C. M.

=== Many minds ===
{{Main|Many-minds interpretation}}

The many-minds interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]] extends the [[many-worlds interpretation]] by proposing that the distinction between worlds should be made at the level of the mind of an individual observer.

=== Quantum logic ===
{{Main|Quantum logic}}

[[Quantum logic]] can be regarded as a kind of propositional logic suitable for understanding the apparent anomalies regarding quantum measurement, most notably those concerning composition of measurement operations of complementary variables. This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.

* Information ontologies, such as J. A. Wheeler's "[[it from bit]]". These approaches have been described as a revival of [[idealism|immaterialism]]&lt;ref&gt;Timpson, Op. Cit.: "Let us call the thought that information might be the basic category from which all else flows informational immaterialism."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interpretations where quantum mechanics is said to describe an observer's knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr's thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"Physics concerns what we can say about nature". (Niels Bohr, quoted in Petersen, A. (1963). The philosophy of Niels Bohr. ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 19(7):8–14.)&lt;/ref&gt; Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.
...A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The "reduction of the wavepacket" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to "become entangled" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.

Not all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, highlights how well the two-state vector formalism dovetails with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''. In: Juan Gonzalo Muga, Rafael Sala Mayato, Íñigo Egusquiza (eds.): ''Time in Quantum Mechanics'', Volume 1, Lecture Notes in Physics 734, pp.&amp;nbsp;399–447, 2nd ed., Springer, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-540-73472-7}}, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-540-73473-4_13}}, {{arXiv|quant-ph/0105101}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=InKru6zHQWgC&amp;pg=PA443 p. 443]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Branching space-time theories ===
BST theories resemble the many worlds interpretation; however, "the main difference is that the BST interpretation takes the branching of history to be a feature of the topology of the set of events with their causal relationships... rather than a consequence of the separate evolution of different components of a state vector."&lt;ref name="Sharlow" /&gt; In MWI, it is the wave functions that branches, whereas in BST, the space-time topology itself branches.
BST  has applications to Bell's theorem, quantum computation and quantum gravity. It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.&lt;ref name="Sharlow"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; "What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics"] p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other interpretations ===
{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}
As well as the mainstream interpretations discussed above, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].

== Comparison ==
The most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.04711.pdf|title=What is quantum information?|last=Olimpia,|first=Lombardi,|last2=1979-|first2=Fortin, Sebastian,|last3=Federico,|first3=Holik,|last4=Cristian,|first4=López,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781107142114|location=|pages=|oclc=965759965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to "interpret" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.

Most of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued about by many people.

* {{note label|note1|1}} According to Bohr, the concept of a physical state independent of the conditions of its experimental observation does not have a well-defined meaning. According to Heisenberg the wavefunction represents a probability, but not an objective reality itself in space and time.
* {{note label|note2|2}} According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction collapses when a measurement is performed.
* {{note label|note3|3}} Both particle &lt;small&gt;AND&lt;/small&gt; guiding wavefunction are real.
* {{note label|note4|4}} Unique particle history, but multiple wave histories.
* {{note label|note5|5}} But quantum logic is more limited in applicability than Coherent Histories.
* {{note label|note6|6}} Quantum mechanics is regarded as a way of predicting observations, or a theory of measurement.
*  {{note label|note7|7}} Observers separate the universal wavefunction into orthogonal sets of experiences.
* {{note label|note8|8}} In the TI the collapse of the state vector is interpreted as the completion of the transaction between emitter and absorber.
* {{note label|note9|9}} Comparing histories between systems in this interpretation has no well-defined meaning.
* {{note label|note10|10}} Any physical interaction is treated as a collapse event relative to the systems involved, not just macroscopic or conscious observers.
* {{note label|note11|11}} The state of the system is observer-dependent, i.e., the state is specific to the reference frame of the observer.
* {{note label|note12|12}} The transactional interpretation is explicitly non-local.
* {{note label|note13|13}} The assumption of intrinsic periodicity is an element of non-locality consistent  with relativity as the periodicity varies in a causal way.
* {{note label|note14|14}} In the stochastic interpretation is not possible to define velocities for particles, i.e. the paths are not smooth. Moreover, to know the motion of the particles at any moment, you have to know what the Markov process is. However, once we know the exactly initial conditions and the Markov process, the theory is in fact a realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics.
* {{note label|note15|15}} The kind of non-locality required by the theory, sufficient to violate the Bell inequalities, is weaker than that assumed in EPR. In particular, this kind non-locality is compatible with no signaling theorem and Lorentz invariance.
* {{note label|note16|16}} A wavefunction merely encodes an agent’s expectations for future experiences. It is no more real than a probability distribution is in [[Bayesian probability#Dutch book approach|subjective Bayesianism]].
* {{note label|note17|17}} Quantum theory is a tool any agent may use to help manage their expectations. The past comes into play only insofar as an agent’s individual experiences and temperament influence their priors.
* {{note label|note18|18}} Although QBism would eschew this terminology. A change in the wavefunction that an agent ascribes to a system as a result of having an experience represents a change in his or her beliefs about further experiences they may have. See [[Doxastic logic]]. 
* {{note label|note19|19}} Observers, or more properly, participants, are as essential to the formalism as the systems they interact with.

An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Plato]] in his work ''The Republic''. Advocates of divine command theory say that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like [[John Locke]] advocated [[natural rights]] as a derivative of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zuckert |first=Michael |title=The Natural Rights Republic |year=1996 |publisher=Notre Dame University Press |pages=73–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers in the [[social contract]] tradition state that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, [[utilitarian]] thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]] said that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the ''proper'' distribution. [[Egalitarianism|Egalitarians]] state that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. [[John Rawls]] used a theory of [[social contract]] to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like [[Robert Nozick]]) take a deontological view of distributive justice and state that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with [[punishment]] for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laurence |first=Timothy |editor-last=Laurence |editor-first=Timothy |title=Good News for the Public Square |publisher=LCF |date=2014 |page=xxii |chapter=Overview |isbn=978-0-9506454-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmony==

{{Main|The Republic (Plato)}}
[[File:Luca Giordano 013.jpg|thumb|''Justice'' by [[Luca Giordano]]]]
In his dialogue ''Republic'', [[Plato]] uses [[Socrates]] to argue for justice that covers both the just person and the just [[City State]]. Justice is a proper, harmonious relationship between the warring parts of the person or city. Hence, Plato's definition of justice is that justice is the having and doing of what is one's own. A just man is a man in just the right place, doing his best and giving the precise equivalent of what he has received. This applies both at the individual level and at the universal level. A person's soul has three parts&amp;nbsp;– reason, spirit and desire. Similarly, a city has three parts&amp;nbsp;– Socrates uses the parable of the chariot to illustrate his point: a chariot works as a whole because the two horses' power is directed by the charioteer. Lovers of wisdom&amp;nbsp;– philosophers, in one sense of the term&amp;nbsp;– [[Philosopher king|should rule]] because only they understand what is [[goodness and evil|good]]. If one is ill, one goes to a medic rather than a farmer, because the medic is expert in the subject of health. Similarly, one should trust one's city to an expert in the subject of the good, not to a mere [[politician]] who tries to gain power by giving people what they want, rather than what's good for them. Socrates uses the parable of the ship to illustrate this point: the unjust city is like a ship in open ocean, crewed by a powerful but drunken captain (the common people), a group of untrustworthy advisors who try to manipulate the captain into giving them power over the ship's course (the politicians), and a [[navigator]] (the philosopher) who is the only one who knows how to get the ship to port. For Socrates, the only way the ship will reach its destination&amp;nbsp;– the good&amp;nbsp;– is if the navigator takes charge.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' trans. Robin Waterfield (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine command==

{{Main|Divine command theory}}{{See also|Divine command}}
[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 012.jpg|thumb|Allegorical fresco cycle (cardinal virtues) by [[Renaissance]] painter [[Domenico di Pace Beccafumi]] from the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, scene: ’’Justitia’’]]
Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice, and indeed the whole of morality, is the authoritative command of God. Murder is wrong and must be punished, for instance, because God says it so. Some versions of the theory assert that God must be obeyed because of the nature of his relationship with humanity, others assert that God must be obeyed because he is goodness itself, and thus doing what he says would be best for everyone.

A meditation on the Divine command theory by [[Plato]] can be found in his dialogue, [[Euthyphro]]. Called the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], it goes as follows: "Is what is morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?" The implication is that if the latter is true, then justice is arbitrary; if the former is true, then morality exists on a higher order than God, who becomes little more than a passer-on of moral knowledge. A [[Argument from morality|response]], popularized in two contexts by [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[C. S. Lewis]], is that it is deductively valid to argue that the existence of an objective morality implies the existence of God and vice versa.

==Natural law==

{{Main|Natural law}}
[[File:VD-04-3.jpg|thumb|''Lex, justitia, pax'' ([[Latin]] for "Law, justice, peace") on the pediment of the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Supreme Court of Switzerland]]]]

For advocates of the theory that justice is part of natural law (e.g., [[John Locke]]), it involves the system of consequences that naturally derives from any action or choice. In this, it is similar to the laws of physics: in the same way as the Third of Newton's laws of Motion requires that for every action there must be an equal and opposite reaction, justice requires according individuals or groups what they actually deserve, merit, or are entitled to.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Justice, on this account, is a universal and absolute concept: laws, principles, religions, etc., are merely attempts to codify that concept, sometimes with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

===Despotism and skepticism===

In ''Republic'' by [[Plato]], the character [[Thrasymachus]] argues that justice is the interest of the strong&amp;nbsp;– merely a name for what the powerful or cunning ruler has imposed on the people.
{{further|The Republic (Plato)}}

===Mutual agreement===

{{Main|Social contract}}
Advocates of the social contract agree that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned; or, in many versions, from what they would agree to under ''hypothetical'' conditions including equality and absence of bias. This account is considered further below, under 'Justice as fairness'. The absence of bias refers to an equal ground for all people concerned in a disagreement (or trial in some cases).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Subordinate value===
According to utilitarian thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]], justice is not as fundamental as we often think. Rather, it is derived from the more basic standard of rightness, [[consequentialism]]: what is right is what has the best consequences (usually measured by the total or average [[Quality of life|welfare]] caused). So, the proper principles of justice are those that tend to have the best consequences. These rules may turn out to be familiar ones such as keeping [[contract]]s; but equally, they may not, depending on the facts about real consequences. Either way, what is important is those consequences, and justice is important, if at all, only as derived from that fundamental standard. Mill tries to explain our mistaken belief that justice is overwhelmingly important by arguing that it derives from two natural human tendencies: our desire to retaliate against those who hurt us, or the feeling of self-defense and our ability to put ourselves imaginatively in another's place, sympathy. So, when we see someone harmed, we project ourselves into her situation and feel a desire to retaliate on her behalf. If this process is the source of our feelings about justice, that ought to undermine our confidence in them.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''Utilitarianism'' in ''On Liberty and Other Essays'' ed. John Gray (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of distributive justice==
{{Main|Distributive justice}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Theories of distributive justice need to answer three questions:
# ''What goods'' are to be distributed? Is it to be [[wealth]], [[Political power|power]], [[respect]], opportunities or some combination of these things?
# ''Between what entities'' are they to be distributed? Humans (dead, living, future), [[Sentience|sentient]] beings, the members of a single society, [[nation]]s?
# What is the ''proper'' distribution? Equal, [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]], according to [[social status]], according to [[need]], based on property rights and non-aggression?

Distributive justice theorists generally do not answer questions of ''who has the right'' to enforce a particular favored distribution.  On the other hand, property rights theorists argue that there is no "favored distribution."  Rather, distribution should be based simply on whatever distribution results from lawful interactions or transactions (that is, transactions which are not illicit).

This section describes some widely held theories of distributive justice, and their attempts to answer these questions.

===Social justice===
{{Main|Social justice}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Social justice is concerned with the just relationship between individuals and their society, often considering how privileges, opportunities, and wealth ought to be distributed among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/social_justice|title=social justice {{!}} Definition of social justice in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice is distinct from egalitarianism, which is the idea that all people are equal in terms of status, value, or rights, as social justice theories do not all require equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/egalitarianism|title=egalitarianism {{!}} Definition of egalitarianism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sociologist [[George C. Homans]] suggested that the root of the concept of justice is that each person should receive rewards that are proportional to their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubinstein|first=David|date=1988|title=The Concept of Justice in Sociology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/657654|journal=Theory and Society|volume=17|issue=4|pages=527–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2668194|title=Social behavior; its elementary forms.|last=Homans|first=George Caspar|publisher=Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich|year=1974|isbn=0155814176|edition= Rev.|location=New York,|pages=246–249|oclc=2668194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the egalitarian, justice can exist only within the parameters of equality. This basic view can be elaborated in many ways, according to what goods are to be distributed&amp;nbsp;– wealth, respect, opportunity&amp;nbsp;– and who or what they are to be distributed equally among&amp;nbsp;– individuals, families, nations, races, species. Egalitarian theories are typically less concerned with discussing who exactly will do the distributing or what effects their recommended policies will have on the production of the goods, services, or resources they wish to distribute.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Commonly held egalitarian positions include demands for [[equality of opportunity]], though equality of opportunity is often defended by adherents of nonegalitarian conceptions of justice as well. Some variants of egalitarianism affirm that justice without equality is hollow and that equality itself is the highest justice, though such a formulation will have concrete meaning only once the main terms have been fleshed out.

At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are communism, socialism, [[left-libertarianism]], and progressivism, which propound economic, political, and legal egalitarianism, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Fairness===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Justice statue.jpg|thumb|J. L. Urban, statue of [[Lady Justice]] at court building in [[Olomouc]], [[Czech Republic]]]]

In his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', [[John Rawls]] used a [[social contract]] argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness: an impartial distribution of goods. Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves behind a [[veil of ignorance]] that denies us all knowledge of our personalities, social statuses, moral characters, wealth, talents and life plans, and then asks what theory of justice we would choose to govern our society when the veil is lifted, if we wanted to do the best that we could for ourselves. We don't know who in particular we are, and therefore can't bias the decision in our own favour. So, the decision-in-ignorance models fairness, because it excludes selfish [[bias]]. Rawls argues that each of us would reject the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theory of justice that we should maximize welfare (see below) because of the risk that we might turn out to be someone whose own good is sacrificed for greater benefits for others. Instead, we would endorse Rawls's ''two principles of justice'':
* Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.
* Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both
** to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and
** attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (revised edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

This imagined choice justifies these principles as the principles of justice for us, because we would agree to them in a fair decision procedure. Rawls's theory distinguishes two kinds of goods&amp;nbsp;– (1) [[Freedom (political)|the good of liberty rights]] and (2) social and economic goods, i.e. wealth, income and power&amp;nbsp;– and applies different distributions to them&amp;nbsp;– equality between citizens for (1), equality unless inequality improves the position of the worst off for (2).

In one sense, theories of distributive justice may assert that everyone should get what they deserve. Theories disagree on the meaning of what is "deserved". The main distinction is between theories that argue the basis of just deserts ought to be held equally by everyone, and therefore derive egalitarian accounts of distributive justice&amp;nbsp;– and theories that argue the basis of just deserts is unequally distributed on the basis of, for instance, hard work, and therefore derive accounts of distributive justice by which some should have more than others.

According to ''[[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]'' theories, goods, especially wealth and [[social status]], should be distributed to match individual ''merit'', which is usually understood as some combination of talent and hard work. According to ''[[need]]s''-based theories, goods, especially such basic goods as food, shelter and medical care, should be distributed to meet individuals' [[basic needs]] for them. [[Marxism]] is a needs-based theory, expressed succinctly in [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] slogan "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, 'Critique of the Gotha Program' in ''Karl Marx: Selected writings'' ed. David McLellan (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977): 564–70, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''contribution''-based theories, goods should be distributed to match an individual's contribution to the overall social good.

===Property rights===
{{further|Libertarianism|Constitutional economics}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
In ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', [[Robert Nozick]] argues that distributive justice is not a matter of the whole distribution matching an ideal ''pattern'', but of each individual entitlement having the right kind of ''history''. It is just that a person has some good (especially, some [[Property rights|property right]]) if and only if they came to have it by a history made up entirely of events of two kinds:
* Just ''acquisition'', especially by working on unowned things; and
* Just ''transfer'', that is free gift, sale or other agreement, but not [[theft]] (i.e. by force or fraud).

If the chain of events leading up to the person having something meets this criterion, they are entitled to it: that they possess it is just, and what anyone else does or doesn't have or need is irrelevant.

On the basis of this theory of distributive justice, Nozick argues that all attempts to redistribute goods according to an ideal pattern, without the consent of their owners, are theft. In particular, [[redistribution (economics)|redistributive taxation]] is theft.

Some property rights theorists (like Nozick) also take a consequentialist view of distributive justice and argue that property rights based justice also has the effect of maximizing the overall wealth of an economic system.  They explain that voluntary (non-coerced) transactions always have a property called [[Pareto efficiency]]. The result is that the world is better off in an absolute sense and no one is worse off.  Such consequentialist property rights theorists argue that respecting property rights maximizes the number of Pareto efficient transactions in the world and minimized the number of non-Pareto efficient transactions in the world (i.e. transactions where someone is made worse off).  The result is that the world will have generated the greatest total benefit from the limited, scarce resources available in the world.  Further, this will have been accomplished without taking anything away from anyone unlawfully.

===Welfare-maximization===
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. This may require sacrifice of some for the good of others, so long as everyone's good is taken impartially into account. Utilitarianism, in general, argues that the standard of justification for actions, institutions, or the whole world, is ''impartial welfare consequentialism'', and only indirectly, if at all, to do with [[Human rights|rights]], [[property]], [[need]], or any other non-utilitarian criterion. These other criteria might be indirectly important, to the extent that human welfare involves them. But even then, such demands as human rights would only be elements in the calculation of overall welfare, not uncrossable barriers to action.

==Theories of retributive justice==
{{Main|Retributive justice}}

[[File:Justicia Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Justitia'' (Justice), outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]
Theories of retributive justice are concerned with [[punishment]] for wrongdoing, and need to answer three questions:
# ''why'' punish?
# ''who'' should be punished?
# ''what punishment'' should they receive?
This section considers the two major accounts of retributive justice, and their answers to these questions. ''Utilitarian'' theories look forward to the future consequences of punishment, while ''retributive'' theories look back to particular acts of wrongdoing, and attempt to balance them with deserved punishment.

===Utilitarianism===
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. Punishment fights crime in three ways:
# ''[[Deterrence (legal)|Deterrence]]''. The credible [[coercion|threat]] of punishment might lead people to make different choices; well-designed threats might lead people to make choices that maximize welfare. This matches some strong [[intuition]]s about just punishment: that it should generally be proportional to the crime.
# ''[[Rehabilitation (penology)|Rehabilitation]]''. Punishment might make bad people into better ones. For the utilitarian, all that 'bad person' can mean is 'person who's likely to cause bad things (like suffering)'. So, utilitarianism could recommend punishment that changes someone such that they are less likely to cause bad things.
# ''[[Incapacitation (penology)|Security/Incapacitation]]''. Perhaps there are people who are irredeemable causers of bad things. If so, [[Prison|imprisoning]] them might maximize welfare by limiting their opportunities to cause harm and therefore the benefit lies within protecting society.
So, the reason for punishment is the maximization of welfare, and punishment should be of whomever, and of whatever form and severity, are needed to meet that goal. This may sometimes justify punishing the innocent, or inflicting disproportionately severe punishments, when that will have the best consequences overall (perhaps executing a few suspected [[Shoplifting|shoplifters]] live on television would be an effective deterrent to shoplifting, for instance). It also suggests that punishment might turn out ''never'' to be right, depending on the facts about what actual consequences it has.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Ten, 'Crime and Punishment' in Peter Singer ed., ''A Companion to Ethics'' (Oxford: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishing]], 1993): 366–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retributivism===
The retributivist will think [[consequentialism]] is mistaken. If someone does something wrong we must respond by punishing for the committed action itself, regardless of what outcomes punishment produces. Wrongdoing must be balanced or made good in some way, and so the criminal ''deserves'' to be punished. It says that all guilty people, and only guilty people, deserve appropriate punishment. This matches some strong [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitions]] about just punishment: that it should be ''proportional'' to the crime, and that it should be of ''only'' and ''all of'' the guilty.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However, it is sometimes argued that retributivism is merely [[revenge]] in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, ''Punishment: The supposed justifications'' (London: Hutchinson &amp; Co., 1969), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences between retribution and revenge: the former is impartial and has a scale of appropriateness, whereas the latter is personal and potentially unlimited in scale.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Restorative justice===
{{Main|Restorative justice}}

Restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders, instead of satisfying abstract legal principles or punishing the offender. Victims take an active role in the process, while offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, "to repair the harm they've done&amp;nbsp;– by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service". It is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community rather than the state. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender shows the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Braswell, and John Fuller, ''Corrections, Peacemaking and Restorative Justice: Transforming Individuals and Institutions'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed theories===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Some modern philosophers have argued that Utilitarian and Retributive theories are not mutually exclusive. For example, [[Andrew von Hirsch]], in his 1976 book ''Doing Justice'', suggested that we have a moral obligation to punish greater crimes more than lesser ones. However, so long as we adhere to that constraint then utilitarian ideals would play a significant secondary role.

==Theories==

===Rawls' theory of justice===
{{further|Justice (virtue)|Cardinal virtues}}
It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Eric Heinze, ''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013), pp. 4–10, 50–60.&lt;/ref&gt; that 'systematic' or 'programmatic' political and moral philosophy in the West begins, in [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]], with the question, 'What is Justice?'&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', Book I, 331b–c.&lt;/ref&gt; According to most contemporary theories of justice, justice is overwhelmingly important: [[John Rawls]] claims that "Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought."&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (revised edn, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In classical approaches, evident from [[Plato]] through to [[John Rawls|Rawls]], the concept of 'justice' is always construed in logical or 'etymological' opposition to the concept of injustice. Such approaches cite various examples of injustice, as problems which a theory of justice must overcome.  A number of post-World War II approaches do, however, challenge that seemingly obvious dualism between those two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;
*See, e.g., Eric Heinze, ''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013).
*Clive Barnett ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice can be thought of as distinct from [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], [[prudence (virtue)|prudence]], [[mercy]], [[generosity]], or [[compassion]], although these dimensions are regularly understood to also be interlinked. Justice is the concept of [[cardinal virtue]]s, of which it is one.  Metaphysical justice has often been associated with concepts of [[destiny|fate]], [[reincarnation]] or [[Divine Providence]], i.e., with a life in accordance with a cosmic plan. The association of justice with fairness is thus historically and culturally inalienable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daston|first=Lorraine|year=2008|journal=Daedalus|pages=5–14|title=Life, Chance and Life Chances|doi=10.1162/daed.2008.137.1.5|volume=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equality before the law===
Law raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice. There is an old saying that '[[All are equal before the law]]'. The belief in equality before the law is called legal egalitarianism. In criticism of this belief, the author [[Anatole France]] said in 1894, "In its majestic equality, the law forbids [[rich and poor alike]] to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread."&lt;ref&gt;(France, ''The Red Lily'', [http://www.online-literature.com/anatole-france/red-lily/8/ Chapter VII]).&lt;/ref&gt; With this saying, France illustrated the fundamental shortcoming of a theory of legal equality that remains blind to social inequality;
the same law applied to all may have disproportionately harmful effects on the least powerful.

===Classical liberalism===
Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref name=kukathas/&gt;&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; Classical liberalism calls for equality before the law, not for [[equality of outcome]].&lt;ref name=kukathas&gt;[[Chandran Kukathas]], "Ethical Pluralism from a Classical Liberal Perspective," in ''The Many and the One: Religious and Secular Perspectives on Ethical Pluralism in the Modern World'', ed. Richard Madsen and Tracy B. Strong, Ethikon Series in Comparative Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003), 61 ({{ISBN|0-691-09993-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Classical liberalism opposes pursuing [[group rights]] at the expense of [[individual rights]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Mark Evans, ed., ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'' (London: Routledge, 2001), 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and spirituality===

====Abrahamic justice====
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumbnail|''Moses with the [[Tablets of Law]]'', by [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]]]]

[[Judaism|Jews]], [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Christianity|Christians]] traditionally believe that justice is a present, real, right, and, specifically, governing concept along with [[mercy]], and that justice is ultimately derived from and held by [[God]]. According to the [[Bible]], such [[institution]]s as the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] were created by God to require the [[Israelites]] to live by and apply His standards of justice.

The Hebrew Bible describes God as saying about the Judeo-Christian [[patriarch]] [[Abraham]]: "No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice;...." ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:19, [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV)]]. The [[Psalms|Psalmist]] describes God as having "Righteousness and justice [as] the foundation of [His] throne;...." (Psalms 89:14, NRSV).

The [[New Testament]] also describes God and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as having and displaying justice, often in comparison with God displaying and supporting [[mercy]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:7).

===Theories of sentencing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
In [[criminal law]], a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] forms the final explicit act of a [[judge]]-ruled process, and also the symbolic principal act connected to his function. The sentence can generally involve a decree of [[prison|imprisonment]], a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] and/or other [[punishment]]s against a [[defendant]] [[conviction (law)|convicted]] of a [[crime]]. Laws may specify the range of penalties that can be imposed for various offenses, and sentencing guidelines sometimes regulate what punishment within those ranges can be imposed given a certain set of offense and offender characteristics. The most common purposes of sentencing in legal theory are:

|- style="background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;"

|[[Retributive justice|Retribution]]

|-
|}

In [[civil law (common law)|civil cases]] the decision is usually known as a [[verdict]], or judgment, rather than a sentence. Civil cases are settled primarily by means of monetary compensation for harm done ("[[damages]]") and orders intended to prevent future harm (for example [[injunction]]s). Under some legal systems an award of damages involves some scope for retribution, denunciation and deterrence, by means of additional categories of damages beyond simple compensation, covering a [[Punitive damages|punitive effect, social disapprobation, and potentially, deterrence]], and occasionally [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorgement]] (forfeit of any gain, even if no loss was caused to the other party).

===Evolutionary perspectives===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Gerechtigkeit-1537.jpg|thumb|"Justice as a naked woman with a [[sword]] and [[Weighing scale|balance]]" by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1537]]

[[Evolutionary ethic]]s and an argued [[evolution of morality]] suggest [[evolutionary]] bases for the concept of justice. [[Biosocial criminology]] research argues that human perceptions of what is appropriate criminal justice are based on how to respond to crimes in the ancestral small-group environment and that these responses may not always be appropriate for today's societies.

===Reactions to fairness===
[[File:Justitia, Jost Amman.png|thumb|‘’Justitia’’, copper engraving by [[Jost Amman]], made between 1539 and 1591]]
Studies at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in 2008 have indicated that reactions to fairness are "wired" into the brain and that, "Fairness is activating the same part of the brain that responds to food in rats... This is consistent with the notion that being treated fairly satisfies a basic need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/brain-reacts-to-fairness-as-it-49042.aspx?link_page_rss=49042 |title=Brain reacts to fairness as it does to money and chocolate, study shows |work=UCLA Newsroom |publisher= UCLA |date=April 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in 2003 at [[Emory University]] involving capuchin monkeys demonstrated that other cooperative animals also possess such a sense and that "[[inequity aversion]] may not be uniquely human".&lt;ref&gt;Nature 425, 297–99 (18 September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions and justice===

In a world where people are interconnected but they disagree, institutions are required to instantiate ideals of justice. These institutions may be justified by their approximate instantiation of justice, or they may be deeply unjust when compared with ideal standards&amp;nbsp;– consider the institution of [[slavery]]. Justice is an ideal the world fails to live up to, sometimes due to deliberate opposition to justice despite understanding, which could be disastrous. The question of institutive justice raises issues of [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]], [[Legal procedure|procedure]], [[Codification (law)|codification]] and [[statutory interpretation|interpretation]], which are considered by legal theorists and by [[Philosophy of law|philosophers of law]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''''Kay's Tutor v. Ayrshire &amp; Arran Health Board''''' [1987] 2 All ER 417; 1987 S.C. 145; 1987 S.L.T. 577; is an [[Scots Delict Law]] case concerning [[Causation (law)|causation]] in a [[Medical malpractice|medical negligence]] context. It was decided by the House of Lords, with [[Lord Keith of Kinkel]], [[Lord Brandon of Oakbrook]], [[Hugh Griffiths, Baron Griffiths|Lord Griffiths]], [[Lord Mackay of Clashfern]] and [[Lord Ackner]] sitting.

==Facts==
Kay's son was admitted to hospital with [[meningitis]]. By mistake, he was given a [[penicillin]] overdose. It was thirty times the norm. He went deaf. No case had ever been recorded where penicillin had caused deafness. Often, [[meningitis]] itself caused deafness. The first instance found in favour of the plaintiff, but this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. In the House of Lords the plaintiff argued, the overdose increased the risk of neurological damage. Deafness was damage of the same type, therefore the defendants should be liable. Lord Keith demonstrated grasp of medical knowledge by describing the facts somewhat more elaborately.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Meningitis is a disease which causes [[inflammation]] of one or more of the three [[Biological membrane|membranes]] which envelop the [[central nervous system]] consisting of the brain and [[spinal chord]]{{sic|?|}}. The three membranes are the [[dura mater]], the [[arachnoid mater|arachnoid]] and the [[pia mater]]. Between the arachnoid and the underlying pia mater is the [[subarachnoid space]], which is filled with [[cerebro-spinal fluid]] (CSF). The general practitioner had treated the respiratory infection with [[ampicillin]] administered orally, but due to vomiting its therapeutic effect may have been to some extent frustrated. On admission to hospital Andrew was found to be seriously ill. He was treated with [[benzyl penicillin]] and [[sulphadiazine]] administered [[intravenous]]ly. A specimen of CSF was taken and sent for analysis. On the following day, 29 November, the laboratory reported that two cultures of [[pneumococci]] had been cultivated from the specimen. This led to a confirmed diagnosis of [[pneumococcal meningitis]], a most virulent form of the disease. The consultant [[paediatrician]] in charge of the case, Dr McClure, instructed that 10,000 units of penicillin be injected [[intrathecal]]ly, that is to say by way of lumbar puncture into the subarachnoid space containing the CSF. The reason for this procedure was to bring about that the penicillin might most readily reach the infected [[meninges]] and attack the [[bacteria]] which were causing the disease. The injection was carried out shortly after noon on that day by Dr Adam-Strump, a senior house officer. By mistake he injected about 300,000 units of penicillin instead of 10,000 units. This rapidly produced toxic effects. The child went into [[convulsion]]s and later developed a degree of [[hemiparesis]], that is to say [[paralysis]] on one side of his body. Dr Adam-Strump realised his mistake immediately, and remedial measures were urgently instituted. These were successful in saving the child's life and by 1 December the immediate ill effects of the overdose appeared to have been surmounted. A rapid recovery from the meningitis also followed. He was discharged from hospital on 24 December. His parents before then had begun to suspect that he was suffering from deafness. This proved to be indeed the case. He was suffering and still suffers from profound [[bilateral deafness]]."&lt;ref&gt;1987 S.L.T. 577, 578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Judgment==
It was held that where two competing causes of damage existed the law could not presume that the tortious cause was responsible. It needed to be proved that it was an accepted fact that the tortious cause was capable of aggravating the damage. The case was distinguished from ''[[McGhee v. National Coal Board]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[McGhee v. National Coal Board]]'' [1973] 1 W.L.R. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Ackner, who gave the final judgment, offered a good anecdotal account of the evidence at trial about the possible causes of the boy's deafness.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr McAllister, consultant bacteriologist in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow had made a special study in laboratory and clinical assessment of antibiotics, organising many symposia on antibiotics all over the world and, in particular, Europe and the United States. His contributions to the literature on this subject numbered nearly 100, including 20 dealing with penicillins. He confirmed that pneumococcal meningitis was the classical disease for producing deafness. He was asked whether he had ever come across any information which would suggest that an overdose of intrathecal penicillin causes or could cause deafness. He said he had searched the literature, he had computer scans done by three different processes, he had watched for years and in his experience there was no single recorded case of deafness from such an overdose.
He was asked in terms by the Lord Ordinary whether, as a bacteriologist, he was saying there was any reason why an overdose of penicillin injected intrathecally could not cause deafness. His reply was:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As a medical scientist I need evidence for things, without evidence and without rational balance of evidence medicine is a dead duck and in this case there is no evidence that an overdose of intrathecal Benzylpenicillin ever has caused deafness." In answer to a further question from the learned judge he said:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are possible and in medicine we never say never, but from the point of view of scientific medicine to my mind there is no evidence to incriminate an overdose of intrathecal Benzylpenicillin as a cause of deafness in this or in other cases and on the other side of the waterfall there is a massive amount of evidence to incriminate pneumococcal meningitis as one of the best known causes."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only evidence to the effect that penicillin was the cause of the boy's deafness came from Mr Williams, a neuro-surgeon. His theory that penicillin injected intrathecally would itself have a destructive effect on the auditory nerve was rejected by the Lord Ordinary. The Lord Ordinary, however, developed his own theory, which was not put to any of the expert medical witnesses who gave evidence for the respondents nor was it canvassed at all at the hearing. The First Division of the Court of Session held that the appellant was not entitled to succeed on the basis of this theory and this decision has not been challenged before your Lordships.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lord Ackner agreed that this case was distinguishable from ''McGhee''. In ''McGhee'' there was no problem about evidence that the failure to provide a shower could have caused Mr McGhee's dermatitis. The "could have" element simply reflected that it was uncertain which cause (the brick dust at work, or the lack of a shower) was the operating cause of dermatitis. But here, the idea that the penicillin overdose "could have" caused deafness was of a different quality. It was not just of lesser degree of possibility, but that there was no evidential basis for the assertion at all.

The '''Kosher tax''' was one of several indirect taxes imposed by the Russian Imperial government and sometimes by [[Hapsburg empire]], Germany and Moldavia on Jews.&lt;ref name="ji"&gt;[[Herman Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Herman]]; [[Jacob Goodale Lipman|Lipman, J.G.]] [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=394&amp;letter=B "Basket-Tax"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belovinskiĭ2003p357"&gt;Leonid Vasilʹevich Belovinskiĭ.

==Russia==

In [[Russia]], the tax, known as the ''korobka'', was a tax paid only by Jews for each animal slaughtered in accordance with the [[kashrut]] rules and for each pound of this meat sold.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/kraziai/history_tax_on_jews.htm Korobka Tax on Kraziai's Jews], Document 49-1-1362 from the Kaunas Archive&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the Russian Jewish "basket tax" or "box tax". Though it was used to refer to a tax on meat or slaughtering, the word ''korobka'' (Russian: коробка) actually means "box" in Russian. The tax came to be called that because Jews paying had to deposit a coin in a box at the kosher slaughterer.&lt;ref name=Diner2001p164&gt;[[Hasia R. Diner|Diner, Hasia R.]] ''Hungering for America: Italian, Irish, and Jewish Foodways in the Age of Migration'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00605-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zU1WYFWxn74C&amp;pg=PA164 p.&amp;nbsp;164.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman Rosenthal]] and [[Jacob Goodale Lipman]], the tax was "the most burdensome and annoying of the special taxes imposed upon the Jews of Russia by the government".&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt; The burden of taxes, and the ''korobka'' in particular, was one of the factors which drove many Jews to abandon the towns and settle in villages or on noblemen estates.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica (1971): History, vol. 8, 734&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galicia==
With the annexation to Austria in 1772, special taxes were imposed on [[Galician Jews]] ("[[Ostjuden|Eastern Jews]]") for marriage permits, kosher meat, synagogues, and similar items.

Between 1777 to 1784, the Jews of [[Horodenka]], a region on the south-east corner of Galicia, paid a number of special taxes, including the "Protection and [[Tolerance tax|Tolerance Tax]]", and "Property and Occupation tax". In 1784, the Property and Occupation Tax was cancelled and replaced with the Kosher Meat Tax.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, N. M. ''The History of the Jews of Horodenka'', p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moldavia==

In 1741, [[Moldavia]]n prince [[Grigore II Ghica|Grigore Ghica]] confirmed the obligation of each Jew to pay the ''crupca'', an indirect tax on kosher meat similar to the Russian ''korobka''.&lt;ref&gt;Herşcovici, Lucian-Zeev (August 16, 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Iasi Iaşi]." Translated from Romanian by Anca Mircea. ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 2016-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Germany]] appears to have had a "kosher meat tax" imposed by municipalities and used to support the local Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

{{Wiktionary|loyalty|allegiance|troth}}
'''Loyalty''', in general use, is a [[Fixation (psychology)|devotion]] and [[faithfulness]] to a nation, cause, philosophy, [[country]], group, or [[person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/loyalty |title=Loyalty definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary |publisher=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophers]] disagree on what can be an object of loyalty, as some argue that loyalty is strictly interpersonal and only another human [[being]] can be the object of loyalty. The definition of loyalty in [[law]] and [[political science]] is the fidelity of an individual to a [[nation]], either one's nation of birth, or one's declared home nation by [[oath]] ([[naturalization]]).

==Historical concepts==

=== Western world ===
{{further|Semper fidelis|In Treue fest|Fidelity|Tryggvi}}
Classical [[tragedy]] is often based on a conflict arising from [[dual loyalty]]. 
''[[Euthyphro]]'', one of [[Plato]]'s early dialogues, is based on the ethical dilemma arising from
Euthyphro intending to lay manslaughter charges against his own father, who had caused the death of a slave through negligence.

In the [[Gospel of Matthew]] 6:24, Jesus states, "No one can serve two masters.  Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.  Ye cannot serve God and [[mammon]]".  This relates to the authority of a master over his servants (as per [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 6:5), who, according to [[Biblical law]], owe undivided loyalty to their master (as per Leviticus 25:44–46).&lt;ref name=White2000 /&gt;
On the other hand, the "[[Render unto Caesar]]" of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties (secular and religious) without conflict, but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to God, the latter takes precedence.&lt;ref name=SharmaSharma1998 /&gt;

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] defines loyalty as "allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one's country" and also "personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family".  It traces the word "[[wikt:loyalty|loyalty]]" to the 15th century, noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service, in love, or to an [[oath]] that one has made. The meaning that the ''Britannica'' gives as primary, it attributes to a shift during the 16th century, noting that the origin of the word is in the [[Old French]] "[[wikt:loialte|loialte]]", that is in turn rooted in the [[Latin language|Latin]] "[[wikt:lex|lex]]", meaning "[[wikt:law|law]]".  One who is loyal, in the [[feudalism|feudal]] sense of [[fealty]], is one who is lawful (as opposed to an [[outlaw]]), who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful [[allegiance]] to a feudal lord.  Hence the 1911 ''Britannica'' derived its (early 20th century) primary meaning of loyalty to a [[monarch]].&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandekerckhove2006 /&gt;

(Zhong){{clarify-inline||date=August 2017|reason=What does "zong" mean?  Per Wiktionary, it does not seem to be the Mandarin word for "loyalty", nor the name of a (Confucian) philosopher who wrote about the subject.}} Often cited as one of the many virtues of [[Confucianism]], meaning to do the best you can do for others.

"Loyalty" is the most important and frequently emphasized virtue in [[Bushido]]. It combines other six virtues, such as Righteousness ([[wikt:義|義 gi?]]), Courage ([[wikt:勇気|勇 yū?]]), Benevolence, ([[wikt:仁|仁 jin?]]), Respect ([[wikt:礼|礼 rei?]]), Sincerity ([[wikt:誠|誠 makoto?]]), Honour ([[wikt:名誉|名誉 meiyo?]]), and formed the Bushido code: "It is somehow implanted in their chromosomal makeup to be loyal".&lt;ref name=Hurst1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurst|first1=G. Cameron|title=Death, Honor, and Loyality{{sic}}: The Bushidō Ideal|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=October 1990|volume=40|issue=4|page=516|issn=0031-8221|doi=10.2307/1399355|jstor=1399355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern concepts==

[[Josiah Royce]] presented a different definition of the concept in his 1908 book ''The Philosophy of Loyalty''. According to Royce, loyalty is a [[virtue]], indeed a primary virtue, "the heart of all the virtues, the central duty amongst all the duties". Royce presents loyalty, which he defines at length, as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived.&lt;ref name=Thilly1908 /&gt;  The short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is "the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause".&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thilly1908 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin1994 /&gt;  Loyalty is thoroughgoing in that it is not merely a casual interest but a wholehearted commitment to a cause.&lt;ref name=Mullin2005 /&gt;

Royce's view of loyalty was challenged by Ladd in the article on "Loyalty" in the first edition of the Macmillan ''[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1967).

Ralls (1968) observes that Ladd's article is the Macmillan ''Encyclopaedia''{{'}}s only article on a virtue, and praises it for its "magnificent" declaration by Ladd that "a loyal Nazi is a contradiction in terms".&lt;ref name=Ralls1968 /&gt;
Ladd asserts that, contrary to Royce, causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal, not impersonal or suprapersonal.&lt;ref name=Baron1984 /&gt;  He states that Royce's view has "the ethical defect of postulating duties over and above our individual duties to men and groups of men.  The individual is submerged and lost in this superperson for its tends to dissolve our specific duties to others into 'superhuman' good". Ronald F. Duska, the Lamont Post Chair of Ethics and the Professions at [[The American College of Financial Services|The American College]], extends Ladd's objection, saying that it is a perversion of ethics and virtue for one's self-will to be identified with anything, as Royce would have it.  Even if one were identifying one's self-will with God, to be worthy of such loyalty God would have to be the ''[[summum bonum]]'', the perfect manifestation of good.

Ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal, i.e., a relationship between a lord and vassal, parent and child, or two good friends.  Duska states that doing so leads to a problem that Ladd overlooks.  Loyalty may certainly be between two persons, but it may also be from a person to a group of people.  Examples of this, which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty, are loyalty by a person to his or her family, to a team that he or she is a member or fan of, or to his or her country.  The problem with this that Duska identifies is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved, and whether Ladd's contention that loyalty is interpersonal—not suprapersonal—is an adequate description.&lt;ref name=Duska2007 /&gt;

Ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives: its proper object and its moral value.&lt;ref name=Ladd1967 /&gt;  

John Kleinig, professor of [[philosophy]] at [[City University of New York]], observes that over the years the idea has been treated by writers from [[Aeschylus]] through [[John Galsworthy]] to [[Joseph Conrad]], by psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, scholars of religion, political economists, scholars of business and marketing, and—most particularly—by political theorists, who deal with it in terms of [[loyalty oath]]s and [[patriotism]]. As a philosophical concept, loyalty was largely untreated by philosophers until the work of [[Josiah Royce]], the "grand exception" in Kleinig's words.&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;  John Ladd, professor of philosophy at [[Brown University]], writing in the Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' in 1967, observes that by that time the subject had received "scant attention in philosophical literature". This he attributed to "odious" associations that the subject had with [[nationalism]], including [[Nazism]], and with the metaphysics of [[idealism]], which he characterized as "obsolete". However, he argued that such associations were faulty and that the notion of loyalty is "an essential ingredient in any civilized and humane system of morals".&lt;ref name=Ladd1967 /&gt;  Kleinig observes that from the 1980s onwards, the subject gained attention, with philosophers variously relating it to [[professional ethics]], [[whistleblowing]], [[friendship]], and [[virtue theory]].&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;

Additional aspects enumerated by Kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects.&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;

=== The proper object of loyalty ===
Ladd and others, including [[Milton R. Konvitz]]{{year needed|date=October 2015}} and Marcia W. Baron (1984),&lt;ref name=Baron1984/&gt; disagree amongst themselves as to the proper ''object of'' loyalty—what it is possible to be loyal ''to'', in other words.  Ladd, as stated, considers loyalty to be interpersonal, and that the object of loyalty is always a person. In the ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Ideas'', Konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles, causes, ideas, ideals, religions, ideologies, nations, governments, parties, leaders, families, friends, regions, racial groups, and "anyone or anything to which one's heart can become attached or devoted".  Baron agrees with Ladd, inasmuch as loyalty is "to certain people or to a group of people, not loyalty to an ideal or cause".  She argues in her [[monograph]], ''The Moral Status of Loyalty'', that "[w]hen we speak of causes (or ideals) we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them".  Kleinig agrees with Baron, noting that a person's earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people, and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values, causes, and ideals.  He disagrees, however, with the notion that loyalties are restricted ''solely'' to personal attachments, considering it "incorrect (as a matter of logic)".&lt;ref name=Kleinig1996 /&gt; Loyalty to people and abstract notions such as causes or ideals is considered an [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary tactic]], as there is a greater chance of survival and procreation if animals belong to loyal packs.&lt;ref name="breedbites"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Tribes in Evolution |work=Breed Bites |date=1 December 2007 |url=https://breedbites.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/the-power-of-tribes-in-evolution/ |accessdate=23 January 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplicity, disloyalty, and whether loyalty is exclusionary ===
Stephen Nathanson, professor of Philosophy at [[Northeastern University]], states that loyalty can be either ''exclusionary'' or ''non-exclusionary''; and can be ''single'' or ''multiple''.  Exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups; whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not.  People may have single loyalties, to just one person, group, or thing, or multiple loyalties to multiple objects.  Multiple loyalties can constitute a ''disloyalty'' to an object if one of those loyalties is ''exclusionary'', excluding one of the others.  However, Nathanson observes, this is a special case.  In the general case, the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty.  One can, for example, be loyal to one's friends, or one's family, and still, without contradiction, be loyal to one's religion, or profession.

=== Other dimensions ===
In addition to ''number'' and ''exclusion'' as just outlined, Nathanson enumerates five other "dimensions" that loyalty can vary along: basis, strength, scope, legitimacy, and attitude.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''basis'' according to their foundations. They may be constructed upon the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty, such as biological ties or place of birth (a notion of natural allegiance propounded by [[Socrates]] in his political theory). Alternatively, they may be constructed from personal choice and evaluation of criteria with a full degree of freedom. The degree of control that one has is not necessarily simple; Nathanson points out that whilst one has no choice as to one's parents or relatives, one ''can'' choose to desert them.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''strength''.  They can range from supreme loyalties, that override all other considerations, to merely presumptive loyalties, that affect one's presumptions, providing but one motivation for action that is weighed against other motivations.  Nathanson observes that strength of loyalty is often interrelated with basis.  "[[Blood is thicker than water]]", states an aphorism, explaining that loyalties that have biological ties as their bases are generally stronger.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''scope''.  They range from loyalties with limited scope, that require few actions of the subject, to loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes, which require many actions, or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty.  Loyalty to one's job, for example, may require no more action than simple punctuality and performance of the tasks that the job requires.  Loyalty to a family member can, in contrast, have a very broad effect upon one's actions, requiring considerable personal sacrifice.  Extreme patriotic loyalty may impose an unlimited scope of duties.  Scope encompasses an element of ''constraint''.  Where two or more loyalties conflict, their scopes determine what weight to give to the alternative courses of action required by each loyalty.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''[[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]''.  This is of particular relevance to the conflicts among multiple loyalties.  People with one loyalty can hold that another, conflicting, loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate.  In the extreme view, one that Nathanson ascribes to religious extremists and xenophobes for examples, all loyalties bar one's own are considered illegitimate.  The xenophobe does not regard the loyalties of foreigners to their countries as legitimate while the religious extremist does not acknowledge the legitimacy of other religions.  At the other end of the spectrum, past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not, according to cases, or plain and simple indifference to other people's loyalties, is the positive regard of other people's loyalties.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Finally, loyalties differ in the ''attitude'' that the subjects of the loyalties have towards other people.  (Note that this dimension of loyalty concerns the ''subjects'' of the loyalty, whereas legitimacy, above, concerns the loyalties themselves.)  People may have one of a range of possible attitudes towards others who do not share their loyalties, with hate and disdain at one end, indifference in the middle, and concern and positive feeling at the other.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

==In relation to other subjects==

===Patriotism===
{{Main|Patriotism}}
Nathanson observes that loyalty is often directly equated to patriotism.  He states, that this is, however, not actually the case, arguing that whilst patriots exhibit loyalty, it is not conversely the case that all loyal persons are patriots.  He provides the example of a [[mercenary]] soldier, who exhibits loyalty to the people or country that pays him.  Nathanson points to the difference in motivations between a loyal mercenary and a patriot.  A mercenary may well be motivated by a sense of [[professionalism]] or a belief in the sanctity of [[contracts]].  A patriot, in contrast, may be motivated by affection, concern, identification, and a willingness to sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Nathanson contends that patriotic loyalty is not always a virtue.  A loyal person can, in general be relied upon, and hence people view loyalty as virtuous.  Nathanson argues that loyalty can, however, be given to persons or causes that are unworthy.  Moreover, loyalty can lead patriots to support policies that are immoral and inhumane.  Thus, Nathanson argues, patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue, when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable.  Such loyalties, in Nathanson's view, are erroneously ''unlimited'' in their scopes, and fail to acknowledge boundaries of morality.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

===Whistleblowing===
{{Main|Whistleblowing}}
Several scholars, including Duska, discuss loyalty in the context of whistleblowing.  Wim Vandekerckhove of the [[University of Greenwich]] points out that in the late 20th century saw the rise of a notion of a ''bidirectional'' loyalty—between employees and their employer.  (Previous thinking had encompassed the idea that employees are loyal to an employer, but not that an employer need be loyal to employees.)  The ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties, where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his or her community, which the employer's business practices may be adversely affecting.  Vandekerckhove reports that different scholars resolve the conflict in different ways, some of which he, himself, does not find to be satisfactory.  Duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances, the community, a position that Vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty.

John Corvino, associate professor of Philosophy at [[Wayne State University]] takes a different tack, arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice, not a virtue, and that "loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good" (similar to Nathanson). Vandekerckhove calls this argument "interesting" but "too vague" in its description of how tolerant an employee should be of an employer's shortcomings.  Vandekerckhove suggests that Duska and Corvino combine, however, to point in a direction that makes it possible to resolve the conflict of loyalties in the context of whistleblowing, by clarifying the objects of those loyalties.&lt;ref name=Vandekerckhove2006 /&gt;

===Marketing===
{{Main|Loyalty business model}}
Businesses seek to become the objects of loyalty in order to retain customers. [[Brand loyalty]] is a consumer's preference for a particular [[brand]] and a commitment to repeatedly purchase that brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dick Alan S. |author2=Basu Kunal | year = 1994 | title = Customer Loyalty: Toward an Integrated Conceptual Framework | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1177%2F0092070394222001 | journal = Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1177/0092070394222001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loyalty programs]] offer rewards to repeat customers in exchange for being able to keep track of consumer preferences and buying habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharp Byron |author2=Sharp Anne | year = 1997 | title = Loyalty Programs and Their Impact on Repeat-Purchase Loyalty Patterns | url = http://byronsharp.com/resources/6076.PDF| journal = International Journal of Research in Marketing | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 473–86 | doi=10.1016/s0167-8116(97)00022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One similar concept is [[fan loyalty]], an allegiance to and abiding interest in a [[sports team]], [[fictional character]], or fictional series. Devoted sports fans continue to remain fans even in the face of a string of losing seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Mark|title=The Business of Sports: A Primer for Journalists|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415876520| edition=2|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YG2wf1DT1MYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==
Attempting to serve two masters leads to “double-mindedness” ([[Epistle of James|James]] 4:8), undermining loyalty to a cause. The [[Bible]] also speaks of loyal ones, which would be those who follow the Bible with absolute loyalty, as in "Precious in the eyes of God is the death of his loyal ones" ([[Psalms]] 116:15).  Most Jewish and Christian authors view the [[binding of Isaac]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22), in which [[Abraham]] was called by God to offer his son Isaac as a [[burnt offering]], as a test of Abraham's loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Louis A., ''The Akedah: The Binding of Isaac''. (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997; {{ISBN|1-56821-899-0}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s faithfulness to his master [[Potiphar]] and his rejection of Potiphar's wife's advances ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 39) have also been called an example of the virtue of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;[[William J. Bennett]], ''[[The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories]]'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995; {{ISBN|0-684-83577-0}}), p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misplaced==
{{Main|Misplaced loyalty}}
Misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or [[organisations]] where that loyalty is not acknowledged or [[respect]]ed, is [[Betrayal|betrayed]], or taken advantage of. It can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause.

[[Social psychology (sociology)|Social psychology]] provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way "the ''norm of social commitment'' directs us to honor our agreements...People usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot R. Smith and Diane M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanists]] point out that "man inherits the capacity for loyalty, but not the use to which he shall put it...may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile, as he may to what is generous and noble".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur James Balfour, ''Theism and Humanism'' (2000) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Edwin Landseer Attachment.JPG|thumb|160px|right| Foxie, guarding the body of her master [[Charles Gough (artist)| Charles Gough]], in  ''Attachment'' by [[Edwin Landseer]], 1829]]

Animals as [[pet]]s have a large sense of loyalty to humans. Famous cases include [[Greyfriars Bobby]], a Skye terrier who attended his master's grave for fourteen years; [[Hachiko]], a dog who returned to the place he used to meet his master every day for nine years after his [[death]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AC95cdzhg_4C&amp;pg=PA7 |title= First Friend |author= Katharine Rogers|isbn= 9781450208734 |date= April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Foxie, the [[spaniel]] belonging to [[Charles Gough (artist)|Charles Gough]], who stayed by her dead master's side for three months on [[Helvellyn]] in the [[Lake District]] in 1805 (although it is possible that Foxie had eaten Gough's body).&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first= Jonathan |last= Jones |date= 15 March 2003 |title= The Romantics and the Myth of Charles Gough |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/mar/15/art.artsfeatures |work= The Guardian |location= London |accessdate= 25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the righteous King [[Yudhishthira]] appears at the gates of Heaven at the end of his life with a stray dog he had picked up along the way as a companion, having previously lost his brothers and his wife to death.  The god [[Indra]] is prepared to admit him to Heaven, but refuses to admit the dog, so Yudhishthira refuses to abandon the dog, and prepares to turn away from the gates of Heaven.  Then the dog is revealed{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to be the manifestation of [[Dharma]], the god of righteousness and justice, and who turned out to be his deified self.  Yudhishthira enters heaven in the company of his dog, the god of righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;
''[[Mahabharata]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm book 17, ch. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, supra, pp. 684–85
&lt;/ref&gt;
Yudhishthira is known by the [[epithet]] Dharmaputra, the lord of righteous duty.

'''Marginal demand'''  in [[economics]] is the change in demand for a product or service in response to a specific change in its price.

Normally, as prices for goods or service rise, demand falls, and conversely, as prices for goods or services fall, demand rises.

A product or service where price changes cause a relatively big change in demand is said to have ''elastic'' demand. A product or service where price changes cause a relatively small change in demand is said to have  ''inelastic'' demand. See [[Elasticity of demand]].

'''Micro-sustainability''' focuses on the small [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al actions that collectively result in a large [[environmental impact]]. Micro-sustainability centers on individual efforts, [[behavior modification]] and creating attitudinal changes, which result in an environmentally conscious individual or community. Micro-sustainability encourages sustainable changes through "change agents", which are individuals that are encouraged; and therefore, foster positive environmental action inside their [[sphere of influence]]. Examples of micro-sustainability include [[recycling]], [[power saving]] by turning off unused lights, programming [[thermostat]]s for efficient [[energy use|use of energy]], reducing [[water usage]], changing [[driving habits]] or patterns in order to use less gasoline or modifying [[buying habits]] to reduce waste and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. The focus is on individual actions, rather than organizational practices. These narrow, small ticket, community level actions have immediate local benefits. If widely imitated, they have a cumulative,&lt;ref name=transformative&gt;[http://www.grist.org/article/2010-02-01-how-personal-actions-can-kick-start-a-sustainability-revolution How personal actions can kick-start a sustainability revolution | Grist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; broader impact.

The remaining large-scale plans for [[sustainability]], categorized under the term ''macro-sustainability'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jessestallone.com/2009/12/29/micro-vs-macro-sustainability/|title=Micro vs Macro Sustainability|date=2009-12-29|work=Jesse Stallone|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Macro-economics of mineral and water resources.|last = Kisor|first = Kaulir|publisher = Capital Publishing Company|year = 2015|isbn = |location = India|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are in most cases addressed by governments, multi-national corporations or companies. They combat [[global issue]]s including [[climate change]], and reliance upon [[petroleum]]-based energy sources. Businesses primarily focus on the business case and return on investment of changes such as their source of energy or the way they transport or manufacture products. Governments confront these larger issues through increased regulation, subsidies, and investment in new technologies and energy sources.

{{Human history}}
'''Modernity''', a topic in the humanities and social sciences, is both a historical period (the [[modern era]]), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural [[norm (social)|norms]], attitudes and practices that arose in the wake of the [[Renaissance]]{{mdash}}in the "[[Age of Reason]]" of 17th-century thought and the 18th-century "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]". Some commentators consider the era of modernity to have ended by 1930, with [[World War II]] in 1945, or the 1980s or 1990s; the following era is called [[postmodernity]]. The term "[[contemporary history]]" is also used to refer to the post-1945 timeframe, without assigning it to either the modern or postmodern era.  (Thus "modern" may be used as a name of a particular era in the past, as opposed to meaning "the current era".)

Depending on the field, "modernity" may refer to different time periods or qualities.  In historiography, the 17th and 18th centuries are usually described as [[early modern]], while the [[long 19th century]] corresponds to "[[modern history]]" proper. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from [[fashion]] to [[modern warfare]]), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics {{harv|Berman|2010|loc=15–36}}.

As an analytical concept and [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] ideal, modernity is closely linked to the [[ethos]] of philosophical and aesthetic [[modernism]]; political and intellectual currents that intersect with the Enlightenment; and subsequent developments such as [[existentialism]], [[modern art]], the formal establishment of [[social science]], and contemporaneous antithetical developments such as [[Marxism]].  It also encompasses the social relations associated with the rise of capitalism, and shifts in attitudes associated with secularisation and post-industrial [[Personal life|life]] {{harv|Berman|2010|loc=15–36}}.

In the view of [[Michel Foucault|Michel]] {{harvtxt|Foucault|1975}} (classified as a proponent of [[postmodernism]] though he himself rejected the "postmodernism" label, considering his work as a "a critical history of modernity"{{mdash}}see, e.g., {{harvnb|Call|2002|loc=65}}), "modernity" as a historical category is marked by developments such as a questioning or rejection of [[tradition]]; the prioritization of [[individualism]], [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[equality before the law|formal equality]]; faith in inevitable social, scientific and technological [[progress (history)|progress]], [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and [[professionalization]], a movement from [[feudalism]] (or [[agrarianism]]) toward [[capitalism]] and the [[market economy]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and [[secularization]], the development of the [[nation-state]], [[representative democracy]], [[public education]] (etc.) {{harv|Foucault|1977|loc=170–77&lt;!--wrong for the Penguin edition, at any rate--&gt;}}.

In the context of [[art history]], "modernity" (''modernité'') has a more limited sense, "[[modern art]]" covering the period of c. 1860–1970. Use of the term in this sense is  attributed to [[Charles Baudelaire]], who in his 1864 essay "The Painter of Modern Life", designated the "fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis", and the responsibility art has to capture that experience. In this sense, the term refers to "a particular relationship to time, one characterized by intense historical discontinuity or rupture, openness to the novelty of the future, and a heightened sensitivity to what is unique about the present" {{harv|Kompridis|2006|loc=32–59}}.

==Etymology==
The [[Late Latin]] adjective ''[[:wikt:modernus#Latin|modernus]]'', a derivation from the adverb ''[[:wikt:modo#Latin|modo]]'' "presently, just now", is attested from the 5th century, at first in the context of distinguishing the [[Ancient Roman Christianity|Christian era]] from the [[Decline of Greco-Roman paganism|pagan era]]. 
In the 6th century, [[Cassiodorus]] appears to have been the first writer to use ''modernus'' "modern" regularly to refer to his own age {{harv|O'Donnell|1979|loc=235 n9}}. 
The terms ''antiquus'' and ''modernus'' were used in a chronological sense in the [[Carolingian era]]. For example, a ''magister modernus'' referred to a contemporary scholar, as opposed to old authorities such as [[Benedict of Nursia]]. In early medieval usage, ''modernus'' referred to authorities younger than pagan antiquity and the early church fathers, but not necessarily to the present day, and could include authors several centuries old, from about the time of [[Beda]], i.e. referring to the time after the foundation of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and/or the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] {{harv|Hartmann|1974|loc=passim}}.

The Latin adjective was adopted in  [[Middle French]], as ''moderne'', by the 15th century, and hence, in the early [[Tudor period]], into [[Early Modern English]].
The early modern word meant "now existing", or "pertaining to the present times", not necessarily with a positive connotation.
[[Shakespeare]] uses ''modern'' in the sense of "every-day, ordinary, commonplace".

The word entered wide usage in the context of the  late 17th-century [[quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] within the [[Académie française]], debating the question of "Is Modern culture superior to Classical (Græco–Roman) culture?"
In the context of this debate, the "ancients" (''anciens'') and "moderns" (''modernes'') were proponents of opposing views, the former believing that contemporary writers could do no better than imitate the genius of classical antiquity, while the latter, 
first with [[Charles Perrault]] (1687), proposed that more than a mere "[[Renaissance]]" of ancient achievements, the "[[17th-century philosophy|Age of Reason]]" had gone beyond what had been possible in the classical period. 
The term [[:wikt:modernity|modernity]], first coined in the 1620s, in this context assumed the implication of a historical epoch following the Renaissance, in which the achievements of antiquity were surpassed {{harv|Delanty| 2007}}.

==Phases&lt;!--'Phases of modernity' redirects here; section linked from 'Contemporary history'--&gt;==
Modernity has been associated with cultural and [[intellectual]] movements of 1436–1789 and extending to the 1970s or later {{harv|Toulmin|1992|loc=3–5}}.

According to [[Marshall Berman|Marshall]] {{harvtxt|Berman|1982|loc=16–17}}, modernity is periodized into three conventional phases (dubbed "Early," "Classical," and "Late," respectively, by Peter {{harvtxt|Osborne|1992|loc=25}}):

* [[Early modern period|Early modernity]]: 1500–1789 (or 1453–1789 in traditional historiography)
* Classical modernity: 1789–1900 (corresponding to the [[long 19th century]] (1789–1914) in [[Eric Hobsbawm|Hobsbawm]]'s scheme)
* Late modernity: 1900–1989

In the second phase Berman draws upon the growth of modern technologies such as the newspaper, telegraph and other forms of mass media. There was a great shift into modernization in the name of industrial capitalism. Finally in the third phase, modernist arts and individual creativity marked the beginning of a new modernist age  as it combats oppressive politics, economics as well as other social forces including mass media {{harv|Laughey|2007|loc=30}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Citations are needed to the relevant writings of Berman, not just to a tertiary source (namely Laughey 2007).--&gt;

Some authors, such as [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} believe that modernity ended in the mid- or late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely [[Postmodernity]] (1930s/1950s/1990s–present). Other theorists, however, regard the period from the late 20th century to the present as merely another phase of modernity; [[Zygmunt Bauman|Zygmunt]] {{harvtxt|Bauman|1989}}{{Page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--Or is this in Bauman 2000, or both?--&gt; calls this phase [[Liquid modernity|"liquid" modernity]], {{harvtxt|Giddens|1998}}{{Page needed|date=September 2014}} labels it "high" modernity (see [[High modernism]]).

==Definition==

===Political===
Politically, modernity's earliest phase starts with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s works which openly rejected the medieval and Aristotelian style of analyzing politics by comparison with ideas about how things should be, in favour of realistic analysis of how things really are. He also proposed that an aim of politics is to control one's own chance or fortune, and that relying upon providence actually leads to evil. Machiavelli argued, for example, that violent divisions within political communities are unavoidable, but can also be a source of strength which lawmakers and leaders should account for and even encourage in some ways {{harv|Strauss|1987}}.

Machiavelli's recommendations were sometimes influential upon kings and princes, but eventually came to be seen as favoring free republics over monarchies {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=1}}. Machiavelli in turn influenced [[Francis Bacon]] {{harv|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[Marchamont Needham]] {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] ({{harvnb|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}), [[John Milton]] {{harv|Bock, Skinner, and Viroli|1990|loc=chapt. 11{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[David Hume]] {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, and many others {{harv|Strauss|1958}}.

Important modern political doctrines which stem from the new Machiavellian realism include [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]]'s influential proposal that "''Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits''" (the last sentence of his ''[[Fable of the Bees]]''), and also the doctrine of a constitutional "[[separation of powers]]" in government, first clearly proposed by [[Montesquieu]]. Both these principles are enshrined within the [[constitution]]s of most [[modern democracy|modern democracies]]. It has been observed that while Machiavelli's realism saw a value to war and political violence, his lasting influence has been "tamed" so that useful conflict was deliberately converted as much as possible to formalized political struggles and the economic "conflict" encouraged between free, private enterprises ({{harvnb|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 5{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}; {{harvnb|Mansfield|1989}}).

Starting with [[Thomas Hobbes]], attempts were made to use the methods of the new modern physical sciences, as proposed by [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[Descartes]], applied to humanity and politics {{harv|Berns|1987}}. Notable attempts to improve upon the methodological approach of Hobbes include those of [[John Locke]] {{harv|Goldwin|1987}}, [[Spinoza]] {{harv|Rosen|1987}}, [[Giambattista Vico|Giambattista]] {{harvtxt|Vico|1984|loc=xli}}, and {{harvtxt|Rousseau|1997|loc=part 1}}. [[David Hume]] made what he considered to be the first proper attempt at trying to apply Bacon's scientific method to political subjects {{harv|Hume|1896 [1739]|loc=''intro.''}}, rejecting some aspects of the approach of Hobbes.

Modernist republicanism openly influenced the foundation of republics during the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1568–1609) {{harv|Bock, Skinner, and Viroli|1990|loc=chapt. 10,12{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive pages.--&gt;}}, [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}, [[American Revolution]] (1775–1783) {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 6–11{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}, the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), and the Haitian revolution (1791–1804). {{harv|Orwin and Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 8{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}.

A second phase of modernist political thinking begins with Rousseau, who questioned the natural rationality and sociality of humanity and proposed that [[human nature]] was much more malleable than had been previously thought. By this logic, what makes a good political system or a good man is completely dependent upon the chance path a whole people has taken over history. This thought influenced the political (and aesthetic) thinking of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Burke]] and others and led to a critical review of modernist politics. On the conservative side, Burke argued that this understanding encouraged caution and avoidance of radical change. However more ambitious movements also developed from this insight into human [[culture]], initially [[Romanticism]] and [[Historicism]], and eventually both the [[Communism]] of [[Karl Marx]], and the modern forms of [[nationalism]] inspired by the [[French Revolution]], including, in one extreme, the German [[Nazi]] movement {{harv|Orwin and Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}.

On the other hand, the notion of modernity has been contested also due to its Euro-centric underpinnings. This is further aggravated by the re-emergence of non-Western powers. Yet, the contestations about modernity are also linked with Western notions of democracy, social discipline, and development {{harv|Regilme|2012|loc=96}}.

===Sociological===
[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of the original German edition of [[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'']]
In [[sociology]], a discipline that arose in direct response to the social problems of "modernity" {{harv|Harriss|2000|loc=325}}, the term most generally refers to the social conditions, processes, and discourses consequent to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In the most basic terms, [[Anthony Giddens]] describes modernity as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...a shorthand term for modern society, or industrial civilization. Portrayed in more detail, it is associated with (1) a certain set of attitudes towards the world, the idea of the world as open to transformation, by human intervention; (2) a complex of economic institutions, especially industrial production and a market economy; (3) a certain range of political institutions, including the nation-state and mass democracy. Largely as a result of these characteristics, modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of social order. It is a society—more technically, a complex of [[institution]]s—which, unlike any preceding culture, lives in the future, rather than the past {{harv|Giddens|1998|loc=94}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other writers have criticized such definitions as just being a listing of factors. They argue that modernity, contingently understood as marked by an ontological formation in dominance, needs to be defined much more fundamentally in terms of different ways of being. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The modern is thus defined by the way in which prior valences of social life ... are reconstituted through a constructivist reframing of social practices in relation to basic categories of existence common to all humans: time, space, embodiment, performance and knowledge. The word 'reconstituted' here explicitly does not mean replaced. {{harv|James|2015|loc= 51–52}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that modernity overlays earlier formations of traditional and customary life without necessarily replacing them.

===Cultural and philosophical===
The era of modernity is characterised socially by industrialisation and the division of labour and philosophically by "the loss of certainty, and the realization that certainty can never be established, once and for all" {{harv|Delanty|2007}}. With new social and philosophical conditions arose fundamental new challenges. Various 19th-century intellectuals, from [[Auguste Comte]] to [[Karl Marx]] to [[Sigmund Freud]], attempted to offer scientific and/or political ideologies in the wake of secularisation. Modernity may be described as the "age of ideology." {{harv|Calinescu|1987|loc=2006}}.

{{Quote|For Marx, what was the basis of modernity was the emergence of capitalism and the revolutionary bourgeoisie, which led to an unprecedented expansion of productive forces and to the creation of the world market. [[Durkheim]] tackled modernity from a different angle by following the ideas of Saint-Simon about the industrial system. Although the starting point is the same as Marx, feudal society, Durkheim emphasizes far less the rising of the bourgeoisie as a new revolutionary class and very seldom refers to capitalism as the new mode of production implemented by it. The fundamental impulse to modernity is rather industrialism accompanied by the new scientific forces. In the work of [[Max Weber]], modernity is closely associated with the processes of rationalization and disenchantment of the world. {{harv|Larraín|2000|loc=13}}}}

[[Critical theory|Critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Zygmunt Bauman]] propose that modernity or industrialization represents a departure from the central tenets of the Enlightenment and towards nefarious processes of [[social alienation|alienation]], such as [[commodity fetishism]] and the [[Holocaust]] ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bauman|1989}}). Contemporary sociological [[critical theory]] presents the concept of "[[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]" in even more negative terms than those Weber originally defined. Processes of rationalization—as progress for the sake of progress—may in many cases have what critical theory says is a negative and dehumanising effect on modern society. ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bauman|2000}})

{{Quote|Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant. ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973|loc=210}})}}

{{Quote|What prompts so many commentators to speak of the 'end of history', of post-modernity, 'second modernity' and 'surmodernity', or otherwise to articulate the intuition of a radical change in the arrangement of human cohabitation and in social conditions under which life-politics is nowadays conducted, is the fact that the long effort to accelerate the speed of movement has presently reached its 'natural limit'. Power can move with the speed of the electronic signal – and so the time required for the movement of its essential ingredients has been reduced to instantaneity. For all practical purposes, power has become truly exterritorial, no longer bound, or even slowed down, by the resistance of space (the advent of cellular telephones may well serve as a symbolic 'last blow' delivered to the dependency on space: even the access to a telephone market is unnecessary for a command to be given and seen through to its effect. {{harv|Bauman|2000|loc=10}}}}

Consequent to debate about [[economic globalization]], the comparative analysis of civilizations, and the post-colonial perspective of "alternative modernities," [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] introduced the concept of "multiple modernities" ({{harvnb|Eisenstadt|2003}}; see also {{harvnb|Delanty|2007}}). Modernity as a "plural condition" is the central concept of this sociologic approach and perspective, which broadens the definition of "modernity" from exclusively denoting Western European culture to a [[cultural relativism|culturally relativistic]] definition, thereby: "Modernity is not Westernization, and its key processes and dynamics can be found in all societies" {{harv|Delanty|2007}}.

===Secularization===
Modernity, or the Modern Age, is typically defined as a post-[[traditional]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and post-[[medieval]] historical period ({{harvnb|Heidegger|1938|loc=66–67}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QImd2ARqQPMC&amp;pg=PA66 66–67]). Central to modernity is emancipation from [[religion]], specifically the hegemony of [[Christianity]], and the consequent secularization. Modern thought repudiates the [[Judeo-Christian]] belief in the Biblical God as a mere relic of superstitious ages ({{harvnb|Fackenheim|1957|loc=272-73}}; {{harvnb|Husserl|1931}}, {{Page needed|date=February 2012}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from {{harvnb|Fackenheim|1967|loc=272–73}}: {{quotation|But there does seem to be a necessary conflict between modern thought and the Biblical belief in revelation. All claims of revelation, modern science and philosophy seem agreed, must be repudiated, as mere relics of superstitious ages. ... [to a modern phylosopher] The Biblical God...was a mere myth of bygone ages.}} Quotation from {{harvnb|Husserl|1931}},{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}: {{quotation|When, with the beginning of modern times, religious belief was becoming more and more externalized as a lifeless convention, men of intellect were lifted by a new belief, their great belief in an autonomous philosophy and science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It all started with Descartes' revolutionary [[methodic doubt]], which transformed the concept of truth in the concept of certainty, whose only guarantor is no longer God or the Church, but Man's subjective judgement ({{harvnb|Alexander|1931|loc=484-85}}; {{harvnb|Heidegger|1938}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from Heidegger 1938{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;!--If this English version is taken from one of the two mentioned published translations, then that edition should be cited instead of the German one; otherwise the grammatical and spelling mistakes cannot be verified.--&gt;: {{quotation|The essence of modernity can be seen in humanity's freeing itself from the bonds of Middle Ages... Certainly the modern age has, as a consequence of the liberation of humanity, introduced subjectivism and indivisualism. ... For up to Descartes... The claim [of a self-supported, unshakable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty] originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians have tried to cope with their worry that Western modernism has brought the world to no longer being well-disposed towards Christianity ({{harvnb|Kilby|2004|loc=262}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G26xfiuhCmIC&amp;pg=PA262 262]; {{harvnb|Davies|2004|loc=133}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G26xfiuhCmIC&amp;pg=PA133 133]; {{harvnb|Cassirer|1944|loc=13–14}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x46qiaccZLYC&amp;pg=PA14 13–14]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from {{harvnb|Kilby|2004|loc=262}}: {{quotation|... a cluster of issues surrounding the assessment of modernity and of the apologetic task of theology in modernity. Both men [Rahner and Balthasar] were deeply concerned with apologetics, with the question of how to present Christianity in a world which is no longer well-disposed towards it. ... both thought that modernity raised particular problems for being a believing Christian, and therefore for apologetics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernity aimed towards "a progressive force promising to liberate humankind from ignorance and irrationality" {{harv|Rosenau|1992|loc=5}}.

===Scientific===
{{Main|Modern science}}
In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], [[Galileo]] and others developed a new approach to physics and astronomy which changed the way people came to think about many things. Copernicus presented new models of the [[solar system]] which no longer placed humanity's home, on [[Earth]], in the centre. Kepler used mathematics to discuss physics and described regularities of nature this way. Galileo actually made his famous proof of uniform acceleration in [[freefall]] using mathematics ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 1,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

[[Francis Bacon]], especially in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', argued for a new experimental based approach to science, which sought no knowledge of [[four causes|formal or final causes]], and was therefore [[materialism|materialist]], like the ancient philosophy of [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]]. But he also added a theme that science should seek to control nature for the sake of humanity, and not seek to understand it just for the sake of understanding. In both these things he was influenced by Machiavelli's earlier criticism of medieval [[Scholasticism]], and his proposal that leaders should aim to control their own fortune ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 1,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

Influenced both by Galileo's new physics and Bacon, [[René Descartes]] argued soon afterward that [[mathematics]] and [[geometry]] provided a model of how scientific knowledge could be built up in small steps. He also argued openly that human beings themselves could be understood as complex machines ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 6{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

[[Isaac Newton]], influenced by Descartes, but also, like Bacon, a proponent of experimentation, provided the archetypal example of how both [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[mathematics]], [[geometry]] and [[theory|theoretical]] [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] on the one hand, and [[Baconian method|Baconian]] [[scientific method|experimental observation]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] on the other hand, together could lead to great advances in the practical understanding of regularities in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] ({{harvnb|d'Alembert|2009 [1751]}}; {{harvnb|Henry|2004}}).

===Artistic===
{{Main|Modern art}}

After modernist political thinking had already become widely known in France, [[Rousseau]]'s re-examination of human nature led to a new criticism of the value of [[reason]]ing itself which in turn led to a new understanding of less rationalistic human activities, especially the arts. The initial influence was upon the movements known as [[German Idealism]] and [[Romanticism]] in the 18th and 19th century. Modern art therefore belongs only to the later phases of modernity {{harv|Orwinand Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 2,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}.

For this reason [[art history]] keeps the term "modernity" distinct from the terms [[Modern History|Modern Age]] and [[Modernism]] – as a discrete "term applied to the cultural condition in which the seemingly absolute necessity of [[innovation]] becomes a primary fact of life, work, and thought". And modernity in art "is more than merely the state of being modern, or the opposition between old and new" {{harv|Smith|2009}}.

In the [[essay]] "The Painter of Modern Life" (1864)&lt;!--NB: Baudelaire died in 1867, do not confuse this date of original composition with the year of publication of the English edition of Baudelaire's writings.--&gt;, Charles Baudelaire gives a literary definition: "By modernity I mean the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent" {{harv|Baudelaire|1964|loc=13}}.

Advancing technological innovation, affecting artistic technique and the means of manufacture, changed rapidly the possibilities of art and its status in a rapidly changing society.  Photography challenged the place of the painter and painting.  Architecture was transformed by the availability of steel for structures.

===Theological===
From theologian [[Thomas C. Oden]]'s perspective, "modernity" is marked by "four fundamental values" {{harv|Hall|1990}}: 
* "Moral relativism (which says that what is right is dictated by culture, social location, and situation)"
* "Autonomous individualism (which assumes that moral authority comes essentially from within)"
* "Narcissistic hedonism (which focuses on egocentric personal pleasure)"
* "Reductive naturalism (which reduces what is reliably known to what one can see, hear, and empirically investigate)"
Modernity rejects anything "old" and makes "novelty ... a criterion for truth." This results in a great "phobic response to anything antiquarian." In contrast, "classical Christian consciousness" resisted "novelty" {{harv|Hall|1990}}.

Pope Pius IX and Pope Pius X of the Roman Catholic Church claim that [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernism]] (in a particular definition of the Catholic Church) is a danger to the Christian faith. Pope Pius IX compiled a [[Syllabus of Errors]] published on December 8, 1864 to describe his objections to Modernism {{harv|Pius IX|1864}}. Pope Pius X further elaborated on the characteristics and consequences of Modernism, from his perspective, in an encyclical entitled "[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]" (Feeding the Lord's Flock) on September 8, 1907 {{harv|Pius X|1907}}. Pascendi Dominici Gregis states that the principles of Modernism, taken to a logical conclusion, lead to atheism. The Roman Catholic Church was serious enough about the threat of Modernism that it required all Roman Catholic clergy, pastors, confessors, preachers, religious superiors and seminary professors to swear an [[Oath against modernism|Oath Against Modernism]]  {{harv|Pius X|1910}} from 1910 until this directive was rescinded in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--The 1910 source does not (and cannot) confirm the directive was rescinded in 1967.--&gt;

==Defined==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Don Quixote]] --&gt;
Of the available conceptual definitions in [[sociology]], modernity is "marked and defined by an obsession with '[[evidence]]'," [[visual culture]], and personal visibility {{harv|Leppert|2004|loc=19}}. Generally, the large-scale social integration constituting modernity, involves{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} the:
* increased movement of goods, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], people, and information among formerly discrete populations, and consequent influence beyond the local area
* increased formal social organization of mobile populaces, development of "circuits" on which they and their influence travel, and societal standardization conducive to socio-economic mobility
* increased specialization of the segments of society, i.e., [[division of labor]], and area inter-dependency
* increased level of excessive stratification in terms of social life of a modern man 
* Increased state of dehumanisation, dehumanity, unionisation, as man became embittered about the negative turn of events which sprouted a growing fear. 
* man became a victim of the underlying circumstances presented by the modern world 
* Increased competitiveness amongst people in the society (survival of the fittest) as the jungle rule sets in.

==Etymology and meaning==
''Moha'' appears in the Vedic literature, and has roots in early Vedic word ''mogha'' which means "empty, unreal, vain, useless, foolish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA543 |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|page= 542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, as well as the three defects concept appears in the ancient texts of Jainism and some schools of Hinduism such as [[Nyaya]], in their respective discussion of the theory of rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathmal Tatia|title=Studies in Jaina Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZ7IwbORbLgC&amp;pg=PA101|year=1965|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-89581-996-3|pages=101–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term means "delusion, confusion, dullness".&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha/&gt; The opposite of ''Moha'' is ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajna]]'' (insight, wisdom). Beliefs different from those considered as insights in Buddhism, are forms of delusions or Moha in Buddhism. Moha is one of the roots of evil, in the Buddhist belief.&lt;ref name=davidloyp28/&gt;

==Application==

Within the Mahayana tradition, ''moha'' is classified as one of the [[three poisons]], which are considered to be the root cause of suffering.

In the Mahayana tradition, ''moha'' is considered to be a subcategory of ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]''. Whereas ''avidyā'' is defined as a fundamental ignorance, ''moha'' is defined as an ignorance of cause and effect or of reality that accompanies only destructive states of mind or behavior.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Berzin, Alexander. [http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html_80737386.html ''Berzin Archives, Glossary of Buddhist Terms'']&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Moha'' is sometimes replaced by ''avidyā'' in lists of the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]]. In contemporary explanations of the ''three poisons'', teachers are likely to emphasize the fundamental ignorance of ''avidyā'' rather than ''moha''.

[[Image:Narcissus-Caravaggio (1594-96) edited.jpg|thumb|''[[Narcissus (Caravaggio)|Narcissus]]'' (1590s) by [[Caravaggio]] ([[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], [[Rome]])]]
'''Narcissism''' is the pursuit of gratification from [[vanity]] or [[egotistic]] admiration of one's idealised self image and attributes. The term originated from [[Greek mythology]], where the young [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] fell in love with his own image reflected in a pool of water. Narcissism is a  concept in [[psychoanalytic theory]], which was popularly introduced in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s essay ''[[On Narcissism]]'' (1914). The [[American Psychiatric Association]] has listed the classification [[narcissistic personality disorder]] in its ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) since 1968, drawing on the historical concept of [[megalomania]].

Narcissism is also considered a social or cultural problem.
It is a factor in [[trait theory]] used in various [[self-report inventory|self-report inventories]] of personality such as the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]]. It is one of the three [[dark triad]]ic personality traits (the others being [[psychopathy]] and [[Machiavellianism]]). Except in the sense of [[primary narcissism]] or [[Healthy narcissism|healthy self-love]], narcissism is usually considered a problem in a person's or group's relationships with self and others. Narcissism is not the same as [[egocentrism]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of narcissism}}
[[File:Sisyphus Pushing His Stone up a Mountain (486x640).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The myth of [[Sisyphus]] tells about a man punished for his  [[hubris]]tic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself. He has to push a stone up a mountain each day, only to have to recommence the task on the next day.]]
The term "narcissism" comes  from the Greek myth about [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Νάρκισσος}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Narkissos}}''), a handsome Greek youth who, according to [[Ovid]], rejected the desperate advances of the nymph [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]]. This caused Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. Unable to consummate his love, Narcissus "lay gazing enraptured into the pool, hour after hour," and finally changed into a flower that bears his name, the [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Symington|first=Neville|title=Narcissism: A New Theory|year=1993|publisher=H.

In ancient Greece the concept was understood as [[hubris]].  It is only more recently that narcissism has been defined in psychological terms.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

* In 1898 [[Havelock Ellis]], an English psychologist, used the term "Narcissus-like" in reference to excessive masturbation, whereby the person becomes his or her own sex object&lt;ref name="millon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millon|first1=Theodore|last2= Grossman|first2= Seth|last3= Million |first3 = Carrie|last4= Meagher|first4= Sarah|last5=Ramnath|first5=Rowena|publisher = Wiley|isbn = 0-471-23734-5|page = 343|url = http://leipper.org/manuals/zip-fill/Personality%20Disorders%20in%20Modern%20Life%202ND%20ED%20-%20THEODORE%20MILLON.pdf|title=Personality Disorders in Modern Life|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1899, Paul Näcke was the first person to use the term "narcissism" in a study of sexual perversions.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
* [[Otto Rank]] in 1911 published the first psychoanalytical paper specifically concerned with narcissism, linking it to vanity and self-admiration.&lt;ref name="millon" /&gt;

* In 1923, [[Martin Buber]] published an essay "''[[Ich und Du]]''" (I and You), in which he pointed out that our narcissism often leads us to relate to others as objects instead of as equals.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

A 2012 book on [[Abusive power and control|power-hungry]] narcissists suggests that narcissists typically display most, and sometimes all, of the following traits:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Thomas|first = David|title = Narcissism: Behind the Mask|date=2012|isbn =184624935X|publisher = Book Guild Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An obvious self-focus in interpersonal exchanges
* Problems in sustaining satisfying relationships
* A lack of psychological awareness (see [[insight in psychology and psychiatry]],  [[egosyntonic]])
* Difficulty with [[empathy]]
* Problems distinguishing the self from others (see [[personal boundaries]])
* Hypersensitivity to any insults or imagined [[insults]] (see [[Criticism#Psychopathology|criticism psychopathology]], [[narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury]])
* [[Vulnerability]] to [[shame]] rather than [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]
* Haughty [[body language]]
* [[Flattery]] towards people who admire and affirm them ([[narcissistic supply]])
* Detesting those who do not admire them ([[narcissistic abuse]])
* Using other people without considering the cost of doing so
* Pretending to be more important than they actually are
* [[Bragging]] (subtly but persistently) and [[exaggerating]] their achievements
* Claiming to be an "expert" at many things
* Inability to view the world from the perspective of other people
* [[Denial]] of [[remorse]] and [[gratitude]]

These criteria have been criticized because they presume a knowledge of intention (for example, the phrase "pretending to be").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Readings_in_Philosophy_of_Psychology.html?id=cgsOAAAAQAAJ|title=Readings in Philosophy of Psychology|first=Ned Joel|last=Block|date=22 October 1980|publisher=Methuen|accessdate=22 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior is observable, but intention is not. Thus classification requires assumptions which need to be tested before they can be asserted as fact, especially considering multiple explanations could be made as to why a person exhibits these behaviors.

=== Seven deadly sins of narcissism ===
The US psychiatrists Hotchkiss and [[James F. Masterson]] identified what they called the seven deadly sins of narcissism:&lt;ref&gt;Hotchkiss, Sandy &amp; [[James F. Masterson|Masterson, James F.]] Why Is It Always About You?: The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Shame]]lessness: Narcissists are often proudly and openly shameless; they are not bound by the needs and wishes of others. Narcissists hate shame, and consider it "toxic", as shame implies they are not perfect and need to change. Narcissists prefer guilt over shame, as guilt allows them to dissociate their actions from themselves - it's only their actions that are wrong, while they themselves remain perfect.
# [[Magical thinking]]: Narcissists see themselves as perfect, using [[Cognitive distortion|distortion]] and illusion known as [[magical thinking]]. They also use [[psychological projection|projection]] to "dump" shame onto others.
# [[Hubris|Arrogance]]: A narcissist who is feeling deflated may "reinflate" their sense of self-importance by diminishing, debasing, or degrading somebody else.
# [[Envy]]: A narcissist may secure a sense of superiority in the face of another person's ability by using contempt to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the other person or their achievements.
# [[Entitlement]]: Narcissists hold unreasonable expectations of particularly favorable treatment and automatic compliance because they consider themselves special. Failure to comply is considered an attack on their superiority, and the perpetrator is considered an "awkward" or "difficult" person. Defiance of their will is a narcissistic injury that can trigger [[narcissistic rage]].
# [[wikt:exploit|Exploitation]]: Can take many forms but always involves the exploitation of others without regard for their feelings or interests. Often the other person is in a subservient position where resistance would be difficult or even impossible. Sometimes the subservience is not so much real as assumed.
# [[Personal boundaries|Bad boundaries]]: Narcissists do not recognize that they have boundaries and that others are separate and are not extensions of themselves. Others either exist to meet their needs or may as well not exist at all. Those who provide [[narcissistic supply]] to the narcissist are treated as if they are part of the narcissist and are expected to live up to those expectations. In the mind of a narcissist, there is no boundary between self and other.

==== Required element within normal development ====
Karen Horney saw the narcissistic personality as a temperament trait molded by a certain kind of early environment. She did not see narcissistic needs and tendencies as inherent in human nature.&lt;ref name=horney1&gt;Paris, Bernard J, ''Personality and Personal Growth'', edited by Robert Frager and James Fadiman, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Malkin called a lack of healthy narcissism "echoism" after [[Echo (mythology)|the nymph Echo]] in the mythology of Narcissus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking Narcissism: The Bad-and Surprising Good-About Feeling Special|author=Craig Malkin|isbn=978-0062348104|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy narcissism might exist in all individuals.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="freud1" /&gt;--&gt;

[[Freud]] said that narcissism was an original state from which the individual develops the love object.&lt;ref name="Nagera"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Narcissism (pp. 107ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=_tcUbPPdf8AC&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Libido Theory |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tcUbPPdf8AC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=iD1qAAAAMAAJ 1969] |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |isbn=1-78181098-2 |id={{ISBN|978-1-781-81098-9}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qualify evidence}}&lt;!-- Has this theory been debunked or is it currently accepted by mainstream psychologists? --&gt; He argued that healthy narcissism is an essential part of normal development.&lt;ref name="freud1" /&gt; According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and their attitude toward their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism.&lt;ref name="freud1" /&gt; The child has a megalomaniac [[omnipotence]] of thought;&lt;ref name="Nagera"/&gt; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see the things that they have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities of their child. When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Freud contrasted the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson referred to as echoism, in the latter.&lt;ref name="Libido 2015"&gt;The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{block quote|This is the place for two remarks. First, how do we differentiate between the concepts of narcissism and egoism? Well, narcissism, I believe, is the libidinal complement to egoism. When we speak of egoism, we have in view only the individual's advantage; when we talk of narcissism we are also taking his libidinal satisfaction into account. As practical motives the two can be traced separately for quite a distance. It is possible to be absolutely egoistic and yet maintain powerful object-cathexes, in so far as libidinal satisfaction in relation to the object forms part of the ego's needs. In that case, egoism will see to it that striving for the object involves no damage to the ego. It is possible to be egoistic and at the same time to be excessively narcissistic—that is to say, to have very little need for an object, whether, once more, for the purpose of direct sexual satisfaction, or in connection with the higher aspirations, derived from sexual need, which we are occasionally in the habit of contrasting with 'sensuality' under the name of 'love'. In all these connections egoism is what is self-evident and constant, while narcissism is the variable element. The opposite to egoism, altruism, does not, as a concept, coincide with libidinal object-cathexis, but is distinguished from it by the absence of longings for sexual satisfaction. When someone is completely in love, however, altruism converges with libidinal object-cathexis. As a rule the sexual object attracts a portion of the ego's narcissism to itself, and this becomes noticeable as what is known as the 'sexual overvaluation' of the object. If in addition there is an altruistic transposition of egoism on to the sexual object, the object becomes supremely powerful; it has, as it were, absorbed the ego." (Freud, ''Introductory Lectures'' (1919), pp. 417–18)}}

Where the egoist can give up love in narcissism, the altruist can give up on competition, or "the will," in echoism. The individual first has a non-ambivalent relations of ''fusion'' with authority or love figures, which are characterized by the egoistic or altruistic drives. Second, the individual can move to ''defusion'' from authority or love figures which leads to repetitions of ambivalent, narcissistic or echoistic relations. In the third movement the individual becomes the dead or absent parental figure that never returned love to the echoist, or the perfect, grandiose parental figure in narcissism.&lt;ref name="Libido 2015"/&gt; While egoism and narcissism concern dynamics of power and inferiority/superiority, Pederson argues that altruism and echoism concern dynamics of belonging and inclusion/exclusion. Pederson has two types of echoists: the "subject altruist" and the "object altruist", with the former being concerned with the belonging of others and loving them, and the latter being concerned with their own belonging and being loved. The subject altruist is self-effacing, a people pleaser, and sacrifices her desire to help others who are outsiders become insiders, or to be the submissive helper of an insider. The object altruist is gregarious, a people person, and wants to be interesting which is based on wanting to fit in and not be an outsider or wanting to be unique as an insider. Both types of echoists show issues with being submissive, having problems saying no, and avoiding conflict.&lt;ref name="Libido 2015"/&gt;

==== In relation to the pathological condition ====
Healthy narcissism has to do with a strong feeling of "own love" protecting the human being against illness. Eventually, however, the individual must love the other, "the object love to not become ill". The individual becomes ill as a result of the frustration created when he is unable to love the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psywilly.be/index.php?page=lezingen|title=Psywilly.be, psychoanalyticus Willy Depecker|first=Stijn|last=Blomme|website=www.psywilly.be|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}} In pathological narcissism such as the [[narcissistic personality disorder]], the person's libido has been withdrawn from objects in the world and produces [[megalomania]]. The clinical theorists [[Kernberg]], [[Kohut]] and [[Theodore Millon]] all saw pathological narcissism as a possible outcome in response to unempathic and inconsistent early childhood interactions. They suggested that narcissists try to compensate in adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/S15327965PLI1204_1 |author=Morf, Caroline C.|author2=Rhodewalt, Frederick |author2link= Frederick Rhodewalt|title=Unraveling the Paradoxes of Narcissism: A Dynamic Self-Regulatory Processing Model |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=177–96 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathological condition of narcissism is, as Freud suggested, a magnified, extreme manifestation of healthy narcissism.

Healthy narcissism has been suggested to be correlated with good psychological health. [[Self-esteem]] works as a mediator between narcissism and psychological health. Therefore, because of their elevated self-esteem, deriving from self-perceptions of competence and likability, high narcissists are relatively free of worry and gloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.400 |author=Sedikides, C.|author2=Rudich, E.A.|author3=Gregg, A.P.|author4=Kumashiro, Ml|author5=Rusbult, C. |title=Are Normal Narcissists Psychologically Healthy?: self-esteem matters |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=87 |pages=400–16 |year=2004 |issue=3 |pmid=15382988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have suggested that healthy narcissism cannot be seen as 'good' or 'bad', but that it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured. In certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships, and with certain outcome variables, such as feeling good about oneself, healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with outcome variables, such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.&lt;ref name = caf&gt;{{cite book|last1= Campbell|first1 = W.

=== Commonly used measures ===

==== Narcissistic Personality Inventory ====
{{Main|Narcissistic Personality Inventory}}
The Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) is the most widely used measure of narcissism in social psychological research. Although several versions of the NPI have been proposed in the literature, a forty-item forced-choice version (Raskin &amp; Terry, 1988) is the one most commonly employed in current research. The NPI is based on the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]-III clinical criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), although it was designed to measure these features in the general population. Thus, the NPI is often said to measure "normal" or "subclinical" (borderline) narcissism (i.e., in people who score very high on the NPI do not necessarily meet criteria for diagnosis with NPD).

==== Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory ====
{{Main|Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory}}
The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) is a widely used diagnostic test developed by [[Theodore Millon]]. The MCMI includes a scale for Narcissism. The NPI and MCMI have been found to be well correlated, ''r''(146)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.55, ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4806_13 |author=Auerbach JS |title=Validation of two scales for narcissistic personality disorder |journal=J Pers Assess |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=649–53 |date=December 1984 |pmid=6520692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the MCMI measures narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), the NPI measures narcissism as it occurs in the general population. In other words, the NPI measures "normal" narcissism; i.e., most people who score very high on the NPI do not have NPD. Indeed, the NPI does not capture any sort of narcissism taxon as would be expected if it measured NPD.&lt;ref name="foster1"&gt;Foster, J.D., &amp; Campbell, W.K., Are there such things as "narcissists" in social psychology? A taxometric analysis of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empirical studies ===
Within the field of [[psychology]], there are two main branches of research into narcissism: (1) clinical and (2) social psychology.

These two approaches differ in their view of narcissism, with the former treating it as a disorder, thus as discrete, and the latter treating it as a [[personality trait]], thus as a ''continuum''. These two strands of research tend loosely to stand in a divergent relation to one another, although they converge in places.

Campbell and Foster (2007)&lt;ref name="caf"/&gt; review the literature on narcissism. They argue that narcissists possess the following "basic ingredients":
* Positive: Narcissists think they are better than others.&lt;ref name="cras"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0146167202286007 |author=Campbell, W. K.|author2=Rudich, E.|author3=Sedikides, C. |title=Narcissism, [[self esteem]], and the positivity of self views: Two portraits of ''self-love'' |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=28 |pages=358–68 |year=2002 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inflated: Narcissists' views tend to be contrary to reality. In measures that compare self-report to objective measures, narcissists' self-views tend to be greatly [[exaggerated]].&lt;ref name="get"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00798.x |author=Gabriel, M. T.|author2=Critelli, J. W.|author3=Ee, J. S. |title=Narcissistic illusions in self-evaluations of intelligence and attractiveness |journal=[[Journal of Personality]]  |volume=62 |pages=143–55 |year=1994 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Agentic: Narcissists' views tend to be most exaggerated in the [[agentic]] domain, relative to the communion domain.{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}&lt;ref name="cras" /&gt;&lt;ref name="get" /&gt;
* Special: Narcissists perceive themselves to be unique and special people.&lt;ref name="emmons"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4803_11 |pmid=16367528 |author=Emmons, R.A. |title=Factor analysis and construct validity of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory |journal=Journal of Personality Assessment |volume=48 |pages=291–300 |year=1984 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Selfish: Research upon narcissists' behaviour in resource dilemmas supports the case for narcissists as being [[selfish]].&lt;ref name="cbbs"&gt;Campbell, W. K., Bush, C. P., Brunell, A. B., &amp; Shelton, J. (in press). Understanding the social costs of narcissism: The case of tragedy of the commons. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oriented toward success: Narcissists are oriented towards success by being, for example, approach oriented.{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;Rose, P. &amp; Campbell, W. K. (in press). Greatness feels good: A telic model of narcissism and subjective well-being. Advances in Psychology Research. Serge P. Shohov (Ed.) Hauppauge, NY: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissists tend to demonstrate a lack of interest in warm and caring interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="caf"/&gt; There are several ongoing controversies within narcissism literature, namely: whether narcissism is healthy or unhealthy; a [[personality disorder]]; a discrete or continuous variable; defensive or offensive; the same across genders; the same across cultures; and changeable or unchangeable.

Campbell and Foster (2007) argue that [[Self control|self-regulatory]] strategies are of paramount importance to understanding narcissism.&lt;ref name="caf" /&gt; Self-regulation in narcissists involves such things as striving to make one's self look and feel positive, special, successful and important. It comes in both intra-psychic, such as blaming a situation rather than self for failure, and interpersonal forms, such as using a relationship to serve one's own self. Some differences in self-regulation between narcissists and non-narcissists can be seen with Campbell, Reeder, Sedikides &amp; Elliot (2000)&lt;ref name="cre"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jrpe.2000.2282 |author=Campbell, W.K.|author2=Reeder G.D.|author3=Sedikides, C.|author4=Elliot, A.J. |title=Narcissism and Comparative Self-Enhancement Strategies |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=34 |pages=329–47 |year=2000 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted a study with two experiments. In each experiment, participants took part in an achievement task, following which they were provided with false feedback; it was either bogus success or failure. The study found that both narcissists and non-narcissists self-enhanced, but non-narcissists showed more flexibility in doing so. Participants were measured on both a comparative and a non-comparative [[self-enhancement]] strategy. Both narcissists and non-narcissists employed the non-comparative strategy similarly; however, narcissists were found to be more self-serving with the comparative strategy, employing it far more than non-narcissists, suggesting a greater rigidity in their self-enhancement. When narcissists receive negative feedback that threatens the self, they self-enhance at all costs, but non-narcissists tend to have limits.

Sorokowski et al. (2015) showed that narcissism is related to the frequency of posting [[selfie]]-type pictures on [[social media]]. Sorokowski's study showed that this relationship was stronger among men than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sorokowski | first1 = P | last2 = Sorokowska | first2 = A | last3 = Oleszkiewicz | first3 = A | last4 = Frackowiak | first4 = T | last5 = Huk | first5 = A | last6 = Pisanski | first6 = K| year = 2015| title = Selfie posting behaviors are associated with narcissism among men | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915003256 | journal = Pers Individ Dif | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 123–27 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heritability research using twin studies ===
Livesley et al. concluded, in agreement with other studies, that narcissism as measured by a standardized test was a common inherited trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Livesley WJ, Jang KL, Jackson DN, Vernon PA |title=Genetic and environmental contributions to dimensions of personality disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=150 |issue=12 |pages=1826–31 |date=December 1993 |pmid=8238637 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8238637 |doi=10.1176/ajp.150.12.1826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in similar agreement with those other studies, it was found that there exists a continuum between normal and disordered personality. The study subjects were 175 volunteer twin pairs (ninety identical, eighty-five fraternal) drawn from the general population. Each twin completed a questionnaire that assessed eighteen dimensions of personality disorder. The authors estimated the [[heritability]] of each dimension of personality by standard methods, thus providing estimates of the relative contributions of [[genetics|genetic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] causation. Of the eighteen personality dimensions, narcissism was found to have the highest heritability (0.64), indicating that the [[Concordance (genetics)|concordance]] of this trait in the [[identical twins]] was significantly influenced by genetics. Of the other dimensions of personality, only four were found to have heritability coefficients of greater than 0.5: [[Callous and unemotional traits|callousness]], identity problems, oppositionality and social avoidance.

=== Stigmatising attitude towards psychiatric illness ===
Arikan found that a [[Social stigma|stigmatising]] attitude to [[psychiatric]] patients is associated with narcissistic personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arikan, K. |title=A stigmatizating attitude towards psychiatric illnesses is associated with narcissistic personality traits |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=42  |issue=4 |pages=248–50 |year=2005 |pmid=16618057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In evolutionary psychology ===
The concept of narcissism is used in [[evolutionary psychology]] in relation to the mechanisms of [[assortative mating]], or the non-random choice of a partner for purposes of procreation. Evidence for assortative mating among humans is well established; humans mate assortatively regarding age, IQ, height, weight, nationality, educational and occupational level, physical and personality characteristics, and family relatedness.&lt;ref&gt;Buston &amp; Emlen 2003, Buss 1989, Epstein &amp; Guttman 1984, Garrison et al. 1968, Ho 1986, Jaffe &amp; Chacon 1995, Spuhler 1968, Rushton 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In the "self seeking like" hypothesis, individuals unconsciously look for a "mirror image" of themselves in others, seeking criteria of beauty or reproductive fitness in the context of self-reference. Alvarez et al. found that facial resemblance between couples was a strong driving force among the mechanisms of assortative mating: human couples resemble each other significantly more than would be expected from random pair formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alvarez, L. |title=Narcissism guides mate selection: Humans mate assortatively, as revealed by facial resemblance, following an algorithm of 'self seeking like' |journal=Evolutionary Psychology |volume=2 |pages=177–94 |year=2005 |url=http://human-nature.com/ep/articles/ep02177194.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618224549/http://human-nature.com/ep/articles/ep02177194.html |archivedate=June 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since facial characteristics are known to be inherited, the "self seeking like" mechanism may enhance reproduction between genetically similar mates, favoring the stabilization of genes supporting social behavior, with no kin relationship among them.

== Narcissistic supply ==
{{Main|Narcissistic supply}}
Narcissistic supply is a concept introduced into [[Psychoanalysis#Theories|psychoanalytic theory]] by [[Otto Fenichel]] in 1938, to describe a type of [[admiration]], [[Social support|interpersonal support]] or sustenance drawn by an individual from his or her environment and essential to their [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=fenichel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenichel|first = Otto|date = 1938|title = The Drive to Amass Wealth|url = http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fenichel-The-Drive-to-Amass-Wealth.pdf|journal = They Psychoanalytic Quarterly|volume = 7 |issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/21674086.1938.11925342|pages= 69-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is typically used in a negative sense, describing a pathological or excessive need for attention or admiration in [[codependents]] and the orally fixated, that does not take into account the feelings, opinions or preferences of other people.

== Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury ==
{{Main|Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury}}
Narcissistic rage is a reaction to narcissistic injury, which is a perceived threat to a narcissist's [[self-esteem]] or self-worth. ''Narcissistic injury'' and ''narcissistic scar'' are terms used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in the 1920s. ''Narcissistic wound'' and ''narcissistic blow'' are other, almost interchangeable, terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2009) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''narcissistic rage'' was coined by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1972. Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum from aloofness, to expressions of mild irritation or annoyance, to serious outbursts, including violent attacks.&lt;ref name="isbn1-58562-204-4"/&gt;

Narcissistic rage reactions are not limited to [[personality disorders]]. They may also be seen in [[catatonic]], [[paranoid delusion]], and depressive episodes.&lt;ref name="isbn1-58562-204-4"&gt;{{cite book |author= Carl P. Malmquist|title=Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc |location= |year=2006 |pages=181–82  |isbn=1-58562-204-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that narcissists have two layers of rage. The first layer of rage can be thought of as a constant anger towards someone else, with the second layer being a self-aimed anger.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin, Sam]], ''Malignant Self Love: Narcissism Revisited'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissistic defences ==
{{Main|Narcissistic defences}}
Narcissistic defences are those processes whereby the idealized aspects of the self are preserved, and its limitations denied.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw J.A. (1999.) ''Sexual Aggression'', American Psychiatric Publishing, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be rigid and totalistic.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Alper, ''Self Defence in a Narcissistic World'' (2003) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They are often driven by feelings of [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissistic abuse ==
{{Main|Narcissistic abuse}}
Narcissistic abuse was originally just defined as a specific form of [[emotional abuse]] of children by [[narcissistic parents]] – parents who require the child to give up their own wants and feelings in order to serve the parent's needs for esteem.&lt;ref&gt;James I. Kepner, ''Body Process'' (1997) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;
The term emerged in the late twentieth century due to the works of [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] and other [[Neo-Freudian]]s, rejecting psychoanalysis as being similar to the [[Poisonous pedagogy|poisonous pedagogies]].&lt;ref name="rutschky note"&gt;Note: In ''For Your Own Good'', Alice Miller herself credits [[Katharina Rutschky]] and her 1977 work ''Schwarze Pädagogik'' as the inspiration to consider the concept of ''poisonous pedagogy'',[http://www.nospank.net/fyog5.htm] which is considered as a translation of Rutschky's original term ''Schwarze Pädagogik'' (literally "black pedagogy").

[[Self-help]] culture assumes that someone abused by narcissistic parenting as a child likely struggles with [[codependency]] issues in adulthood. An adult who is or has been in a relationship with a narcissist likely struggles with not knowing what constitutes a "normal" relationship.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bailey-Rug, ''It's Not You, It's Them'' (2016) pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the term has been applied more broadly to refer to any abuse by a narcissist including in adult to adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bailey-Rug, ''Life After Narcissistic Abuse'' (2015) pp. i–iii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Masterson's subtypes (exhibitionist and closet) ===

In 1993, [[James F. Masterson]] proposed two categories for pathological narcissism, ''[[exhibitionist]]'' and ''closet''.&lt;ref name="masterson"&gt;Masterson, James F.  The Emerging Self: A Developmental Self &amp; Object Relations Approach to the Treatment of the Closet Narcissistic Disorder of the Self, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects in the quality of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in [[DSM-IV]] and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist is more likely to be described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the [[Borderline Personality Disorder|borderline]] in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Millon's variations ===

In 1996 [[Theodore Millon]] identified five variations of narcissist.&lt;ref name="millon1" /&gt; Any individual narcissist may exhibit none or one of the following:
* unprincipled narcissist: including [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features. A [[charlatan]]—is a fraudulent, [[wikt:exploit|exploitative]], deceptive and unscrupulous individual.
* amorous narcissist: including [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] features. The [[Don Juan]] or [[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] of our times—is erotic, [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]].
*[[Compensation (psychology)|compensatory]] narcissist: including negativistic ([[Passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive]]), [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]] features.
* [[Elitism|elitist]] narcissist: variant of pure pattern. Corresponds to [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s "phallic narcissistic" personality type.

=== Other forms ===

==== Acquired situational narcissism ====

Acquired situational narcissism (ASN) is a form of narcissism that develops in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of [[celebrity]]. It was coined by [[Robert Millman|Robert B. Millman]], professor of [[psychiatry]] at the [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] of [[Cornell University]]. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society.  Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. "Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about me'' (London 2007) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from [[narcissistic personality disorder]], differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. "The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable,"&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is [[Norma Desmond]], the main character of ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

==== Codependency ====

{{Main|Codependency}}
Codependency is a tendency to behave in overly passive or excessively caretaking ways that negatively impact one's relationships and quality of life. Narcissists are considered to be natural magnets for the codependent. Rappoport identifies codependents of narcissists as "co-narcissists".&lt;ref name="co"&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissistic Parents. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collective or group narcissism ====

{{main|Collective narcissism}}
Collective narcissism (or group narcissism) is a type of narcissism where an individual has an inflated [[self-love]] of his or her own [[ingroup]], where an "ingroup" is a group in which an individual is personally involved.&lt;ref name="Zavala"&gt;Golec de Zavala, A, et al. "Collective narcissism and its social consequences." Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 97.6 (2009): 1074–96. Psyc articles. [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCO]]. Web. 26 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the classic definition of narcissism focuses on the individual, collective narcissism asserts that one can have a similar excessively high opinion of a group, and that a group can function as a narcissistic entity.&lt;ref name="Zavala" /&gt; Collective narcissism is related to [[ethnocentrism]]; however, ethnocentrism primarily focuses on self-centeredness at an ethnic or cultural level, while collective narcissism is extended to any type of ingroup beyond just cultures and ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Zavala" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bizumic"&gt;Bizumic, Boris, and John Duckitt. "My Group Is Not Worthy of Me": Narcissism and Ethnocentrism." Political Psychology 29.3 (2008): 437–53. Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. EBSCO. Web. 9 Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conversational narcissism ====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Conversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist [[Charles Derber]] in his book, ''The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life''.
Derber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention. In social situations, they tend to steer the [[conversation]] away from others and toward themselves. "Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America," he wrote. "It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life." What Derber describes as "conversational narcissism" often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is prudent to avoid being judged an egotist.
Derber distinguishes the "shift-response" from the "support-response," as in the following two hypothetical conversation fragments:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
:John: I'm feeling really starved. 
:Mary: Oh, I just ate. (shift-response)

:John: I'm feeling really starved.
:Mary: When was the last time you ate? (support-response)}}

==== Cultural narcissism ====

In ''[[The Culture of Narcissism]]'', [[Christopher Lasch]] defines a narcissistic culture as one where every activity and relationship is defined by the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] need to acquire the symbols of wealth,&lt;ref&gt;Lasch, C, The Culture of Narcissism. 1979&lt;/ref&gt; this becoming the only expression of rigid, yet covert, social [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]. It is a culture where [[liberalism]] only exists insofar as it serves a consumer society, and even [[art]], [[sex]] and [[religion]] lose their liberating power. In such a society of constant competition, there can be no allies, and little transparency. The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a way of life. Any real sense of community is undermined—or even destroyed—to be replaced by virtual equivalents that strive, unsuccessfully, to synthesize a sense of community.

==== Destructive narcissism ====

Destructive narcissism is the constant exhibition of numerous and intense characteristics usually associated with the [[pathological]] narcissist but having fewer characteristics than pathological narcissism.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nina W., The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malignant narcissism ====

{{Main|Malignant narcissism}}
Malignant narcissism, a term first coined in a book by [[Erich Fromm]] in 1964,&lt;ref name="fromm2"&gt;Fromm, Erich, The Heart of Man, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[syndrome]] consisting of a cross breed of the [[narcissistic personality disorder]], the [[antisocial personality disorder]], as well as [[paranoia|paranoid]] traits.  The malignant narcissist differs from one suffering from narcissistic personality disorder in that the malignant narcissist derives higher levels of psychological [[gratification]] from accomplishments over time (thus worsening the disorder).  Because the malignant narcissist becomes more involved in this psychological gratification, in the context of the right conditions, the narcissist is apt to develop the [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], the [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], and the [[schizoid]] personality disorders. The term [[malignant]] is added to the term ''narcissist'' to indicate that individuals with this disorder have a severe form of narcissistic disorder that is characterized also by features of paranoia, psychopathy (anti-social behaviors), aggression, and sadism according to Kernberg and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Lenzenweger M.F., Clarkin J.F., Caligor E., Cain N.M., &amp; Kernberg O.F. (2018). "Malignant Narcissism in Relation to Clinical Change in Borderline Personality Disorder: An Exploratory Study". Psychopathology. [https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/492228 doi:10.1159/000492228].&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Medical narcissism ====

Medical narcissism is a term coined by John Banja in his book, ''Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism''.&lt;ref name="banja1"&gt;Banja, John, Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="banja2"&gt;Banja, John, (as observed by Eric Rangus) [http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2005/February/February7/sandr1.htm John Banja: Interview with the clinical ethicist]&lt;/ref&gt; Banja defines "medical narcissism" as the need of health professionals to preserve their [[self-esteem]] leading to the compromise of error disclosure to patients. In the book he explores the psychological, ethical and legal effects of [[medical error]]s and the extent to which a need to constantly assert their competence can cause otherwise capable, and even exceptional, professionals to fall into narcissistic traps. He claims that:
{{blockquote|...most health professionals (in fact, most professionals of any ilk) work on cultivating a self that exudes authority, control, knowledge, competence and respectability. It's the narcissist in us all—we dread appearing stupid or incompetent.}}

==== In the workplace ====
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}
Narcissism as a personality trait, generally assessed with the [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]], is related to some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high in narcissism inventories are more likely to engage in [[counterproductive work behavior]] (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = T. A. | last2 = LePine | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Rich | first3 = B. L. | year = 2006 | title = Loving Yourself Abundantly: Relationship of the Narcissistic Personality to Self- and Other Perceptions of Workplace Deviance, Leadership, and Task and Contextual Performance | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 4| pages = 762–76 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.762 | pmid=16834504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although individuals high in narcissism inventories might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bushman | first1 = B. J. | last2 = Baumeister | first2 = R. F. | year = 1998 | title = Threatened egotism, narcissism, self-esteem, and direct and displaced aggression: Does self-love or self-hate lead to violence? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 75 | issue = 1| pages = 219–29 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.75.1.219 | pmid=9686460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus narcissistic employees are more likely to engage in CWB when they feel threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Penney | first1 = L.

One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wislar | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Richman | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Fendrich | first3 = M. | last4 = Flaherty | first4 = J.

The narcissistic manager will have two main sources of [[narcissistic supply]]: inanimate – [[status symbol]]s like company cars, company-issued [[smartphone]] or prestigious offices with window views; and animate – [[flattery]] and [[attention]] from colleagues and subordinates.&lt;ref name=Dubrin&gt;{{cite book | author = A. J. DuBrin | title = Narcissism in the Workplace | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries.&lt;ref name=Dubrin/&gt;{{rp|143, 181}} The need to protect such supply networks will prevent the narcissistic managers from taking objective decisions;&lt;ref&gt;S. Allcorn, ''Organizational Dynamics and Intervention'' (2005) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; while long-term strategies will be evaluated according to their potential for attention-gaining for the manager themself.&lt;ref name=Dubrin/&gt;{{rp|122}} Organizational psychologist Alan Downs wrote a book in 1997 describing corporate narcissism.&lt;ref name="downs"&gt;Downs, Alan: Beyond The Looking Glass: Overcoming the Seductive Culture of Corporate Narcissism, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; He explores high-profile corporate leaders (such as [[Al Dunlap]] and [[Robert Eugene Allen|Robert Allen]]) who, he suggests, literally have only one thing on their minds: [[profit (economics)|profits]]. According to Downs, such narrow focus actually may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and some firms now utilizing these options are examined. Downs' theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, ''Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia''.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Victor (2005) Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia, Pengus Books Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Primordial narcissism ====

Psychiatrist [[Ernst Simmel]] first defined primordial narcissism in 1944.&lt;ref name="simmel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simmel, Ernst |author-link=Ernst Simmel |journal=[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]] |volume=XIII |issue=2 | title=Self-Preservation and the Death Instinct |pages=160–85 |year=1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simmel's fundamental thesis is that the most primitive stage of libidinal development is not the oral, but the gastrointestinal one. Mouth and anus are merely to be considered as the terminal parts of this organic zone. Simmel terms the psychological condition of prenatal existence "primordial narcissism." It is the vegetative stage of the pre-ego, identical with the id. At this stage there is complete instinctual repose, manifested in unconsciousness. Satiation of the gastrointestinal zone, the representative of the instinct of self-preservation, can bring back this complete instinctual repose, which, under pathological conditions, can become the aim of the instinct. Contrary to [[Christopher Lasch|Lasch]], [[Bernard Stiegler]] argues in his book, ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'', that [[consumer capitalism]] is in fact destructive of what he calls primordial narcissism, without which it is not possible to extend love to others.&lt;ref name="stiegler"&gt;[[Bernard Stiegler]], ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'' (Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he is referring to the natural state of an infant as a [[human fetus|fetus]] and in the first few days of its life, before it has learned that other people exist besides itself, and therefore cannot possibly be aware that they are human beings with feelings, rather than having anything to do with actual narcissism.

==== {{anchor|Gender narcissism}}Sexual narcissism ====

Sexual narcissism has been described as an [[egocentric]] pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense of sexual ability and sexual entitlement.  In addition, sexual narcissism is the erotic preoccupation with oneself as a superb lover through a desire to merge sexually with a mirror image of oneself.  Sexual narcissism is an intimacy dysfunction in which sexual exploits are pursued, generally in the form of extramarital affairs, to overcompensate for low self-esteem and an inability to experience true intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurlbert, D.F.|author2=Apt, C. |title=Sexual narcissism and the abusive male |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=279–92 |year=1991 |pmid=1815094 |doi=10.1080/00926239108404352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavioral pattern is believed to be more common in men than in women and has been tied to [[domestic violence]] in men and sexual coercion in couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurlbert, D.F.|author2=Apt, C.|author3= Gasar, S.|author4= Wilson, N.E.|author5=Murphy, Y. |title=Sexual narcissism: a validation study |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=20 |pages=24–34 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/00926239408403414 |pmid=8169963|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9403-9 |author=Ryan, K.M.|author2=Weikel, K.|author3=Sprechini, G. |title=Gender differences in narcissism and courtship violence in dating couples |journal=Sex Roles |volume=58 |pages=802–13 |year=2008 |issue=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurlbert argues that sex is a natural biological given and therefore cannot be deemed as an addiction.  He and his colleagues assert that any [[sexual addiction]] is nothing more than a misnomer for what is actually sexual narcissism or sexual compulsivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1066480795032003 |author=Apt, C.|author2=Hurlbert, D.F. |title=Sexual Narcissism: Addiction or Anachronism? |journal=The Family Journal |volume=3 |pages=103–07 |year=1995 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Hurlbert writes mainly of sexual narcissism in men, Schoenewolf (2013) describes what he calls "gender narcissism" which occurs in both males and females who compensate for feelings of sexual inadequacy by becoming overly proud and obsessed with their masculinity or femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schoenewolf, G. |title=Psychoanalytic Centrism: Collected Papers of a Neoclassical Psychoanalyst |publisher=Living Center Press |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissistic parents ===

{{Main|Narcissistic parents}}
Narcissistic parents demand certain behavior from their children because they see the children as extensions of themselves, and need the children to represent them in the world in ways that meet the parents' emotional needs. This parenting 'style' most often results in estranged relationships with the children, coupled with feelings of resentment and self-destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="co"/&gt;

=== Narcissistic leadership ===

{{Main|Narcissistic leadership}}
Narcissistic leadership is a common form of [[leadership]]. The narcissism may be healthy or destructive although there is a continuum between the two. A study published in the journal ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'' suggests that when a group is without a leader, you can often count on a narcissist to take charge. Researchers found that people who score high in narcissism tend to emerge as group leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brunell | first1 = A. B. | last2 = Gentry | first2 = W.

Supporting the contention that [[American culture]] has become more narcissistic and that this is increasingly reflected in its cultural products is an analysis of US popular song lyrics between 1987 and 2007. This found a growth in the use of first-person singular pronouns, reflecting a greater focus on the self, and also of references to antisocial behavior; during the same period, there was a diminution of words reflecting a focus on others, positive emotions, and social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeWall|first1=C.

A linguistic analysis of the largest circulation Norwegian newspaper  found that the use of self-focused and individualistic terms increased in frequency by 69 per cent between 1984 and 2005 while collectivist terms declined by 32 per cent.&lt;ref name="Twengep203" /&gt; References to narcissism and self-esteem in American popular print media have experienced vast inflation since the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Twengep203" /&gt; Between 1987 and 2007 direct mentions of self-esteem in leading US newspapers and magazines increased by 4,540 per cent while narcissism, which had been almost non-existent in the press during the 1970s, was referred to over 5,000 times between 2002 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Twengep203" /&gt;

Cross-cultural studies of differences in narcissism are rare. Instead, as there is a positive association between narcissism and [[individualism]] and a negative one between it and [[collectivism]], these traits have been used as proxies for narcissism in some studies.&lt;ref name="Twengep202"&gt;{{cite book|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|title=The Handbook of Narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Theoretical Approaches, Empirical Findings, and Treatments|editor1-last=Campbell|editor1-first=W.

=== Fictional narcissists ===
* [[Jay Gatsby]], the eponymous character of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s 1925 novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', "an archetype of self-made American men seeking to join [[Upper class|high society]]", has been described as a "pathological narcissist" for whom the "[[Ego ideal|ego-ideal]]" has become "inflated and destructive" and whose "grandiose lies, poor sense of reality, sense of entitlement, and exploitive treatment of others" conspire toward his own demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fitzgerald.narod.ru/critics-eng/mitchell-narcissist.html|title=The Great Narcissist: A Study of Fitzgerald's Gatsby, by Giles Mitchell.|first=Giles|last=Mitchell|website=fitzgerald.narod.ru|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the film ''[[To Die For]]'', [[Nicole Kidman|Nicole Kidman's]] character wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted that she "was seen as a prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hesse|first=Morten|author2=Schliewe S |author3=Thomsen RR |year=2005|title=Rating of personality disorder features in popular movie characters|journal=BMC Psychiatry|publisher=BioMed Central|location=London|volume=5|pmid=16336663|pmc=1325244|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-5-45|page=45|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gordon Gekko]] is a [[fictional character]] in the 1987 film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' and its 2010 sequel ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The return of Gordon Gekko|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2010/02/wall-street-spotlight-201002|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |last=Burrough|first=Bryan|date=February 2010|accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gekko has become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained [[greed]] and self-interest (with the signature line, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good"), often in fields outside [[corporate finance]].
* [[Charles Foster Kane]] is a [[fictional character]] and the subject of [[Orson Welles]]' [[1941 in film|1941 film]] ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.  The character is widely believed to be based on publishing tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Welles played Kane (receiving an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination), with [[Buddy Swan]] playing Kane as a child. Welles also produced, co-wrote and directed the film. ''Citizen Kane'' explores the life of the titular character, who is born of humble origins. In 1871, Kane's mother puts him under the guardianship of a [[New York City]] banker named Walter Parks Thatcher, who raises him in luxury. As an adult, Kane takes control of a [[newspaper]], which he uses to advance businesses in which Kane holds stock. Kane also hires staff members away from the rival ''Chronicle'' newspaper, regarding them as collectibles. To finance the fledgling ''Inquirer'', Kane uses his personal resources; this would allow him to operate it, even at a million dollar annual loss, for decades.
* [[Charlize Theron]]'s character in ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]'' (2011), who conspires to return to her hometown to steal back her high school sweetheart, despite him being married with a child, embodies many narcissistic traits&amp;ndash;including the emptiness she feels when she is not receiving attention or praise from her writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11368">A '''narcissistic parent''' is a [[parent]] affected by [[narcissism]] or [[narcissistic personality disorder]]. Typically narcissistic parents are exclusively and possessively close to their children and may be especially [[envious]] of, and threatened by, their child's growing independence.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Levich, ''Clone Being'' (2004) p. 31 and p.89-91&lt;/ref&gt;  The result may be what has been termed a pattern of narcissistic [[Attachment theory|attachment]], with the child considered to exist solely to fulfill the parent's wishes and needs.&lt;ref&gt;David Stafford &amp; [[Liz Hodgkinson]], ''Codependency'' (London 1995) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly parents attempt to force their children to treat themselves as though they are their parents' puppets, or else be subject to punishments such as emotional abuse. Relative to [[developmental psychology]], narcissistic parenting will adversely affect children in the areas of reasoning, emotional, ethical, and societal behaviors and attitudes as they mature.&lt;ref&gt;(2015, Apr. 27 ). In Wikipedia. Retrieved Apr. 27, 2015, from http://hciresearch4.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/~rfarzan/APSWI-Patrick/stage/site/searcharticles.php?title=Parenting%20styles.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the realm of narcissistic parenting, [[personal boundaries]] are often disregarded with the goal of moulding and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]] the child to satisfy the parents’ expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Banschick M.D., M. (2013, March 13). The Narcissistic Father. Retrieved April 29, 2015, from https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201303/the-narcissistic-father.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissistic people with low [[self esteem]] feel the need to [[Abusive power and control|control]] how others regard them, fearing they will be [[blamed]] or rejected and personal inadequacies exposed. They are self-absorbed, some to the point of [[grandiosity]]; and being preoccupied with protecting their [[self image]], they tend to be inflexible, and lack the [[empathy]] necessary for [[child raising]].&lt;ref name=co/&gt;

==Characteristics==
The term “narcissism,” as used in [[Sigmund Freud]]’s clinical study, noted behavioral observations such as self-aggrandizement, self-esteem, vulnerability, fear of losing the affection of people and of failure, reliance on defense mechanisms, perfectionism and interpersonal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, Robert, and Howard. Terry. (1988). A Principal-Components Analysis of the Narcissistic Personality. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54 (5), PP 890-902&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissism tends to play out inter-generationally, with narcissistic parents producing either narcissistic or [[codependent]] children in turn.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me: Loving a Narcissist'' (London 2007) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas a [[self-confident]] parent, the [[Good enough parent|good-enough parent]], can allow a child its autonomous development, the narcissistic parent may instead use the child as a means to promote their own image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Good Feeling'' (London 2009) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The father concerned with [[self-enhancement]], with being [[Mirroring (psychology)|mirrored]] and admired by a son&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz Kohut]], ''How Does Analysis Cure?'' (London 1984) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;, may leave the latter feeling a puppet to his father's emotional/intellectual demands.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Glenmullen, ''Prozac Backlash'' (New York 2000) p. 278 and p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

To maintain their self-esteem, and protect their vulnerable [[true selves]], narcissists need to [[Abusive power and control|control]] others'  behavior, particularly that of their children seen as extensions of themselves.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissism. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus narcissistic parents may speak of carrying the torch, maintaining the family image, or making mother or father proud and may reproach their children for exhibiting weakness, being too dramatic, or not meeting the standard of what is expected. As a result, children of narcissists learn to play their part and to perform their special skill, especially in public or for others; but typically do not have many memories of having felt loved or appreciated for being themselves, rather associating their experience of love and appreciation with conforming to the demands of the narcissistic parent.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R. ''[http://www.energeticsinstitute.com.au/page/childhood_oedipal_narcissistic_development_affects_later_adult_intimacy_and_relationships.html How Early Childhood Oedipal Narcissistic Development Affects Later Adult Intimacy and Relationships]'' 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Destructive narcissistic parents have a pattern of consistently being the [[Attention seeking|focus of attention]], [[Exaggerate|exaggerating]], seeking compliments and putting their children down.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me: Loving a Narcissist'' (London 2007) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]] in the form of [[blame]], [[criticism]] or [[emotional blackmail]], and attempts to induce [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], may be used to ensure [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] with the parents' wishes and their need for [[narcissistic supply]].&lt;ref name="co"/&gt;

==Children of narcissists==
Children of a resistant, more stubborn [[wikt:temperamental|temperamental]] parent defend against being supportive of others in the house. They observe how the selfish parents get their needs met by others. They learn how [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and using guilt gets the parent what he or she wants. They develop a [[false self]] and use [[aggression]] and [[intimidation]] to get their way.&lt;ref name="ao"&gt;Lynne Namka, Ed.D. [https://lynnenamka.com/relationships/relationships-articles/selfishness-narcissism-family-relationships/ Selfishness and narcissism in Family Relationships]. &lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common issues in narcissistic parenting are due to the lack of appropriate, responsible nurturing which ultimately contributes to a child’s feeling of emptiness, insecurity in loving relationships, imaginary fears, mistrust of others, identity conflict and inability to develop a distinct existence from that of the parent.&lt;ref&gt;McBride, K. (2008). The Empty Mirror. Will I Ever Be Good Enough?: Healing the Daughters of Narcissistic Mothers. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sensitive, guilt-ridden children in the family learn to meet the parent’s needs for [[gratification]] and try to get love by accommodating the whims and wishes of the parent. The child’s normal feelings are ignored, [[denied]] and eventually [[psychological repression|repressed]] in attempts to gain the parent’s “love”. Guilt and [[shame]] keep the child locked into this [[developmental arrest]]. Their aggressive impulses and rage become split off and are not integrated with normal development. These children develop a false self as a [[defense mechanism]] and become [[codependent]] in relationships. The child's unconscious denial of their [[true self]] perpetuates a cycle of [[self-hatred]], fearing any reminder of their authentic self.&lt;ref name="ao" /&gt;

Narcissistic parenting often leads to children being either [[victimized]] or [[bullying]] themselves, hypersexual in nature (media driven), having a poor or overly inflated [[body image]], tendency to use and/or abuse drugs or alcohol, [[body modification]] such as [[piercings]] or tattoos, or [[acting out]] (in a potentially harmful manner) for attention.&lt;ref&gt;Pinsky, Drew, S M. Young, and Jill Stern. The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism Is Seducing America. New York: Harper, 2009

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6557">In [[philosophical]] [[ontology]], '''ontic''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄν}}, genitive {{lang|grc|ὄντος}}: "of that which is") is physical, real, or factual existence.&lt;br&gt;

==Overview==
"Ontic" describes what is there, as opposed to the nature or properties of that being. To illustrate:

*[[Roger Bacon]], observing that all languages are built upon a common grammar, stated that they share a foundation of ontically anchored linguistic structures.
*[[Martin Heidegger]] posited the concept of ''Sorge'', or caring, as the fundamental concept of the [[intentionality|intentional being]], and presupposed an ontological significance that distinguishes [[ontology|ontological]] being from mere "thinghood" of an ontic being. He uses the [[German language|German]] word "[[Dasein]]" for a being that is capable of ontology, that is, [[recursivity|recursively]] comprehending [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of the very fact of its own Being. For Heidegger, "ontical" signifies concrete, specific realities, whereas "ontological" signifies deeper underlying structures of reality. Ontological objects or subjects have an ontical dimension, but they also include aspects of being like self-awareness, evolutionary vestiges, future potentialities, and networks of relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontico-Ontological Distinction|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679516_ss1-33|publisher=Blackwell Reference|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Michael|title=The Ontological and the Ontic|url=http://mikejohnduff.blogspot.com/2007/08/ontological.html|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nicolai Hartmann]] distinguishes among ontology, ontics, and metaphysics: (i) ontology concerns the categorical analysis of entities by means of the knowledge categories able to classify them, (ii) ontics refers to a pre-categorical and pre-objectual connection which is best expressed in the relation to transcendent acts, and (iii) metaphysics is that part of ontics or that part of ontology which concerns the residue of being that cannot be rationalized further according to categories.

== Philosophy of science ==
[[Harald Atmanspacher]] writes extensively about the philosophy of science, especially as it relates to [[Chaos theory]], [[determinism]], [[Causality|causation]], and [[stochastic process|stochasticity]]. He explains that "''ontic'' states describe all properties of a physical system exhaustively. ('Exhaustive' in this context means that an ''ontic'' state is 'precisely the way it is,' without any reference to [[epistemic]] knowledge or ignorance.)"{{ref|autonumber}}

In an earlier paper, Atmanspacher portrays the difference between an [[epistemic]] perspective of a [[system]], and an ontic perspective:

:Philosophical [[discourse]] traditionally distinguishes between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] and generally enforces this distinction by keeping the two subject areas separated. However, the relationship between the two areas is of central importance to [[physics]] and [[philosophy of physics]]. For instance, many [[measurement]]-related problems force us to consider both our [[knowledge]] of the [[Classical mechanics|states]] and [[observables]] of a [[system]] ([[epistemic perspective]]) and its states and observables, independent of such knowledge (ontic perspective). This applies to [[quantum|quantum systems]] in particular.{{ref|autonumber}}

== Critical realism ==
{{noref-section|date=August 2018}}
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] [[Roy Bhaskar]], who is closely associated with the philosophical [[Cultural movement|movement]] of [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] writes:
:"I differentiate the 'ontic' ('ontical' etc.) from the 'ontological'. I employ the former to refer to

:# whatever pertains to being generally, rather than some distinctively philosophical (or scientific) theory of it (ontology), so that in this sense, that of the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', we can speak of the ontic presuppositions of a work of art, a [[joke]] or a strike as much as a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]; and, within this [[rubric]], to
:# the [[intransitive]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of some specific, [[historically determinate]], [[scientific investigation]] (or set of such investigations), the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

:"The ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is always specified, and only identified, by its relation, as the intransitive object(s) of some or other (denumerable set of) particular transitive process(es) of enquiry. It is cognitive process-, and level-specific; whereas the ontological (like the ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not."{{ref|autonumber}}

[[Ruth Groff]] offers this expansion of Bhaskar's note above:
:"'ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' is an abstract way of denoting the [[object-domain]] of a particular [[scientific]] area, field, or inquiry. E.g.: [[molecules]] feature in the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry. He's just saying that the scientific undertaking ITSELF is not one of the objects of said, most narrowly construed, immediate object-domain. So [[chemistry]] itself is not part of the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry."

'''Projected area''' is two-dimensional [[area]] measurement of a three-dimensional object by projecting its shape on to an arbitrary plane. This is often used in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[architectural engineering]] related fields, specifically [[hardness]] testing, [[axial stress]], wind pressures, and [[terminal velocity]].

The geometrical definition of a projected area is: "the rectilinear [[parallel projection]] of a surface of any shape onto a plane". This translates into the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{projected} = \int_{A} \cos{\beta} \, dA&lt;/math&gt;

where A is the original area, and &lt;math&gt;\beta \,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the normal to the surface A and the normal to the arbitrary plane onto which we project. For basic shapes the results are listed in the table below.&lt;ref name="rpfaq"&gt;[https://employeepages.scad.edu/~kwitte/documents/Photometry_FAQ.PDF]{{Citation|last = Palmer|first = James M.|title = Radiometry and photometry FAQ|date = 1999-07-08|url = https://employeepages.scad.edu/~kwitte/documents/Photometry_FAQ.PDF|accessdate = 2011-04-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''psychotherapy and social action model''' is an approach to [[psychotherapy]] characterized by concentration on past and present personal, social, and political obstacles to [[mental health]]. In particular, the goal of this therapeutic approach is to acknowledge that individual symptoms are not unique, but rather shared by people similarly oppressed and marginalized. Ultimately, the psychotherapy and social action model aims to aid clients in overcoming [[mental illness]] through personal psychotherapy, group [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], and collective social action.

==Background==
	The psychotherapy and social action model was initially proposed by Sue Holland, a [[psychotherapist]] with a background in community action. Holland developed this framework in 1980 following her experience working with women coping with psychological disorders at a housing estate in West London.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; At this estate, Holland observed the psychological difficulties experienced by women, noticing that their mental health was fundamentally tied to the social and economic obstacles they encountered as females in their society. In addition, Holland took issue with the way [[Depression (mood)]] was being treated at the shelter, believing that individualized treatment, especially with the use of psychotropic medication, was not successfully addressing the root of the dysfunction for these women. Instead, Holland posited a pathway from individual treatment to sociopolitical action that empowered women to deal with their mental dysfunction both privately and socially. As such, the psychotherapy and social action model is rooted in the ideals of both traditional psychotherapy and [[Feminism|feminist]] empowerment.

	Implementation of the model began with a three-year trial run and, according to Holland (1992), achieved its three initial goals, including providing private focused psychotherapy, promoting mental health, and fostering community continuity. There was initial evidence supporting the efficacy of the model in treating individual psychological dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==

The square model derives from the sociological theory of the four paradigms for the analysis of social theory.&lt;ref&gt;Burrell, G. &amp; Morgan, G. (1979). Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the frame of the model, the dichotomy of individual versus social approaches to personal well-being is represented. The two bottom cells of the square delineate the changing of individuals to conform to social convention while the two top cells of the square represent the changing of social structures as opposed to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Orford, J. (2008). Community Psychology: challenges, controversies and emerging consensus (Illustrated ed.). London: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four cells within the frame represent the four paradigms of social theory including functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist, and radical structuralist paradigms. [[Functional psychology|Functionalism]] here is rooted in regulation and objective thinking, and represents the individual, status-quo approach to mental health. The interpretive paradigm is characterized by an approach to understanding the social world through subjective experience, and represents psychoeducation within the psychotherapy framework. The radical humanist paradigm is defined by a radial approach to change with an emphasis on “transcending limitations of existing social arrangements.” (Burrell &amp; Morgan, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;32). With respect to an approach to therapy, this stage is characterized by the adoption of a social self, such that healing occurs at a group or collective level. The radical structuralist paradigm concentrates on radical change through political or economic emancipation. This is the endpoint of therapy, at which time the client is empowered to challenge sociopolitical structures that foster the conditions perpetuating the manifestation of individual mental illness within an oppressed group.

Taken from her 1992 publication entitled, “From Social Abuse to Social Action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women,” Holland formulated her four step approach to mental health and social action for women in treatment for depression as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

===I. Patient on Pills===
At this stage, patients endorse the status-quo characterization of the “individualized patient.” As such, they treat their disorder passively with psychotropic medication and accept the label associated with their illness.

===II. Person-to-Person Psychotherapy===
This stage represents the first alternative to the status-quo treatment of psychiatric disorders: [[talk therapy]]. At this stage, clients and therapists are able to explore the meaning of their psychopathology and pinpoint the potential causes through individual therapy.

===III. Talking in Groups===
At this stage, the client is able to move past the personal challenges that are acknowledged and addressed in psychotherapy and discover that the challenges are universal amongst similarly marginalized individuals. Together, clients aim to acknowledge what is best for the collective.

===IV. Taking Action===
The final stage, as the name suggests, is the point at which the collective mobilizes to change the social structures enabling their common oppression. Having changed from an individual to a collective, the clients should feel empowered to undertake social change.

Included in this framework is the assumption that only some of the clients in this therapy will traverse all three stages. In Holland’s words, “…many will be content enough with the relief from symptoms and the freedom to get on with their personal lives which the individual therapy gives them.” (Holland, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;73). Thus, this framework is fluid based on the personal inclinations of the client throughout the therapeutic process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6417">'''Q-vectors''' are used in atmospheric dynamics to understand physical processes such as vertical motion and [[frontogenesis]]. Q-vectors are not physical quantities that can be measured in the atmosphere but are derived from the [[quasi-geostrophic equations]] and can be used in the previous diagnostic situations. On meteorological charts, Q-vectors point toward upward motion and away from downward motion.  Q-vectors are an alternative to the [[omega equation]] for diagnosing vertical motion in the quasi-geostrophic equations.

==Derivation==
First derived in 1978,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoskins|first=B. J. |author2=I. Draghici |author3=H. C. Davies|title=A new look at the ω-equation|journal=Quart. J. R. Met. Soc|year=1978|volume=104|pages=31–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q-vector derivation can be simplified for the midlatitudes, using the midlatitude β-plane quasi-geostrophic prediction equations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=168–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g u_g}{Dt} - f_{0}v_a - \beta y v_g = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (x component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g v_g}{Dt} + f_{0}u_a + \beta y u_g = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (y component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g T}{Dt} - \frac{\sigma p}{R} \omega = \frac{J}{c_p} &lt;/math&gt; (quasi-geostrophic thermodynamic equation)

And the [[thermal wind]] equations:

&lt;math&gt; f_{0} \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial p} = \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} &lt;/math&gt; (x component of thermal wind equation)

&lt;math&gt; f_{0} \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} = - \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} &lt;/math&gt; (y component of thermal wind equation)

where &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Coriolis parameter]], approximated by the constant 1e&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the atmospheric [[ideal gas constant]]; &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the latitudinal change in the Coriolis parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac{\partial f} {\partial y} &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is a static stability parameter; &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] at constant pressure; &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is pressure; &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature; anything with a subscript &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[geostrophic]]; anything with a subscript &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[ageostrophic]]; &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a diabatic heating rate; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the Lagrangian rate change of pressure with time. &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{Dp}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that because pressure decreases with height in the atmosphere, a &lt;math&gt; - \omega &lt;/math&gt; is upward vertical motion, analogous to &lt;math&gt;+w=\frac{Dz}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

From these equations we can get expressions for the Q-vector:

&lt;math&gt; Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

And in vector form:

&lt;math&gt; Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial x} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial y} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging these Q-vector equations into the [[omega equation|quasi-geostrophic omega equation]] gives:

&lt;math&gt; \left(\sigma \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} + f_{\circ}^2 \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial p^2} \right) \omega = -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} + f_{\circ} \beta \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} - \frac{\kappa}{p} \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} J &lt;/math&gt;

Which in an adiabatic setting gives:

&lt;math&gt; -\omega \propto -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the left-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation in a [[Fourier Series]] gives the &lt;math&gt; -\omega &lt;/math&gt; above, implying that a &lt;math&gt; -\omega &lt;/math&gt; relationship with the right-hand side of the [[omega equation|quasi-geostrophic omega equation]] can be assumed.

This expression shows that the divergence of the Q-vector (&lt;math&gt; \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt;) is associated with downward motion. Therefore, convergent &lt;math&gt; \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt; forces ascend and divergent &lt;math&gt; \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt; forces descend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q-vectors and all [[ageostrophic]] flow exist to preserve [[thermal wind]] balance. Therefore, low level Q-vectors tend to point in the direction of low-level ageostrophic winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=C. N.|title=Handbook of atmospheric science: principles and applications|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-632-05286-4|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Q-vectors can be determined wholly with: [[geopotential height]] (&lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt;) and temperature on a constant pressure surface. Q-vectors always point in the direction of ascending air. For an idealized cyclone and anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (where &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial T} {\partial y} &lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;), cyclones have Q-vectors which point parallel to the thermal wind and anticyclones have Q-vectors that point antiparallel to the thermal wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means upward motion in the area of warm air advection and downward motion in the area of cold air advection.

In [[frontogenesis]], temperature gradients need to tighten for initiation. For those situations Q-vectors point toward ascending air and the tightening thermal gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Weather Service|first=Jet Stream - Online School for Weather|title=Glossary: Q's|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/append/glossary_q.htm|work=NOAA - NWS|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas of convergent Q-vectors, cyclonic vorticity is created, and in divergent areas, anticyclonic vorticity is created.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Quamina Gladstone''', most often referred to simply as '''Quamina''', was a [[British Guiana|Guianese]] slave, a [[Coromantee]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} who was father of [[Jack Gladstone]]. He and his son were involved in the [[Demerara rebellion of 1823]], one of the largest [[slave revolts]] in the [[Crown colony|British colonies]] before slavery was abolished.

He was a carpenter by trade, and worked on an estate owned by [[Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gladstone]]. Quamina was implicated in the revolt by the colonial authorities, apprehended and executed on 16 September 1823. He is considered a national hero in Guyana, and there are streets in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] and the village of Beterverwagting on the East Coast Demerara, named after him.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2492&amp;dat=20070913&amp;id=IUZaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oSYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1813,2049664 "The 1823 Demerara slave rebellion (Part 3)"] ''Stabroek News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 145"/&gt; According to da Costa, he was a "loyal, well-behaved, trustworthy and pious deacon." He brought news of the congregation members on a day-to-day basis, and was always consulted about the affairs of any member.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt;&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 145"/&gt;

Quamina had many wives, but he cohabited for twenty years with Peggy, a [[freedman|free woman]]. As was common with other slaves, he had been harshly treated and humiliated by his masters and once was beaten badly and incapacitated for six weeks. He was frequently forced to work, thus missing religious services.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; In 1822,&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; when Peggy was taken seriously ill, he was forced to work all day, every day, and was not allowed any time off to look after her. One evening, he returned to find her dead.&lt;ref name="abolproject"/&gt;

== The revolt ==
{{Main|Demerara rebellion of 1823}}
Being very close to Jack, Quamina supported his son's aspirations to be free, by supporting the fight for the rights of slaves. But he was at the same time a rational man.&lt;ref&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been troubled for some time by rumours he had heard about an emancipation ordered by Britain that was being withheld by the colonists. Rev. John Smith noted in a private journal entry on 25 July that Quamina had spoken of the matter. Smith assured him that any announcement would be of measures to improve the slaves' condition, and that the rumours of anticipation were not to be believed.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; He urged him to tell the other slaves, particularly the Christians, not to rebel&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; and sent Manuel and Seaton on this mission. When he knew the rebellion was imminent, he urged restraint, and made the fellow slaves promise a peaceful strike.&lt;ref name=guyana43&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter43.html |title=The Demerara Slave Uprising |publisher=Guyana News and Information |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the planned rebellion had leaked out, and Quamina was arrested by John Stewart, the manager at his plantation, shortly before it was due to start. And although he was set loose by fellow slaves as the rebellion was unfolding, Quamina never took up arms, and even actively prevented from Stewart from coming to any harm.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; After the slaves' defeat in a major battle at "Bachelor's Adventure", Jack fled into the woods. A "handsome reward"&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; of one thousand guilder was offered for the capture of Jack, Quamina and about twenty other "fugitives".&lt;ref&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jack led thousands of slaves in rebellion, most of the colonists thought the reverse – that Quamina was the ultimate leader, and Jack was merely aiding and abetting it.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; Jack and his wife were captured by Capt. McTurk at Chateau Margo on 6 September after a three-hour standoff.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), pp. 83–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Quamina remained at large until he was captured on 16 September in the fields of Chateau Margo. He was executed, and his body was hung up in chains by the side of a public road in front of "Success".&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), pp. 87–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very low number of white deaths is proof that the uprising was largely peaceful – plantation owners, managers and their families were locked up and not harmed.&lt;ref name=GCN/&gt; Hundreds of slaves died during the various battles and skirmishes during the revolt, or were executed as "ringleaders". Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to [[Saint Lucia]]. The rebellion helped bring attention to the plight of sugar plantation slaves, accelerating the full [[abolition of slavery]].&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Quamina is considered a national hero in Guyana. In 1985 the post-independence Guyana renamed Murray Street in Georgetown – named for former [[Demerara]] Lieutenant Governor [[John Murray (colonial administrator)|John Murray]] (1813–1824) who was in charge of the colony during the unrest and rebellion – Quamina Street in his honour.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.gov.gy/historiccummings.html |title=Historic Cummingsburg |publisher=National Trust of Guyana |accessdate=25 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930064245/http://www.nationaltrust.gov.gy/historiccummings.html |archivedate=30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A monument to him was erected at the junction of Quamina and Carmichael Streets.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guyanaobservernews.org/content/view/1447/1/

'''Run-to-completion scheduling''' is a [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] model in which each task runs until it either finishes, or explicitly yields control back to the scheduler. Run to completion systems typically have an [[event queue]] which is serviced either in strict order of admission by an [[event loop]], or by an [[admission scheduler]] which is capable of scheduling events out of order, based on other constraints such as [[time limit|deadlines]].

Some [[preemptive multitasking]] scheduling systems behave as run-to-completion schedulers in regard to scheduling tasks at one particular [[process priority]] level, at the same time as those processes still preempt other lower priority tasks and are themselves preempted by higher priority tasks.

In [[Buddhism]], the '''Sakadāgāmin''' ([[Pali]]; Sanskrit: ''Sakṛdāgāmin''), "returning once"&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 660, entry for "Sakadāgāmin" (retrieved 26 Sep 2007 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2653.pali).&lt;/ref&gt; or "once-returner," is a partially [[bodhi|enlightened person]], who has cut off the first three [[Fetter (Buddhism)|chain]]s with which the ordinary mind is bound, and significantly weakened the fourth and fifth. Sakadagaminship is the second stage of the [[four stages of enlightenment]].

The Sakadagamin will be reborn into the realm of the senses at most once more. If, however, he attains the next stage of enlightenment ([[Anagami]]ship) in this life, he will not come back to this world.

The three specific chains or fetters (Pali: {{IAST|saṃyojana}}) of which the Sakadagamin is free are:&lt;br&gt;
1. {{IAST|Sakkāya-diṭṭhi}} (Pali) - Belief in self&lt;br&gt;
2. Sīlabbata-parāmāsa (Pali) - Attachment to rites and rituals&lt;br&gt;
3. Vicikicchā (Pali) - Skeptical doubt&lt;br&gt;The Sakadagami also significantly weakened the chains of:&lt;br&gt;
4. Kāma-rāga (Pali) - [[Raga (Buddhism)|Sensuous craving]]&lt;br&gt;
5. Byāpāda (Pali) - Ill-will

Thus, the Sakadagamin is an intermediate stage between the [[Sotapanna]], who still has comparatively strong sensuous desire and ill-will, and the [[Anagami]], who is completely free from sensuous desire and ill-will. A Sakadagami's mind is very pure. Thoughts connected with greed, hatred and delusion do not arise often, and when they do, do not become obsessive.

'''Same-sex intimacy''' refers to a relationship between two friends of the same sex that has many components of a sexually intimate relationship (e.g. self-disclosures, emotional expressiveness, unconditional support, physical contact and trust),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Monsour, "Meanings of Intimacy in Cross- and Same-Sex Friendships", ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'' 9, no. 2 (1992): 277.&lt;/ref&gt; but not necessarily sexual intimacy or sexual contact.  The term can apply to the exploration of sexuality outside the home, as well as to the physical activities shared between two friends.&lt;ref&gt;John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman, ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1988), 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary applications include the "[[bromance]]" culture, referring intimate bonds formed between male friends in films such as ''[[I Love You, Man]]'', as well as the familial bonds exhibited by close female friends, propagated in the mainstream media by television shows such as ''[[Sex and the City]]''.

== History ==

=== Historical context ===
{{See also|Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln}}
In ''Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality'', American [[LGBT]] historian [[Jonathan Ned Katz]] explores notable incidents of same-sex love prior to the creation of the word "[[homosexual]]"—a time that Katz describes as "the universe before that great sexual divide."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, ''x''&lt;/ref&gt;  Katz's research suggests that prior to distinguishing this [[Wikt:binary|binary]] (heterosexual-homosexual), men felt freer to explore feelings of intense intimacy for other men without feeling judged or stigmatized by societal views. Katz writes, "We may refer to early-nineteenth-century men's acts or desires as gay or [[Heterosexuality|straight]], homosexual, [[heterosexual]], or [[bisexual]], but that places their behaviors and lusts within our sexual system, not the system of their time."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  One example that Katz examines in his book is the relationship between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his friend [[Joshua Fry Speed]]. In 1837, the two men began rooming together their first night of meeting, sharing Speed's double bed for the sake of logic and convenience, and quickly developed a close relationship. The two maintained an intimate bond until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's death]] in 1865. Although there is no evidence that Lincoln and Speed had a sexual physical relationship, Speed once stated about his relationship with Lincoln that "no men were ever more intimate."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual policing ===

Throughout the 1700s, there was an extensive sexual policing of young people. The restrictions in place included mandatory chaperones when on dates and attending public events, as well as other socially acceptable customs such as [[bundling (tradition)|bundling]]. The latter refers to times when a male courter would spend the night in the same bed as his female companion—which was often both necessary and practical, as many courters lived a fair distance from their love interests and the majority of homes had limited beds. When bundling, both partners remained fully clothed and wrapped in separate blankets, sometimes with a "bundling board" between their bodies, to ensure that no sexual activity would take place.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Many intimate same-sex friendships were developed as a response to such sexual policing practices. Intimate relationships between friends were considered a socially acceptable method of sexual expression outside of marriage, as well an outlet for emotional desire that was otherwise limited at this time.

In ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', [[Michel Foucault]] explores the theory of the [[repressive hypothesis]]: the belief that throughout the 1800s, sex was not spoken about because of the heavy sexual policing taking place throughout the [[Victorian Era]]. Foucault argues that the Repressive Hypothesis was hypocritical and inaccurate, as, in actuality, sex was discussed at great lengths at this time.&lt;ref name=Repressive&gt;Michel Foucault, "The Repressive Hypothesis", ''The History of Sexuality: An Introduction'' (New York: Vintage, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  The restrictions, Foucault argued, were in reference to who was permitted to discuss sex and desire and in what situation.&lt;ref name=Repressive/&gt;  For instance, citizens were encouraged to disclose their sexual desires and fantasies to Catholic priests in the name of repentance. Foucault's research on the repressive hypothesis and similar myths about how sexuality was discussed and perceived in the Victorian Era demonstrates further how sexual practices were policed, regulated, and monitored by those in power.

=== Sodomy ===

In the 1800s, "[[sodomy]]" referred to a number of sexual activities that were perceived as deviant. These acts included anal and oral sex outside of marriage, bestiality, masturbation, the "spending of your seed upon another man," and the corrupting youth to partake in any of these activities.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 30-31"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;  Officially, these acts were punishable by death, but [[sodomy|sodomites]] were seldom executed for their crimes. This is because these actions were seen as singular acts for which one could repent. Instead, most offenders were whipped publicly, burned with hot irons, or banished from their towns. All of these punishments were determined and carried out by the church.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 30-31"/&gt;  None of these activities branded an individual a "sodomite", for example, but rather as an individual who committed an act of sodomy.

=== Courtly love and sonnet writing ===

At its conception, the term "[[courtly love]]" referred to the extensive code created to control the intense feelings of love between a knight and a married woman of a higher social standing.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s.v. "Courtly love," (8th ed., Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  The knight in question would perform great acts of bravery in her name in order to demonstrate his love for her from afar. In later years, the definition of "courtly love" expanded to signify any admiration for a peer and, further, the notion that it was an acceptable form of admiration to create writings or art about your beloved.

The most notable example of frequent and common instances of courtly love occurs in the writings of [[William Shakespeare]]. Shakespeare wrote many sonnets to young men that he admired, praising their beauty, intelligence and virility.&lt;ref&gt;Rictor Norton, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/shakespe.htm "Enter Willie Hughes as Juliet: Or, Shakespeare's Sonnets Revisited"] Gay History and Literature Canon, last modified June 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   He addressed sonnets 1-126 to "Fair Youth"—an individual who is commonly interpreted to be male—and later, in Sonnet 20, refers to the boy as the "master-mistress of [his] passion."&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, [http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/179/the-sonnets/3259/sonnet-20/ "Sonnet 20"] ''The Sonnets'', Lit2Go Edition (1609)&lt;/ref&gt; Additional examples of Shakespeare writing of same-sex intimacy and courtly love are within his [[procreation sonnets]]. In these poems, Shakespeare encourages a young man to marry and have children to preserve his beauty, using loving and occasionally romantic language to communicate his message.&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, [http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/179/the-sonnets/3240/sonnet-1/ "Sonnet 1"] ''The Sonnets'', Lit2Go Edition, (1609)&lt;/ref&gt;   Additionally, it is believed by many scholars that Shakespeare's famous [[Sonnet 18]] ("Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?") is also about a man, as he dedicated his book of sonnets to an unidentified "Mr. W.H."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Foster, "Master W.H., R.I.P." PMLA 102 (1987): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Same-sex and "free love" communes ===

While sexuality was heavily policed and regulated in the 1600s, there were many individuals who disagreed with government policies and who opted to rebel. The most notable example of such an instance is [[Thomas Morton (colonist)|Thomas Morton]], an English adventurer who wished to live outside of the family-centric, religion-driven settlements being created by the Christian pilgrims. In 1625, Morton founded [[Merrymount (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Merrymount]]: a commune that opposed the beliefs that he so despised.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  His followers practiced interracial, pre- and extra-marital relationships, polygamy, as well as many forms of same-sex intimacy, union, and sexual expression.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The acceptance of same-sex contact within this context helped to lay the groundwork for same-sex communes that followed.

In the 1860s, [[Martha McWhirter]], a married woman living in Belton, Texas, established a community for women who wished to live together away from their husbands, either permanently or part-time. McWhirter's commune allowed for married women to experience emotional relationships without the risk of pregnancy, as well as experience "sensual pleasures" such as mineral baths and other soothing exercises amidst the company of other women.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 81"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 81&lt;/ref&gt;  While not strictly an expression of same-sex intimacy, this community allowed a socially acceptable way for women to explore friendships and their personal erotic desires outside of the confines of heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 81"/&gt;

== Exploring sexuality outside marriage and the family ==

While same-sex intimate friendships gave the participants a much-needed confidant and companion, the realization of self outside of one's family was also important to the formation of these friendships. Following the period of time in which families lived in one room and children learned about sexuality from their parents,&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 56&lt;/ref&gt;  a different outlet was necessary for sexual growth among youth.  Oftentimes, the practice of a same-sex intimate friendship mirrored that of a heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, this was considered a socially acceptable method of seeking companionship outside of marriage. As a result, often men and women were encouraged to find companions to spend time with.

=== Academia ===

[[Boarding school]]s and [[women's college]]s encouraged same-sex intimate friendships because of limited access to males and "socializ[ation]…into a world which valued female sensibility and female bonds."&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 191&lt;/ref&gt;  Within boarding schools girls formed strong bonds with each other in the absence of other outlets for their emotions and impulses.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"/&gt;  "Smashing" was a term used during the 1860s and 1870s to describe the intensely romantic relationships paralleling heterosexual courtship formed between young women in formal academic settings.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 126"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 126&lt;/ref&gt;  In "Smashing: Women’s Relationships Before the Fall", [[Nancy Sahli]] writes "…when a Vassar girl takes a shine to another she straightaway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes…candies, locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as—''smashed''."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Sahli, "Smashing: Women's Relationships Before the Fall", ''Chrysalis'' 8 (1979): 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having a crush on, or strong feelings for another girl was common, and celebrated within magazines and other works of fiction.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"/&gt;

It was the first time for many women in college that they were away from their families and in the public sphere and most were socializing or living with other women who had similar interests and aspirations.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 192"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 192&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no longer a requirement to wed if a woman decided to become an academic and, because of this, women felt free to continue living with their female companions indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Boston marriage]]s", or partnerships in which women lived and worked together, shared a bed, and planned how to spend their money together, became commonplace. Many professional, young women opted for this arrangement in order to remain financially and emotionally independent of male support.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 192"/&gt;

College also supported intimate same-sex friendships between males for similar reasons (i.e.: ventures out in to the public sphere, distance from families, easier access to entertainment and friends). Fraternities offered an opportunity for men to live together easily and develop bonds with other males while living in close quarters.

=== Related physical intimacy ===

[[Bosom sex]] was often practised between young women. This refers to the act of revealing or fondling of the breasts by a female companion, often while in bed. Bosom sex signified a deep bond and trust between the women performing it. While this practice was not inherently sexual, it is one of the more documented forms of physical intimacy within same sex intimate friendships and today would certainly be categorized as a sexual act.&lt;ref name="Hansen 160-61"&gt;Karen V. Hansen, "'No Kisses Is Like Youres': An Erotic Friendship Between Two African-American Women During the Mid-Nineteenth Century", ''Gender &amp; History'' 7, no. 2. (1995): 160-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[No Kisses Is Like Youres]]", Professor [[Karen V. Hansen]] discusses the relationship between Rebecca Primus and Addie Brown: two African American women who shared an intimate long-distance friendship in the 1860s that spanned over nine years and took place mostly through correspondence.&lt;ref name="Hansen 160-61"/&gt;  The preserved letters from this time articulate a friendship that was loving and supportive, and, at times, sexually-charged. Addie writes fondly of her memories sharing a bed with Rebecca and of the incidents of "bosom sex" that they experienced together.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1995, 160&lt;/ref&gt;  Addie also frequently refers to Rebecca as her "beloved", writing, "Yours {{sic|for ever}}, until death parts us."&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1995, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often held hands, kissed, or caressed while in private settings with other women. This behaviour was acceptable and often encouraged within society as long as these women made no genital contact, the actions were done in a private setting, and such intimacy was not performed in front of men.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 126"/&gt;  Therefore, it was not unusual for women to write notes that mirrored the style and content of love letters to each other, even if one or both of the correspondents were married.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Women often made statements in these letters that they had the desire to make love to one another, which expressed a desire to court and not necessarily to touch.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Anna and [[Emily Dickinson]] both often wrote to married friends expressing their desire to be with their female counterparts, and anxiety to be so far away from each other.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"/&gt;

Working class girls, who were experiencing a separation from their family and the ability to venture out into the public sphere for the first time, also found other ways to explore and express their sexuality. Along with intimacy in same-sex friendships, women would often attend [[cabarets]] together, or else avail themselves of the readily available entertainments in the city.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 130&lt;/ref&gt;  They may even attend a [[peepshow]] together, bringing their intimacy into the public by viewing other women together in a sexual light.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Young men also often put themselves in hypersexual situations with their intimate same-sex friends, without directly being sexual with them.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;   In ''[[Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America]]'', [[John D'Emilio]] specifically references Fred Ryman and his friend Claude Macy, whom Ryman "can truly say [he] love[s]" who seek out a prostitute together.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 110&lt;/ref&gt;  This was common practice among men who experienced intimate same-sex friendships, and is a practice that has carried on in contemporary times with strip clubs and other such activities.

Whether or not there was also sexual intimacy within these relationships is debatable, as homosexuality was still observed as a punishable offense in the United States of America and the intense need to keep sexuality within the private sphere and away from the public sphere was still present.

=== Formation of homosexuality ===

In 1892, American neurologist [[Charles G. Chaddock]] wrote about same-sex desire in a German health textbook, making the first mention of the word "homosexuality". Chaddock defines homosexuality as the "great diminution or complete absence of sexual feeling for the opposite sex with the substitution of sexual feeling and instinct for the same sex." This is the general understanding we have of the word homosexual today, although at that time homosexuality was still seen as "contrary sexual instinct."&lt;ref&gt;"homosexuality, n.", OED Online, (Oxford University Press: 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the term "homosexual" and the understanding that same-sex sexual desire existed changed the meanings of same-sex intimate friendships. While there had always been some physical aspects to same-sex intimate friendships, now such acts were thrown into a negative light. Sodomy and other activities were no longer seen as single, repentable actions, but instead as a lifestyle choice.&lt;ref&gt;John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman, ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

American poet [[Walt Whitman]] identified his feelings of same-sex attraction as "[[adhesive love]]": something falling outside of same-sex intimacy because of its homoerotic undertones.  Whitman first mentions adhesive love in Leaves of Grass, referring to it as an alternative take on "manly love" or the love of men for men.&lt;ref name="Katz 109"&gt;Jonathan Ned Katz, ''Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2001), 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  He expands on this feeling through several of his poems, talking about his "hot wishes" for strange men he meets in the dark.&lt;ref name="Katz 109"/&gt;  Whitman saw manly love as a sexual expression that did not necessarily go against gender binaries, but, rather, challenged the [[capitalistic]] and Christian-centric spirit of the current American democracy.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"/&gt;  Whitman understood adhesive love as necessary aspect of comradeship and male bonding.  He did not identify as a homosexual, as the word was not largely recognised. However, he wrote extensively about his erotic physical encounters with young men,&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 170&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of his life had begun to question his sexual identity, as a result of some prodding by homosexual writer [[John Addington Symonds]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, homosexuality began to be recognized as something outside of church law and was discussed in the medical community.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 226&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexuality became an identifier of a person, the manifestation of their "[[true nature]]".&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"/&gt;  Terms such as "[[Third gender|third sex]]", "[[urning]]", "[[tribad]]" and "[[:wikt:Invert#Noun|invert]]" were used interchangeably with "homosexual".&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"/&gt;  In response, sodomy between two willing participants of legal age was officially legalized in New York State in the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  However, public outrage against homosexuality, the fierce protection of Christian moral standards, and the desire to appear tough on "[[sexual perversion]]" caused all acts of sodomy to be criminalized until well into the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usages ==

Same-sex intimacy has carried over into the contemporary era. Though our view of it has changed, much of what happens within intimate same-sex friendships remains the same.  The two most popular representations of intimate—and often co-dependent—same-sex friendships in modern popular culture are "bromances" among men and the "BFF" culture among women.

=== Bromance ===
{{Main|Bromance}}

Bromance, like the previous forms of same-sex intimacy, allows men to explore their sexuality and experience intimacy outside of a heterosexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth J. Chen, "Caught in a Bad Bromance", ''Texas Journal of Women and the Law'' 21, no. 2 (2012): abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bromance culture encourages men to find intimate friends or "[[heterosexual life partners]]"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', directed by Kevin Smith (1999; Santa Monica, CA: Lions Gate Entertainment), DVD&lt;/ref&gt; in order to experience the closeness and benefits of friendship. This is something that men have often been denied within constructions of modern masculinity.

One example of a bromance relationship in contemporary popular culture was portrayed in the film ''[[I Love You, Man]]'' (2009). In this movie, male characters Peter and Sydney meet and quickly develop a fast and close friendship. Peter is thrilled with his new best friend, but is also hyper-aware of the social confines and emotional restrictions of a same-sex male friendship.&lt;ref&gt;''I Love You, Man'', directed by John Hamburg (2009: Universal City, CA: DreamWorks SKG), DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;  He states, "I’m really nervous. There are no rules for male friendships."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Whipp, "'I Love You, Man' and the Rules of Male Friendship", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (Los Angeles, CA), March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of bromance relationships are visible in current popular culture. Examples include:

* ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'' (Dale and Saul)
* ''[[Knocked Up]]''
* ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]''
* ''[[Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle]]'' (Harold and Kumar)
* ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (Harry and Lloyd)
* ''[[Clerks]]'', etc. (Jay and Silent Bob)
* ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'' (Evan and Seth)
* ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (Frodo and Sam)
* ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' (SpongeBob and Patrick)

=== "BFF" culture ===
{{Main|Best friends forever}}

BFF ("best friend forever") relationships are similar to bromances, but instead emphasize the close friendships between women. BFF culture is generally more socially acceptable and less stigmatized than close relationships between men, as women have been historically and socially conditioned to seek out and embrace the friendship of other women.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Simon, [http://www.blogher.com/term-bff-best-friend-forever-harmful-girls’-friendships "BFFs &amp; Mean Girls: Why Best Friends Forever Can Be Harmful to Girls"] BlogHer Editors. November 8, 2011. Accessed November 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  BFF culture can also be referred to as "[[womance]]".

One example of a BFF relationship that closely links to historical examples of same-sex intimacy is that of Meredith and Cristina on ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. Two surgical interns, the women are drawn to each other because of the fact that they are stubborn and determined to succeed in the male dominated platform of surgery.  They become fast friends, and talk to each other about everything.  Their relationship blossoms into one of same-sex intimacy, with them hugging and holding hands when they walk, sharing a bed platonically, and later raising Meredith's daughter together while she is temporarily separated from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Highfill,  [http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/05/14/greys-anatomy-meredith-cristina/ "'Grey's Anatomy': Why Meredith and Cristina Are the Best Female Friends on TV"] | EW.com. EW.com. May 14, 2014. Accessed November 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like bromance relationships, many different BFF relationships are visible in popular culture. Some examples of these relationships are visible in:

* ''[[Sex and the City]]''
* ''[[The Golden Girls]]''
* [[The Spice Girls]] (pop group)
* ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''
* ''[[Daria]]'' (Daria and Jane)
* ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'' (Thelma and Louise)
* ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'' (Laverne and Shirley)
* ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]''
* [[The Suicide Girls]]

In contemporary society, the label "[[intimate partner]]" can now be applied to any individual who is in an emotionally, physically and/or mentally fulfilling relationship, be it same- or opposite-sexed, and does not necessarily apply only to those have physical sex.  Intimate partners are not defined only by sexual contact; the definition is as broad as same-sex intimate friendships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.relationships.org.au/relationship-advice/faqs/what-is-intimacy-and-why-is-it-so-important "What Is Intimacy and Why Is It so Important?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210001937/http://www.relationships.org.au/relationship-advice/faqs/what-is-intimacy-and-why-is-it-so-important |date=2015-02-10 }} - Relationships Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[category theory]] and [[abstract algebra]], a '''subquotient''' is a [[quotient object]] of a [[subobject]]. Subquotients are particularly important in [[abelian categories]], and in [[group theory]], where they are also known as '''sections''', though this conflicts with a different meaning in [[section (category theory)|category theory]].

For example, of the 26 [[sporadic group]]s, 20 are subquotients of the [[monster group]], and are referred to as the "Happy Family", while the other 6 are [[pariah group]]s.

A quotient of a subrepresentation of a representation (of, say, a group) might be called a subquotient representation; e.g., [[Harish-Chandra]]'s subquotient theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Dixmier | first1=Jacques | title=Enveloping algebras | origyear=1974 | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0821805606 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-0560-2 | mr=0498740 | year=1996 | volume=11}} p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;

In constructive [[set theory]], where the [[law of excluded middle]] does not necessarily hold, one can consider the relation 'subquotient of' as replacing the usual [[order relation]](s) on [[cardinal number|cardinals]]. When one has the law of the excluded middle, then a subquotient &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is either the [[empty set]] or there is an onto function &lt;math&gt;Y\to X&lt;/math&gt;. This order relation is traditionally denoted &lt;math&gt;\leq^\ast&lt;/math&gt;. If additionally the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a one-to-one function to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and this order relation is the usual &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; on corresponding cardinals.

==Transitive relation==
The relation »is subquotient of« is transitive.
;Proof
Let &lt;math&gt;G,H,J&lt;/math&gt; groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon G\to H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\colon H\to J&lt;/math&gt; be [[group homomorphism]]s, then also the composition
:&lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\phi\colon G\to J, g \mapsto (\psi\circ\phi)(g):=\psi(\phi(g))&lt;/math&gt;
is a homomorphism.

If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\phi(U)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;U':=\phi^{-1}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;U\leq G&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;\phi(U')\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, indeed &lt;math&gt;\phi(U')=V&lt;/math&gt;, because every &lt;math&gt;v \in V\subseteq \phi(U)&lt;/math&gt; has a [[preimage]] in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;(\psi\circ\phi)(U')=\psi(V)&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the image, say &lt;math&gt;\psi(V)&lt;/math&gt;, of a subgroup, say &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is also the image of a subgroup, namely &lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\phi&lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words: If &lt;math&gt;\psi(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a subquotient of &lt;math&gt;\phi(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi(U)&lt;/math&gt; is subquotient of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\psi(V)&lt;/math&gt; is subquotient of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;■

'''Supported living''' or '''supportive living''' refers to a range of services designed to help disabled citizens retain their independence in their local communities.

==In the United States==
Supported living has been defined in diverse ways in the US, including early conceptualization in New York as integrated apartment living, and one early definition by the state of Oregon:

"Supported living is defined as persons with disabilities living where and with whom they want, for as long as they want, with the ongoing support needed to sustain that choice."&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, G.T. &amp; Horner, R.H. (1987). Beyond high school: Residential and employment options after graduation. (p. 506) In: M. Snell (Ed.), "Systematic Instruction of Persons with Severe Handicaps." (3rd edition). Columbus, Ohio: Charles E. Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Supported living...its simplicity is elegant. A person with a disability who requires long-term publicly funded, organized assistance, allies with an agency whose role is to arrange or provide whatever assistance is necessary for the person to live in a decent and secure home of the person's own."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;O'Brien, J. (1993). "Supported Living: What's the Difference?" Lithonia, GA: Responsive Systems Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of community living development, supported living became identified with certain approaches to services and community, including the own home initiatives. These services involved an understanding of "formal" and "informal support" (and their relationship), and changes from "group thinking" approaches (e.g., ten intermediate care facilities for 15 persons each) to planning services for, with and by the person "targeted to be served."&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, S., Racino, J., Knoll, J. &amp; Lutfiyya, Z. (1987). "The Nonrestrictive Environment: On Community Integration for Persons with the Most Severe Disabilities." Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

"Supportive living represents a movement within the (intellectual and) developmental disabilities field to provide support services in regular housing to adults with disabilities. Direct support services can be provided by paid staff, including live-in roommates or boarders, paid neighbors, a person hired as an attendant, a support worker or personal assistant, as well as more traditional agency and (modified) shift(live-in) staffing. Professionals, friends, families, and other "informal supports" can also assist people to live in their homes. Supported living may be joined to a movement toward decent, affordable and accessible housing."&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S. &amp; Taylor, S. (1993). "Housing, Support and Community: Strategies for Adults with Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Racino, J. &amp; Rothenberg, K. (1988). "A Policy Analysis of Private Community Living Arrangements in the State of Connecticut." Syracuse, NY: Center on Human Policy, Syracuse University, Research and Training Center on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1993). "Living in the Community Toward Supportive Policies in Housing and Community Services." Report prepared by Community and Policy Studies for the New York State Department of Health on traumatic brain injury technology transfer; adapted by permission. Reprinted in: Racino, J. (1997).

Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported living in the US has multiple known origins, including:
* The development of a service category of community living for people deemed capable of more independent living (also known as semi-independent living).&lt;ref&gt;New York State Association of Community Residence Administrators.

Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a major reform initiative in the US to provide more choices, more integrated and more regular homes and apartments for people with the "most severe disabilities".&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., O'Connor, S., Shoultz, B., Taylor, S. &amp; Walker, P.

* As part of organizational studies during that period (i.e., programs, agencies, and to some extent, state, regional and county systems), including differentiating family support for children and supportive living for adults.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J.

====Community participation====
First, part of leadership (e.g., federal financing, state leaders, agency providers, knowledge dissemination networks) was back to the broadened concept of "community living" based on emerging concepts and practices in "community participation."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. &amp; Bogdan, R. (1999). "Building Stronger Communities for All: Thoughts about Community Participation for People with Developmental Disabilities." Syracuse, NY: Center on Human Policy, Syracuse University. [President's Committee on Mental Retardation].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Community Participation Book Series [Series Editors: S. Taylor, J. Racino, &amp; B. Shoultz]. Book 1: Taylor, S., Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). "Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers, J.A. (1991). Book Review: Life in the Community. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 16(4), 233-234.&lt;/ref&gt; Supported living linked with the concepts of integrated recreation, inclusive education with community opportunities, community membership, self-determination, "community seeding", "person-centered", and personalized supports.&lt;ref&gt;Dilys Page. (1995). Whose services? Whose needs? "Community Development Journal", 30(2), 217-235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, J. (1995). "The Careless Society: Community and its Counterfeits." New York, NY: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in projects such as the Community Opportunities Project of the Louisiana Developmental Disabilities Council, which were based on roles and relationships such as: Paul becoming a church member, fiancee, health club member, good neighbor, regular at Fred's Country Western and coffee shop, and self-advocate with statewide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Blaney, B. &amp; Freud, E.

Blaney, "Creating Individual Supports for People with Developmental Disabilities: A Mandate for Change at Many Levels." (pp. 237-253). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supportive living====
Second, the concept of supportive living was broadened from a service category of a residential program (i.e., facility-based program model with bundled services)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. &amp; Racino, J. (1993). People First: Approaches to housing and support.In: J. Racino, P. Walker, S. O'Connor, &amp; S. Taylor(Eds.), "Housing, Support and Community". (pp. 33-56). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). Residential service categories. In: J. Racino,  "Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support." (pp, 67-70). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; to bridge the gap toward the independent living concept of housing and personal assistance services (health-funded), the concept of regular homes with the availability of "intensive support services" (special population groups, "severe disabilities"), a "range of community support services" (e.g., community counseling, recreation support personnel), decent community life (e.g., community employment, financial security), and principles of community and self-determination/choice.&lt;ref&gt;Center on Human Policy. (1989). "A Statement in Support of Adults Living in the Community". Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy, Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community Integration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1992).

(pp. 131-148). Sycamore, IL: Sycamore Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; This agency and systems change work was based on the identification of leading practice of organizations supporting people with disabilities in the community, including the following program design components: the separation of housing and support, home ownership and leasing, individualized and flexible supports, and individual choice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This program design requires "service coordination/case management/service broker/support facilitator",&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J.

====Housing and "homes of our own"====
Generally, though the focus remained on making people's places into "homes of their own"&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1987). Small homes: Westport Associates. In: S. Taylor, R. Bogdan, &amp; J. Racino (1991). "Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities." (pp.91-104). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1993).

Racino, Walker, P., O'Connor, S. &amp; Taylor, S.J. (Eds.), "Housing, Support and Community". (pp. 131-160). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; which became a federal initiative to also explore other housing and support options on the local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein, C., Levine, R., Lemanowicz, J., Sedlak, W., Klein, J. &amp; Hagner, D. (2006). Home ownership initiatives and outcomes for people with disabilities. "Community Development", 37(3), 46-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P. (1995). "From a Community Residence to a Home of their Own." Syracuse, NY: Center on Human Policy, Resource Center on Supportive Living.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. (1994, February). Down stairs that are never your own: Supporting developmental disabilities in their own homes. "Mental Retardation," 32(1), 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the service configuration and program design levels, a multi-case study research design was used to explore the five identified characteristics of a "housing and support" approach: the separation of housing and support, "home ownership", including tenancy, close tie among assessment, individual planning and individualized funding, and flexible and individualized support services, and choice.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1995). Community living for adults with developmental disabilities: A housing and support approach. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 20(4), 300-310.&lt;/ref&gt; Separate developments were proceeding on [[personal assistance services]] which began with the independent living movement led by leaders such as now Honorable [[Judith E. Heumann]] and late [[Ed Roberts (activist)|Ed Roberts]]; it remains current today (E.g., Center for Personal Assistance Services in the US of San Francisco State University, California; then the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Center for Personal Assistance Services of the World Institute on Disability, 1990).

A state policy study in South Dakota explored the relationship of state systems change necessary to move to a full range of regular housing and support options from the current facility-based service design in comparison to modifying the current small apartment/home structures such as those in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Racino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Racino, J. &amp; Rothenberg, K. (1988). "A Policy Analysis of Private Community Living Arrangements in Connecticut." Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy, Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community integration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). "State policy in housing and support evaluation and public policy analyses of state systems." In: J. Racino, "Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All." (pp. 263-287). London: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there is no evidence of this type of systems transformation in the US (as of 2012)though we have moved to reporting on homes of one's own, personal assistance services and supportive living approaches, including over 189,000 participants of the latter two categories.&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Rizzolo, M., Coulter, D., Haffer, L. &amp; Thompson, M. (2005). "The State of the State in Developmental Disabilities: 2005". Boulder, CO: and Washington,DC: University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakin, K.C., Larson, S., Salmi, P., &amp; Webster, A. (2010). "Residential Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities: Status and Trends through 2009." (pp. 1-14). Washington, DC: American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Robert Agranoff]] reported in the "Public Administration Review", that leading state systems in the US (in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities) indicated an 80-90% conversion from a large institutional system to small, dispersed community homes and services in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Agranoff, R. (2013, September/October). The transformation of public sector intellectual developmental disabilities programming. Health Care Crucible Reform: Challenges for Public Administration.  "Public Administration Review", 73, S127-S137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community support standards in the US==
Supportive living in the US is an important movement within the context of decades of federal policies, sometimes reluctantly, for community support services in communities nationwide as part of [[community integration]], community participation, independent living and inclusion. This movement has been accompanied by a strong emphasis on self-determination, with roots in rehabilitation in the 1950s and also, in education in the 2000s&lt;ref&gt; Wehmeyer, M., Abery, B.H., Mithuag, D., &amp; Stancliffe, R.J. (2003). "Theory in Self Determination". Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A. &amp; Turnbull, H.R. (2001). Self-determination for individuals with significant cognitive disabilities and their families. "Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps", 26(1): 56-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, this movement emphasized the skill standards of personnel, including direct service workers who were called "human service workers" and their "community managers" (2013, Department of Labor statistics).&lt;ref&gt; Taylor, M., Bradley, V., &amp; Warren, R. (1996). "The Community Support Skill Standards: Tools for Managing Change and Achieving Outcomes" Boston, MA: Human Services Research Institute. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2000). "Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support". Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers. &lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, in 2013 with the consumer-directed services developed in these fields, education and training standards are being revamped within the context of the new US Direct Support Workforce and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare.&lt;ref&gt; Larson, S., Sedlezky, L., Hewitt, A., &amp; Blakeway, C. (in press, 2014). In: J. Racino, "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US". NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
'''Supported living''' is the term given by local authorities in the [[United Kingdom]] to encompass a range of services designed to help disabled citizens retain their independence in their local community.

Previously, housing and support were usually provided by a [[Charitable organization|charity]] or local council. Now mentally and physically disabled persons can live in their own home and have personal support provided by another organisation or by hiring a personal assistant (paid visiting or live-in carer).

As of 2009, the government in the UK expected "local councils to give people with learning disabilities a genuine opportunity to choose between housing, care and support options that include:
* Supportive living.
* Small-scale ordinary housing.
* Village or intentional communities." (p.&amp;nbsp;73)

"Supportive living" in the "Valuing People, 21st Century" report defined this approach as: "concerned with designing services round the particular needs and wishes of individuals and is less likely to result in housing and support that is designed around congregate living. Department of Health research has shown that supported living is associated with people having greater overall choice and a wider range of community activities." (p.&amp;nbsp;73)&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health of the UK. (2009). "Welcome to Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability in the 21st Century." London, UK: Author. [Original white paper, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams in the UK===
Local supported living teams can advise what supported housing is available in any given area. Other assistance may include:
* a personal assistant or other care services &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2006). Personal assistance services and direct payments. In: G. Albrecht, ''Encyclopedia on Disability'' (pp. 1235-1238). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE. &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Direct Payments]] &lt;ref&gt; Bornat, J. &amp; Leece, J. (2006). ''Developments in Direct Payments''. Bristol, UK: University of Bristol, Policy Press. &lt;/ref&gt; to pay for privately sourced care services
* mobility equipment
* home adaptations
* security
* emergency call centre
* [[meals on wheels]]

==International collaborations==
As Linda Ward (1995) wrote in her edited text on "Values and Visions: Changing Ideas in Services for People with Learning Difficulties",&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. (1995). Equal citizens: Current issues for people with learning difficulties and their allies. (pp. 3–19). Philpot, T. &amp; Ward, L. (Eds.), "Values and Visions: Changing Ideas in Services for People with Learning Difficulties." Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; "the flaws of the "group home model" were recognised sooner in the USA than the UK." (p. 12). Termed "supportive living", she says these developments have been richly documented by Racino, Walker, O'Connor, &amp; Taylor (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S. &amp; Taylor, S., "Housing, Support and Community". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Written at the time of the nine-state pilots by the federal government on Community Supported Living Arrangements in the US, she noted great interstate variability in what it was and did identify the primary principles near the 1991 national organizational study (separation of housing and support, one individual at a time, full user choice and control, rejecting no one, and a focus on relationships, with maximum use of informal support and community resources). For comparisons, about the same time, Paul Williams (1995) identified the residential services available in Great Britain, including life sharing, hostels, staffed houses, living alone, lodgings, family placements, group homes, living with families, short term care, hospitals and village communities, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, P. (1995). Residential and day services. In: Malin, N., "Services for People with Learning Disabilities." (pp. 79-110). London and NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s on homes and community living in the United Kingdom was the "influential paper "An Ordinary Life"" which was shared in the US through our internationally known colleague David Towell, then of the King's Fund and Great Britain's National Development Team. &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2016, May 31). Community care and budgeting initiatives, Great Britain, 1983-2008. ''The Rise in Health Care Financing in the Community''. Rome, NY: Community and Policy Studies. &lt;/ref&gt; One of his books, ''An Ordinary Life in Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. (Ed.). (1988). ''An Ordinary Life in the Practice: Developing Comprehensive Community-Based Services for People with Learning Disabilities''. London: King Edward's Hospital Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; was paired with his strategic framework for principled national change.&lt;ref&gt;Towell, D. (1990). "Achieving Strategic Change in Opportunities and Services for People with Learning Difficulties: A Principled Agenda for the 1990s". London: King's Fund College.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the comprehensive book (1988), Richard Brazil and Nan Carle describe an ordinary home life, Linda Ward describes developing opportunities for an ordinary community life, Paul Williams and Alan Tyne values for service development (normalization-based, [[Wolf Wolfensberger]]), Alice Etherington, Keven Hall &amp; Emma Whelan as service users (where I live, where I work), [[Philippa Russell]] on children and families, Jan Porterfield on regular employment, the late James Mansell on training, David Towell on managing strategic change, and Roger Blunden on safeguarding quality, among others.

In 2013, the current framework is inclusive and sustainable housing and communities, similar in both the US and UK with sustainability worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. &amp; Towell, D. (2010). "Conversation about Sustainable and Inclusive Communities: An Invitation". London: Centre for Inclusive Futures.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (in press, 2014). Housing, support and disability: Inclusive, equitable and sustainable communities. "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US" NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, these inclusion initiatives were discussed in relationship to [[community integration]] theories at the American Society for Public Administration in Atlanta, Georgia (Racino, Rolandi, Huston, &amp; Begman, 2017) &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J., Rolandi, S., Huston, A., &amp; Bergman, A. (2017). ''Expanding Theories of Community Integration to Inclusion, Equity and Sustainability in the Age of Terrorism''. Atlanta, GA: American Society for Public Administration. &lt;/ref&gt;

Canadians, while not typically using the term supported living which is current in the US &lt;ref&gt; Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Rizzolo, M.C., Tanis, E.S., Haffer, L., &amp; Wu, J. (2013). Table 17.

'''The Geochemist's Workbench''' (GWB) is an integrated set of interactive [[Simulation software|software]] tools for solving a range of problems in aqueous [[chemistry]]. The graphical user interface simplifies the use of the [[geochemical code]].

== History ==
The GWB package was originally developed at the Department of [[Geology]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] over a period of more than twenty years,&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, C. and Yeakel, S., 2016, ''The Geochemist’s Workbench® Release 11 - GWB Essentials Guide''. https://www.gwb.com/pdf/GWB11/GWBessentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; under the sponsorship initially of a consortium of companies and government laboratories and later through license fees paid by a community of users.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. and M. Goldhaber, 2011, ''The Geochemist's Workbench Computer Program''. http://crustal.usgs.gov/projects/aqueous_geochemistry/geochemists_workbench.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, J., March 2012, ''Aqueous Solutions: Solving problems from carbon sequestration to Fukushima''. Central Illinois Business, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the GWB development team moved to the Research Park at the University of Illinois, where they operate as an independent company named Aqueous Solutions LLC.&lt;ref name="Bethke"&gt;Bethke, C.M., and S. Yeakel, 2014, ''The Geochemist's Workbench User's Guides'', Version 10.0. Aqueous Solutions LLC, Champaign&lt;/ref&gt; Since its release, over 3,000 copies have been licensed in 64 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Official website http://www.gwb.com/software_overview.php&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a free Student Edition of the software was released.&lt;ref name = "GWB Student"&gt;Student Edition website http://student.gwb.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

An early version of the software was one of the first applications of [[Parallel computing|parallel]] [[Vector processing|vector computing]], the predecessor to today's [[multi-core processor]]s, to geological research.&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, C.M., W.J. Harrison, C. Upson, and S.P. Altaner, 1988, Supercomputer analysis of sedimentary basins. ''Science'' '''239''', 261-267&lt;/ref&gt; The current release is [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreaded]], and as such retains features of the early parallel vector architecture.&lt;ref&gt;GWB Multithreading page http://www.gwb.com/multithread.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The GWB is an integrated [[geochemical]] [[Computer simulation|modeling]] package used for balancing [[chemical reactions]], calculating stability diagrams and the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] states of natural waters, tracing reaction processes, modeling reactive transport, plotting the results of these calculations, and storing the related data.  The Workbench, designed for personal computers running [[MS Windows]], is distributed commercially in three packages: GWB Professional, Standard, and Essentials, as well as in the free [[#Other geochemical modeling programs in common use|GWB Student Edition]].&lt;ref name="NGWA Newszine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geochemistry Software Made Available for Free to Students|url=http://newsmanager.commpartners.com/ngwanz/issues/2014-08-22/3.html#1|website=www.ngwa.org|publisher=National Ground Water Association|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GWB reads datasets of [[thermodynamic]] [[equilibrium constants]] (most commonly compiled from 0 to 300&amp;nbsp;°C along the steam saturation curve) with which it can calculate chemical equilibria. Thermodynamic datasets from other popular programs like PHREEQC,&lt;ref name = "Parkhurst"&gt;Parkhurst, D.L., 1995, User's Guide to PHREEQC, a computer model for speciation, reaction-path, advective-transport and inverse geochemical calculations. US Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 95-4227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Parkhurst and Appelo"&gt;Parkhurst, D.L. and C.A.J. Appelo, 1999, User's Guide to PHREEQC (version 2), a computer program for speciation, batch-reaction, one-dimensional transport and inverse geochemical calculations. US Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 99-4259.&lt;/ref&gt; WATEQ4F,&lt;ref name = "Ball and Nordstrom"&gt;Ball, J.W. and D.K. Nordstrom, 1991, User's manual for WATEQ4F, with revised thermodynamic data base and test cases for calculating speciation of major, trace, and redox elements in natural waters. US Geological Survey Open File Report 91-183.&lt;/ref&gt; and Visual MINTEQ&lt;ref name = "Visual MINTEQ"&gt;hem.bredband.net/b108693/-VisualMINTEQ_references.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have been formatted for the GWB, enabling comparison and validation of the different codes.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafsson, J.P., 2010, ''Visual MINTEQ thermodynamic databases in GWB format''. http://www2.lwr.kth.se/English/OurSoftware/vminteq/download.html&lt;/ref&gt; The program K2GWB&lt;ref&gt;Cleverley, J.S. and E.N. Bastrakov, 2005, K2GWB: Utility for generating thermodynamic data files for The Geochemist's Workbench® at 0–1000 °C and 1–5000 bar from UT2K and the UNITHERM database. ''Computers &amp; Geosciences'' '''31''', 756-767&lt;/ref&gt; (log K to GWB) was written to generate thermodynamic data for GWB under pressures and temperatures beyond the limits of the default datasets. The GWB can couple chemical reaction with [[Groundwater model|hydrologic transport]] to produce simulations known as [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]]. GWB can calculate flow fields dynamically, or import flow fields as numeric data or calculated directly from the [[USGS]] hydrologic flow code [[MODFLOW]].&lt;ref name="Bethke" /&gt;

== Uses in science and industry ==
[[Geochemistry|Geochemists]] working in the field, office, lab, or classroom store their analyses, calculate the [[Chemical equilibrium|distribution of chemical mass]], create plots and diagrams, evaluate their experiments, and solve real-world problems.

The software is used by [[Environmental chemistry|environmental chemists]], [[Environmental engineering|engineers]], [[Environmental microbiology|microbiologists]], and remediators to gain quantitative understanding of the chemical and microbiological reactions which control the fate and mobility of contaminants in the biosphere. With this knowledge, they can develop predictive models of contaminant fate and transport, and test the effectiveness of costly remediation schemes before implementing them in the field.

Within the energy industry, [[Petroleum engineering|petroleum engineers]], [[Mining engineering|mining geologists]], [[environmental geochemists]] and [[geothermal energy]] developers use the software to search for resources, optimize recovery, and manage wastes, all while using safe and environmentally friendly practices. Geocientists manage the side effects of energy production in [[carbon sequestration]] projects and in the design of [[Deep geological repository|nuclear waste repositories]].

== Uses in education ==
Hundreds of scholarly articles cite or use GWB&lt;ref name="Google Scholar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Scholar search: The Geochemist's Workbench|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Geochemist%27s+Workbench+&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C14|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several textbooks apply the software to solve common problems in environmental [[Environmental protection|protection]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], the [[petroleum industry]], and [[economic geology]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, C.M., 1996, ''Geochemical Reaction Modeling, Concepts and Applications''. Oxford University Press, 397 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GBRM"&gt;Bethke, C.M., 2008, ''Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, C. and G. Anderson, 2002, ''Environmental Applications of Geochemical Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 300 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geochemistry]] students can save time performing routine but tedious tasks that are easily accomplished with the software. Instead of balancing chemical reactions and constructing [[Pourbaix diagram|Eh-pH diagrams]] by hand, for example, students can spend time exploring advanced topics like [[Chemical equilibrium|multi-component equilibrium]], [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic]] theory, or [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport]].&lt;ref name="GBRM"/&gt; Students can apply for a free download of The Geochemist's Workbench Student Edition from the developer's website.&lt;ref name="GWB Student" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5523">'''Toni Dove''' is a [[New York City|New York]]-based artist working primarily in electronic and interactive media.  

==Career==
Dove is considered one of the pioneers of [[interactive cinema]]&lt;ref name=zkm/&gt; and has shown work at [[ZKM]], the [[Banff Centre]] for the Arts, the Brooklyn  Anchorage, and the [[Whitney Museum]] of American Art.  She has been affiliated with [[Creative Time]] and [[Harvestworks]], and a DVD version of scenes from her pieces has been distributed by [[Cycling '74]]. She is the granddaughter of American abstract painter [[Arthur Dove]].

Dove has been working with interactive narrative since 1990.&lt;ref name=cg/&gt; Her work blends cinematic tropes typical of [[Studio system|studio-age]] [[film noir]] with contemporary narrative trends in [[science fiction]], [[cybernetics]], and [[new media]], often offering a feminist take on popular genres.&lt;ref name=century/&gt; Dove refers to her work as "cyber-theatre" because it relies on virtual performers (avatars) rather than human actors and because she gives her audience partial control over the performance through the use of interactive technologies.&lt;ref name=century/&gt;&lt;ref name=carver/&gt; In these hybrids of [[film]], [[installation art]], and [[experimental theater]], the participants interact with an unfolding narrative movie, often using minimally invasive [[user interface|interface]] technologies such as [[speech recognition]] and [[computer vision]] to control or 'perform' their on-screen [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s.&lt;ref name=bennet/&gt;

Dove's 1994 piece entitled ''Casual Workers, Hallucinations and Appropriate Ghosts'' has been interpreted as belonging to the larger domain of radio because of its "aural evocation of high-tech street erotics".&lt;ref name=weiss/&gt;

In 2001 Toni Dove received funding from the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]] to produce ''Spectropia: A Ghost Story on the Infinite Deferral of Desire'', the second part in a "trilogy of narrative, interactive installations begun in 1998".&lt;ref name=trilogy/&gt; The first installment, ''Artificial Changelings'', dealt with "the emergence of compulsive consumerism in the 19th century" through a plotline centered on a heist. For this piece, Dove used floor mats as the basis for viewer interaction with the piece: moving around shifted the visitor's point of view among three options (first, second, and third person). Gestures made by visitors further affected how the piece was experienced.&lt;ref name=vv/&gt; In the second installment, Dove continued her inquiry "into the subconscious at work in the capitalist society of the early 20th century".&lt;ref name=century/&gt;

'''Victorian morality''' is a distillation of the [[morality|moral]] views of people living during the time of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign (1837–1901), the [[Victorian era]], and of the moral climate of Great Britain in the mid-19th century in general.  The British sought to bring these values to the [[British Empire]].  Historian [[Harold Perkin]] writes:
:Between 1780 and 1850 the English ceased to be one of the most aggressive, brutal, rowdy, outspoken, riotous, cruel and bloodthirsty nations in the world and became one of the most inhibited, polite, orderly, tender-minded, prudish and hypocritical. The transformation diminished cruelty to animals, criminals, lunatics, and children (in that order); suppressed many cruel sports and games, such as bull-baiting and cock-fighting, as well as innocent amusements, including many fairs and wakes; rid the penal code of about two hundred capital offences, abolished transportation [of criminals to Australia], and cleaned up the prisons; turned Sunday into a day of prayer for some and mortification for all.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Perkin, ''The Origins of Modern English Society'' (1969) p 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian values emerged in all classes and reached all facets of Victorian living. The values of the period—which can be classed as religion, morality, Evangelicalism, industrial work ethic, and personal improvement—took root in Victorian morality. Current plays and all literature—including old classics like Shakespeare—were cleansed of naughtiness, or "[[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]]."

Contemporary historians have generally come to regard the [[Victorian era]] as a time of many conflicts, such as the widespread cultivation of an outward appearance of dignity and restraint, together with serious debates about exactly how the new morality should be implemented. The international slave trade was abolished, and this ban was enforced by the Royal Navy. Slavery was ended in all the British colonies, child labour was ended in British factories, and a long debate ensued regarding whether prostitution should be totally abolished or tightly regulated. Homosexuality remained illegal.

As of the turn of the 21st century, the term "Victorian morality" can describe any set of values that espouse [[sexual restraint]], [[law and order (politics)|low tolerance of crime]] and a strict social [[code of conduct]].

==Slavery==
{{Main|Abolitionism in the United Kingdom}}
Opposition to slavery was the main evangelical cause from the late 19th century, led by [[William Wilberforce]] (1759–1833). The cause organized very thoroughly, and developed propaganda campaigns that made readers cringe at the horrors of slavery. The same moral fervor and organizational skills carried over into most of the other reform movements.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (2009) pp 205–44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, only four years after the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] throughout the British Empire. The [[anti-slavery]] movement had campaigned for years to achieve the ban, succeeding with a partial abolition in 1807 and the full ban on slave trade, but not slave ownership, which only happened in 1833. It took so long because the anti-slavery morality was pitted against powerful economic interests which claimed their businesses would be destroyed if they were not permitted to exploit slave labour. Eventually, [[plantation]] owners in the [[Caribbean]] received £20 million in cash compensation, which reflected the average market price of slaves. [[William E. Gladstone]], later a famous reformer, handled the large payments to his father for their hundreds of slaves.  The [[Royal Navy]] patrolled the Atlantic Ocean, stopping any ships that it suspected of trading African slaves to the Americas and freeing any slaves found. The British had set up a [[Crown Colony]] in [[West Africa]]—[[Sierra Leone]]—and transported freed slaves there. Freed slaves from [[Nova Scotia]] founded and named the capital of Sierra Leone "[[Freetown]]".&lt;ref&gt;Howard Temperley, ''British antislavery, 1833–1870'' (1972). &lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolishing cruelty==
===Cruelty to animals===
{{Main|Animal welfare in the United Kingdom}}
[[William Wilberforce]], [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]] and [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/animal-rights#ref287259|title=Animal rights|last=Wise|first=Steven M.|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the first legislation to prevent cruelty to animals, the [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822]]; it pertained only to cattle and it passed easily in 1822. &lt;ref&gt; James C. Turner, ''Reckoning with the Beast: Animals, Pain, and Humanity in the Victorian Mind'' (2000) p 39.&lt;/ref&gt;) 

In the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1839]] "fighting or baiting Lions, Bears, Badgers, Cocks, Dogs, or other Animals" was made a criminal offence.  The law laid numerous restrictions on how, when, and where animals could be used. It prohibited owners from letting mad dogs run loose and gave police the right to destroy any dog suspected of being rabid. It prohibited the use of dogs for drawing carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/victorian-legislation/1839-uk-act-london-police.htm |title=London Police Act 1839, Great Britain Parliament. Section XXXI, XXXIV, XXXV, XLII |accessdate=23 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424093224/http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/victorian-legislation/1839-uk-act-london-police.htm |archivedate=24 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was extended to the rest of England and Wales in 1854. Dog-pulled carts were often used by very poor self-employed men as a cheap means to deliver milk, human foods, animal foods (the cat's-meat man), and for collecting refuse (the [[rag-and-bone man]]). The dogs were susceptible to rabies; cases of this horrible deadly disease among humans had been on the rise. They also bothered the horses, which were economically much more vital to the city. Evangelicals and utilitarians in the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals persuaded Parliament it was cruel and should be illegal; the Utilitarian element added government inspectors to provide enforcement.  The owners had no more use for their dogs, and killed them.&lt;ref&gt;M. B. McMullan, "The Day the Dogs Died in London" ''The London Journal: A Review of Metropolitan Society Past and Present'' (1998) 23#1 pp 32–40  https://doi.org/10.1179/ldn.1998.23.1.32 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rep&gt;{{citation |title=Representing Animals |last=Rothfels |first=Nigel |page=12 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-34154-X}}.

===Child labour===
{{Main|Child labour}}
Evangelical religious forces took the lead in identifying the evils of child labor, and legislating against them. They were angered at the contradiction between the conditions on the ground for children of the poor and the middle-class notion of childhood as a time of innocence led to the first campaigns for the imposition of legal protection for children. Reformers attacked child labor from the 1830s onward. The campaign that led to the [[Factory Acts]] was spearheaded by rich philanthropists of the era, especially [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], who introduced bills in Parliament to mitigate the exploitation of children at the workplace. In 1833 he introduced the [[Factory Acts#Labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833|Ten Hours Act 1833]], which provided that children working in the cotton and woollen mills must be aged nine or above; no person under the age of eighteen was to work more than ten hours a day or eight hours on a Saturday; and no one under twenty-five was to work nights.&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Battiscombe, ''Shaftesbury: A Biography of the Seventh Earl 1801–1885'' (1988) pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Factory Acts|Factory Act of 1844]] said children 9–13 years could work for at most 9 hours a day with a lunch break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kelly et al.|title=Business Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMhwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA548|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional legal interventions throughout the century increased the level of childhood protection, despite the resistance from the [[laissez-faire]] attitudes against government interference by factory owners. Parliament respected laissez-faire in the case of adult men, and there was minimal interference in the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. J. Litzenberger|author2=Eileen Groth Lyon|title=The Human Tradition in Modern Britain|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3735-4|pages=142–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployed street children suffered too, as novelist [[Charles Dickens]] revealed to a large middle class audience the horrors of London street life.&lt;ref&gt;Amberyl Malkovich, ''Charles Dickens and the Victorian Child: Romanticizing and Socializing the Imperfect Child'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==
{{Main|Victorian era#morality}}
Historians [[Peter Gay]] and Michael Mason both point out that modern society often confuses Victorian etiquette for a lack of knowledge. For example, people going for a bath in the [[sea]] or at the [[beach]] would use a [[bathing machine]]. Despite the use of the bathing machine, it was still possible to see people bathing nude.  Typical middle-class brides likely knew nothing about sex and learned about their husbands' expectations for it on their wedding night; the experience was often traumatic. Contrary to popular conception, however, Victorian society recognised that both men and women enjoyed copulation.&lt;ref name="draznin2001"&gt;{{cite book | title=Victorian London's Middle-Class Housewife: What She Did All Day (#179) | publisher=Greenwood Press | author=Draznin, Yaffa Claire | year=2001 | series=Contributions in Women's Studies | location=Westport, Connecticut | pages=95–96 | isbn=0-313-31399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbal or written communication of [[libido|sexual feeling]]s was also often proscribed so people instead used the [[language of flowers]]. However, they also wrote explicit [[erotica]], perhaps the most famous being the racy tell-all ''[[My Secret Life (erotica)|My Secret Life]]'' by the pseudonym Walter (allegedly [[Henry Spencer Ashbee]]), and the magazine ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which was published for several years and reprinted as a paperback book in the 1960s. Victorian erotica also survives in private letters archived in museums and even in a study of women's orgasms. Some current historians now believe that the myth of Victorian repression can be traced back to early twentieth-century views, such as those of [[Lytton Strachey]], a member of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], who wrote ''[[Eminent Victorians]]''.
===Homosexuality===
{{see also|Labouchere Amendment|Oscar Wilde}}
The enormous expansion of police forces, especially in London, produced a sharp rise in prosecutions for illegal sodomy at midcentury.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Brady, ''Masculinity and Male Homosexuality in Britain, 1861–1913'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, law officers saw it as an unfortunate duty that detracted them from the real business of fighting crime.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Cocks, ''Nameless Offences: Homosexual Desire in the Nineteenth Century'' (2003) p. 50; [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/193191 online review]&lt;/ref&gt;  Male sexuality became a favorite subject of study especially by medical researchers whose case studies explored the progression and symptoms of institutionalized subjects. [[Henry Maudsley]] shaped late Victorian views about aberrant sexuality. [[George Savage (physician)|George Savage]] and [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] wrote about homosexuals living in society. [[Daniel Hack Tuke]]'s ''Dictionary of Psychological Medicine'' covered sexual perversion. All these works show awareness of continental insights, as well as moral disdain for the sexual practices described.&lt;ref&gt; Ivan Crozier, "Nineteenth-century British psychiatric writing about homosexuality before Havelock Ellis: The missing story." ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' 63#1 (2008): 65–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simeon Solomon]] and poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], as they contemplated their own sexual identities in the 1860s, fastened on the Greek lesbian poet [[Sappho]]. They made Victorian intellectuals aware of Sappho, and their writings helped to shape the modern image of lesbianism.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Prettejohn,  "Solomon, Swinburne, Sappho." ''Victorian Review'' 34#2 (2008): 103–128. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27793672 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Labouchere Amendment]] to the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], for the first time, made all male homosexual acts illegal. It provided for two years' imprisonment for males convicted of committing, or being a party to public or private acts of homosexuality. Lesbian acts—still scarcely known—were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;F. Barry Smith, "Labouchere's amendment to the Criminal Law Amendment bill." ''Australian Historical Studies'' 17.67 (1976): 165–173.&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[Oscar Wilde]] was convicted of violating the statute, and imprisoned for such violations, in 1895, he became the iconic victim of English puritanical repression.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Adut, "A theory of scandal: Victorians, homosexuality, and the fall of Oscar Wilde." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 111.1 (2005): 213–248 [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ari_Adut/publication/7525127_A_Theory_of_Scandal_Victorians_Homosexuality_and_the_Fall_of_Oscar_Wilde/links/5899e4a3aca2721f0db11941/A-Theory-of-Scandal-Victorians-Homosexuality-and-the-Fall-of-Oscar-Wilde.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===

[[File:Illustrated Police News - Jack the Ripper 2.png|thumb| A victim of [[Jack the Ripper]]]]
Prostitution had been a factor in city life for centuries. The reformers started mobilizing in the late 1840s, major news organisations, clergymen, and single women became increasingly concerned about prostitution, which came to be known as "The Great Social Evil".&lt;ref&gt;Judith R. Walkowitz, ''Prostitution and Victorian society: Women, class, and the state'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;   Estimates of the number of prostitutes in London in the 1850s vary widely (in his landmark study, ''Prostitution'', [[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]] reported that the police estimated there were 8,600 in London alone in 1857).

While the [[Magdalene Asylum]]s had been reforming prostitutes since the mid-18th century, the years between 1848 and 1870 saw a veritable explosion in the number of institutions working to "reclaim" these "fallen women" from the streets and retrain them for entry into respectable society&amp;nbsp;— usually for work as domestic servants. The theme of prostitution and the "fallen woman" (any woman who has had [[sexual intercourse]] out of marriage) became a staple feature of mid-[[Victorian literature]] and politics. In the writings of [[Henry Mayhew]], [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]], [[Charles Dickens]] and others, prostitution began to be seen as a [[Social issues|social problem]].

When Parliament passed the first of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] in 1864 (which allowed the local constabulary in certain defined areas to force any woman suspected of [[Sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] to submit to its inspection), [[Josephine Butler]]'s crusade to repeal the CD Acts yoked the anti-prostitution cause with the emergent [[feminist movement]].  Butler attacked the long-established [[double standard]] of [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Boyd, ''Three Victorian Women Who Changed Their World: Josephine Butler, Octavia Hill, Florence Nightingale'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes were often presented as victims in [[Sentimental novel|sentimental literature]] such as [[Thomas Hood]]'s poem ''[[The Bridge of Sighs (poem)|The Bridge of Sighs]]'', [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s novel ''[[Mary Barton]]'', and [[Dickens]]' novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. The emphasis on the purity of women found in such works as [[Coventry Patmore]]'s ''[[The Angel in the House]]'' led to the portrayal of the prostitute and fallen woman as soiled, corrupted, and in need of cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;George Watt, ''The fallen woman in the nineteenth-century English novel'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

This emphasis on female purity was allied to the stress on the homemaking role of women, who helped to create a space free from the pollution and corruption of the city. In this respect, the prostitute came to have symbolic significance as the embodiment of the violation of that divide. The double standard remained in force. The [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]] allowed for a man to divorce his wife for adultery, but a woman could only divorce for adultery combined with other offences such as incest, cruelty, bigamy, desertion, etc., or based on cruelty alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nelson, Horace |ref=nelson |date=1889|publisher=Stevens and Sons Limited|location=London| title= Selected cases, statutes and orders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uqYPAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;ots=56BiBx77mT&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymity of the city led to a large increase in prostitution and unsanctioned sexual relationships. Dickens and other writers associated prostitution with the mechanisation and industrialisation of modern life, portraying prostitutes as human commodities consumed and thrown away like refuse when they were used up. Moral reform movements attempted to close down brothels, something that has sometimes been argued to have been a factor in the concentration of street-prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Judith R. Walkowitz, "Male vice and feminist virtue: feminism and the politics of prostitution in nineteenth-century Britain." ''History Workshop'' (1982) 13:79–93. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4288404 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of prostitution in London in the 1880s gained national and global prominence through the highly publicised murders attributed to Whitechapel based serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], whose victims were exclusively prostitutes living destitute in the [[East End]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-the-Ripper|title=Jack the Ripper {{!}} English Murderer|publisher=Britannica|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that many prostitutes were living in poverty as late as the 1880s and 1890s, offering sex services was a source of desperate necessity to fund their meals and temporary lodging accommodation from the cold, and as a result prostitutes represented easy prey for criminals as they could do little to personally protect themselves from harm.

== Crime and police==
{{Main|History of law enforcement in the United Kingdom|History of the Metropolitan Police Service}}
After 1815, there was widespread fear of growing crimes, burglaries, mob action, and threats of large-scale disorder. Crime had been handled on an ad-hoc basis by poorly organized local parish constables and private watchmen, supported by very stiff penalties, including hundreds of causes for execution or deportation to Australia. London, with 1.5 million people—more than the next 15 cities combined—over the decades had worked out informal arrangements to develop a uniform policing system in its many boroughs. The [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]], championed by Home Secretary [[Robert Peel]], was not so much a startling innovation, as a systemization with expanded funding of established informal practices.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gash, ''Mr. Secretary Peel: the life of Sir Robert Peel to 1830'' (1961) pp. 487–98.&lt;/ref&gt; It created the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], headquartered at [[Scotland Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Lyman, "The Metropolitan Police Act of 1829: An Analysis of Certain Events Influencing the Passage and Character of the Metropolitan Police Act in England," ''Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science'' (1964) 55#1 pp. 141–154 [https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol55/iss1/18/ online]&lt;/ref&gt; London now had the world's first modern police force. The 3000 policemen were called "bobbies" (after Peel's first name). They were well-organized, centrally directed, and wore standard blue uniforms. Legally they had the historic status of constable, with authority to make arrests of suspicious persons and book offenders before a magistrate court. They were assigned in teams to specified beats, especially at night. Gas lighting was installed on major streets, making their task of surveillance much easier.  Crime rates went down. An 1835 law required all incorporated boroughs in England and Wales to establish police forces.  Scotland, with its separate  legal system, was soon added. By 1857  every jurisdiction in Great Britain had an organized police force, for which the Treasury paid a subsidy.  The police had steady pay, were selected by merit rather than by political influence, and were rarely used for partisan purposes. The pay scale was not high (one guinea a week in 1833), but the prestige was especially high for Irish Catholics, who were disproportionately represented in every city where they had a large presence.&lt;ref&gt; Clive Emsley, "Police" in James Eli Adams, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Victorian Era'' (2004) 3:221–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Clive Emsley, ''Crime and Society in England, 1750–1900'' (5th ed. 2018) pp 216-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causation==

Intellectual historians searching for causes of the new morality often point to the ideas by [[Hannah More]], [[William Wilberforce]], and the [[Clapham Sect]]. Perkin argues this exaggerates the influence of a small group of individuals, who were "as much an effect of the revolution as a cause."  It also has a timing problem, for many many predecessors had failed. The intellectual approach tends to minimize the importance of Nonconformists and Evangelicals—the Methodists, for example, played a powerful role among the upper tier of the working class.  Finally, it misses a key ingredient: instead of trying to improve an old society, the reformers were trying to lead Britain into a new society of the future.&lt;ref&gt;Perkin, ''The Origins of Modern English Society,'' pp 280–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Victorian Era movements for justice, freedom, and other strong moral values made greed, and exploitation into public evils.  The writings of [[Charles Dickens]], in particular, observed and recorded these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bivona,  "Poverty, pity, and community: Urban poverty and the threat to social bonds in the victorian age." ''Nineteenth-Century Studies'' 21 (2007): 67–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Peter Shapely examined 100 charity leaders in Victorian Manchester. They brought significant cultural capital, such as wealth, education and social standing. Besides the actual reforms for the city they achieved for themselves a form of symbolic capital, a legitimate form of social domination and civic leadership. The utility of charity as a means of boosting one's social leadership was socially determined and would take a person only so far. &lt;ref&gt;Peter Shapely, "Charity, Status and Leadership: Charitable Image and the Manchester Man" ''Journal of Social History'' 32#1 (1998), pp. 157–177 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789597 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Volumetric efficiency''' (VE) in [[internal combustion engine]] engineering is defined as the [[ratio]] of the [[mass density]] of the [[air-fuel mixture]] drawn into the cylinder at atmospheric pressure (during the intake stroke) to the mass density of the same volume of air in the intake manifold. The term is also used in other engineering contexts, such as [[hydraulic pump]]s and electronic components. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Internal combustion engines==
Volumetric efficiency in an internal combustion engine design refers to the efficiency with which the engine can move the ''charge'' of fuel and air into and out of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinders]]. It also denotes the ratio of air volume drawn into the cylinder to the cylinder's swept volume.
&lt;ref&gt;{{ Internal Combustion Engines 3rd edition  Ferguson , Kirkpatrick-  Publisher John Wiley and Sons, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, volumetric efficiency is a ratio (or percentage) of the mass of air and fuel that is trapped by the cylinder during induction divided by the mass that would occupy the displaced volume if the air density in the cylinder were equal to the ambient air density. The flow restrictions in the intake system create a pressure drop in the inlet flow which reduces the density (unless boosts like turbos or superchargers or cam tuning techniques are used). Volumetric efficiency can be improved in a number of ways, most effectively this can be achieved by compressing the induction charge ([[forced induction]]) or by aggressive cam phasing in naturally aspirated engines as seen in racing applications. In the case of forced induction volumetric efficiency can exceed 100%.

There are several ways to improve volumetric efficiency, but system-wide approaches are used to realize its full potential.

Many high [[performance car]]s use carefully arranged air intakes and [[tuned exhaust]] systems that use pressure waves to push air into and out of the cylinders, making use of the [[resonance]] of the system. [[Two-stroke engine]]s are very sensitive to this concept and can use [[expansion chamber]]s that return the escaping [[air-fuel mixture]] back to the cylinder. A more modern technique for [[four-stroke engine]]s, [[variable valve timing]], attempts to address changes in volumetric efficiency with changes in speed of the engine: at higher speeds the engine needs the valves open for a greater percentage of the cycle time to move the charge in and out of the engine.

Volumetric efficiencies above 100% can be reached by using forced induction such as [[supercharger|supercharging]] or [[turbocharger|turbocharging]]. With proper tuning, volumetric efficiencies above 100% can also be reached by [[naturally aspirated engine]]s. The limit for naturally aspirated engines is about 130%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SohoPros |url=http://www.theoldone.com |title=ENDYN |publisher=Theoldone.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; these engines are typically of a [[DOHC]] layout with [[Multi-valve|four valves per cylinder]].  This process is called [[inertial supercharging effect|inertial supercharging]] and uses the resonance of the intake manifold and the mass of the air to achieve pressures greater than atmospheric at the intake valve. With proper tuning (and dependent on the need for sound level control), VE's of up to 130% have been reported in various experimental studies.&lt;ref&gt;SAE 860032 "Optimization of multi valve four cycle engine design"&lt;/ref&gt;

More "radical" solutions include the [[sleeve valve]] design, in which the valves are replaced outright with a rotating sleeve around the piston, or alternately a rotating sleeve under the cylinder head. In this system the ports can be as large as necessary, up to that of the entire cylinder wall. However, there is a practical upper limit due to the strength of the sleeve, at larger sizes the pressure inside the cylinder can "pop" the sleeve if the port is too large.

==Hydraulic pumps==
Volumetric efficiency in a hydraulic pump refers to the percentage of actual fluid flow out of the pump compared to the flow out of the pump without leakage. In other words, if the flow out of a 100cc pump is 92cc (per revolution), then the volumetric efficiency is 92%. The volumetric efficiency will change with the pressure and speed a pump is operated at, therefore when comparing volumetric efficiencies, the pressure and speed information must be available. When a single number is given for volumetric efficiency, it will typically be at the rated pressure and speed.

==Electronics==
[[File:Capacitor Miniaturizing 1970-2005.png|thumb|Capacitor volumetric efficiency increased from 1970 to 2005 (click image to enlarge)]]
In electronics, volumetric efficiency quantifies the performance of some electronic function per unit volume, usually in as small a space as possible.  This is desirable since advanced designs need to cram increasing functionality into smaller packages, for example, maximizing the energy stored in a battery powering a cellphone.  Besides energy storage in batteries, the concept of volumetric efficiency appears in design and application of [[capacitor]]s, where the "CV product" is a [[figure of merit]] calculated by multiplying the capacitance (C) by the maximum voltage rating (V), divided by the volume. The concept of volumetric efficiency can be applied to any measurable electronic characteristic, including [[electrical resistance|resistance]], [[capacitance]], [[inductance]], [[voltage]], [[electric current|current]], [[energy storage]], etc.

'''Women in positions of power''' are women who hold an occupation that gives them great [[authority]], [[Social influence|influence]], and/or [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]. Historically, [[Power (social and political)|power]] has been distributed among the sexes disparately. Power and powerful positions have most often been associated with men as opposed to women.&lt;ref name=Hartsock&gt;Hartsock, N. (1990). Foucault on power: a theory for women?. Feminism/postmodernism, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[gender equality]] increases, women hold more and more powerful positions, due to policy and [[social reform]].&lt;ref name=Cockburn&gt;Cockburn, C. (1991). In the way of women: Men's resistance to sex equality in organizations (No. 18). Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accurate and proportional representation of women in social systems has been shown to be important to long-lasting success of the system.&lt;ref name="Renyolds"&gt;Reynolds, A. (1999). Women in the Legislatures and Executives of the World. World Politics, 51(4), 547-573.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study shows that “absence is not merely a sign of disadvantage and disenfranchisement, but the exclusion of women from positions of power also compounds gender stereotypes and retards the pace of equalization".&lt;ref name="Renyolds" /&gt;

==Position of power==
Occupational power refers to power over coworkers in the field. Positions of power can exist in almost any setting, from small scale, unofficial groups or clubs, all the way to the obvious leaders of nations or CEOs of companies. These more official situations are found in many areas, such as government, industry and business, science and academia, the media, and many other sectors.

==Gender as a factor==
Positions of power and gender are very intertwined. As one study pointed out, “Power differences frequently underlie what appear to be gender differences in behavior; as society is currently configured, power and gender are never independent".&lt;ref name="Yoder"&gt;Yoder, J. D., &amp; Kahn, A. S. (1992). Toward a feminist understanding of women and power. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 16(4), 381-388.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, gender relates to power in the different ways power is acquired, used, and manifested. A 1988 journal article summarizes this relation between gender and power: "the idea that women and men differ in power motivation is reinforced by history and culture. In the history of the west, certainly, women have had less access to most forms of power than have men. Many people believe that men are interested in power and getting power while women are not. Others hold that men and women differ in the ways that they establish, maintain and express power".&lt;ref name=Winter&gt;Winter, D. G., &amp; Barenbaum, N. B. (1985). Responsibility and the power motive in women and men. Journal of Personality, 53(2), 335-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, studies have shown that increasing women’s participation in leadership positions decreases corruption, as “women are less involved in bribery, and are less likely to condone bribe taking”.&lt;ref name=Swamy&gt;Swamy, A., Knack, S., Lee, Y., &amp; Azfar, O. (2003). Gender and corruption. Democracy, Governance and Growth, edited by Stephen Knack, 191-224.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on gender and corruption from 2000 also found that “cross-country data show that corruption is less severe where women hold a larger share of parliamentary seats and senior positions in the government bureaucracy, and comprise a larger share of the labor force”.&lt;ref name="Swamy"/&gt;

==Other factors==
In addition to the male-female split in the distribution of positions of power, many other factors play a role in who has power. Race, class, sexuality, age, and other factors all play a significant part in who is in control.&lt;ref name=Zweigenhaft&gt;Zweigenhaft, R. L., &amp; Domhoff, G. W. (1998). Diversity in the power elite: Have women and minorities reached the top? (Vol. 670). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Acker&gt;Acker, J. (2006). Inequality regimes gender, class, and race in organizations. Gender &amp; Society, 20(4), 441-464.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors play in especially when coupled with the gender difference: research from the Journal of the National Association of Social Workers has found that the “double burden of racism and sexism exacts a toll on their mental health and restricts their opportunities”.&lt;ref name=Gutierrez&gt;Gutierrez, L. M. (1990). Working with women of color: An empowerment perspective. Social work, 35(2), 149-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to another study, "the degree to which a system successfully includes women can indicate a propensity for the system to include other disenfranchised minorities".&lt;ref name="Renyolds"/&gt;

==Traditional roles and stereotypes==
Traditional roles for men and women in most cultures have relegated women to working in the home primarily. This traditional role of fostering and nurturing others ensued from various sources, but the results are a decrease in the value of work done by women and a decreased ability to work outside the home.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, J. B. (1982). Women and power (Vol. 1). Stone Center for Developmental Services and Studies, Wellesley College.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pleck&gt;Pleck, J. H. (1977). The work-family role system. Social problems, 417-427.&lt;/ref&gt; This is paired with the societal expectation of the woman to take care of the home and family, and with that the lack of male support in the caretaking of the home. This all leads to the expectation that women have responsibilities in the home and often plays a part in occupational sexism.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pleck /&gt;

Other traditional views of women relegate them to certain occupations. The view of women as caretakers of the family extends beyond the familial unit to others. Women have traditionally been seen as caretakers, of both people and other beings and things&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pleck /&gt; However, this caretaker occupation has most often been a subordinate one, under the direction of a superior, usually a man.&lt;ref name=Lorber&gt;Lorber, J. (1984). Women physicians: Careers, status, and power (Vol. 281). New York: Tavistock Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The example of the vastly female-dominated nurse occupation, 95% women as of the 2000s,&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;Evans, J., &amp; Frank, B. (2003). Contradictions and tensions: Exploring relations of masculinities in the numerically female-dominated nursing profession. The Journal of Men's Studies, 11(3), 277-292.&lt;/ref&gt; reflects this, as it is the doctors that ultimately are in charge and have the power in the nurse-doctor relationship.&lt;ref name="Lorber"/&gt;

Traditional stereotypes of women make them out to be much more emotional and irrational than men, and thus less suited for many important jobs.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;Barrett, L. F., Robin, L., Pietromonaco, P. R., &amp; Eyssell, K. M. (1998). Are women the “more emotional” sex? Evidence from emotional experiences in social context. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 12(4), 555-578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;Goldenberg, J. L., &amp; Roberts, T. A. (2013). Throughout the history of the sexes, women have been perceived as inferior to men, but also have been elevated to the status of goddesses on earth. We suggest that these para-doxical biases often associated with women can be linked to an existential need to distance humanity from the natural world. The sources of discrimination against women are most commonly associated with their biological nature. For example, women are devalued for be-ing more emotional than men, less rational, physically weaker, and .... Handbook of experimental existential psychology, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been found that while there is some basis to the stereotype, it does not hold true universally under statistical scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt; One survey based in South Africa found that "over 30 per cent ... are of the opinion that women are too emotional to be able to handle high level leadership positions";&lt;ref name=Gouws&gt;9.	Gouws, A., &amp; Kotzé, H. (2007). Women in leadership positions in South Africa: The role of values. Politikon, 34(2), 165-185.&lt;/ref&gt; evidently, stereotypes persist and still take effect.

Studies show that "it is common for stereotypical ideas about women's abilities to perform well in leadership positions to inform people's perceptions about women leaders".&lt;ref name=Gouws /&gt;

==Government==
{{further|Women in government}}

For many years and in most regions of the globe, politics had not allowed women to play a significant role in government. Even in the early 1900s, politics were viewed almost exclusively as the domain of men.&lt;ref name=Paxton&gt;Paxton, P., &amp; Hughes, M. M. (2007). Women, politics, and power: A global perspective. Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, women’s movements and culture-changing events such as World War II gradually increased women’s rights and roles in politics.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt; Many factors go into the degree of female participation in governments across the world. One 1999 study found: "[the] electoral system structure, left party government, the timing of women's suffrage, the share of women in professional occupations, and cultural attitudes toward the role of women in politics each play a role in accounting for variation in the degree of gender inequality in political representation around the world”.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy&gt;Kenworthy, L., &amp; Malami, M. (1999). Gender inequality in political representation: A worldwide comparative analysis. Social Forces, 78(1), 235-268.&lt;/ref&gt; Even still, there are many other factors that play a serious role in female participation in government. There is a significant “perceived liability” to a party of having a female candidate for office, according to a 2005 study.&lt;ref name=Kunovich&gt;Kunovich, S., &amp; Paxton, P. (2005). Pathways to Power: The Role of Political Parties in Women’s National Political Representation1. American Journal of Sociology, 111(2), 505-552.&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, no country in the world has 50% or higher female participation in a national legislature, and 73% of countries have less than 20% female participation.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;

There are multiple levels of power positions in the government from the local level to the national level. Accordingly, there are different degrees to which women partake in these different levels. For example, studies have found in India that "large scale membership of women in local councils" can be more effective in exerting influence, such as over crime rates, than "their presence in higher level leadership positions".&lt;ref name=Iyer&gt;Iyer, L., Mani, A., Mishra, P., &amp; Topalova, P. (2011). The power of political voice: Women’s political representation and crime in India. Harvard Business School BGIE Unit Working Paper, (11-092).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to have women at all levels of government to ensure the representation as well as enacting of women's interests.&lt;ref name="Renyolds"/&gt;

===Voting===
Women were deprived of exercising political power in every country until granted the right to vote. After earning the right to vote, it often took decades for women to turn out to the polls in numbers proportional to their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=Pintor&gt;Pintor, R. L., &amp; Gratschew, M. (2002). Voter turnout since 1945: a global report.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. today, women are statistically more likely to vote than men,&lt;ref name="Pintor"/&gt; a pattern that occurs in certain countries, such as Scandinavian countries, while the opposite occurs in others, such as India.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pintor"/&gt; Scandinavian countries are also some of the countries with greatest female representation in government positions.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt; Exercising the right to vote is a reflection of the power women feel they have in their political systems.

Today, women are enfranchised in all countries with a legislature other than Saudi Arabia. A 2006 study demonstrated that “although women have the legal right to vote and stand for elections in almost every country of the world, cultural barriers to women’s use of their political rights, including family resistance and illiteracy, remain”.&lt;ref name="Pintor"/&gt;

===Quotas===
Many countries have instituted quotas dictating a minimum number of women to be given elected positions in governments. In general, the quota system has acted as a fast-track to incorporating greater female representation into the governing systems.&lt;ref name=Tripp&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tripp | first1 = Aili M. | last2 = Kang | first2 = Alice | title = The global impact of quotas on the fast track to increased female legislative representation | journal = [[Comparative Political Studies]] | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 338–361 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0010414006297342 | date = March 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0010414006297342 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, such as Rwanda, which have established quota systems successfully have even recently surpassed traditionally highly gender representative countries based on the quota requirements.&lt;ref name=Tripp /&gt; However, there are still flaws to quota systems and there is some controversy over the effectiveness of representation,&lt;ref name=Dahlerup&gt;{{cite book | last = Dahlerup | first = Drude | title = Women, quotas and politics | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415375498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tinker&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Tinker | first = Irene | author-link1 = Irene Tinker | title = Quotas for women in elected legislatures: Do they really empower women? | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 531–546 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2004.09.008 | date = November 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2004.09.008 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some studies have found actual policy change to be limited.&lt;ref name=Dahlerup /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tinker /&gt;

===International organizations===
International bodies such as the UN have established goals for female representation in governing bodies. Thirty percent of elected position seats was recommended as the critical mass necessary to gain effective policy from female representation.&lt;ref name=Tinker /&gt; However, even these international bodies that promote female empowerment on many scales themselves lack proportional gender representation. On Wikipedia’s [[List of current Permanent Representatives to the United Nations]], of the 192 representatives, only 32 are women, which is only 16.67% female, barely over half of what they recommend for governing bodies. Additionally, of these 32 countries represented by women, only three, the [[United States]], [[Singapore]], and [[Luxembourg]], are considered core countries, making women-represented core countries only an even smaller percentage.

==Industry and business==
{{further|Women CEOs of the Fortune 500|Women in business|Gender representation on corporate boards of directors}}

Most top and high-power positions in businesses and companies are held by men{{where|date=May 2014}}.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;Daily, C. M., Certo, S. T., &amp; Dalton, D. R. (1999). Research notes and communications a decade of corporate women: Some progress in the boardroom, none in the executive suite. Strategic Management Journal, 20(1), 93-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Women currently hold 4.4 percent of Fortune 500 CEO roles and 4.4 percent of Fortune 1000 CEO roles.&lt;ref name=Catalyst&gt;"Women CEOs of the Fortune 1000". Catalyst. Retrieved 4 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown “a consistent difference favoring men in accessibility to, and utility of, resources for power”.&lt;ref name=Ragins&gt;Ragins, B. R., &amp; Sundstrom, E. (1989). Gender and power in organizations: A longitudinal perspective. Psychological bulletin, 105(1), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, business and industry worldwide still sees a harsh split between the genders in terms of who has control.&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;

However, having women in leadership positions can be in the company’s best interests. Studies have found that gender diversity in top-level boards means broader perspectives and opinions, which result in more comprehensive outcomes.&lt;ref name=EuropeanUnion&gt;European Union. European Commission. Women on Boards - Factsheet 1 The Economic Arguments. Web. 25 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/womenonboards/factsheet-general-1_en.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on firms in Denmark found that “the proportion of women in top management jobs tends to have positive effects on firm performance, even after controlling for numerous characteristics of the firm and direction of causality”.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, N., Smith, V., &amp; Verner, M. (2006). Do women in top management affect firm performance? A panel study of 2,500 Danish firms. International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 55(7), 569-593.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 2004 study from Bottom Line found that: “Companies with the highest representation of women on their top management teams experienced better financial performance than companies with the lowest women’s representation”.&lt;ref name="The Bottom Line"&gt;"The Bottom Line: Connecting Corporate Performance and Gender Diversity." Catalyst. Equity in Business Leadership, 15 Jan. 2004. Web. 25 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to try to achieve greater gender equality in workplace leadership positions, the European Union established a goal to have 40% women in non-executive board-member positions in publicly listed companies by 2020.&lt;ref name="Women on Boards"&gt;"Women on Boards: Commission Proposes 40% Objective." EUROPA. European Commission, 14 Nov. 2012. Web. 25 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, many pushed for pay equality for women. Unfortunately, this did not lead to greater employment of women in higher roles. New tactics need to be enacted in order to give employers incentives to hire more women, specifically for management and executive roles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Workforce Gender Diversity: It’s Not Happening|url = http://www.greatplacetowork.com/publications-and-events/blogs-and-news/2841-global-workforce-gender-diversity-its-not-happening#sthash.WlfdG0Ps.dpbs|website = www.greatplacetowork.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Women make up less than 5% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, hold less than 25% of management roles, and just less than 19% of board roles globally.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While CEOs of companies are working toward creating more female employees as leaders, the root of the problem is often not addressed. Discrepancies often occur between qualities of leaders and qualities of women as leaders. Once women are respected and given credibility in the workplace, they will have the ability to occupy higher positions. “A significant body of research shows that for women, the subtle gender bias that persists in organizations and in society disrupts the learning cycle at the heart of becoming a leader.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women Rising: The Unseen Barriers|url = https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this bias is rectified, women will be able to gain leadership positions in their companies and/or organizations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===The glass ceiling===
In the workplace, both in the public and private sector, the opportunities available to women are trumped by a [[glass ceiling]]. The glass ceiling is a phenomenon in which women in the workplace, climb the corporate ladder through with qualifications equal to those of their male counterparts only to find that they cannot proceed past a certain point due to  gender stereotypes and their implications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/reich/reports/ceiling2.pdf Dol.gov "A Solid Investment" Retrieved 20 October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; These gender stereotypes create barriers for women trying to reach positions of power which is responsible for creating and influencing the glass ceiling effect. The glass ceiling most directly affects those women who spend many years working in an industry to build up achievements and a status of credibility in order to be considered for positions of power within the company or industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/reich/reports/ceiling.pdf Dol.gov "Good for Business" Retrieved 20 October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet despite their competence, women are not offered top CEO positions because of their sex and existing stereotypes that say that women are not cut out to head such big responsibilities.  However, when these women's achievements are ignored and their success halted because of ignorant stereotypes, they are not the only ones affected. Many young women entering the workforce often look up to these driven women and aspire to achieve many of the same dreams. Yet when these young women witness their mentors and idols failing to achieve their dreams because of gender inequality, a culture begins to develop amongst women where they do not feel worthy of power and struggle with self empowerment.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2013/08/04/glass-ceiling-or-glass-cage-breaking-through-the-biggest-barrier-holding-women-back/ Forbes.com Retrieved 20 October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is an immense reason why a lot of women do not chase after positions of power because of a lack of self-worth brought on by gender stereotypes and inequalities.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

The glass ceiling is continuing to effect women today, but with forced attention on gender equality, women will be able to break through this invisible ceiling and effect change in the corporate world. While companies are shifting toward greater gender diversity in the workplace, it is still necessary to identify and rectify why women are not gaining leadership positions, even though equal pay for equal work exists. Evidence shows that organizations who play an active management role in diversity in the workplace have positive results. Active management in diversity has led to pay equity, more flexible schedules, and equal access to advancement opportunity. Using innovation in the workplace and installing unconventional programs has landed success in employing more women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Academia==
In academia as well, much remains to be accomplished in terms of gender equality. Many departments, especially those in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, are heavily male-dominated.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;Story, M. O. T., &amp; Academia, W. I. (2005). Women faculty make little progress. Education, 83(44), 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women achieve disproportionately less prestige and success in academia than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, S. M., &amp; Corcoran, M. (1986). Perspectives in the professional socialization of women faculty: A case of accumulative disadvantage?. Journal of Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt; They are less likely to be tenured and to receive promotions to more influential or powerful positions.&lt;ref name=Winkler&gt;Winkler, J. A. (2000). Focus Section: Women in Geography in the 21st Century: Faculty Reappointment, Tenure, and Promotion: Barriers for Women. The Professional Geographer, 52(4), 737-750.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in academia also earn a lower income, on average, than their male counterparts, even when adjusted.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt; While hiring of women in academic fields has been on a slight rise, it is mainly in entry-level occupations and not for high-level positions where women are most lacking.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; Integrating women more thoroughly into academia may be important to developing future gender equality as well as greater research outcomes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Highly disproportionate prestige and success outcomes in fields that are seen as being male-dominated may be a consequence of gender socialization that funnel women into specific fields, otherwise known as "care" fields, such as teaching.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Other possible explanations include "overt and subtle sex discrimination, differential interests and preferences for teaching rather than research, lack of sponsorship and collegial networks, and others suggesting accumulative disadvantage in the structure of the occupational career."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

According to the Pew Research Center, after extensive research, the key barrier for why women either are not advancing in their careers or are not being viewed as competitors for top positions in companies is because there are “many interruptions related to motherhood that may make it harder for women”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Women and Leadership|url = http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/01/14/women-and-leadership/|website = Pew Research Center|accessdate = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes provides scenarios that even if women have full-time jobs, they are still the one responsible for any family dilemmas rather than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Marks|first1 = Gene|title = Why Most Women Will Never Become CEO|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2011/10/31/why-most-women-will-never-become-ceo/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David White argues that men during the 1960s, as implemented in his study, “being the sole provider for the family gave men a significant amount of power in their homes and contributed to feelings of male superiority”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = White|first1 = David|title = Gender Roles in 1950s America|url = http://the-artifice.com/masculinity-gender-roles-tv-1950s/|website = Study.com|accessdate = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economics research states that culture can “transmit values and norms that last for centuries and even millennia” and they have “nothing to substantiate them except handed-down beliefs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Eswaran|first1 = Mukesh|title = Why We Think the Way We Do about Men, Women and Work|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/the-lasting-impact-of-the-plow-on-our-attitudes-about-gender-and-work/|website = PBS|accessdate = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research indicates that one reason women are not advancing in top positions in businesses is because of gender norms that have perpetuated into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Contemporary examples==

===Africa===
Most countries in Africa leave women without easy avenues to powerful positions in any area. However, there are some exceptions, such as Rwanda. Rwanda, with their new constitution after the conclusion of the Rwandan Civil War, it was written in that 30% of policy-making positions must be allocated to women.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt; In 2003 with the first election of the new constitution, Rwanda surpassed Sweden to be the country with the highest percentage of women in its parliament with 48.8%.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;

===Nordic countries===
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and other countries in Scandinavia have had long-established parliaments and have gone through a long, slow process of integrating women into power positions. As a result, Sweden is the country with the second highest rate of female participation in government, behind Rwanda.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;

===Middle East===
The Middle East is home to some of the most female-oppressive countries, such as Saudi Arabia where women are not allowed to vote{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. However, some countries, especially more liberal ones such as the United Arab Emirates, many women are making progress toward greater power{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.

===Latin America===
In terms of leadership ratios, Latin America is one of the most progressive regions in the world when it comes to electing women. One fourth of the legislators in Latin America are women; a higher ratio can only be found in Scandinavia. Latin America also has “more female heads of state than any other area of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=10 |edition=2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime example of integration of women into powerful positions in Latin America is Argentina, the first country in the world to adopt a quota system, requiring 15% female participation in the electoral system in 1990.[17]

The presence of women in Argentine government can also be attributed to the Peronist Feminist Party, instituted by Juan Perón and led by his wife Eva. Following the campaigns of this party, 90% of Argentine woman participated in the 1951 election, and seven women won positions in office. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=204 |edition=2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, women have not only been elected to small positions. The previous president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, is one example. She served as president from 2006 to 2010, and was re-elected in 2013. During that three-year intermission, she became the first executive director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. During her presidency, she has championed women’s health and other rights and instituted several reforms to address these issues. Her presidency marked a change in the politics of Chile, as well as Latin America as a whole. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=331 |edition=2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historical examples of female heads of state include Isabel Perón (Argentina, 1974-6), Violeta Chamorro (Nicaragua, 1990-7), Mireya Moscoso de Arias (Panama, 1999-2004), Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (Argentina, 2007-2015), Laura Chinchilla (Costa Rica, 2010-14), and Dilma Rousseff (Brazil, 2011-2016). Despite the high numbers of female politicians, little progress has been made on issues such as gender-based income inequality. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=11 |edition=2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
One of the highly significant things and provisions introduced by the new Companies Act of India, is the mandatory inclusion of at least one woman director to the Board of every prescribed class of companies in India. This provision can be considered as revolutionary initiation by the Government of India, for the purposes of empowerment of the women in the Indian Corporate world thereby strengthening and promoting contributions of women to the economic progress of the country.
