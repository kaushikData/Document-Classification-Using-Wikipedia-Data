'''1394 Algoa''', provisional designation {{mp|1936 LK}}, is a stony [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 14 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 12 June 1936, by English-born South-African astronomer [[Cyril Jackson (astronomer)|Cyril Jackson]] at [[Union Observatory]] in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;ref name="MPC-Algoa" /&gt; The asteroid was named after the historical [[Algoa Bay]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Algoa'' orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|inner]] main-belt at a distance of 2.3–2.6&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 3 years and 10 months (1,391 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.08 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 3[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Prior to its discovery observation in 1936, ''Algoa'' was identified as {{mp|1929 TT}} and {{mp|1933 UY|1}} at [[Lowell Observatory]] and [[Uccle Observatory]], respectively. These observations, however, remained unused to extend the body's [[observation arc]].&lt;ref name="MPC-Algoa" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

In 2012, two rotational [[lightcurve]]s of ''Algoa'' were obtained at the U.S. Etscorn Observatory, New Mexico, and at the Riverland Dingo Observatory, Australia. They gave a well-defined, concurring [[rotation period]] of 2.768 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 and 0.21 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]], respectively ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3-/3]]}}).&lt;ref name="Klinglesmith-2013a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hills-2012a" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for stony [[S-type asteroid]]s of 0.20, and calculates a diameter of 14.2 kilometers with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 11.6.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after the historical [[Algoa Bay]], located approximately 700 kilometers east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], South Africa.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] before November 1977 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 909}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
An '''agency of the European Union''' is a decentralised body of the [[European Union]] (EU), which is distinct from the [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]]. Agencies are established to accomplish specific tasks. Each agency has its own legal personality. Some answer the need to develop scientific or technical know-how in certain fields, others bring together different interest groups to facilitate dialogue at European and international level.

There are over 40 agencies, divided into 4 groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/agencies/index_en.htm|title=Agencies and other EU bodies - European Union - European Commission|first=|last=Anonymous|date=5 July 2016|website=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current agencies==
===Decentralised agencies===
Distinct from the EU institutions, the [https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/agencies/decentralised-agencies_en agencies] of the European Union are specialist bodies set up to advise the EU and Member States in areas that affect everyone living in the EU. They are located in countries across the EU, from Dublin to Helsinki, Tallinn to Lisbon providing services, information and know-how. The total budget of all the decentralised agencies is approximately 0.8% of the EU's annual [https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/c7cd29b7-3712-11e7-a08e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF budget].

Albania is located in [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] in the western section of the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. It borders on [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]] to the northeast, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to the east, [[Greece]] to the south and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the west. The coastline along the lake has a total length of {{convert|32|km}} and specifically marked by a mountainous landscape supplied with small [[bay]]s, [[sand|sandy coast]]s and a unique [[marine life]].

A claim is also made for the name of Richard Ameryk, sheriff of Bristol and patron of John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto), the 16c Anglo-Italian explorer of North America. The name ''America'' first appeared on a map in 1507 by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, referring to the area now called Brazil].

Cromwell Company|location= New York|year= 1963 |page= 157ff|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Old_Trails_West.html?id=hLElAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} On September 13, they encountered what is now called the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], a southward-flowing [[tributary]] of the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado]] and named it ''San Buenaventura'' after  the catholic saint [[Bonaventure]].

[[Image:Miera map 1778.jpg|thumb|300px|Map by Barnardo de Miera, 1778, depicting the Buenaventura River as a faulty combination of [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] and [[Sevier River]].  The depiction of "Lake Timpanogos" with a narrow strait in the middle is probably a misunderstanding of the indigenes description of the large lake to the north (the [[Great Salt Lake]]) as directly connected to Utah Lake rather than connected by the 50 mile long [[Jordan River (Utah)|Jordan River]].  "Laguna de Miera" is the [[Sevier Lake]], again drawn from descriptions by the indigenes.]]

At that point in time, there was nothing mythical about the Buenaventura River. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante' journal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/gateway/diario/diary.html |title=The Diary and Itinerary of Fathers Domínguez and Escalante -- English Translation |work=Early Americas Digital Archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928071254/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/gateway/diario/diary.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; correctly notes that above their crossing, the river flowed toward the west. It flowed generally southwest where they crossed it and continued southwest as they traveled in its vicinity. Escalante also correctly recorded that after its junction with the Rio San Clemente (today's White River? – which he also named) the Buenaventura River turned to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Escalante Journal, September 17&lt;/ref&gt; So, the original Buenaventura River is real and exists today under a different name.

The lake to the north, just west of the city of [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], is [[Utah Lake]].  The south tip of the Great Salt Lake can be seen at the top of the map.]]
After establishing contact with a branch of the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] (Yutahs) Tribe on the south shore of what they called [[Lake Timpanogos]] (various spellings), now called "[[Utah Lake]]," the expedition turned south-southwest. On September 29, they were surprised to come upon a river (the [[Sevier River]]) flowing from the south-southeast and turning toward the west at the point they encountered it. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante noted in their journal that the Native American name for this river suggested it was the same river they had named Buenaventura. They expressed doubts it was the same river because had it been so, it was substantially smaller downstream than it had been upstream-the opposite of the normal pattern. They named this river the Rio San Ysabel. The Native Americans told them it flowed west from there into a lake ([[Sevier Lake]]) and beyond.  The Sevier Lake has no outlet, the indigenes may have been referencing the west-flowing [[Humboldt River]] which originates over 150 miles northwest, and were misinterpreted by the explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Dale L. |title=Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NuoINGBjQIC |publisher=Bison Book University of Nebraska Books |location= Lincoln, London |origyear=1953|year=1964 |ISBN=0-8032-5138-6|edition=paperback|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante's doubts that the Green and Sevier Rivers were one and the same, the maps Miera produced do not include the Rio San Ysabel and depicts the Buenaventura flowing southwest from where they encountered it in northeastern Utah, to the Sevier Lake{{efn|Why Meira disregarded the evidence the two rivers were not the same is a mystery.

Although Miera documented a correct description of the GSL given to them by the indigenes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Francaviglia |first=Richard V.| title=Mapping and Imagination in the Great Basin: A Cartographic History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ExTf_VDTKiMC |year=2005| location=Reno |publisher=University of Nevada Press |page=37|isbn=0-87417-609-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish assumed that what they thought had been described was incorrect and interpreted their description of the "extremely salty" lake as the ocean&lt;ref name=Cline&gt;{{cite book|last=Cline |first=Gloria Griffen | title=Exploring the Great Basin|publisher=University of Nevada Press |location=Reno|date=1988|edition=paperback|origyear=1963|isbn=0-87417-134-2|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed the description of the river flowing from "Lake Timpanogos" which is the Jordan River flowing between Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, as a waterway to the Pacific.

The error of depicting the Buenaventura as flowing southwest to a lake was perpetuated by early explorers and cartographers such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who used a map from the Dominguez and Escalanté expedition to prepare his maps in 1804&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=von Humboldt|first=Alexander|website= Library of Congress| title=General chart of the kingdom of New Spain betn. parallels of 16 &amp; 380 N. from materials in Mexico at commencement of year of 1804 |date=1804|accessdate=December 26, 2015|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2001622416/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=von Humboldt |first=Alexander |title=Carte Generale Du Royaume De La Nouvelle Espagne |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~1866~170004 |date=1809|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Zebulon Pike]] used Humboldts maps to prepare his map for his book from 1810&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Pike |first=Zebulon Montgomery |title=Map of The Internal Provinces of New Spain |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~930~60171 |date=1810|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Arrowsmith]] in 1814 published a map depicting the Buenaventura flowing to "Lac Sale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arrowsmith|first=Aaron |website= Library of Congress| title=A map exhibiting all the new discoveries in the interior parts of North America. |date=1814|accessdate=December 26, 2015|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3300.ct001203//}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cartographers conservatively did not try to chart the area west of that explored by Dominguez and Escalante.

==Extending the Buenaventura West to the Pacific==

[[File:San Joaquin River watershed.png|thumb|Watershed map of the San Joaquin River, depicting its head in the Sierra Nevada]]
There had long been a hope that a river flowing west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean would provide an easy route for travel and trade. This dream was the descendant of the long sought Northwest Passage.{{efn|A map by [[Robert Sayer]] (1750?)&lt;ref&gt;http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3300.np000059&lt;/ref&gt; shows the Great River of the West flowing from Lake Winnipeg}}  When [[Francisco Garcés]] drew his maps of Alta California, he did not understand the nature of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and he drew the "San Felipe" or [[San Joaquin River]] heading (originating) beyond the Sierras in the [[Great Basin]] to the Pacific Ocean, in or near [[San Francisco Bay]]. Then, when Manuel Augustin Mascaro and Miguel Constanso made the first map of the whole [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]]  (1784), they extended the "San Felipe" almost to the Sevier Lake.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, op. cit. pp. 52-3&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar map was published in 1820 by [[Sidney Edwards Morse|Sidney E. Morse]] showing the Rio de San Buenaventura flowing into a lake, the western limits of which are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morse |first=Sidney Edward|title=United States|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~29366~1130411:United-States-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&amp;qvq=q:4494003;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1 |website=David Rumsey Maps|date=1820|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This map shows the "Supposed river between the Buenaventura and the Bay of Francisco, which will probably be the communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific" toward this lake, but quite not connecting with it.{{efn| By 1828, however, Morse was leaving the "supposed river" off his map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morse |first=Sidney Edward|title=United States|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~28288~1120297:United-States-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&amp;qvq=q:0627004;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1 |website=David Rumsey Maps|date=1828|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A map by J. Finlayson (1822) shows a Rio de S. Buenaventura originating near the "{{sic|Principle}} source of the Rio Colorado" and emptying into a salt lake the western limits of which "are unknown". This same map indicates that an uncharted Rio de San Filipe crosses a range of mountains at 122 degrees west longitude.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Other cartographers began to boldly assert that rivers flowed from Lake Timpanogos and "Lac Salado" to the Pacific Ocean.  [[Henry Schenck Tanner|Henry S. Tanner]]'s influential map of 1822 shows the Buenaventura River flowing from the north central Rockies through the Sevier Lake to the Pacific Ocean south of Monterey Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Tanner |first=Henry S. |title=North America...S.W.

Timpanogos), the other to [[Port Orford]], Oregon (the Los Mongos R.) where the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] enters the Pacific.  A similar map by Anthony Finley was published in 1826&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Finley |first=Anthony |title= Map of North America Including All The Recent Geographical Discoveries. 1826|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~2354~250001:Map-of-North-America-Including-All-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&amp;qvq=q:finley%2B1826;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=6&amp;trs=205 |date=1826|accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|By 1830, Finley had dropped the two northern rivers and just depicted the Buenaventura flowing from the "Salt Lake" (Sevier Lake)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Finley |first=Anthony |title=Mexico |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~490~60032 |date=1830|accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  A map by Thomas Bradford (1835) shows a river flowing to San Francisco Bay (mislabeled Sir Francis Drake) from the south end of Lake Timpanogos. There is no reference to Rio de San Buenaventura.   An 1844 map by James Bowden shows a landlocked Buenaventura wrapping around the southeast side of a "doubtful" Lake Timpanogos.

==Explorations to find the Buenaventura==

The Great Salt Lake (GSL) was first seen and reported as very saline by white North Americans in 1824, apparently independently by [[Jim Bridger]] and [[Etienne Provost]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, op. cit. pp. 182-83&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning of the GSL, explorers began equating Lake Timpanogos on the maps with it, and apparently unaware of the fact that [[Inland sea (geology)|saline lakes]] such as the Great Salt and Sevier Lakes have no outlets;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stegner|first=Wallace |title=Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-q4BPeGQ0jcC |publisher=Penguin |origyear=1982|date=March 1, 1992|isbn=1101075856 |page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; began efforts to find the rivers flowing from them west to the Pacific as promised by maps such as Tanner's.

In 1825, [[William Henry Ashley|William H. Ashley]] attempted to float the Green (Buenaventura) River to either what was called "Salt Lake" (actually Sevier Lake) on Tanner's map, or the [[Colorado River]], to which the fur traders suspected it flowed.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, op. cit. p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;  He started in present-day [[Wyoming]], and after passing through the treacherous [[Gates of Lodore]], aborted the trip prior to entering [[Desolation Canyon]].  Despite not having gotten close to the Colorado River, he concluded that the Green did empty into it, and continued his exploration by engaging Provost to lead him on an overland excursion to observe the GSL.  The next spring his partner, [[Jedediah Smith]], explored areas the north and west of the GSL, but found no rivers flowing from it.  He sent more men to float around the shoreline to the west and south, and they were also unsuccessful in finding the "Los Mongos R." and "R. Timpanogos". However, this information was delayed in reaching cartographers, and in 1836 Tanner repeated the depictions of the three rivers, except he identified the "R. Timpanogos" as "R. S. Sacramento ou (or) Timpanogos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Tanner |first=Henry S. |title=Mexico &amp; Guatemala |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~567~60205 |date=1836|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, when, in 1841, [[John Bidwell]] embarked over the Rocky Mountains to California, he was advised to take carpenters tools with them, to build canoes and sail from the GSL to the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bidwell |first=John|website=longcamp.com|editor=Bob Graham |url=http://www.longcamp.com/buenaventura.html |accessdate=November 10, 2008 |date=1890|title=Quotes from Frèmont et. al. on His Search for the Buenaventura}} from {{cite journal |journal=The Century; a popular quarterly|title=Gold Hunters of California.

After Ashley retired from the fur trade his partnership with Smith was bought out by Smith and two new partners, Smith focused on finding the Buenaventura.  In 1826, he led an expedition south from southern Idaho, and upon reaching the mouth of the Jordan River on the southeast end of the GSL, traveled south along to the east side of Utah Lake.  Since he identified the Jordan River as the outlet of Utah Lake, he did not explore the lake further.  He encountered the Sevier River on its northeast-flowing stretch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jedediah S.|last2=Rogers |first2=Harrison G. |editor=George R.

In the spring of 1827, Daniel Potts, a fur trader in the employ of Smith, encountered the Sevier River downstream from the point Smith had the previous summer.  He continued to follow the river downstream to the Sevier Lake, which he confirmed was a saline lake, but did not try to circumvent it to find an outlet.  He instead followed the entire course of the river upstream to its head.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, op. cit. pp. 226-27&lt;/ref&gt; {{efn|Although Potts was presumably at the 1827 [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|rendezvous]], with Smith, Smith was unaware of Potts' findings that the Sevier did not flow to Utah Lake when he wrote to [[William Clark]] on July 12, 1827, the day before he left to return to California.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, op. cit. p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1834 the widow of French cartographer A.

Brue published a map, apparently based on information from that letter which had been published in Europe, depicting the Sevier (Rio de Ashley) flowing to Utah Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Brue |first=Adrien Hubert |title=Nouvelle Carte du Mexique, Et D'Une Partie Des Provinces Unies De L'Amerique Centrale |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~226~20064:Nouvelle-Carte-du-Mexique,-Et-D-Une?sort=pub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_list_no_initialsort&amp;qvq=q:5386001;sort:pub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_list_no_initialsort;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1 |origyear=1834|date=1839|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Buenaventura River's existence or non-existence was a matter of controversy until 1843, when [[John Charles Frémont]], with Thomas Fitzpatrick and [[Kit Carson]] as scouts, led a perilous expedition from the [[Columbia River]] to [[Sacramento, California]] via the Sierra Nevada. By that time the fact that the Buenaventura River did not flow from the headwaters of the Colorado/Green River was well established among the trappers and guides, but maps continued to show it and other rivers flowing from the region of Great Salt Lake to the sea. On January 27, 1844 at [[Walker River (Nevada)|Walker River]], he briefly believed himself to have found the mythical river, but it was the result of a faulty measurement. Two days later he discovered his mistake and definitively proved that the Buenaventura did not exist.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longcamp.com/buenaventura.html Excerpts] from Frémont's journals. Accessed online 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon later finding the [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] flowed into the Pacific at about the same point the maps depicted the mouth of the Buenaventura, Frémont concluded that it was the source of the legend and applied the name "Rio San Buenaventura" to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frémont|first=John Charles |website= Library of Congress|title=Map of an exploring expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the year 1842 and to Oregon &amp; north California in the years 1843-44 |date=1845|accessdate=January 2, 2016|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/96688042/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frèmont |first=John Charles|website=longcamp.com|editor=Bob Graham |url=http://www.longcamp.com/buenaventura.html |accessdate= November 10, 2008 |date=1891|title=Quotes from Frèmont on His Search for the Buenaventura}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|As late as 1849,&lt;ref&gt;Hollingsworth's "Sketch of General Riley's Route"&lt;/ref&gt; the name "Buenaventura River" was applied to the Salinas River.}}

After Frémont established that no rivers flowed across the Great Basin region to the Pacific, [[James K. Polk|President Polk]] was reluctant to accept his conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Frémont, op, cit.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the premise was accepted that no east to west waterway flowed across the interior of the western United States, Frémont and his father-in-law and political sponsor, Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], directed their ambitions to a [[transcontinental railway]], which was completed in 1869, after the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–48 and the [[American Civil War]].

The '''Burgan field''' is an [[oil field]] situated in the desert of southeastern [[Kuwait]]. Burgan field can also refer to the '''Greater Burgan'''—a group of three closely spaced fields, which includes Burgan field itself as well as the much smaller Magwa and Ahmadi fields. Greater Burgan is the world's largest [[sandstone]] oil field, and the second largest overall, after [[Ghawar]]. The burgan Field is bordered by the Persian gulf which played a huge part in the creation of this prominent reservoir formation many million years ago.

==Discovery and geology==
A natural surface oil seep above the Burgan field was known to humankind since neolithic time, bituminous material from a reed boat discovered in As-Sabiyah/North Kuwait and dated 5000 BC have been traced back to this seep.[https://www.academia.edu/181354/A_comparative_geochemical_study_of_bituminous_boat_remains_from_H3_As-Sabiyah_Kuwait_and_RJ-2_Ras_al-Jinz_Oman_ (Connan et al., 2005)]
The subsurface reservoirs of the Burgan oil field were discovered in February, 1938. The US and UK-owned [[Kuwait Oil Company]] began commercial oil production at Burgan in 1946.&lt;ref name=Ma2009/&gt;

The Greater Burgan, a wider area around Burgan, is the world largest [[sandstone]] ([[clastic]]) oil field with the total surface area of about 1000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. To put that into perspective, that is about 11,000 football fields. It includes three producing subfields: Burgan itself (500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Magwa (180&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and Ahmadi (140&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Ma2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carman1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carman|first=George J.|title=Structural elements of onshore Kuwait|year=1996|journal=GeoArabia|volume=1|issue=2|pages=239–66|url=http://q8geologist.com/koko/StructuralElementsofOnshoreKuwait_small.pdf|format=pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912105311/http://q8geologist.com/koko/StructuralElementsofOnshoreKuwait_small.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burgan field's structure is an [[anticlinal dome]] having an elliptical shape and transected by numerous radial [[Normal fault|fault]]s.&lt;ref name=Croft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregcroft.com/burgan.ivnu|title=The Burgan Field of Kuwait|publisher=Greg Croft Inc.|date=undated, circa 1996|accessdate=31 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607233422/http://www.gregcroft.com/burgan.ivnu|archivedate=7 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Magwa and Ahmadi are located on smaller, subsidiary domes north of Burgan &lt;ref name= Sorkhabi&gt;[http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_Great_Burgan_Field_Kuwait/e3fdc547.aspx The Great Burgan Field, Kuwait] by Rasoul Sorkhabi,  GeoExpro Volume 9,  Issue 1,  2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil is contained in the four main horizons of [[Cretaceous]] age: Wara (sandstone), Mauddud (limestone), Burgan Third Sand (3S) and Burgan Fourth Sand (4S). Burgan Third Sand is in turn subdivided into Third Sand Upper (3SU), Third Sand Middle (3SM) and Third Sand Lower (3SL). Historically the production has come mainly from the 3SM unit. By 1992 the second and third sand units had been swept by water.&lt;ref name=Croft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ma2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ma|first=Eddie|last2=Sanwoolu|first2=Ayodele|last3=Abdy |first3=Yaser|last4=Al-Jadi|first4=Menayer|url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPE-125330-MS&amp;soc=SPE|title=Evaluation of Infill Drilling in the Third Sand Upper Reservoir, Greater Burgan Field, Kuwait|year=2009|doi=10.2118/125330-MS|journal=SPE/EAGE Reservoir Characterization and Simulation Conference, 19–21 October 2009, Abu Dhabi, UAE|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burgan Oil Field is made up of three main subsurface structures known as the Magwa, Ahmadi, And Burgan formation.The deeper reservoirs, namely the Lower Cretaceous Ratawi and Minagish limestones and the Jurassic Marrat Formation also contain significant oil reserves but are less substantial. The Magwa and Ahmadi formation are separated from the Burgan formation by a normal fault cutting horizontally down through the whole structure. This is known as the Burgan [[Graben]].&lt;ref name="Sorkhabi" /&gt; The role of tectonic stresses that have affected this region in Mesozoic and Cenozoic times also play a part in mcuh of the faultings seen in the formation. Looking closer at the Burgan field the formation is made up of several radial faults that help trap the petroleum content in the [[formation (geology)|formation]]. These faults and the Burgan graben are what cause the compartmentalization of the reservoir. This compartmentalization makes for great petroleum play and holds it in place well over a long period of time. The [[source rock]] that caps this formation is known as the Mauddad Limestone.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=R. L.|last2=Dashti|first2=H.|last3=Kabir|first3=C.

The Paleo environment of the Greater Burgan Field suggest the field began constructing in the lower and upper Burgan sand based on a fluvial system accommodated by transgressive coastline movements over time. Following the Burgan Formation, the Mauddud Limestone Formation (source Rock) began forming. The Mauddud formation is made up of shallow marine, [[bioclast]] [[wackestone]], [[grainstone]], and shoal surrounded by lagoonal dolomite. Lastly, the Wara formation is created by a fluvial system exposed to bio clastic dolomite known as the wara shales. These shales were formed during the falling RSL. Finishing the Wara formation the fluvial valleys are filled with [[tidal estuaries]] caused by [[transgression (geology)|transgressive]] and RSL high stand. The formation is capped off by the Ahmadi Cap rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/pdfz/documents/2012/20169filak/ndx_filak.pdf.html|title=View PDF|website=www.searchanddiscovery.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to find deeper oil plays have been made. In 1951 discovery of the Berriasian-age Minagish Oolite Limestone in Burgan was made along with the Jurassic carbonate at Magwa and both proved to be holding oil. However, production did not make way from these subsurface discoveries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Oil reserves, production capacity and estimated lifetime==
"The reserves and production data for Burgan are shrouded in a cloud of secrecy, uncertainty, and controversy." &lt;ref name= Sorkhabi/&gt;

Burgan's total potential production of recoverable oil has been estimated as between 66 and 75 billion barrels, plus perhaps 70 trillion cubic ft. of natural gas.&lt;ref name= Sorkhabi/&gt;[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] estimated remaining reserves of 55 billion barrels as of 2005.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;  Cumulative production through 1996 was estimated by a consulting firm at around 28 billion barrels of oil.&lt;ref name=Croft/&gt; &lt;!-- 55+28=83 bbo --a problem here, see talk. 1996 date is from sources cited in that report.--&gt;

Burgan's production capacity stood at {{convert|1700000|oilbbl/d}} in 2005. It was the fourth most productive oilfield worldwide in 2013, per 
Oil Patch Asia.&lt;ref name=T10/&gt; This was lower than it had been in the past—it reached as high as {{convert|2400000|oilbbl/d}} in 1972.&lt;ref name=Croft/&gt; The actual oil production from the field in 2005 was between 1,300,000 and 1,700,000&amp;nbsp;barrels per day. The International Energy Agency then predicted an output of {{convert|1640000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2020 and {{convert|1530000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2030. In 2005, the Kuwait Oil Co. estimated a remaining life of 30 to 40 years for Burgan, at a production rate of about 1.7 million barrels a day.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news

In 2010 the Chief Executive of the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] said that Burgan produced half of Kuwait’s oil.&lt;ref name= Sorkhabi/&gt;

The possibilities of deeper plays below the known Burgan oil &amp; gas resource appear to be under-explored.&lt;ref name= Sorkhabi/&gt;

In 1991, retreating Iraqi soldiers [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set Burgan Field on fire]] during the [[Gulf War|1st Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/landsat/news/40th-top10-kuwait.html|title=NASA - Landsat Top Ten - Kuwait Oil Fires|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke plumes from the Greater Burgan oil field extended 50 kilometers in width on any given day, and 2.5&amp;nbsp;km thick. From satellite observations the plume appeared like a black snake in the desert that extended parallel to the Persian Gulf. [[The Red Adair Service and Marine Company]] extinguished 117 of the burning well fires, while the Canadian company [[Safety Boss]] set the pace with 180 wells extinguished. Declassified 1991 [[CIA]] documents claimed that despite the destruction there was no significant depletion of the oil reserves and drop in production capacity at Burgan field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/declassdocs/cia/19960417/cia_70556_70555_01.html|title=Status of oil well fire control and reservoir pressures in kuwaiti oil fields|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|date=October 2001|accessdate=31 July 2012|journal=CITE CIA 925441|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204600/http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/declassdocs/cia/19960417/cia_70556_70555_01.html#|archive-date=2012-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three gathering stations were, however, too badly damaged to repair.

The 1st Marine Division destroyed 60 Iraqi tanks in a battle that took place near the Burgan oil field.&lt;ref&gt;Blitzkrieg in the Gulf: Armor of the 100 Hour war by Yves Debay

'''Bällstaån''' or '''Spångaån''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "Stream of Bällsta/Spånga") is a small [[stream]] in northern [[Stockholm]].  Flowing through the municipalities of [[Järfälla]], Stockholm, [[Sundbyberg]], and [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], it empties in the bay [[Bällstaviken]], the innermost part of [[Ulvsundasjön]].

Some 1,4&amp;nbsp;km of the stream is passing through culverts and long stretches of it have been straitened out to form part of the local stormwater system.  Notwithstanding, other sections are furnished with promenades and ponds and therefore considered as of local recreational interest.  The municipalities sharing the catchment area, together with the county administrative board, are collaborating to improve water quality and the areas surrounding the stream.&lt;ref name="Bällstaan"&gt;Bällstaån&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
Flowing from [[Viksjö]] in Järfälla, the stream starts as a ditch receiving considerable amounts of stormwater from the residential area [[Jakobsberg]].  After a bit more than 2&amp;nbsp;km, near [[Barkarby Airport]], it dives into a short culvert before merging with another ditch (''Veddsta dike'') bringing water from a golf range, industrial and residential areas.  It then passes under the traffic route [[European route E18|E18]] to continue 1&amp;nbsp;km through am open grassland in it natural meandering shape past some [[allotment (gardening)|allotment-gardens]] near [[Tensta]] before reaching the ponds in the park of [[Hjulsta]].  The stream is guided under the central commercial district of Spånga through a tunnel 1.4&amp;nbsp;km long, opening out near [[Bromsten]] industrial area, and receiving stormwater from surrounding areas.  It then flows past the residential neighbourhood [[Bällsta]] before reaching two ponds in a park and receiving water from a second ditch (Nälsta dike) bringing water from residential areas at [[Nälsta]], [[Flysta]], and [[Solhem]].  It then flows through the [[harness racing]] track [[Solvalla]] where the water is used for fountains during races.  Downstream Solvalla, it becomes broad with a slow flow occasionally becoming stagnant.  Bällstaån finally receives water from [[Rissne]], [[Duvbo]], and [[Sundbyberg]] before emptying into Bällstaviken under the bridge [[Löfströmsbron]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-29.3"&gt;Vattenprogram, 29.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
[[Image:Bällstaviken 070611.JPG|thumb|Bällstaviken.]]
As most of the inflow comes from settled grounds, including industrial areas and streets, the stream contains high levels of nutrients, metals and bacteria, with sediments contaminated with oil.&lt;ref name="Bällstaan" /&gt;  The river receives 1400 kg/year of [[phosphorus]] and 16000 kg/year of [[nitrogen]].  Increased levels of pollutants and bacteria downstream Spånga is believed to stem from stormwater pipes but no source have been identified.  Increased levels of metals, particularly copper, has been reported, and minor oil discharges are rather common with negative impact on local bird life.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-29.3" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
No inventory of [[aquatic plant]]s has been made, but [[greater dodder]] has been documented around the Lunda Industrial Area.  No rare species of bottom fauna were found during an inventory in 1999, the stream being quantitatively dominated by a few species.  Noteworthy is the gastropod ''[[Valvatidae|Valvata piscinalis]]'' found near the residential area Bällsta.  The stream is, nonetheless, important for various birds, including [[black-headed gull]], [[common gull]], [[lesser black-backed gull]], [[European herring gull|herring gull]], and [[Slavonian grebe]] reported at Hjulsta Water Park.  As stretches of the watercourse remain ice-free during winters, it attracts [[duck]]s and [[common teal|teal]], which have both been spending winters here.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-29.5"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 29.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Discharge pipe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wastewater]] discharge]]
'''Effluent''' is an outflowing of water or gas to a natural body of water, from a structure such as a [[wastewater treatment plant]], [[Sewerage|sewer pipe]], or industrial outfall. Effluent, in engineering, is the stream exiting a [[chemical reactor]].&lt;ref&gt; Scott Fogler, ''Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering'', page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Effluent is defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] as "''wastewater - treated or untreated - that flows out of a treatment plant, sewer, or industrial outfall. Generally refers to wastes discharged into surface waters''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/OCEPAterms/eterms.html |title=Terms of Environment Beginning With "E"    |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-06-09 |date=2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Compact Oxford English Dictionary defines effluent as "''liquid waste or sewage discharged into a river or the sea''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/effluent?view=uk |title=AskOxford: effluent |work=Ask Oxford.com |publisher=Oxford University Press, |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effluent in the artificial sense is in general considered to be [[water pollution]], such as the outflow from a [[sewage treatment]] facility or the [[wastewater]] discharge from industrial facilities. An effluent [[sump pump]], for instance, pumps waste from toilets installed below a main sewage line. Similar to wastewater produced in different establishments, industries, and facilities. These wastewater released can also accumulate and pollute the nearby communities and bodies of water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canencia|first=Oliva P|last2=Dalugdug|first2=Marlou D|last3=Emano|first3=Athena Marie|last4=Mendoza|first4=Richard|last5=Walag|first5=Angelo Mark P.|date=2016-08-31|title=Slaughter waste effluents and river catchment watershed contamination in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307931158_Slaughter_waste_effluents_and_river_catchment_watershed_contamination_in_Cagayan_de_Oro_City_Philippines | journal=ResearchGate | volume=9 | issue=2 | issn=2220-6663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[waste water treatment plants]], effluent that has been treated is sometimes called ''secondary effluent'', or ''treated effluent''.  This cleaner effluent is then used to feed the [[bacteria]] in [[biofilters]].

In the context of a [[thermal power station]], the output of the cooling system may be referred to as the effluent cooling water, which is noticeably warmer than the environment.  Effluent only refers to liquid discharge.  

In [[sugar beet]] processing, effluent is often settled in water tanks that allow the mud-contaminated water to settle. The mud sinks to the bottom, leaving the top section of water clear, free to be pumped back into the river or be reused in the process again.

The '''Estonian Land Board''' ({{lang-et|Maa-amet}}) is an official body, dealing with [[cartography]] and [[cadastre]] issues in [[Estonia]]. It is subordinated the [[Estonian Ministry of the Environment|Ministry of the Environment]].
The Land Board is a government agency that participates actively in the development and implementation of national land policy and provides the society with up-to-date land-related information. 
The Land Board’s vision is to guarantee the availability and fitness for use of the up-to-date national land information and an efficient management of state assets. 

The '''Land Board''' was founded on January 16,1990. Its name at that time was the Estonian National Land Board and it started its work under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture. Since June 3, 1991 the Land Board has been operating under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Environment. 

The '''Land Board''' was established with the objective to ensure a more efficient management and use of land, organise geodetic and cartographic activities, establish the land cadastre, organise land assessment and supervise the enforcement of land tax, issue licences for land readjustment activities, solve land disputes, etc.
 
'''With years the implementation of national land policy and provision of spatial data have become the Land Board’s main fields of activities, which in their turn can be subdivided into four:'''

• Implementation of national land policy (execution of land reform, administration of state-owned lands, acquisition of immovable properties the use of which is restricted due to nature conservation requirements, protection of state interests in planning processes) 

• Maintenance of land cadastre (management of cadastral data and guaranteeing their availability to the public, organising land surveying and control of surveying quality, organising land assessment) 

• Geoinformatics (management of spatial data, provision of spatial data services and coordination of geoinformation related activities) 

• Capture and management of geodetic, geological and topographic data (organising the establishment of geodetic networks, organising geological mapping, mapping of the Estonian territory, providing national topographic data and maps to the society)
 
==Organization==
Director General is '''Tambet Tiits'''. Deputy Directors General are '''Anne Toom''' and '''Artu Ellmann'''. &lt;ref name="peadirektor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personnel|url=http://www.maaamet.ee/index.php?lang_id=2&amp;page_id=206&amp;menu_id=51|publisher=Estonian Land Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Navigation Grid Code''' (GNGC) is a Chinese-developed point reference system designed for global [[navigation]]. It is similar in design to national grid reference systems used throughout the world. GNGC was based upon the work of the GeoSOT team, headquartered in the Institute of Remote Sensing and GIS, [[Peking University]]. The concept for this system was proposed in 2015 in Bin Li's dissertation: ''Navigation Computing Model of Global Navigation Grid Code''.&lt;ref&gt;Bin Li.Navigation Computing Model of Global Navigation Grid Code[D].Peking University，2015.&lt;/ref&gt; GNGC allows easy calculation of space and spatial indexes and can be extended to the provide navigation mesh coding. Along with the [[Beidou navigation system]], GNGC provides independent intellectual property rights, globally applicable  standards and global navigation trellis code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xyz3d.net/col.jsp?id=108|title=北京昊云科技有限公司|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From 2009-2013 a research team (the Institute of Remote Sensing and GIS School of Earth and Space Science located at Peking University), in conjunction with [[Wuhan University]], Information Engineering University, [[Chinese University of Science and Technology]], National University of Defense Technology, completed the National 973 Project: "Global Spatial Information Subdivision Theory and Application Method". As a result of this effort, the team proposed a global subdivision grid frame: Geographic Coordinate Subdivision Grid With One Dimension Integer Coding on 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; Tree (GeoSOT). This work solved the three scientific problems with regards to spatial data organization : basic frame, location code and presentation model.

This work resulted in 28 patent applications. The results of the project were published in a work entitled:  ''Introduction to Spatial Information Subdivision''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/8295845.htm|title=空间信息剖分组织导论|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Design ==
GeoSOT, is a grid system that originates from a center point on earth and climbs to another point at 50,000&amp;nbsp;km altitude. It subdivides the earth according to 32 levels into millions of grids 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size. The team proposed a complete area location coding system called "1+4 basic code, N serial extended codes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/research-news/3636|title=工学院程承旗实验室973计划项目“全球空天信息剖分组织机理及其应用方法研究”结题验收 - 科研新闻 - 北京大学工学院|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above these codes, the global subdivision grid code is a basic one and it has been completed.

GNGC is part of research on Global Sub-division Grid (GSG, or global discrete grid, geographic grid or spatial information grid). It subdivides the earth's surface into small cells. The research of GSG covers the methods of how to subdivide the earth into cells of equal size and shape at different levels. GSG improves the proficiency of the spatial information presentation and data organization. GSG is one of the key methods in geo-information science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.sohu.com/20160420/n445218069.shtml|title=李博士谈网格之地理网格的概念|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Main applications include geographic spatial data fusion, multi-source data fusion and geo-science comprehensive analysis.

It can mark location and position elements on a grid. The truing number coding design can simplify location area identification, expression and calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.point3d.net/nd.jsp?id=65&amp;_np=4_11|title=中国推出面向全球导航应用的新网格编码GNGC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4098">'''Henricus Hondius II''' or '''Hendrik Hondius the Younger''' (1597 – 16 August 1651) was a Dutch [[engraver]], [[cartographer]] and publisher.

He was born in [[Amsterdam]], the son of the famous cartographer [[Jodocus Hondius]] who had started a map-making business in the city. Henricus obtained the original plates of the [[Mercator 1569 world map]], and published a 1606 version of it. After his father died in 1612 Henricus co-ran the business with his brother-in-law.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11337/ |title = Venezuela with the Southern Part of New Andalusia |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1612–1699 |accessdate = 2013-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1621 opened his own company in his hometown. The first time his name was mentioned in an atlas was in 1623 when he published the fifth edition of the Mercator-Hondius atlas. After 1628 Henricus partnered with the cartographer [[Jan Janssonius]] and together they continued the business. He died in Amsterdam.

He came from a different family from [[Hendrik Hondius I]]; there were two families engaged in very similar activities at the same time.

[[File:Invar-Graph-CTE-composition.svg|thumb|350px|right|The coefficient of thermal expansion of nickel/iron alloys is plotted here against the nickel percentage (on a mass basis) in the alloy. The sharp minimum occurs at the Invar ratio of 36% Ni.]]

'''Invar''', also known generically as '''FeNi36''' ('''64FeNi''' in the US), is a [[nickel]]–[[iron]] [[alloy]] notable for its uniquely low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (CTE or α). The name ''Invar'' comes from the word ''invariable'', referring to its relative lack of expansion or contraction with temperature changes.&lt;ref name="alloying"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Joseph R. | title = Alloying: Understanding the Basics | publisher = ASM International | pages = 587–589| isbn = 0-87170-744-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was invented in 1896 by Swiss physicist [[Charles Édouard Guillaume]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1920 for this discovery, which enabled improvements in scientific instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1920 |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1920/ |work=nobelprize.org |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=20 March 2011 |quote=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1920 was awarded to Charles Edouard Guillaume ''"in recognition of the service he has rendered to precision measurements in Physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys"''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
[[File:Invar 800.jpg|thumb|Samples of Invar]]

Like other nickel/iron compositions, Invar is a [[solid solution]]; that is, it is a single-[[Phase (matter)|phase]] [[alloy]], consisting of around 36% nickel and 64% iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vdm-metals.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Downloads/Data_Sheets/Data_Sheet_VDM_Alloy_36.pdf|title=Material Data Sheet Alloy 36|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common grades of Invar have a coefficient of thermal expansion (denoted &lt;var&gt;α&lt;/var&gt;, and measured between 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 100&amp;nbsp;°C) of about 1.2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1.2&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]/°C), while ordinary steels have values of around 11–15 ppm.  Extra-pure grades (&lt;0.1% [[Cobalt|Co]]) can readily produce values as low as 0.62–0.65&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C. Some formulations display [[negative thermal expansion]] (NTE) characteristics. Though it displays high dimensional stability over a range of temperatures, it does have a propensity to [[creep (deformation)|creep]].

== Applications ==
Invar is used where high dimensional stability is required, such as precision instruments, clocks, seismic creep gauges, television [[Shadow mask|shadow-mask]] frames,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nickel &amp; Its Uses |publisher=Nickel Institute |work=Nickel Magazine |date=3 May 2005 |url=http://www.nickelinstitute.org/index.cfm/ci_id/12313.htm |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219005643/http://www.nickelinstitute.org/index.cfm/ci_id/12313.htm |archivedate=19 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; valves in engines, [[antimagnetic watch]]es, and large aerostructure molds. 

In [[Surveying|land surveying]], when first-order (high-precision) elevation [[leveling]] is to be performed, the [[level staff]] (leveling rod) used is made of Invar, instead of wood, fiberglass, or other metals.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Invar struts were used in some pistons to limit their thermal expansion inside their cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Internal combustion engines illustrated|year=1947|publisher=Odhams Press Limited|location=Long Acre, London|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the manufacture of large [[composite material]] structures for [[aerospace]] [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]] [[layup mold]]s, invar is used to facilitate the manufacture of parts to extremely tight tolerances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aero-mag.com/tooling-mould-die/ Tooling to mould and die for!], Mike Richardson, Aerospace Manufacturing, 6 April 2018, accessed 10 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
There are variations of the original Invar material that have slightly different coefficient of thermal expansion such as:
*'''Inovco''', which is Fe–33Ni–4.5Co and has an &lt;var&gt;α&lt;/var&gt; of 0.55&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C (from 20–100&amp;nbsp;°C).
*'''FeNi42''' (for example NILO alloy 42), which has a nickel content of 42% and {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;α&lt;/var&gt; ≈ 5.3&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C}}, is widely used as lead frame material for electronic components, integrated circuits, etc.
*FeNiCo alloys—named [[Kovar]] or Dilver P—that have the same expansion behaviour as [[borosilicate glass]], and because of that are used for optical parts in a wide range of temperatures and applications, such as [[satellite]]s.

== Explanation of anomalous properties ==
A detailed explanation of Invar's anomalously low CTE has proven elusive for physicists.

All the iron-rich face-centered cubic Fe–Ni alloys show Invar anomalies in their measured thermal and magnetic properties that evolve continuously in intensity with varying alloy composition. Scientists had once proposed that Invar's behavior was a direct consequence of a high-magnetic-moment to low-magnetic-moment transition occurring in the face centered cubic Fe–Ni series (and that gives rise to the mineral [[antitaenite]]); however, this theory was  proven incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K. Lagarec |author2=D.G. Rancourt |author3=S.K. Bose |author4=B. Sanyal |author5=R.A. Dunlap |url=http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~dunlap/index_files/index_files/journal/c210_lagarec.pdf |title=Observation of a composition-controlled high-moment/low-moment transition in the face centered cubic Fe–Ni system: Invar effect is an expansion, not a contraction |journal=Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials |volume=236 |year=2001 |pages=107–130 |doi=10.1016/S0304-8853(01)00449-8 |bibcode=2001JMMM..236..107L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425145000/http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~dunlap/index_files/index_files/journal/c210_lagarec.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it appears that the low-moment/high-moment transition is preceded by a high-magnetic-moment [[Geometrically frustrated magnet|frustrated ferromagnetic state]] in which the Fe–Fe magnetic exchange bonds have a large magneto-volume effect of the right sign and magnitude to create the observed thermal expansion anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D.G.

A '''keyhole garden''' is a 2 meter wide circular raised garden with a keyhole-shaped indentation on one side. The indentation allows gardeners to add uncooked vegetable scraps, [[greywater]], and manure into a [[compost]]ing basket that sits in the center of the bed. In this way, composting materials can be added to the basket throughout the growing season to provide nutrients for the plants. The upper layer of soil is hilled up against the center basket so the soil slopes gently down from the center to the sides. Most keyhole gardens rise about one meter above the ground and have walls made of stone. The stone wall not only gives the garden its form, but helps trap moisture within the bed. Keyhole gardens originated in [[Lesotho]] and are well adapted to dry [[arid]] lands and deserts.  In Africa they are positioned close to the kitchen and used to raise [[leafy greens]] such as lettuce, kale, and spinach; herbs; and [[root crop]]s such as onions, garlic, carrots, and beets. Keyhole gardens are ideal for intensive planting, a technique in which plants are placed close together to maximize production. Plants with wide reaching root systems such as tomatoes and zucchini may not perform well in a keyhole garden.
[[File:St Ann's Community Orchard African keyhole bed 1304.JPG|thumb|left|A keyhole garden at St Ann's Community Orchard, [[Nottingham]]]]
The keyhole garden was developed in Lesotho by the Consortium for Southern Africa Food Security Emergency (C-SAFE), based upon a design that originated with [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] in [[Zimbabwe]]. In the mid-1990s Lesotho had one of the highest AIDS/HIV rates in the world. C-SAFE designed the keyhole garden for people who suffered from AIDS or were otherwise unable to tend a traditional garden.  They are tall enough that people don’t have to bend over while working in them; sturdy enough that a person who is weak can lean against them while they work; and are small enough that the entire bed is within arm’s reach. The garden is constructed using layers of compost, manure, wood ash and other nutrient rich materials so they are more productive than most home gardens; and they hold water making them [[drought]] resistant. The walls can be made of common stones picked up from a field, cinderblocks, bricks, or any material strong enough to hold in the soil. Clean water is used when watering the plants on the surface, while household greywater is poured down into the compost basket.
 
While they are designed for people who were too sick to tend a traditional garden, because they were so productive, people in good health started building them as [[kitchen garden]]s. Here the family could grow its high value crops using [[succession planting]].  In the end C-SAFE helped build over 20,000 keyhole gardens, and when they returned a couple of years later, more than 90% were still in use. Today keyhole gardens are found in many places throughout Africa, including Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya, Sudan, and Nigeria.

African style keyhole gardens have been built in Texas and other places in the US. The Texas [[Master Gardeners]] Association has put on several workshops to promote them. They have modified the basic design, having standardized on a 6-foot wide bed with a 12-inch tube made of rabbit fencing or chicken wire for the compost basket. It is common in Texas to add [[Eisenia fetida|red-wiggler worms]] to the compost basket to help break down the organic matter.

The term "keyhole garden" is also used in [[permaculture]] to describe a garden bed that has been laid out with one or more paths that dead-end rather than continuing through, in order to reduce the area of paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gaia's Garden|last=Hemenway|first=Toby|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1603580298|location=White River Junction, Vermont, USA|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.interdependentweb.com/content/rethinking-mandala-gardens|title=Rethinking circular keyhole beds and mandala gardens|last=Stallings|first=Ben|date=2016-12-14|website=Interdependent Web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110222533/https://www.interdependentweb.com/content/rethinking-mandala-gardens|archive-date=2018-11-10|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture keyhole gardens tend to be wider and flatter than the African variety and do not generally incorporate a compost basket or compost pile built into the bed. The tall beds that incorporate compost are referred to as "banana circles" by permaculturalists.

{{Main article|19th SAARC summit}}
[[Pakistan]] scheduled to host the 19th summit of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Islamabad on 15 to 16 November 2016.
India including Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives did not attend SAARC SUMMIT due to [[2016 Uri attack]]. Pakistan postponed the SAARC summit and announced that new dates would be released soon,but it did not happen.

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his address to the 19th SAARC summit being held in the Pakistan’s capital,&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/26-Nov-2014/pakistan-to-host-19th-saarc-summit-in-islamabad |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224412/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/26-Nov-2014/pakistan-to-host-19th-saarc-summit-in-islamabad |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the objective of this summit was to address the security issues between India and Pakistan. Hours after Indian PM [[Narendra Modi]] decided to boycott the SAARC Summit in Islamabad in the wake of Uri terror attack Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka have pulled out of the summit.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2016/10/FEATURED-Will-SAARC-Reincarnate-002-10-2016-0028.html|title=FEATURED {{!}} Will SAARC Reincarnate?|last=Mishra|first=Sitakanta|authorlink=Sitakanta Mishra|date=|website=|publisher=IndraStra Global|doi=10.6084/m9.figshare.4029486|issn=2381-3652|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sources, Bangladesh believes that growing interference in internal affairs of Bangladesh by one country has created environment not conducive to successful hosting of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad in November 2016. Reportedly, Bangladesh said that it remains steadfast in its commitment to regional co-operation but believes these can only go forward in more congenial atmosphere.

Afghanistan stated that "Due to increased level of violence, fighting as a result of imposed terrorism on Afghanistan, President of Afghanistan with his responsibilities as Commander in Chief will be engaged and will not be able to attend the SAARC Summit."

Also, Bhutan has expressed concern over recent escalation of terrorism in the region, which seriously compromises environment for successful holding of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad in Nov 2016, sources added. Bhutan has shared concerns of some of SAARC countries on deterioration of regional peace and security due to terrorism.

Sri Lanka decided to pull out of SAARC Summit, becoming the fifth country to pull out, citing the non-conductive situation in Islamabad. The island nation on September 30, 2016, said in a statement, "Sri Lanka condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stresses in this regard, the need to deal with the issue of terrorism in the region in a decisive manner".

Maldives on 1 October 2016 joined hands with other five nations and boycott the summit to become sixth nation to do so.

India alleged Pakistan for terrorism.
It is reported by Indian media that the SAARC summit in Pakistan is cancelled due to pulling out of six SAARC member states citing "poor conducive atmosphere" in the South Asian region.

Nepal is only country that have not pulled out of SAARC Summit 2016. Nepal cannot pull out of SAARC summit due to present chairperson is from Nepal.

Nepal, the current chair of SAARC, urged that "a conducive environment be created soon to ensure the participation of all member states in the 19th SAARC summit in line with the spirit of the SAARC charter".

This article lists the main components of a [[petroleum]] onshore [[drilling rig]].  

[[Offshore drilling]] rigs have similar elements, but are configured with a number of different drilling systems to suit drilling in the marine environment.

The equipment associated with a rig is to some extent dependent on the type of rig but typically includes at least some of the items listed below.

==Explanation==
*[[Bell nipple]] (#22) is a section of large diameter pipe fitted to the top of the [[blowout preventer]]s that the [[flow line]] attaches to via a side outlet, to allow the [[drilling mud]] to flow back to the [[mud tank]]s.
*[[Blowout preventer]]s (BOPs) (#23 and #24) are devices installed at the wellhead to prevent fluids and gases from unintentionally escaping from the [[wellbore]]. #23 is the [[annular (oil well)|annular]] (often referred to as ''Hydril'' named after a manufacturer), and #24 is the [[pipe rams]] and [[blind rams]].
*[[Casing head]] (#27) is a large metal [[flange]] welded or screwed onto the top of the [[conductor pipe]] (also known as ''drive-pipe'') or the [[casing (borehole)|casing]] and is used to bolt the surface equipment such as the [[blowout preventer]]s (for well drilling) or the [[Christmas tree (oil well)]] (for well production).
*[[Centrifuge]] (not pictured) is an industrial version of the device that separates fine silt and sand from the drilling fluid. It is typically mounted on top or just off of the mud tanks.
*[[Crown block]] (#13) is the stationary end of the ''block and tackle''.
*[[Degasser]] (not pictured) is a device that separates air and/or gas from the drilling fluid. It is typically mounted on top of the mud tanks.
*[[Derrick]] (#14) is the support structure for the equipment used to lower and raise the [[drill string]] into and out of the [[wellbore]].  This consists of the sub-structure (structure below the drill floor level) and the mast.
*[[Desander]] / [[desilter]] (not pictured) contains a set of [[hydrocyclone]]s that separate sand and silt from the drilling fluid. Typically mounted on top of the mud tanks.
*[[Draw-works]] (#7) is the mechanical section that contains the spool, whose main function is to reel in/out the drill line to raise/lower the [[traveling block]].
*[[Drill bit (well)|Drill bit]] (#26) is a device attached to the end of the drill string that breaks apart the rock being drilled. It contains jets through which the drilling fluid exits.
*[[Drill floor]] (#21) is the area on the rig where the tools are located to make the connections of the drill pipe, bottom hole assembly, tools and bit. It is considered the main area where work is performed.
*[[Drill line]] (#12) is thick, stranded metal cable threaded through the two blocks (traveling and crown) to raise and lower the drill string.
*[[Drill pipe]] (#16) is a joint of hollow tubing used to connect the surface equipment to the [[bottom hole assembly]] (BHA) and acts as a conduit for the drilling fluid. In the diagram, these are ''[[stand (drill pipe)|stands]]'' of drill pipe which are 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe connected and ''stood'' in the derrick vertically, usually to save time while [[tripping pipe]].
*[[Drill string]] (#25) is an assembled collection of drill pipe, heavy weight drill pipe, drill collars and any of a whole assortment of tools, connected and run into the [[wellbore]] to facilitate the drilling of a well. The collection is referred to singularly as the drill string.
*[[Elevators (drilling rig)|Elevators]] (not pictured) are hinged devices that is used to latch to the drill pipe or [[casing (borehole)|casing]] to facilitate the lowering or lifting (of pipe or casing) into or out of the [[wellbore]].
*[[Flow line]] (#28) is large diameter pipe that is attached to the [[bell nipple]] and extends to the [[shale shakers]] to facilitate the flow of drilling fluid back to the mud tanks.
*[[Goose-neck (drilling rig)|Goose-neck]] (#10) is a thick metal elbow connected to the [[swivel]] and [[Drilling rig|standpipe]] that supports the weight of and provides a downward angle for the kelly hose to hang from.
*[[Kelly drive]] (#19) is a square, hexagonal or octagonal shaped tubing that is inserted through and is an integral part of the [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary table]] that moves freely vertically while the rotary table turns it.
*[[Kelly hose]] (#9) is a flexible, high pressure hose that connects the [[Rig standpipe|standpipe]] to the kelly (or more specifically to the gooseneck on the swivel above the kelly) and allows free vertical movement of the kelly, while facilitating the flow of the [[drilling fluid]] through the system and down the drill string.
*[[Racking board]] (#15) is the catwalk along the side of the derrick (usually about 35 or 40 feet above the "floor"). The monkey board is where the derrick man works while "tripping" pipe.
*[[Mud motor]] (not pictured) is a hydraulically powered device positioned just above the [[Drilling bit#Well drilling bits|drill bit]] used to spin the bit independently from the rest of the drill string.
*[[Mud pump]] (#4) is a reciprocal type of pump used to circulate drilling fluid through the system.
*[[Mud tank]] (#1) is often called mud pits and stores drilling fluid until it is required down the wellbore.
*[[Setback (drill floor)|Setback]] (#17) is a part of the [[drill floor]] (#21) where the stands of drill pipe are stood upright. It is typically made of a metal frame structure with large wooden beams situated within it. The wood helps to protect the end of the drill pipe.
*[[Rotary table (drilling rig)|Rotary table]] (#20) rotates, along with its constituent parts, the kelly and [[kelly bushing]], the drill string and the attached tools and bit.
*[[Shale shaker]] (#2) separates [[drill cuttings]] from the drilling fluid before it is pumped back down the [[wellbore]].
*[[Stand (drill pipe)|Stand]] (#16) is a section of 2 or 3 joints of [[drill pipe]] connected and ''stood'' upright in the [[derrick]]. When they are pulled out of the hole, instead of laying down each joint of drill pipe, 2 or 3 joints are left connected and stood in the derrick to save time.
*[[Standpipe (drilling rig)|Standpipe]] (#8) is a thick metal tubing, situated vertically along the derrick, that facilitates the flow of drilling fluid and has attached to it and supports one end of the kelly hose.
*Suction line (#3) is an intake line for the mud pump to draw drilling fluid from the mud tanks.
*[[Swivel (drill rig)|Swivel]] (#18) is the top end of the kelly that allows the rotation of the drill string without twisting the block.
*[[Traveling block]] (#11) is the moving end of the ''block and tackle''. Together, they give a significant mechanical advantage for lifting.
*[[Vibrating hose]] (#6) is a flexible, high pressure hose (similar to the ''kelly hose'') that connects the mud pump to the ''stand pipe''. It is called the ''vibrating hose'' because it tends to vibrate and shake (sometimes violently) due to its close proximity to the mud pumps.

The following is a '''list of place names in Poland of German origin''', sorted by [[Polish voivodeship]]. 

Many current and historical regions of Poland has throughout history been substantially, or primarily, under a strong German influence or population. The [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the subsequent [[German Empire]], was made out of several areas that today is part of the modern nation state of Poland. Several areas with a primarily Polish population belonging to Germany was lost after the [[First World War]], and several areas of primarily German population was lost after the [[Second World War]]. Some of these areas had been under continuing, or intermittent, German control for several centuries, with some having traditionally been inhabited by [[Germans|German]] (or [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]) peoples.

In the wake of the [[Potsdam Conference]], and the annexation, transfer and ethnic cleansing of the [[former eastern territories of Germany]], the [[Commission for the Determination of Place Names]] was charged with determining names in the newly acquired territories, often either by means of [[Polonization|polonizing]] or renaming. 

As a result of the areas' rich history, several place names in what is Poland today has a German origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1716">{{Politics of Guadeloupe}}

[[Guadeloupe]] is not a separate territory but a region of [[France]]. France has a [[multi-party]] system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.


For further details see the article: ''[[Politics of France]]''.

==The parties==
&lt;!--:''The general rule on naming applies. That means: the parties are named in the English translation and the original native name is placed on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the English form. Rationale and specifics: See: [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]]''.--&gt;

Most of the [[List of political parties in France|French political parties]] are active in Guadeloupe.

In addition there are a number of regional parties:

*[[Guadeloupe Communist Party]] (''Parti Communiste Guadeloupéen'', PCG)
*[[Progressive Democratic Party of Guadeloupe]]
*[[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Guadeloupe]] (''Union Populaire pour la Libération de la Guadeloupe'', UPLG)
*[[Guadeloupean Objective]] (''Objectif Guadeloupéen'')
*[[Pluralist Left]] (''Gauche Pluriel'')
*[[United Guadaloupe, Socialism and Realities]]

{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}

The following is a list providing an overview of [[sovereign state]]s around the world, with information on their status and recognition of their [[sovereignty]].

Membership within the [[United Nations]] system divides the 206 listed states into three categories: 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]],&lt;ref name="unms"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Member States|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml|publisher=United Nations|author=Press Release ORG/1469|accessdate=28 February 2011|date=3 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230101646/http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml#|archive-date=30 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer states]], and 11 other states. The ''sovereignty dispute'' column indicates states whose sovereignty is undisputed (191 states) and states whose sovereignty is disputed (15 states, out of which there are 5 member states, 1 observer state and 9 other states).

Compiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process, as there is no definition that is binding on all the members of the community of nations concerning the criteria for [[sovereign state|statehood]]. For more information on the criteria used to determine the contents of this list, please see the ''[[#Criteria for inclusion|criteria for inclusion]]'' section below. The list is intended to include entities that have been recognized to have ''[[de facto]]'' status as sovereign states, and inclusion should not be seen as an endorsement of any specific claim to statehood in legal terms.

The territory of the ROC is claimed in whole by the PRC.{{efn|name="TAI2"|In 1949, the Republic of China government led by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] to the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and set up a provisional capital in [[Taipei]]. The CPC established the PRC. As such, the [[political status of Taiwan|political status of the ROC and legal status of Taiwan]] (alongside the [[Free area of the Republic of China|territories]] under ROC jurisdiction) are in dispute. In 1971, the United Nations gave the [[China and the United Nations|China seat]] to the PRC and the ROC withdrew from the UN. Most states recognise the PRC to be the [[One-China policy|sole legitimate representative]] of all China, and the UN classifies Taiwan as "[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan, Province of China]]". The ROC has de facto relations with most sovereign states. A significant political movement within Taiwan advocates [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]].}} The ROC [[Foreign relations of Taiwan#Relations with international organizations|participates in international organizations]] under a variety of pseudonyms, most commonly "[[Chinese Taipei]]" and in the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] it has full membership. The ROC was a founding member of the UN and enjoyed membership from 1945 to 1971, with veto power in the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]]. See [[China and the United Nations]].

== Criteria for inclusion ==
The dominant [[customary international law]] standard of statehood is the [[Declarative theory|declarative theory of statehood]], which was codified by the [[Montevideo Convention]] of 1933. The Convention defines the state as a [[Legal personality|person]] of international law if it ''"possess[es] the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) a capacity to enter into relations with the other states"'' so long as it was not ''"obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measure"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hersch Lauterpacht|title=Recognition in International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWgEv1Qq2TwC&amp;pg=PA419|year=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=419|isbn=9781107609433}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis inline|date=December 2017}}

Debate exists on the degree to which [[Diplomatic recognition|recognition]] should be included as a criterion of statehood. The declarative theory of statehood argues that statehood is purely objective and recognition of a state by other states is irrelevant. On the other end of the spectrum, the [[Constitutive theory|constitutive theory of statehood]] defines a state as a person under international law only if it is recognised as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] by other states. For the purposes of this list, included are all states that either:

* (a) consider themselves sovereign (through a [[declaration of independence]] or some other means) and are often regarded as satisfying the declarative theory of statehood, ''or''
* (b) are recognised as a sovereign state by at least one [[member states of the United Nations|UN member state]]

Note that in some cases, there is a divergence of opinion over the interpretation of the first point, and whether an entity satisfies it is disputed. Unique political entities which fail to meet the classification of a sovereign state are considered [[proto-state]]s.&lt;ref name=Hahn&gt;{{cite book|last=Hahn|first=Gordon|title=Russia's Revolution from Above, 1985–2000: Reform, Transition, and Revolution in the Fall of the Soviet Communist Regime|date=2002|page=527|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick|isbn=978-0765800497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Ryan|title=Age of Secession: The International and Domestic Determinants of State Birth|date=2016|pages=85, 213–242|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107161627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of the above criteria, this list includes the following 206 entities:&lt;ref&gt;The following bullets are grouped according to the availability of sources for the two criteria ((a) and/or (b)). This arrangement is not intended to reflect the relative importance of the two theories. Additional details are discussed in the state's individual entries.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name="micros"|The [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] is not included, as despite being a sovereign entity it lacks territory and does not claim statehood. Entities considered to be [[micronation]]s are not included. It is often up to debate whether a micronation truly controls its claimed territory. Also omitted from this list are all [[uncontacted people]]s, either who live in [[stateless society|societies that cannot be defined as states]] or whose statuses as such are not definitively known.}}

* 203 states recognised by at least one [[member states of the United Nations|UN member state]]
* Two states that satisfy the declarative theory of statehood and are recognised only by non-UN member states: [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]], [[Transnistria]]
* One state that satisfies the declarative theory of statehood and is not recognised by any other state: [[Somaliland]]

The table includes bullets representing entities which are either not sovereign states or have a close association to another sovereign state. It also includes subnational areas where the sovereignty of the titular state is limited by an international agreement. Taken together, these include:

* States in a [[associated state|free association]] relationship to another state
* Two entities controlled by Pakistan which are neither sovereign states, dependent territories, or part of another state: [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit Baltistan]]
* Dependent territories of another state, as well as areas that exhibit many characteristics of dependent territories according to the [[dependent territory]] page
* Subnational entities created by international agreements

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32493">This '''list of tallest buildings in Seoul''' ranks skyscrapers in the South Korean capital city of [[Seoul]] by height. The tallest in the city is currently the 555m (1,821ft) [[Lotte World Tower]] with 123 floors.

The tallest buildings are concentrated in four different locations: the traditional city center at [[Jongno]], the modern business and financial district in [[Gangnam-gu|Gangnam]] along [[Teheranno|Teheran Road]] between [[Gangnam Station]] and the [[COEX]] complex, the financial and political centre on the island of [[Yeouido]], and the affluent residential neighbourhood of Dogok-dong.

Seoul is located in a valley surrounded by mountains with one mountain in the center, [[Namsan (Seoul)|Namsan]].  On top of Namsan is [[Namsan Tower]] which is considered an iconic image of the city of Seoul and can be seen from almost anywhere in the city.  To maintain this line of sight, many developers have had to set height limits on their buildings.  The city also has strict laws about building heights for reasons of national security stressed by the [[Republic of Korea Air Force|Korean Air Force]] and [[U.S. Air Force]].

==Tallest buildings==
This lists ranks Seoul's skyscrapers that stand at least 150m tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height.

'''[[Lithuania]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of sovereign states|sovereign country]] located in the [[Baltic region]] of Northern Europe.&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=13 July 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lh.html|title=Lithuania|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#europe Geographical region and composition]&lt;/ref&gt; Situated along the south-eastern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]], sharing borders with [[Latvia]] to the north, [[Belarus]] to the southeast, [[Poland]], and the [[Russia]]n [[exclave]] of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] to the southwest. Lithuania is a member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and of the [[European Union]]. Its population is about 2.8 million. The largest city and capital is [[Vilnius]].

During the 14th century, Lithuania was the largest country in Europe, as present-day [[Belarus]], Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were territories of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. With the [[Lublin Union]] of 1569 Poland and Lithuania formed a new state: the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which [[Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|was finally destroyed]] by its neighboring countries in 1795. Most of Lithuania's territory was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]], until the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Act of Independence]] was signed on 16 February 1918, which declared re-establishment of a sovereign state. Between 1940 and 1945 Lithuania was occupied by both the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] at different times. When [[World War II]] was near its end in 1944 and the Nazis retreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first Baltic republic to [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|declare its restored independence]] after 50 years of Soviet occupation.
Lithuania became a full member of the [[Schengen Agreement]] on 21 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Lietuva įsiliejo į Šengeno erdvę | publisher=Vidaus reikalų ministerija | url =http://www.vrm.lt/index.php?id=131&amp;backPID=4&amp;tt_news=1458&amp; | accessdate =22 December 2007 | language = Lithuanian }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, Lithuania celebrated the millennium of its name.

Nunes, considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians of his time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pedronunes.fc.ul.pt/biography.html Pedro Nunes (1502-1578)]&lt;/ref&gt; is best known for his contributions in the nautical sciences (navigation and cartography), which he approached, for the first time, in a mathematical way. He was the first to propose the idea of a [[loxodrome]], and was the inventor of several measuring devices, including the [[Nonius (device)|nonius]] (from which [[Vernier scale]] was derived), named after his Latin surname.&lt;ref name=source1 /&gt;

== Life ==
Little is known about Nunes' early education, life or family background, only that he was born in [[Alcácer do Sal]], his origins are [[Jewish]] and that his grandchildren spent a few years behind bars after they were accused by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] of professing and secretly practicing Judaism.&lt;ref name=source3&gt;
[http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/ciencia_eng/e42.html Pedro Nunes – A mathematician in a country of navigators]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[University of Salamanca]], maybe from 1521 until 1522, and at the University of Lisbon (this University later become the [[University of Coimbra]]) where he obtained a degree in [[medicine]] in 1525. In the 16th century medicine used [[astrology]], so he also learned [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref name=source1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Nunes.html |title=Biography of Pedro Nunes Salaciense |last1=O'Connor |first1=J. J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E. F. |date=November 2010 |website= |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued his medical studies but held various [[teaching]] posts within the [[University of Lisbon]], including [[Moral]], [[Philosophy]], [[Logic]] and [[Metaphysics]]. When, in 1537, the Portuguese University located in [[Lisbon]] returned to [[Coimbra]], he moved to the re-founded University of Coimbra to teach mathematics, a post he held until 1562.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} This was a new post in the University of Coimbra and it was established to provide instruction in the technical requirements for navigation: clearly a topic of great importance in [[Portugal]] at this period, when the control of sea trade was the primary source of Portuguese wealth. Mathematics became an independent post in 1544.&lt;ref name=source1 /&gt;

In addition to teaching he was appointed Royal Cosmographer in 1529 and Chief Royal Cosmographer in 1547: a post which he held until his death.&lt;ref name=source1 /&gt;

In 1531, King [[John III of Portugal]] charged Nunes with the education of his younger brothers Luís and [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry]]. Years later Nunes was also charged with the education of the king's grandson, and future king, [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]].&lt;ref name=source1 /&gt;

While at the University of Coimbra, future astronomer [[Christopher Clavius]] attended Pedro Nunes' classes, and was influenced by his works.&lt;ref name=source1 /&gt; Clavius, proponent of the [[Gregorian Calendar]], the greatest figure of the Colégio Romano, the great center of Roman Catholic knowledge of that period, classified Nunes as “supreme mathematical genius".&lt;ref name=source3 /&gt;  Nunes died in [[Coimbra]].

== Work ==
Pedro Nunes lived in a transition period, during which science was changing from valuing theoretical knowledge (which defined the main role of a  scientist/mathematician as commenting on previous authors), to providing [[experiment]]al data, both as a source of information and as a method of confirming theories. Nunes was, above all, one of the last great commentators,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1 =Fernández|first1=V.V.|last2=Rodrigues Jr.,|first2=W.A.,|title=Gravitation as a Plastic Distortion of the Lorentz Vacuum|year = 2010|publisher = Springer-Verlag|language=|location=Berlin Heidelberg|page=5|isbn=978-3-642-13589-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is shown by his first published work “Tratado da Esfera”, enriched with comments and additions that denote a profound knowledge of the difficult cosmography of the period.&lt;ref name=source3 /&gt; He also acknowledged the value of experimentation.

In his ''Tratado da sphera'' he argued for a common and universal diffusion of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;«''o bem, quanto mais comum e universal, tanto é mais excelente''» quoted by Calafate, Pedro (see above)&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he not only published works in [[Latin]], at that time science's [[lingua franca]], aiming for an audience of European scholars, but also in [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] (''Livro de Algebra'').

===Navigation===
[[File:Pedro Nunes April 2009-1a.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the [[Padrão dos Descobrimentos|Monument to the Portuguese Discoveries]] showing the well-known navigators. Left to right:  [[Jehuda Cresques|Jácome de Maiorca]] (cosmographer and chart maker), [[Pedro Escobar]] (navigator), Pedro Nunes (shown holding an [[armillary sphere]]), [[Pêro de Alenquer]] (navigator), [[Gil Eanes]] (navigator) and finally [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] (navigator)]]
Much of Nunes' work related to [[navigation]]. He was the first to understand why a ship maintaining a steady [[course (navigation)|course]] would not travel along a [[great circle]], the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a [[spiral]] course, called a [[loxodrome]].&lt;ref name=source3 /&gt;  The later invention of [[logarithm]]s allowed [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] to establish [[algebraic equation]]s for the loxodrome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=aPcQY1CeW4IC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=Leibniz+pedro+nunes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xKqA4TKvv9&amp;sig=_pZpl7-CJ_A0nRnL8DaD2Vh19-I&amp;hl=iw&amp;ei=7oalTeDqBc7ssgaN99iRCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Leibniz%20pedro%20nunes&amp;f=false Science in the Spanish and Portuguese empires, 1500-1800]&lt;/ref&gt; These lines —also called [[rhumb line]]s— maintain a fixed angle with the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]s. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes [[Affine connection|connection]] —also called navigator connection.&lt;ref&gt;In [[mathematics]], Nunes connection is an example of [[Affine connection|connection]] which [[Élie Cartan|Cartan]] showed to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in 1922 when he visited [[Paris]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Treaty defending the sea chart'', Nunes argued that a [[nautical chart]] should have its [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused: a situation that lasted until [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] developed the [[Map projection|projection]] bearing his name. The [[Mercator Projection]] is the system which is still used.

===Geometry===
Nunes also solved the problem of finding the day with the shortest [[twilight]] duration, for any given position, and its duration.&lt;ref name=source3 /&gt; This problem ''per se'' is not greatly important, yet it shows the geometric genius of Nunes as it was a problem which was independently tackled by [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]] and [[Jakob Bernoulli]] more than a century later with less success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=z_BNPYRNmyYC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=Bernoulli+pedro+nunes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WQTtwXL0xn&amp;sig=hz3wpstlxHVm9A6-TCiIktllYT8&amp;hl=iw&amp;ei=ToilTdWkNI_CtAbF-42bCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Bernoulli%20pedro%20nunes&amp;f=false Prelúdio para uma história: ciência e tecnologia no Brasil]&lt;/ref&gt; They could find a solution to the problem of the [[shortest day]], but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they got lost in the details of [[differential calculus]] which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.&lt;ref name=source4&gt;[http://pedronunes.fc.ul.pt/science.html Pedro Nunes (1502 - 1578)(Science)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
He was probably the last major mathematician to make relevant improvements{{According to whom|date=March 2010}} to the [[ptolemaic system]] (a [[geocentric model]] describing the relative motion of the Earth and Sun). However, this lost importance because [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] introduced his [[heliocentrism|heliocentric system]] theory around the same time. Nunes knew Copernicus' work but referred only briefly to it in his published works, with the purpose of correcting some mathematical errors.

Most of Nunes' achievements were possible because of his profound understanding of [[spherical trigonometry]] and his ability to transpose [[Ptolemy]]'s adaptations of [[Euclidean geometry]] to it.

===Inventions===
[[File:Nonio originale.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Nunes [[Nonius (device)|nonius]] original model]]
Nunes worked on several practical nautical problems concerning [[Course (navigation)|course correction]] as well as attempting to develop more accurate devices to determine a ship's position.&lt;ref name=source4 /&gt;

He created the [[Nonius (device)|nonius]] to improve the [[astrolabe]]'s accuracy.  This consisted of a number of [[concentric]] circles traced on the astrolabe and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle.  Thus the outermost [[Circular sector|quadrant]] would comprise 90° in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on.  When an angle was measured, the circle and the division on which the [[alidade]] fell was noted.  A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The nonius was used by [[Tycho Brahe]], who considered it too complex. The method inspired improved systems by [[Christopher Clavius]] and [[Jacob Kurz von Senftenau|Jacob Curtius]].&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;Daumas Maurice,  ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were eventually improved further by [[Pierre Vernier]] in 1631, which reduced the nonius to the [[Vernier scale]] that includes two scales, one of them fixed and the other movable. Vernier himself used to say that his invention was a perfected nonius and for a long time it was known as the “nonius”, even in France.&lt;ref name=source3 /&gt; In some languages, the Vernier scale is still named after Nunes, for example ''{{lang|sv|nonieskala}}'' in Swedish.

Pedro Nunes also worked on some [[mechanics]] problems, from a mathematical point of view.

==Influence==
Nunes was very influential internationally e.g. on the work of [[John Dee]] and [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Wright and Pedro Nunes|url=http://pedronunes.fc.ul.pt/episodes/edward_wright/edward_wright.htm|work=Pedro Nunes (1502 - 1578)|publisher=Centre for the History of Sciences, [[Lisbon University]]|accessdate=17 October 2011|author1=Almeida, Bruno  |author2=Leitão, Henrique |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
*One of the best known [[Lisbon]] public Secondary/High Schools is named after Pedro Nunes, ''Escola Secundária de Pedro Nunes'' (teaching 7th to 12th grade). It was founded, in 1906, as ''Lyceu Central da 3ª Zona Escolar de Lisboa'' (''Central Liceum of the 3rd School Area of Lisbon''). Over the years had known several designations: Lyceu Central de Pedro Nunes (1911–1930), Liceu Normal de Lisboa (1930–1937), Liceu Pedro Nunes (1937–1956), Liceu Normal de Pedro Nunes (1956–1978) and Escola Secundária de Pedro Nunes (1978–{{as of|2011|alt=present}}&lt;!-- ??? bad usage --&gt;), but is still popularly known as Liceu Pedro Nunes. Many well known Portuguese personalities have studied in Pedro Nunes. The current headquarters commemorated its centenary in 2011, after being totally refurbished and modernized between 2008 and 2010.
*He was featured on 100 [[escudo]]s coins.
*The [[Instituto Pedro Nunes]] in [[Coimbra]], a business incubator and a center of innovation and technology transfer founded by the University of Coimbra, is named after Pedro Nunes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
*Asteroid [[5313 Nunes]] is named after him{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
*[[TAP Portugal]] Airlines has named an [[Airbus]] A330-202 airplane after him, registered CS-TOP.

'''Peter Haggett''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]] [[British Academy|FBA]] (b. 24 January 1933)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite linked authority file|id=n79-150313|accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an eminent British [[geographer]] and academic, Professor [[Emeritus]] and Senior [[Research Fellow]] in Urban and Regional Geography at the School of Geographical Sciences, [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2008 |title=Biographical note |url=http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/personal/PeterHaggett/haggett_biog.html |work=Emeritus Professor Peter Haggett |publisher=School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haggett was born 1933 in the rural [[Somerset]] village of [[Pawlett, Somerset|Pawlett]], and he was educated at Dr Morgan's Grammar School in [[Bridgwater]].&lt;ref&gt;UWE-Bristol (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He would later credit the time spent in his childhood walking and cycling around the district for the development of his keen interest in geography.&lt;ref&gt;Flowerdew (2004, p.155)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 he entered undergraduate studies at [[St. Catharine's College, Cambridge]], where he read [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Geography]]. [[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Peter Hall]] (later Sir Peter), the noted urban geographer, was one of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Flowerdew (2004, p.155)&lt;/ref&gt; Haggett graduated in 1954, obtaining a "Double First" ([[First-class honours|First-Class Honours]] in parts I and II of the [[Tripos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae |year=2005 |url=http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/personal/PeterHaggett/haggett_cv.html |work=Emeritus Professor Peter Haggett |publisher=School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol|accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an academic career spanning half a century, Professor Haggett is noted for his significant research contributions to the field of [[human geography]], and is the author or editor of over 30 books on geographical practice, theory and individual research topics. He has held numerous teaching posts and [[visiting professor]]ships at institutions around the world, but is most particularly associated with the University of Bristol where he has been a lecturer and professor of geography since 1966. Among the many awards and distinguished recognitions conferred, Haggett was awarded the French [[Lauréat Prix International de Géographie Vautrin Lud]] in 1991, and made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] of 1993, for "services to urban and regional geography".

Peter is also known to have been offered many prestigious academic positions, but has preferred to specialize in the geographical study of [[epidemiology]] and the spatial relationships and distribution of [[infectious diseases]] for the latter half of his career.

A '''ravine''' is a [[landform]] narrower than a [[canyon]] and is often the product of [[stream]]cutting [[erosion]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary Meaning"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ravine Definition of "ravine"] at [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ravines are typically classified as larger in scale than [[gully|gullies]], although smaller than [[valley]]s.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Meaning"/&gt;

==Definition==
A ravine is generally a [[fluvial]] volcano (cross-sectional) sides, on the order of twenty to seventy percent in [[Grade (slope)|gradient]].  Ravines may or may not have active streams flowing along the downslope channel which originally formed them; moreover, often they are characterized by intermittent streams, since their geographic scale may not be sufficiently large to support a [[perennial stream|perennial]] [[watercourse]].&lt;ref name="MorrisPress1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher G.

[[Image:Location SSS-islands.png|thumb|250px|The location of the SSS islands in the [[Caribbean]], from top to bottom [[Saint Martin]], [[Saba]], and [[Sint Eustatius]]]]

[[Image:SSSEilanden.png|frame|SSS-islands]]
The '''SSS islands''' is an [[acronym]] which refers to three island territories in the [[Lesser Antilles]] that are under Dutch sovereignty:
#[[Saba]]
#[[Sint Eustatius]]
#[[Sint Maarten]]

[[Sint Maarten]] is a [[Countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and is the southern half of the island of [[Saint Martin]] (the northern half is the French [[Collectivity of Saint Martin]]). The islands of Saba and Sint Eustatius are [[Caribbean Netherlands|public bodies]] of the [[Netherlands]].

The acronym is analogous to the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]], consisting of [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], and the [[BES islands]], consisting of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, both of which are also part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. All six island territories were formerly part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]].

==History==
Saint Martin was split between the Netherlands and France in 1648. The Dutch part became a single Dutch colony in 1818 as '''Sint Eustatius and Dependencies''' when France returned its possessions after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. This colony was merged in 1828 with the colonies [[Curaçao and Dependencies]] (the ABC islands) and Suriname with a capital in Paramaribo. When this merge was partly reversed in 1845, the Dutch part of the SSS islands became part of Curaçao and Dependencies with [[Willemstad]] as capital. This colony became the [[Netherlands Antilles]] in 1952. The Dutch part of the SSS islands initially formed the single "island area" ({{lang-nl|eilandgebied}}, the main administrative division of the Netherlands Antilles, governed by an [[Island council (Netherlands Antilles)|Island council]]) the Leeward islands ({{lang-nl|de Bovenwindse eilanden}}) until 1983.

The '''Silverband Falls''' are [[waterfalls]] located in the [[Grampians National Park]], in western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Fed by Dairy Creek, the horsetail falls are characterised by a narrow band of water that tumbles over a small rock face and then disappears into a rocky base.  The creek re-emerges some {{convert|50|m}} west of the falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/australia-silverband-falls.html|title=Silverband Falls|work=World of Waterfalls|author=Cheng, Johnny T.|date=|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early European visitors to the falls named it Silverband because of its narrow stream of water.

'''St George's Channel''' ({{lang-cy|Sianel San Siôr}}, {{lang-ga|Muir Bhreatan}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/1166502.aspx|title=Muir Bhreatan|work=[[logainm.ie]]|publisher=Placenames Branch (Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs)|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[channel (geography)|sea channel]] connecting the [[Irish Sea]] to the north and the [[Celtic Sea]] to the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

Historically, the name "St George's Channel" was used interchangeably with "Irish Sea" or "Irish Channel" to encompass all the waters between Ireland to the west and Great Britain to the east.&lt;ref name="Andrews1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=John Harwood|title=Shapes of Ireland: maps and their makers 1564–1839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfcRAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 September 2010|date=January 1997|publisher=Geography Publications|isbn=978-0-906602-95-9|pages=87–88, 155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtis1839"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Thomas Curtis |title=The London encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdLyNZ-OUMwC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=18 September 2010|volume=10|year=1839|page=133|chapter=George's Channel (St.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some geographers restricted it to the portion separating [[Wales]] from [[Leinster]],&lt;ref name="Andrews1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtis1839"/&gt; sometimes extending south to the waters between the [[West Country|West Country of England]] and East [[Munster]];&lt;ref name="Curtis1839"/&gt; the latter have since the 1970s come to be called the [[Celtic Sea]]. In Ireland "St George's Channel" is now usually taken to refer only to the narrowest part of the channel, between [[Carnsore Point]] in [[County Wexford|Wexford]] and [[St David's Head]] in [[Pembrokeshire]]. However, it remains common in Ireland to talk about a cross-channel trip, cross-channel soccer, etc., where "cross-channel" means "to/from Great Britain".&lt;ref name="Heslinga1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heslinga|first=Marcus Willem|title=The Irish border as a cultural divide: a contribution to the study of regionalism in the British Isles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzygAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 September 2010|year=1979|publisher=Van Gorcum|isbn=978-90-232-0864-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current (third, 1953) edition of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]]'s publication ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' defines the southern limit of "Irish Sea and St. George's Channel" as "A line joining [[St David's Head|St. David's Head]] ({{Coord|51|54|N|5|19|W|display=inline}}) to [[Carnsore Point]] ({{Coord|52|10|N|6|22|W|display=inline}})"; it does not define the two waterbodies separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf#page=41 |format=PDF |chapter=Corrections to pages 12 and 13 |title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 draft fourth edition omits the "and St. George's Channel" part of the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choo|first=Sungjae|year=2007|title=The Cases of International Standardization of Sea Names and Their Implications for Justifying the Name East Sea|journal=Journal of the Korean Geographical Society|volume=42|issue=5|pages=751; Table 3, footnote|url=http://kgeography.or.kr/publishing/journal/42/05/05.PDF#page=7|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/com_wg/S-23WG/S-23WG_Misc/Draft_2002/Draft_2002.htm |website=IHO |title=2002 Draft of Limits of Oceans and Seas |accessdate=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/REF&gt;

A 2004 letter from the St.George's Channel Shipping Company to ''Seascapes'', an [[RTÉ Radio]] programme, said that St George's Channel bordered the Irish coast between [[Howth Head]] and [[Kilmore Quay]], and criticised contributors to the programme who had used "Irish Sea" for these waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/seascapes/1023657.html |title=Seascapes News Summary |date=30 September 2004 |work=[[RTÉ.ie]] |accessdate=18 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525171202/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/seascapes/1023657.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "St George's Channel" is recorded in 1578&lt;ref name="Taylor1896"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Isaac|title=Names and their histories, alphabetically arranged as a handbook of historical geography and topographical nomenclature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNkNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate=18 September 2010|year=1896|publisher=Rivington, Percival|page=243|chapter=St. George's Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Martin Frobisher]]'s record of his second voyage.

==Establishment==

The unit consisted of around 250 fighters.&lt;ref name=dispatch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aymennjawad.org/2018/01/dispatch-the-syrian-democratic-forces-border|title=Dispatch: The Syrian Democratic Forces' Border Guards|author=[[Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi]]|date=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On 23 December 2017, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[Joseph Votel]], commander of [[United States Central Command|CENTCOM]], announced that U.S. forces in Syria were planning an expansion of their current training program for pro-Coalition militias to specialize in border security.&lt;ref name="Votel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/us-forces-train-kurdish-arab-fighters-border-security-prevent-resurgence-isis/|title=US forces to train Kurdish, Arab fighters in border security to prevent 'resurgence of ISIS'|author=Andrew Illingworth|work=Al-Masdar News|date=23 December 2017|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official reasoning for extending support of pro-Coalition Kurdish and Arab militias was preventing the resurgence of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] in newly cleared areas under the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF) control.&lt;ref name="Votel"/&gt;

On 31 December 2017, Kurdish [[Hawar News Agency]] reported that a "North Syrian Army" was in the process of being formed. The role of the new formation was said to be carrying out border security duties in areas under the control of the SDF.&lt;ref name="HXP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/new-north-syrian-army-led-coalition-forces/|title=New 'North Syrian Army' to be led by Coalition forces|author=Andrew Illingworth|work=Al-Masdar News|date=31 December 2017|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new army was planned to be headed by the [[Self-Defense Forces (Rojava cantons)|Self-Defense Forces]] (HXP), and composed of Arab, Kurdish, Syriac, Assyrian, Turkmen and Chechen fighters. HXP leader, Siyabend Welat, stated that "the North Syrian Army will prove the will of people to defend themselves should they ever come under attack."&lt;ref name="HXP"/&gt;

Officially announced on 13 January 2018, [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve]] (CJTF-OIR) Public Affairs Officer Col. Thomas Veale told the Defense Post website that the force will consist of roughly 30,000 personnel, half of which are Syrian Democratic Forces veterans.&lt;ref name="SDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Defense Post"/&gt; The other 15,000 are currently being recruited, with about 230 people undergoing training in the Border Security Force (BSF)'s inaugural class.&lt;ref name="training"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-sdf/u-s-led-coalition-helps-to-build-new-syrian-force-angering-turkey-idUSKBN1F30OA|title=U.S.-led coalition helps to build new Syrian force, angering Turkey|author=Tom Perry, Orhan Coskun|work=Reuters|date=14 January 2018|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Affairs Office further stated that Kurdish [[People's Protection Units|YPG]] units would serve in northern Syria, which would be a dividing line between the border of [[Turkey]] and Turkish-backed [[Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army|Free Syrian Army]] forces. Syrian Arabs will be deployed along the [[Euphrates]] River Valley and close to the border of Iraq to separate themselves from the Russian and Iranian-backed [[Syrian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="training"/&gt;&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/us-led-coalition-goes-ahead-training-new-border-force-syria-reports/|title=US-led Coalition goes ahead with training new border force in Syria – reports|author=Andrew Illingworth|work=Al-Masdar News|date=14 January 2018|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spokesman added that the training of BSF troops would include instructions on interrogation, screening and biometric scanning as well as countering [[improvised explosive device]]s.&lt;ref name="Defense Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="announcement"/&gt;

On 20 January 2018, around 250 fighters graduated as part of the second contingent of the BSF south of [[Hasaka]]. Fighters of the unit waved both SDF and HXP flags, and the graduation ceremony was attended by SDF officers and US military personnel.&lt;ref name=dispatch/&gt;

==Reactions==

The announced creation of the Border Security Force has been met with strong international criticism by [[Syria]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="training"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/russia-may-undertake-measures-us-decision-border-force-syria/|title=Russia may 'undertake measures' after US decision on border force in Syria|author=|work=Al-Masdar News|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flag|Syria}} – The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates (Syria)|Syrian Foreign Ministry]] officially condemned the U.S. decision to create the new Border Security Force with 30,000 personnel in areas controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces as being illegal. The statement further called the creation of this force as "blatant breach of Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity and a flagrant violation of international law."&lt;ref name="Syria"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syria-brands-us-border-militia-illegal-joining-high-treason/|title=Syria brands US "border militia" as illegal, and joining it as high treason|author=Brecht Jonkers|work=Al-Masdar News|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria's Foreign Ministry urged the UN to denounce the U.S.-led coalition's decision, and counter the "domination mentality and arrogance which dominate the U.S. administration's policies", saying that this action would lead to consequences for international security. The ministry's office warned that any Syrian citizen that fights on behalf of the U.S.-created border force will be guilty of high treason against the state and people of Syria, and that the person would stand trial as a traitor.&lt;ref name="Syria"/&gt;

{{flag|Russia}} – On 15 January, [[Vladimir Shamanov]], Chairman of the Defense Committee of the [[State Duma]] announced Russia would have to take measures in response to the formation of the Border Security Force. Shamanov stated that "[such behavior by the U.S.-led coalition] stands in direct confrontation [with Russia's interests], and we and our colleagues will certainly undertake certain measures on stabilization of the situation in Syria."&lt;ref name="Russia"/&gt;

{{flag|Turkey}} – The plans of the coalition to create this border force has fueled Turkey's resentment over the coalition arming and supporting Kurdish militias in Syria.&lt;ref name="announcement"/&gt; Turkey views the Syrian Kurdish [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|PYD]] movement and their armed-wing, the [[People's Protection Units|YPG]], as a national security threat.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria/erdogan-we-will-strangle-u-s-backed-force-in-syria-before-its-even-born-idUSKBN1F41HJ|title=Erdogan: we will 'strangle' U.S.-backed force in Syria 'before it's even born'|author=Ellen Francis, Ezgi Erkoyun|work=Reuters|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The YPG are dominant forces in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, and are allies of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]], a Kurdish organization designated as a terrorist group that wages an [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|insurgency in southern Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;

The Border Security Force announcement immediately triggered a reaction from [[Ankara]], with President Erdoğan's representative [[İbrahim Kalın]], stating the move was unacceptable and worrying. He further mentioned that instead of ceasing the weapon supplies to SDF forces, "the USA is taking worrying steps to legitimize this organisation and make it lasting in the region."&lt;ref name="announcement"/&gt; On 13 January, President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] said that the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] might launch a [[Turkish military intervention in Syria (January 2018–present)|military operation]] in YPG-controlled areas of northern Syria, including the cities of [[Manbij]] and [[Afrin, Syria|Afrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/turkey-condemns-us-plans-create-border-security-force-syria/|title=Turkey condemns US plans to create 'border security force' in Syria|author=|work=Al-Masdar News|date=14 January 2018|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier on 14 January, a Turkish senior official told Reuters that the U.S. training of the BSF was the real reason as to why the U.S. [[chargé d'affaires]] was summoned in Ankara on 10 January, as relations between the U.S. and Turkey are becoming strained due to U.S. military support for the YPG.&lt;ref name="announcement"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/01/10/world/middleeast/10reuters-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-usa.html|title=Turkey Summons U.S. Charge D'affaires Over Syria: Turkish Sources|author=|work=The New York Times|date=10 January 2018|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 15 January, President Erdoğan strongly condemned the formation of the Border Security Force. In his speech in Ankara, he criticized the U.S., stating that "a country we call an ally is insisting on forming a terror army on our borders," and said that Turkey will try to prevent the BSF from being formed.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;

{{flag|Iran}} – Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi has stated that such a unit would raise tensions in Syria and is an obvious interference in the internal affairs of a country, while at the same time urging all 2,000 U.S. troops to leave Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-iran/iran-says-planned-u-s-backed-force-inside-syria-would-fan-war-idUSKBN1F50YM|title=Iran says planned U.S.-backed force inside Syria would fan war|work=Reuters|date=16 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flag|USA}} – Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] eventually denied the US was involved in the creation of any border security force stating "that entire situation has been mis-portrayed, mis-described, some people misspoke. We are not creating a border security force at all."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/tillerson-signals-deeper-us-military-commitment-in-syria/2018/01/17/bda7232c-fbe8-11e7-9b5d-bbf0da31214d_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tagus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|eɪ|ɡ|ə|s}}; {{lang-es|Tajo}}, {{IPA-es|ˈtaxo|}}; {{lang-pt|Tejo}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈtɛʒu|}}&lt;!--; {{lang-la|Tagus}}; {{lang-grc|Τάγος|Tagos}}--&gt;) is the longest river in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It is {{convert|1007|km|mi|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} long, {{convert|716|km|mi|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} in Spain, {{convert|47|km|mi|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} along the border between Portugal and Spain and {{convert|275|km|mi|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} in [[Portugal]], where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Lisbon]]. It drains an area of {{convert|80100|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us}} (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the [[Douro]]). The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to places of central Spain and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after [[Castle of Almourol|Almourol]] it enters a wide alluvial valley, prone to flooding. Its mouth is a large estuary near the port city of Lisbon.

The source of the Tagus is the Fuente de García, in the [[Frías de Albarracín]] municipal term, [[Montes Universales]], [[Sistema Ibérico]], [[Sierra de Albarracín Comarca]]. All its major tributaries enter the Tagus from the right (north) bank. The main cities it passes through are [[Aranjuez]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Talavera de la Reina]] and [[Alcántara]] in Spain, and [[Abrantes]], [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], [[Almada]] and [[Lisbon]] in Portugal.

==Course==
[[File:SpainTajoBasin.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Map of the Tagus river Basin]]

===In Spain===
[[File:Tagus.gif|thumb|Confluence of the [[Guadarrama (river)|Guadarrama]] and Tagus rivers]]
The first notable city on the Tagus is [[Sacedón]]. Below [[Aranjuez]] it receives the combined flow of the [[Jarama]],  [[Henares]], [[Algodor River|Algodor]] and [[Tajuña]].  Below [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] it receives the [[Guadarrama (river)|Guadarrama River]].  Above [[Talavera de la Reina]] it receives the [[Alberche]].  At [[Valdeverdeja]] is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the ''[[Embalse de Valdecañas]]'', beyond which are the ''[[Torrejon Dam|Embalse de Torrejon]]'', into which flow the [[Tiétar (river)|Tiétar]], and the lower reservoir, the [[Alcántara Dam]] into which flows the [[Alagón (river)|Alagón]] at the lower end.

There is a canal and [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] between the Tagus and the [[Segura]], the [[Tagus-Segura Water Transfer]].

===In Portugal===
After forming the border it enters Portugal, passing [[Vila Velha de Ródão]], [[Abrantes]], [[Constância]], [[Entroncamento]], [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] and [[Vila Franca de Xira]] at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has [[Lisbon]] at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the [[Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve]]. There is a large bridge across the river, the [[Vasco da Gama Bridge]], which with a total length of {{Convert|17.2|km|abbr=on}} is the second longest bridge in Europe. The [[Port of Lisbon]], located at its mouth, is one of Europe's busiest.

The Portuguese [[Alentejo Province|Alentejo]] region and former [[Ribatejo Province]] take their names from the river; Alentejo, from ''além Tejo'' "Beyond the Tagus" and Ribatejo from ''arriba Tejo'', an archaic way of saying "Upper Tagus".

In Spanish Riba means land beside a river or shore along of a river. Then Ribatejo should mean "The land beside the Tejo" or "The shore of the Tejo" you can see too many samples of towns in Spain with this prefix.

==Geology==
The lower Tagus is on a [[fault line]]. Slippage along it has caused numerous [[earthquake]]s, the major ones being those of 1309, [[1531 Lisbon earthquake|1531]] and [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William Herbert|last=Hobbs|authorlink=William Herbert Hobbs|title=Earthquakes: An Introduction to Seismic Geology|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=NewYork|year=1907|pages=142–144}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TmAJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=Tagus&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=nogySYy7MIjcygTRy4X8Bw#PPR3,M1 Downloadable Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Tejo do Castelo Almourol.JPG|thumb|left|Tagus river seen from the [[Castle of Almourol]] (Portugal)]] The Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the [[Nossa Senhora dos Mártires (nau)|''Nossa Senhora dos Mártires'']], is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001.

The river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to [[Lisbon]]. For example, in 1587, [[Francis Drake]] briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Garrett Mattingly |title=The Armada |pages=118–119 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0ld6FcKu38C&amp;q=%22Tagus%22&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage|isbn=978-0618565917 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
A major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular [[fado]] song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (''"My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young"''). The author, [[Fernando Pessoa]], wrote a poem that begins: 
:''"The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village..."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pessoa |first=Fernando |authorlink=Fernando Pessoa |author2=Richard Zenith, Translator |title=Fernando Pessoa and Co.: Selected Poems |year=1999 |publisher= Grove Press|isbn= 9780802136275 |pages= 55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Crashaw|Richard Crashaw's]] poem "Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper" refers to the "Golden" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands ([[Catullus]] 29.19, [[Ovid]], ''Amores'', 1.15.34, [[Juvenal]], ''Satires'', 3.55, etc.).

The '''United Regions Organization / Forum of Regional Governments and Global Associations of Regions (ORU Fogar)''' is an [[international organization]], which aims to bring together regions from all over the world and represents them before other international organizations in order to boost a global policy of balanced [[Economic development|development]] and territorial cohesion.

The Organization's main objective is to seek the regions' recognition as major players in [[global governance]]. ORU Fogar defends that states' [[decentralization]] power towards other actors accelerates development; consequently fostering [[democracy]] by the proximity between these new actors and the citizens. ORU Fogar promotes a model based on a strong [[regional government]], with legally recognized capabilities and competences and also budgets in compliance with those competences. Amongst its members, ORU Fogar has important European and Latin American regions, as well as regional governments from Africa and Asia.

The organization acts according to two approaches:
* An integrated approach generated in the territories to design and implement in the field solutions to the new challenges that these territories are facing.
* The promotion of new governance rules at a global level, including the regional scale, allowing the development of this territorial approach.

== Objectives ==
ORU Fogar's founding objectives can be wrapped up into three main topics: To '''raise the voice of regions before all of the international bodies''', through the association of regions from all over the world in order to work together for development; to '''defend a new global governance''' where regions have a relevant role in encouraging the participation of regional governments in the creation of new policies and '''work for regions''' in order for national governments to take into account the regional dimensión and cultural diversity, through the promotion of competitiveness and regional growth, but always trying to follow a sustainable development and respect for climate approach.

== History ==
[[File:Buró ORU Montevideo.jpg|thumb|315x315px|ORU Fogar's Executive Bureau at Montevideo (2015)]]
Facing the new global situation, [[region]]s gathered to achieve a coordinated response to the current challenges in a worldwide association. That meeting was named "Forum of Regional Governments and Global Associations of Regions (FOGAR)", held in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], in August 2007. It was conducted on the basis of the "Declaration of the Regions on their participation in the governance of [[globalization]]" signed in [[Marseille]], PACA, [[France]], on the occasion of the first international convention for a regional approach to development. Seventeen networks of regions from all continents were the founders of the Organization, with a representation of more than 900 subnational governments. Since July 2010, membership in ORU Fogar is also opened to regions and [[federated state]]s individually.

[[File:Paúl Carrasco LED Forum.jpg|thumb|246x246px|ORU Fogar's former President, Paúl Carrasco, at the LED Forum in Turin (October 2015)]]
The General Assembly is the body of the Organization with the highest level of decision-making power. It is in charge of defining the approaches of the Organization as well as deciding over the actions that will have to be carried on. All the members of the Organization shall meet up in ordinary session once a year.

=== Executive Bureau ===
The Executive Bureau is devoted to direct and manage the actions of the Organization, always being backed by the General Secretariat. The Executive Bureau meets up twice a year.

Some of the basic functions of the Bureau are: To propose the Organization's political vias and to carry them out, coordinate the work among the different members and commissions that can be created from such members, to supervise the General Secretariat's work and the financial management, and to establish the internal regulations which would be passed at the General Assembly.

{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
